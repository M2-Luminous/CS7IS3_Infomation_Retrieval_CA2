President Clinton surprised the diplomats by mentioning Kashmir along with Somalia and Bosnia in his first address in the United Nations General Assembly. The astonishment caused by this announcement had not yet abated when Ms. Robin Raphel, assistant secretary of state, announced that the United States did not recognize the documents that Kashmir's Maharajah Hari Singh had signed merging Kashmir to India. This was followed by Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's congratulatory letter to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in which he had for the first time offered to discuss all the aspects related to Kashmir. At that time, the first impression was that the Indian Government was trying to move the situation created by the siege of Hazratbal to its advantage by offering to open negotiations. This could have been one reason for this action. However, if we review the developments during September and October 1993 and look at the statements issued by the U.S. State Department showing that the United States has been pressuring both India and Pakistan to resolve this issue by talks, the whole situation becomes a bit clearer. One reaction would be: God what is going on? Until a few years ago, the United States was not willing to hear anything about Kashmir. Whenever, the issue was brought up, it was tabled by referring to the Shimla Agreement. Now it is so interested that it is considering Kashmir as one of the three major problem areas in the world and has put so much pressure to resolve this issue that foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan had to hold talks. Despite Madam Bhutto's direct statement that it is useless to waste time on meaningless talks, it is certain now that there will be additional rounds of talks between India and Pakistan even when they are meaningless. What is the reason for this effort to win our friendship? Has the freedom struggle of occupied Kashmir pulled at the U.S. conscience? Their sacrifices definitely are enough to awaken any sleeping conscience. The occupied Kashmir has been facing devastation since January 1990 when the Kashmiris took up weapons. According to international news agencies, at least 16,000 persons have lost their lives. Front doors of hundreds of homes are knocked on at night and the young men there are arrested. Their bodies are given to a nearly police station the very next day. Many a virtuous young woman fall prey to gang rape by the Indian soldiers. Many unblossomed young women were trodden under the boots of Indian soldiers. These sacrifices could wake up even the most ruthless of hearts. However, did the conscience of the sole world superpower wake up because of these sacrifices? We wish it was true. Unfortunately, the conscience of a superpowers is controlled by its vested interests. What U.S. interests are related to Kashmir? [passage ommitted on U.S. relations with China] This difference in stand on international affairs is the main reason for enmity between China and the United States. Thus, if the United States manages to take the Kashmir valley and areas north of it under the U.S. control, then it will have succeeded in surrounding the newly liberated nations in Central Asia on the one side and China on the other side. In the ring around China, the Philippines in the east and South Korea are also U.S. allies. Some of our analysts do not agree that the United States needs to put a ring around China and Central Asia. They believe that space intelligence or intelligence through satellites has made so much progress that the United States does not need Peshawar to monitor any country. It was 30 or 40 years ago when the United States needed Badber near Peshawar to set up a base to monitor the Soviet Union. The Pakistani government had very kindly given control of Badber to the United States from where the U-2 planes were used to take off to photograph Soviet air bases. Even Pakistan's president did not have the permission to enter that base. It was this base from where Gary Power's U-2 had flown when it was shot down in Central Asia. Khrushchev, then president of the Soviet Union, had drawn a red circle around Peshawar at that time. The situation has changed now. The camera mounted on satellites flying hundreds of miles in the space can take picture of not only air bases but also of bedrooms. Even the privacy of a closed room is not safe from these now. Why should they need a monitoring station on earth in this situation? This sounds logical, however, just like a rifle is the basic weapon of a soldier in this age of guided missiles and rockets, the importance of a land monitoring station has not diminished. Especially, for putting psychological pressure on the enemy. What plan could the United States have to take control of Kashmir? Before considering this, we have to review two other incidents. [passage ommitted on Pressler Amendment] Thus, the mention of Kashmir by the U.S. President in his address to the UN General Assembly, Assistant Secretary Raphel's challenging Kashmir's ever having joined India, the possibility of ending the Pressler Amendment, and not including Pakistan in the list of terrorist nations are all events which need to be viewed as in a series rather than in isolation. The purpose of these appears to be putting pressure on India and Pakistan to "flatten them." There are two problems. One is to open up Indian and Pakistani nuclear installations for international inspection and the other is creating such a solution of the Kashmir problem that U.S. interests are served. If Kashmir remains in India, no India government, despite its enmity with China, will allow the building of U.S. bases. If Kashmir joins Pakistan, perhaps because of its traditional loyalty, Pakistan may agree to the United States demands. Even during the peak period of Pakistan-China friendship, the PIA [Pakistan International Airlines] planes were used for spying on China. It would be impossible to convince India to give the Kashmir valley to Pakistan. This approach would be very dangerous because of the fundamentalist groups in occupied Kashmir. If Azad Kashmir with some modifications is given to Pakistan, Jammu and Laddakh are given to India, and areas lying north of Kashmir become independent, the picture would be complete and this is what the U.S. option appears to be. The problem is that both India and Pakistan find it difficult to accept this. India calls Kashmir its integral part. Pakistan has paved its way for connection with China through the northern region. Therefore, it would not be easy to convince either of them. However, if necessary, they should be forced to accept it. Even a very brief war between the two countries could exhaust their resources. Even after another Tashkent or Shimla pact, the United States will be very careful about it. President Clinton has received several jolts in his foreign policy implementation during the first year of his presidency. He had to recall the peace forces from Somalia. He has failed in imposing restrictions on weapons for the Muslims in Bosnia even after making several announcements to this effect. He has been unsuccessful in making friends in South America. Therefore, it is likely that he will think seriously before he takes another step. It took 13 years after the Camp David Agreement to hold conciliatory talks between Israel and the Palestinians. It appears that he will not take any hasty action. However, Kashmir is on the U.S. agenda, and it is the first time that it has been included in it. *
