Presidential spokesman Fernando Costa said: "The government will not permit any incitement to civil disobedience like that suggested by Levy Nogueira, president of Abram (Brazilian Supermarkets Association)." Yesterday, Nogueira reaffirmed his earlier remarks that the prices of 10 percent of the products sold in supermarkets will have to be marked up due to the effects of the end of the harvest season. He denied, however, having called for civil disobedience. Costa said: "The president has emphasized that supermarkets will not mark up their prices, as the government will use existing legal mechanisms to discourage this type of crime against the public economy." President Franco has called for a meeting with Justice Minister Alexandre Dupeyrat and legal adviser Geraldo Magela Quintao to discuss the subject tomorrow. Last night, Dupeyrat ordered that Nogueira's companies -- the Epa supermarkets in Belo Horizonte -- be monitored. Commenting on Nogueira's remarks, a friend of Franco's, who was at Planalto Palace yesterday, said: "The president was stunned by such a display of brazenness." Franco called Costa into his office yesterday morning during a meeting he was holding with Dupeyrat. Franco said: "The government will adopt measures that will in no way allow supermarket prices to be marked up, such as was proposed by Mr. Levy Nogueira." Late in the morning, before leaving Planalto Palace to have lunch at Alvorada Palace, Franco asked Costa if he had released the presidential message to the press. Nogueira learned about the president's reaction from reporters in Rio de Janeiro shortly before attending a meeting between supermarket representatives and Finance Ministry special adviser Jose Milton Dallari. Showing first surprise and then tension, Nogueira charged the press with giving a sensationalist tone to his remarks and denied having called for civil disobedience. He said: "The reports distorted my remarks, as there are always price adjustments in any stable economy." He added: "I have not talked about price markups because 90 percent of the supermarket prices have already been adjusted." Mogueira confirmed, however, that nearly 700 products of medium-sized supermarkets and 1,500 products of large supermarkets will be adjusted under the real. "Beef and coffee prices are rising in URV's [real value units]," he said. He stated, however, that there will be a declining trend for the prices of manufactured products in July because the current industrial prices are padded. Other supermarket representatives who attended the meeting with Dallari also conveyed surprise at Franco's remarks. Aylton Fornari, president of the Rio de Janeiro State Association of Supermarkets (Asserj), said: "The government may not tolerate price abuses, but supermarkets are being forced to tolerate the disobedience of government officials who issue currency without due backing." Upon leaving the meeting, Dallari, who was recently rebuked by the president for stating his opposition to the rules for converting school tuition into URV's, said tersely: "I agree with the president: He is right."
