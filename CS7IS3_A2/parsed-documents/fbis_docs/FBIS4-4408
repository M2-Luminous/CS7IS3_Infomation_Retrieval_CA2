The source, who has collected and analyzed various data on North Korean military moves, said the communist state is not in a state of extreme tension nor is it taking any preparatory action for war, the MAINICHI SHIMBUN reported. "There is no strange sign in North Korea. We cannot catch any change in communications or frequency in North Korean military bases. They did not stop periodical reconnaissance flights either," the source was quoted as saying. Defense Ministry staff do not think an emergency will arise at this stage, he said.
