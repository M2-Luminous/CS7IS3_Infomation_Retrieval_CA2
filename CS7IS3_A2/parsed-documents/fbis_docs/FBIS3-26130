Public attitudes ranging from commodity prices and the image of public servants to environmental pollution and housing reform are what a small research agency in south China's boomtown of Guangzhou has been finding out since 1990. Once or twice every month, local media devote time and space to publish the findings on matters of social focus. The feedback prompts the municipal government to adopt measures to solve the problems that affect the life of local residents. Last year a survey found that 70 percent of Guangzhou people are dissatisfied with the jammed traffic conditions. The relevant departments took immediate action to ban bicycle traffic on 11 major roads. A follow-up telephone survey, however, revealed that 55 percent of the people were against the new policy. Then the city solicited ideas from the public and came up with a plan that worked. Xu Yucong, an employee at the Guangzhou public opinion research center, which conducted these surveys, said that the center aims to reflect the concerns of people and serves to jog the minds of policy makers. "In this way, we can draw more attention from the leaders whose policies can help harmonize the multi-faceted relationships in society." To date, the center has conducted over 60 surveys, involving more than 1.4 million residents. Xu said some of the findings touched on sensitive issues. But the municipal government backed their endeavors and considered the practice a main channel of communication of the Communist Party and government organizations with the general public. Xu said the center is able to keep itself objective and unbiased by maintaining total financial independence. Although the Gallup methods have not spread to other parts of the country in finding out public opinion, major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin and the capital Beijing do have "mayor's hot lines" that citizens can dial at any time to voice their grievances and proposals.
