ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The USEPA proposes to approve the ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision and redesignation requests submitted by the State of Ohio for the purpose of redesignating Preble, Columbiana, and Jefferson Counties to attainment for ozone. In the Final Rules Section of this Federal Register , USEPA is approving the State's SIP revision, as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received on or before October 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be mailed to: William MacDowell, Chief, Regulatory Development Section, Air Enforcement Branch (AE&hyph;17J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604.
