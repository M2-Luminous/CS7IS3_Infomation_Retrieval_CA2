After the recent unlawful actions in relation to the Odessa and Nikolayevka departments of the Black Sea Fleet Naval Engineering Service, another action was taken to encourage personnel of the Naval Engineering Service in the Izmail garrison to take the Ukrainian oath. This is already the fourth provocation against Black Sea Fleet seamen serving in this region in the last 2 weeks. The Black Sea Fleet unit stationed there essentially found itself under economic blockade. With the support of city authorities the Military Commissar of Izmail and the Chief of the Officer Training School of the Ukrainian Navy continue to exert pressure upon Black Sea seamen, resorting to a practice of blackmail and threats. In order to normalize the situation and preclude negative development of events in Izmail, the command of the Black Sea Fleet is once again asking the leadership of the Ukrainian Navy and the city authorities to be reasonable, it feels it necessary to await civilized solution of the Black Sea Fleet problem by the presidents of Russia and Ukraine, and it is adhering to agreements on the fleet reached at the highest level. The fleet command has sent the corresponding documents on the situation in Izmail to the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers.
