The history series is to be called "Shanghai Ark." It will show how Shanghai people helped the Jews and sheltered them while many other countries and ports refused to accept the Jewish refugees. About 10,000 Jewish refugees from European countries came to Shanghai from 1933 to 1941. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said in a visit to Shanghai in 1993 that when the Jews were being killed by the Nazi regime and forced to leave home and wander about, the Shanghai people gave refuge to them. Rabin expressed gratitude to the people of Shanghai. The TV series is expected to be shown at the end of the year. It will be dedicated to the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II.
