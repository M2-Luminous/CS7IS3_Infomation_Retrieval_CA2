Logical groupings of family expenditures provided the basis for subcategory and item weights. Unlike category weightings, which vary by income level, subcategory and item weightings are computed from national aggregate expenditures only (i.e., all three income levels used the same set of subcategory and item weightings) as this approach is most common in similar public and private sector cost-of-living analyses. Runzheimer's expenditure research process included procedures to ensure that no marketbasket item had an overwhelmingly large or insignificantly small item weighting. 3.3␣Marketbasket Item Specifications From each logical expense grouping, Runzheimer selected one or more marketbasket items to represent all items in the grouping. When selecting specific items for the marketbasket, Runzheimer worked to satisfy these three criteria: •Items should be readily available in all locations if possible or should be items of local significance. •Item price levels should logically represent the price levels of unselected items in the ``logical grouping.'' •Items should have the same or nearly the same application in all locations. Appendix 2 lists Runzheimer's marketbasket items. Once an item was selected, Runzheimer's research analysts identified the specific brand and/or model/size of each item available in all (or most) locations. For some items, this involved contacting manufacturers, trade associations, retail establishments, etc. For other items, isolating specifications was quite straight forward because of their nature (e.g., bread, nonprescription pain reliever). Appendix 3 identifies changes in the current items selected for pricing in the Goods & Services, Miscellaneous Expense, and Housing Related categories, along with explanation for the changes. 3.3.1␣Exchange and Commissary Expenditure Research Runzheimer used the same marketbasket items to price commissaries and exchanges as were used for the local pricings. We obtained one price quote for each marketbasket item surveyed in these facilities. Runzheimer did not assume that people with access to military facilities made all purchases in these facilities. Instead, we used OPM's 1980 Living Pattern Survey of federal employees to determine the percentage of purchases that families typically make in military facilities versus local outlets. For example, as the following table shows, in Honolulu, 52.7% of Food at Home is purchased at a PX or commissary. These percentages were used to aggregate the local and commissary/exchange prices into one set of appropriate blended prices. (The blended prices were compared to the local prices in the Washington, DC, areas just as each allowance area's local prices were.)
