The session focused on the grave humanitarian situation. Mladen Bosnjak reports: [Bosnjak] The first and key topic of the discussion at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government session today [words indistinct] the availability of food for the population of Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the government's extraordinary session, when it was concluded that the humanitarian situation was so bad that it was threatening with catastrophic consequences, the delivery of food had somewhat improved, but then it quickly fell to its previous level. In some regions, such as in the Bihac region currently, the availability of food has become critical. The main characteristics of the current situation concerning the delivery of food were presented by Arif Smajkic, minister for refugees, labor, and social protection. [Begin Smajkic recording] Refugees, displaced persons, and other socially deprived categories of the population today receive food amounting to 158 grams on average. This is about 21 percent of their needs. The picture is somewhat different in different regions. The availability of food has drastically deteriorated in the Bihac region, where meeting food demands fell from 41 to 18 percent. In Gorazde, it fell from 31 percent to 13.6 percent. A significant deterioration was registered in the Zenica region, where it fell from 28 percent to 13.8 percent. A negligible improvement in the situation was registered in Travnik. The rise there was from 8 to 13.2 percent. In Tuzla, it rose from 7 to 11.6 percent. A somewhat more significant improvement was registered in Sarajevo, where meeting food supplies rose from 25 to 38 percent per resident. [end recording] [Bosnjak] Here is an excerpt from a report on the situation in different regions. Mostar region: No UNHCR relief convoy has arrived in Jablanica in the last seven days. The amount of food that arrived in Mostar is insufficient in terms of quality and variety. Zenica region: The situation remains critical. The greatest problems with the delivery of food were experienced in Zavidovici and Zepce owing to extremely poor roads. This renders the situation in these towns very bad. Travnik region: The situation in this region is extremely difficult, particularly in Gornji Vakuf and the villages around Gornji Vakuf. Tuzla region: The wider area around Tuzla is approaching the point where the delivery of food could be described as dramatic, because the majority of convoys come to this region from Belgrade and through the aggressor's territory. More and more convoys are being canceled. Meeting food demands in this region is the worst in the republic. [passage omitted] The unfavorable situation in Bihac over the last 15 days has culminated in the total suspension of convoys for this town. Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic also stressed the following: [Begin Ljubijankic recording] In the last seven days hospitals have been fiercely shelled. Fourteen patients were killed as a result of this shelling. This is all being somehow overshadowed by events here in Sarajevo. Chetniks are exploiting the attention the world public is giving to Sarajevo and carrying out their activities there in the dark. I think that the psychological effect of air drops would be compelling there, perhaps more so than the actual physical effect. [end recording] [passage omitted]
