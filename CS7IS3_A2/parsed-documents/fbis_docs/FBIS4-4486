Cho Il-min, chief of the Pyongyang mission of Hanminjon, distributed the white paper at a press conference on March 31. To justify the anti-North fuss over the nuclear issue, the white paper says, the Kim Yong-sam group has misled public opinion by misrepresenting the pilot reactor of the North as one for "the development of nuclear arms". But the atomic reactors used for the development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula are the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the multipurpose research reactor in Taedok, South Korea. Stating that the Wolsong heavy water reactor is a reactor for nuclear arms development disguised as one for commercial use, the white paper says: It is a plutonium-producing reactor which has been introduced for the development of nuclear weapons in view of its purpose and structure. The traitor Pak Chong-hui who had politicized nuclear arms development in the early 1970s made sure that a contract on the import of pressurized heavy water reactor was signed with Canada in December 1974 and the project was "pushed forward on a full-scale" (WOLGAN CHOSON, August 1988). Nuclear experts involved in the nuclear arms development in those days and journalists testified: "Park Chong-hui seemed to have ordered the import of a heavy water reactor, because he was keen on developing nuclear weapons" (WOLGAN CHOSON, August 1988), "The Wolsong heavy water reactor was imported from Canada to produce nuclear arms" (WOLGAN CHOSON, October 1991) and "The heavy water reactor is entirely intended for the production of plutonium" (WOLGAN CHOSON, March 1991). The Wolsong heavy water reactor can change spent fuel at any time without stopping operation, because it is designed for the production of plutonium. Therefore, it is almost impossible to supervise it. The Wolsong heavy water reactor disgorges a large amount of spent fuel containing high-level plutonium and is used directly for the development of nuclear weapons. Now South Korea has stockpiled spent fuel containing ten odd tons of plutonium at present and the amount is foreseen to increase to 24 tons by the year 2000. The plutonium produced by the heavy water reactor in Wolsong till now since it started operation in 1983 is enough to make more than 370 atom bombs. When another heavy water reactor now under construction begins operation, the annual amount of plutonium output will more than double. The white paper points out that the multipurpose research reactor constructed in the Taedok complex is a reactor exclusively for nuclear arms development under "research" veil. It is disguised as one unrelated to the development of nuclear weapons because it uses uranium enriched to 20 percent. But it is, in fact, a reactor exclusively for the development of nuclear weapons which plays the key role in nuclear arms development in South Korea. The Seoul regime got the "understanding" of its Washington master through several rounds of negotiations under the cloak of "research and production of isotopes". It began designing a multipurpose research reactor in 1985, started its building in 1989 and completed it in 1992 in cooperation with Canada. The multipurpose research reactor is not a research reactor for peaceful purpose but a reactor for military use which is used as a "diazole" in the production of nuclear arms. Its designing itself has been for the manufacture of nuclear bombs and it has opened the way for legally obtaining highly-enriched uranium. The multipurpose research reactor can be reconstructed into a plutonium-producing reactor without difficulty any time. Though it is camouflaged as a light water reactor fueling on uranium enriched to 20 percent, it, in actuality, discharges much spent fuel containing high-level plutonium in a shorter time than the heavy water reactor. And it is closely linked with reprocessing facilities. The nuclear developing team of South Korea has built experimental irradiation facilities along with the multipurpose reactor in the atomic energy institute of the Taedok complex. Thus, a perfect plutonium extracting system has been formed, in which the spent fuel of the multipurpose research reactor is directly reprocessed by the irradiation facilities. Demanding that the Wolsong heavy water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor of Taedok which are totally for military use be destroyed, the white paper says: The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], making a noisy fuss about the pilot reactor of North Korea, turns a blind eye to the heavy water reactor and multipurpose research reactor for military purpose in South Korea whose capacity is respectively scores of times and several times that of the North's pilot reactor. The IAEA has not disclosed as yet the results of inspection of these nuclear facilities of South Korea. The South Korean authorities are openly claiming the "reexamination of the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," calling for "nuclear option." This suggests that the South Korean authorities scheme to unilaterally abrogate the joint declaration adopted between the North and the South. The South Korean authorities must give up the policy of nuclear arms development and declare the removal of the heavy water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor which are used for the production of nuclear weapons.
