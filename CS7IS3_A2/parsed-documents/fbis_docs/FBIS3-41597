Egypt's delegation to the two-day meetings is led by Ambassador Hajar al-Islambuli, director of the Economic Affairs Department in the Foreign Ministry. The participants in the meetings will discuss the problem of desertification in the Middle East; the disposal of contaminated and solid wastes, particularly from oil; and pollution in the Gulf of Aqaba, which Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Israel overlook. Delegates from more than 40 countries in the Middle East, the Gulf, the Arab Maghreb, and Europe, in addition to the United States, Canada, Russia, China, and Japan, are taking part in the meetings. The committee meetings have been boycotted by both Syria and Lebanon, which are making progress on the bilateral tracks a condition for their attendance at the multilateral talks. Sources close to the committee, which Egypt is hosting, have stated that the group will try to put the ideas and proposals discussed at previous meetings into practice. During previous meetings, the United States and some world major powers promised to bear the costs of the projects related to this issue in the region. The sources noted the importance of the discussions conducted by the five committees stemming from the multilateral talks, which are arms control, water, economic development, refugees, and environment. Addressing the opening session, Assistant Foreign Minister 'Adil al-Safti emphasized that the new atmosphere of peace in the Middle East provides a chance for progress on all the peace tracks. He noted that progress in the bilateral talks will give the countries that are not participating in the multilateral talks the chance to do so. He noted that Egypt and the region's countries attach importance to the environment and the need to protect it. He added that if economic development does not take the need for a clean environment into account, it will be incomplete. He stressed that Egypt calls for establishing regional cooperation to protect the environment. He reiterated Egypt's firm position that progress in the various areas of cooperation among the region's countries depends on progress in the bilateral talks. Al-Safti noted that the establishment of a just peace in the Middle East will give rise to the establishment of regional cooperation on a sound basis that serves the interests of the region's people. The two-day meetings will examine all issues related to environmental protection and ways to deal with the desertification and drought affecting some of the region's countries.
