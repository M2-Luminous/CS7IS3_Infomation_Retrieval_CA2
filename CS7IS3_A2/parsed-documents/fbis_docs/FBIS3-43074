But this catastrophical situation did not come about all at once. Our current woes are bitter payment for entire decades of thoughtless decisions and actions. My career in pharmaceuticals began many years ago. In the early 1970s I was already the director of the department of molecular pharmacology and radiobiology at the Moscow Medical Institute No 2. Once I had the occasion to talk with a certain highly placed worker at the USSR Council of Ministers on the state of medical science. I said then that in another 10-15 years our state would be completely dependent upon the West for pharmaceuticals. Domestic medical industry was developing at a loss, a large share of capital investments was being sent to the GDR, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Bulgaria, while our pharmaceutical factories were shutting down. A crisis was to be expected. I was asked to write all of this down and take the materials over to the Council of Ministers. I worked daily for a month and a half on my concept of the state of pharmaceutical science in the country. Then, after sending the materials I began waiting for a response. But unfortunately no one made the effort to answer me. Then I sent a letter to the CPSU Central Committee. Once again there was no reply. In the heyday of perestroyka I was invited together with Academician M. Mashkovskiy and Academician R. Glushkov to join Gorbachev's staff, and we were asked to draft a presidential edict on pharmaceuticals. For 3 months we conducted serious analytical work, which culminated in a draft edict. It's not known whose fault it was, but this edict never was signed. For years I appeared before public health committees of the Russia and the USSR, roamed the ministry hallways, and expended energy trying to prove something patently obvious--people need pharmaceuticals as much as they need bread. In late 1991 a concrete, fully thought out Russian state program was finally drawn up and approved. The strategic line of development of pharmaceutical science and of provision of medicines to the population was finally defined ``on paper.'' But alas, once again things never went farther than this. As before, the country continues to lack a unified program of research in pharmacology. We have over 40 medical VUZes, and all of them have pharmacology departments, but no one is coordinating their work. The absence of planning and control encourages inactivity. On the other hand the road that must be traveled by medicines already in existence to the patient is infinitely complex and long. So much coordination with numerous committees, commissions and experts councils must be done! It takes an average of 10-12 years to create a new pharmaceutical, while the process of introduction sometimes drags on for decades! Often an original preparation that we could have produced for ourselves and sold abroad grows obsolete, never getting beyond the paperwork stage. In the meantime in developed countries it usually takes 2-3 years to introduce a high quality preparation. Why does this happen? There's no secret here. We simply lack a nationwide system for the synthesis and introduction of pharmaceuticals, and we do not have a unified sector producing them. Throughout the world, pharmaceuticals are made by huge firms in which the processes of scientific development of pharmaceuticals and their introduction into production are combined. In our country we do not have a single firm of this kind. And consequently a preparation that comes into being in some university department also often ``dies'' there, having been unable to make it into production. Another misfortune lies in the fact that our pharmaceutical enterprises have fallen far behind modern requirements in terms of their equipment. As I see it, one of the greatest misfortunes is the absence of state orders for medicinal resources. Consequently we also lack a program for providing the country with pharmaceuticals, one based on a clear idea of what we have for today, what preparations are suitable for use, and which have become hopelessly obsolete, what will be needed tomorrow, including the amount that will have to be purchased abroad, and precisely what will have to purchased there. We do not have any kind of service that could determine the population's demand for pharmaceuticals, draw up state orders, and distribute pharmaceuticals in optimum fashion! No country in the world can completely satisfy its demand for pharmaceuticals by its own production. Japan for example, which has a highly developed pharmaceutical industry, imports many more pharmaceuticals than it exports. Clearly it would be impossible and unsuitable for Russia to do away with imports of pharmaceuticals. But today the ratio between exports and imports is 1:20. This is of course extremely disadvantageous to the country, which has all of the potential to make this ratio equal to 1:2 or 1:3. In the last year the pharmaceutical supply situation became even more tragic. The collapse of the economy, and the tumultuous and inarticulate confusion in the higher echelons of power have had a devastating effect on the supply of pharmaceuticals to the common people. The pharmacies are empty, while the warehouses are overfilled--they are holding pharmaceuticals back in anticipation of new, even fantastically higher prices. What is the Russian Ministry of Health doing in this situation? In the last 15-20 years--that is after it was separated out of the Ministry of Medical and Microbiological Industry, the Ministry of Health has done nothing about pharmaceuticals, and for practical purposes it has even avoided drawing up state orders. The Extraordinary Pharmaceutical Committee was organized in August 1991, but because of its total incompetence it didn't do anything, and it was soon abolished. Then Academician A. I. Vorobyev organized an expert council on pharmaceuticals when he became minister. His work also recalled running in place. When the council held meetings, foreign firms always had their ears to the wall, and their interests were defended by experts discussing the fate of a given preparation. And in my opinion it was not until the new minister assumed his post that we finally began fighting the flawed system of distributing and selling pharmaceuticals, one in which the state appropriated millions of rubles' worth of foreign currency to acquire pharmaceuticals abroad, while patients continued to remain without therapeutic assistance. ``Glorious'' was the legacy left to the new minister. Western states had given us loans for the purchase of pharmaceuticals, but as a result of unforgivable mismanagement they were returned unused. Large sums of foreign currency idled in safes of the Pharmacological Committee. Its former chairman visited companies in different countries of the world 10-15 times each year. And even now he continues to manage international ties in the Pharmacological Committee! The new minister is not responding to the administration's lead, he is trying to fight it, and this does him honor. But it is very important for him to create a team of people around him from different fields of pharmacological industry and pharmacological science, a team of honest people of like mind. It is extremely necessary to distribute orders for imported preparations as quickly as possible--after all, thousands of people are waiting! And of course, we need to change the system under which all hard currency is transferred to local public health departments. Pharmaceutical merchants have rushed headlong to them, easily finding a common language with people who have little understanding of the highly complex issues of purchasing imported preparations. The coordinating role must remain with the Center. Otherwise this idiotic waste of state resources will continue unavoidably. And after all, we have very few of these resources left.
