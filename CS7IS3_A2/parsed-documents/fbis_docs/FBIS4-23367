The organization has appealed to all involved to stop the killings and said it was prepared to offer military or other assistance to help stabilize the situation. Estelle Pienaar reports that South African President Nelson Mandela received a hero's welcome on his arrival in Harare to attend the meeting: There was a tumultuous welcome for South Africa's President Nelson Mandela today as he arrived in Harare for his first official foreign visit as head of state. Zimbabwean vice president and one of the founder members of the Frontline States back in 1974, Mr. Joshua Nkomo, was there to meet him, but at the conference center in the city delegates of the Global Coalition for Africa who have been meeting in the Zimbabwean capital since yesterday, together with the Frontline States, had depressing matters to address. The ravaging Rwanda civil war was addressed during a brief informal discussion of the seven Frontline States' presidents and South Africa's head of state, President Nelson Mandela. All were very concerned about the current situation in Rwanda. Afterwards the Frontline States met for the first time embracing South Africa into the brotherhood of the subcontinent.
