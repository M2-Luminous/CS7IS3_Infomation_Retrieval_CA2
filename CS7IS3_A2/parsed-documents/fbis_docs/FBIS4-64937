At the beginning, the Skopjeans told organizers that they had lost their flag. But a short while later they presented a new one. The new flag has a yellow sun with 42 rays and six lines connected together in the form of an X over a red background. The team paraded as The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The team captain later revealed that the new flag was given to them by his country's Sports Ministry. ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reports that the fact that Skopjeans changed their flag indicates that they are ready to present an alternative solution and perhaps they are ready to abandon the Sun of Veryina which they had presented as their symbol.
