The visit to Skopje will take place on Wednesday [23 February] and to Athens on Thursday. At the same time, the European Commission today undertook a commitement to examine from the legal point of view the Greek Government's measures against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] in order to establish whether there are reasons for referring the case against our country to the European Court. These are the two decisions made at noon today during the meeting of the EU foreign ministers. According to the statement by Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos, who is presiding over the council, the question of Greece's measures against Skopje was raised at the meeting by EU Commission President Jacques Delors. According to Mr. Pangalos, most of the countries criticized Greece both for the nature of the measures and the way in which they were adopted. Responding to questions from correspondents, the alternate foreign minister described the Government's decision as an exceptional measure of a political nature. We regret having to make this decision, he said. We would like to have good relations with this republic but tolerance -- as Mr. Pangalos put it -- has its limits. Mr. Pangalos further stressed that in the next few hours the Government will present to the EU Commission all the legal arguments that, in the Government's opinion, justify its decision. Asked whether Greece had informed the member states in time, Mr. Pangalos said that the 11 members were briefed simultaneously with the announcement of the measures. Referring to the measures, the alternate foreign minister stressed that the embargo against FYROM does not include medicines, foodstuffs, or oil used by humanitarian institutions. It is worth noting that, at his regular briefing of the correspondents this morning, the EU Commission spokesman said that the Commission understands very well that the FYROM issue is sensitive for the Greek Government and the sentimental reaction of Greek public opinion. However, as he said, the Commission in its capacity as guardian of the [Maastricht] Treaty has to examine the legal dimensions of the measures that the Government has taken in the light of the EU's lawful order.
