The second rice crop's turned out 3,856 tons while the highland rice farming yielded 1,430 tons. According to an official of the local agriculture service, the output may not meet the demand in consumption of 230,000 residents in this central province. Accordingly, rice shortage is likely to loom over the province for two months this year. The shortfall in rice production in Khammouane was due to severe floods, drought and pests which damaged 3,321 ha [hectares] of farmland. In compensation for the losses, the agriculture service has encouraged for the cultivation of starchy crops and for rice farming on 154 ha with an expected yield of 4.45 tons of paddy per ha.
