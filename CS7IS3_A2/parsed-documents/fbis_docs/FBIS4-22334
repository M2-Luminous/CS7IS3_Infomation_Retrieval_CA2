Popov, Vice President of the Agrotekhnologiya [Agrotechnology] Joint Stock Society and candidate of agricultural sciences: "`Agrotekhnologiya' Is Getting Down to Work"] [Text] Without exaggeration we can say that the country is now in a state of agricultural crisis, the essence of which has to do with the fact that village producers of agricultural products have either inadequate or no assets. The application of fertilizer has practically ceased, there is a shortage of equipment to carry out these operations, soil degradation is in progress, and the ecological balance is being violated. It would seem that measures are being taken to correct this situation. Land relations have been secured through legal channels, and a multi-structural agricultural production base has been approved. Farming enterprises are being created side by side with large agricultural enterprises, the population is being given plots of land, and dacha [summer house] and horticultural-gardening cooperatives are being organized. Gradually, competition is developing among all village goods producers. This is the beginning of market ties and relations. At the same time we have observed a multitude of negative processes that hinder movement along the selected market path in the economy. In particular, unnecessary fuss and haste have been exhibited in eliminating large enterprises and there have been attempts to forcefully introduce farming, whereas both processes should be voluntary. Large enterprises may become genuine collectives in the form of joint-stock societies, cooperatives or partnerships. Land, the means of production, and ultimately the results of work must belong to these collectives. Where conditions exist, farming enterprises are being created, and there should be no hindrance to this. Can it be that we cannot deal with this simple matter? I think that we can. Everyone must simply be a facilitator instead of interfering with the development of judicious multi-structural land ownership. It is from these positions that economic transformation of the village should be managed. But very complicated problems arise in the process of reform. One of them is the use of chemical agents, equipment and scientific elaborations. With the transition to market relations we have noted a negative tendency to partially or fully reject fertilizer in connection with its increased cost. Directors of enterprises say that for 1-2 years they will be able to do without the purchase of chemical agents and equipment by using existing reserves. Most likely this will not be a success -- working with a machine until it wears out will not yield good results. In addition, it could bring with it a curtailment in the production of chemical agents and a reorientation of production capacities. In other words, agriculture will simply exacerbate its predicament. We should consider that if a wheat yield of 15-20 quintals per hectare requires one pesticide treatment and the application of 70-180 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare, then a productivity of 30-35 quintals will require six pesticide treatments and 300-420 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare. In this way, the noted tendency to refuse fertilizer, pesticides and new equipment will result in a sharp drop in soil fertility and thus in a significant decrease in the harvest. In recent years ecological problems have become particularly urgent in agriculture. Avoiding pollution of soil and crops with chemical agents requires their balanced and comprehensive use on the basis of soil and leaf diagnostics. Effective and safe use is impossible without the newest machines and equipment and the leading technologies. Ideas about the negative aspects of chemicals in agriculture are taking hold more and more firmly in the mass media. What is not mentioned is that in the entire world the knowledgeable use of large doses of mineral fertilizers is the foundation for producing large and stable harvests. Let me cite certain figures. In 1991 in the USSR, 120 kilograms of active substance was applied per hectare; in Holland -- 800. The productivity of grains equalled 18 and 70 quintals per hectare respectively. In the USSR pesticides were used on 30-35 percent of sowing area, in the U.S. -- on 90 percent, and in Japan -- on 100 percent of total area. Meanwhile, the life expectancy of an individual equals 70, 75 and 78 years respectively. In this case what should concern us more today -- ecology or soil fertility and the size of the harvest? Obviously we should look at both without contrasting one with the other. Increasing the return on fertilizer should be one of our main tasks because it is still low here. The introduction of one kilogram of nutrients with fertilizers yields 7.3 kilograms of grain abroad and 3-5 kilograms in the Russian Federation. Expenditures of mineral fertilizers to produce a tonne of agricultural product is 2.6 times greater here than in the U.S.. In connection with the difficult economic situation in the country, particularly within agricultural production, the agrochemical potential that has been developed since the early 1970's (Selkhozkhimiya [Agrochemical] Specialized Association, agrochemical laboratories, and stations for chemicalization and plant protection), at the present time is collapsing, and in some places has already collapsed. Under these difficult conditions it is essential to seek new, non-traditional approaches not only to the agrochemical service, but to the entire complex of scientific-technical services within the new multi-structural agricultural production base as well. Most likely, direct ties between producers of agricultural products and enterprises that produce material-technical resources, as well as scientific-research and planning-research institutions will be of more and more significance. For example, after the elimination of Soyuzselkhozkhimiya [All-Union Agricultural Chemical Association], the Agrotekhnologiya Joint Stock Society was created with the goal of further realizing accumulated scientific-technical potential and of effectively utilizing the highly trained specialists of this association's apparatus. Its founders include the Agrokhim Russian Agrochemical Company, Avtoselkhozmash [Agricultural Vehicle and Machinery] Holding Association, Rossiyskiye Semena [Russian Seed] Joint-Stock Society, and the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences. We have selected contemporary scientific-technical supply of agroindustrial production as our main direction. Our clients and partners are kolkhozes, sovkhozes, joint-stock societies, partnerships, farmers, and individual land users regardless of form of ownership or management. All relations are built on direct contracts and a mutually advantageous foundation. During last and this year the society has concluded contracts with large producers to assimilate intensive technologies for raising wheat, corn, sugar beets, potatoes, soybeans and other crops. We are carrying out this work jointly with enterprises, first and foremost, in large land-management regions -- Krasnodarskiy Kray, and Rostov, Voronezh, Orel, Belgorod, Lipetsk, Tambov, Tula, and Penza oblasts. Everything begins with traditional technological maps, which with a consideration of agricultural resources, soil fertility and management-economic conditions, are made more precise by us jointly with agronomists and engineers from enterprises. In carrying out their obligations, our specialists are concerned about supplying enterprises with hybrid corn, peas and other seed, and satisfying demand for the most effective fertilizers, agricultural equipment and plant protection agents. Agrotechnological classes and seminars are held for workers of agricultural enterprises. In striving to alleviate financial problems, we try to sell these agricultural resources under favorable conditions and as inexpensively as possible for the consumer. We do not chase after super profits, and for this reason, overhead expenses are curtailed to 7-8 percent. Incidentally, enterprises pay us in money as well as in agricultural products. In enterprises that have contracts with us, the productivity of grains and legumes, including corn, increased last year by an average of 3 quintals per hectare; of sugar beets -- by 30-50. A large savings in resources is achieved when they are utilized more effectively. Another direction in our operations involves providing agricultural services to the small producer of agricultural products, beginning with the farmer and ending with the cultivators of dacha plots and members of horticultural-garden cooperatives. Unfortunately, we have not yet created an orderly system for supplying the population with technology and agricultural resources with stability. Farming enterprises have found themselves in particularly difficult circumstances because they are not supplied with chemical agents, small equipment, seed and scientific-technical elaborations either through the centralized supply system for kolkhozes, sovkhozes and joint-stock societies created on the basis of kolkhozes or sovkhozes or through government and cooperative trading, which has also undergone reforms everywhere, or through scientific-research institutions and the agronomic service. Nevertheless, practically all individual land users understand that without a positive solution to these problems it is impossible to cultivate a good harvest of most agricultural crops. It is no secret to anyone that during moist years up to 30-50 percent of the potato harvest perishes from phytophthora, and of the cucumber harvest -- from peronosporosis. During dry years potato plantations become severely infested with the Colorado potato beetle. Individuals do not always have mineral fertilizer, seed and a horticultural inventory to carry out seasonal operations. Due to the absence of chemical ameliorative agents on the market the population loses up to 25-30 percent of harvest potential annually. In the Non-Chernozem Zone alone the demand for such agents equals over 7,000 tonnes annually. In connection with this, Agrotekhnologiya has begun to create local specialized partnerships to provide technological supplies to individual land users. At the present time such partnerships have been created in Moscow, Leningrad, Lipetsk, Belgorod, and Vladimir oblasts and Krasnodar Kray. This work is carried out in close cooperation with local Selkhozkhimiya associations. Last year partnerships fully supplied the demand for chemical ameliorative agents by over 60,000 individual land users. The society together with the Vitebsk Dolomit Production Association has organized the production of dolomite meal packed in small packages (5-25 kilograms). This is the best soil amelioration agent, containing the vital microelement magnesium in addition to calcium. Agrochemical soil analyses on fine-contour farm plots and in dacha and horticultural-gardening cooperatives and technological consultations with land users on the effective and ecologically safe use of fertilizers and plant protection agents are provided jointly with chemicalization stations. Through the system of partnerships individual land users are supplied with significant quantities of vegetable seed, the framework for dacha hothouses and hotbeds, panels, and horticultural-gardening inventory. The simplest accounts show that improved availability to individual land users, especially farming (peasant) enterprises, of essential agricultural resources and technological services will enable them to greatly improve land productivity and to increase the production of potatoes, vegetables, fruit and livestock raising by 15-20 percent. Such experience exists. The first positive results also exist. But they can be more weighty if we unify our efforts and the efforts of many other production-technical, commercial-supply, agronomic and variety seed farming organizations, including the structures of the RF Ministry of Agriculture and Food and of local agricultural organs.
