The package was sent to the House of Councillors. The revised package, jointly submitted to the Diet by the governing coalition and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), features changes in the districts of proportional representation for lower house elections and in corporate donations to political fund-raising organizations. The original government package banned corporate donations to politicians and their fund-raising organizations, but the revised bills will allow firms to donate up to 500,000 yen per year during the next five years as a temporary provision. The package maintains that 300 seats in the lower house will be elected through a single-seat constituency system and the remaining 200 by a system of proportional representation. Current lower house members are elected from constituencies with two to six seats. The package was passed on January 29 at the last extraordinary session of the Diet shortly after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono agreed that the amendments and date of enforcement would be discussed during the current ordinary session. On February 24, the ruling coalition and the LDP agreed on the revisions weeks after discussions of the package began. Lower house elections based on the political reform legislation will be able to commence after a bill on the locations of the 300 single-seat constituencies clears the parliament.
