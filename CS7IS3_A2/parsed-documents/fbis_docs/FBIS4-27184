Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa reportedly briefed the meeting on the collapse of talks between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over the inspection of spent fuel rods being removed from a 5-megawatt reactor in the Yongbyon complex. Kakizawa also briefed the closed-door meeting on the discussion currently under way within the United Nations Security Council and reaction from other nations to the nuclear impasse, the sources said. Kakizawa later told reporters that North Korea has already removed about half of the 8,000 fuel rods in the experimental reactor. He said that if the United Nations had waited to adopt a presidential statement on the reactor refueling, the opportunity to ensure no radioactive materials from the reactor have been diverted to military purposes would be lost. At Tuesday's meeting in Tokyo, the Japanese Defense Agency explained the situation on the Korean peninsula and reported on information it had received from the United States about North Korea's expected missile launch, government sources said. In New York on Monday, the UN Security Council adopted a presidential statement urging North Korea to halt the fuel rod removal after receiving a letter from the IAEA on Friday.
