FBIS4-7767 "dreeu066_p_94010" FBIS-EEU-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 POLAND Poll on Public Support, Propensity To Strike Poll on Public Support, Propensity To Strike WS0604152194 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 6 Apr 94 p 2 WS0604152194 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA Polish BFN [Report by R.W.: "CBOS on Strikes; They Are Caused by Activists, Poor People Strike" -- diagram appearing in original text not included] [Text] The wave of strikes and protests across the country will increase, according to almost half (48 percent) of adult Poles questioned by the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] in mid-March, a few days after "Solidarity," in line with its February announcement, began a nationwide protest action. Almost two-thirds (63 percent) of respondents agree with the opinion that given the present situation, "staging a strike actually does not provide any results," and 70 percent object to the union's organizing a general strike. In comparison with February, the number of people approving strikes has decreased, which, however, does not apply to the group which most widely takes part in such protests -- that is, among skilled workers. Forty percent of respondents would be ready to take part in an organized strike at their enterprise. Thirty-eight percent of respondents might go on a so-called solidarity strike, that is, a strike which backs protests at other enterprises; 41 percent would be prepared to participate in a general strike against the government's economic policies. Half of the respondents believe that strikes are most frequently caused by union activists. Every fourth respondent believes that activists announce strikes to avert an uncontrolled outbreak of dissatisfaction. Why do people take part in strikes? Almost half (46 percent of the respondents) say that the reasons are, first of all, political -- an aversion for the present government. A little fewer (40 percent) of the respondents think that dominating factors are economic considerations -- the desire to improve their material situation. Regardless of the reasons, employees with low wages and those living on the brink of poverty (46 percent of respondents chose this answer) take part in strikes more often than employees with fairly good wages who would like to earn more (39 percent). According to the respondents, most justified are the strikes of health-care employees (opinion of 64 percent of respondents), miners (55 percent), and teachers (43 percent). Support for the protests of railway workers, metallurgists, or employees of the arms industry is much weaker. Among every hundred respondents, only eight believe that the protests of postal workers are justified; six -- that the protests of municipal transportation companies are justified; and only two -- that strikes by employees of the power engineering industry are justified. Every second respondent believes that decisions concerning strike demands in state-run enterprises should be made by the directors of those enterprises; every fourth person thinks that such decisions should be left to the government. The poll was conducted between 10 and 14 March on a representative sample of 1,228 adult Poles.
