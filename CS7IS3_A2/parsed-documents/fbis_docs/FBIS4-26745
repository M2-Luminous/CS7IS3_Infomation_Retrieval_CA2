Some of the sectors, such as civil aviation, are becoming open for the first time, said a government official who asked not to be identified. Also under the new policies, foreign trade will be partially opened to foreign investors, the official said. Overseas companies can launch joint ventures with local partners in bonded areas in China, he said. He declined to give further details. The official disclosed that the government is considering setting up a Sino-foreign civil aviation joint venture company as a trial programme to enhance competitiveness of the domestic civil aviation industry on the world market. The new policies will also open different parts of China's transportation network to foreign investors. Such things as expressways, railways, motor vehicle transportation centres and wharfs will be opened. The country will drum up foreign investment to set up plants to manufacture passenger railway coaches and launch restaurants and motor vehicle maintenance shops along highways. The official also disclosed that one to two supermarkets can be set up with foreign investment in each of the major cities and special economic zones, including Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen and Hainan. The retail stores, however, must be joint ventures including Chinese partners. No wholly foreign-owned supermarkets will be allowed, he said. The government will limit these joint ventures to retail sales only and they are not allowed to carry out whole sale business, he added. To develop the financial and tourism sectors, foreign companies are now allowed to set up banking institutions in some coastal cities and build some tourism facilities in State-approved tourist spots across the country; the official did not specify which coastal cities would be opened in this way. In the real estate sector, he said, foreign investment will be encouraged to help develop large parcels of land. Overseas capital will not only be allowed in residential construction but also in the building of key facilities involving transportation, telecommunications and water supply systems. Foreign-funded real estate projects, however, will be required to undergo a thorough examination by the government. Other fields opened under the new policies for foreign investment include leasing, accounting, advertising, information consultancy, engineering, industrial designing, and schools and training centres. The government has managed to guarantee sufficient funds to domestic enterprises for setting up key joint ventures projects -- mainly industrial, infrastructural and agricultural ones -- with foreign partners. In the first five months of this year, China approved 20,230 foreign-invested projects. The pledged foreign input was $32.7 billion. By the end of last year, the country cumulatively had approved more than 180,000 foreign-funded ventures with $224 billion worth of pledged foreign capital, making China the top haven for international capital investment. A senior government official said China will remain a major magnet for international investment due to its high-powered technical and industrial bases. In addition, he said, China's vast territory, natural resources and cheap labour force are also attractive.
