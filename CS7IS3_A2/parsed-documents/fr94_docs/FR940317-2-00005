FR940317-2-00005 FR940317-2-00003 The lead Agency in the preparation of the EIS is the Forest Service. The process will also include consideration of designating cooperating agencies. Among those who may become cooperating agencies are the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Implementation of this proposal may require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The Forest Service anticipates the Draft EIS will be filed in the Fall of 1994, and the Final EIS in the Spring of 1995. The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 60 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the notice of availability in the Federal Register . The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewers position and contentions. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC , 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts. City of Angoon v. Hodel , 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris , 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final environmental impact statement. To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. Dated: February 25, 1994. Veto J. Lasalle, Forest Supervisor. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6203 Filed 3&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;11&hyph;M
