Li expressed the belief in a written statement released here this afternoon upon his arrival for a three-day official visit to Uzbekistan, the first leg of his five-Asian-nation tour. The tour will also take him to Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. Li said he was delighted to start his tour of Central Asia from the ancient city of Tashkent. The people of China and Uzbekistan have a traditional friendship, which dates back to the times of the "silk-road", Li said. He recalled that Uzbek President Islam Karimov's visit to China in 1992 "opened a new chapter" in bilateral friendly relations, and gave a strong momentum to an in-depth and overall growth of such ties. China attaches importance to its relations with Uzbekistan, respects the choice of its people, and sincerely hopes for a lasting, stable and friendly relationship with the country based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence, he said. During the visit, Li will hold talks with Uzbek leaders on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of mutual concern.
