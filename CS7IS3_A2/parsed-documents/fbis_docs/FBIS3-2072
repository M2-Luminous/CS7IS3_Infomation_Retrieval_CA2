A person in charge of the CAIC announced at this evening's news briefing that the corporation, now hallmarked by its Long March rocket series undertaking the launching of foreign satellites, is moving toward the outside world in a fresh manner. This year, the corporation will hold four large exhibitions and international cooperation meetings in Chicago, Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, and Beijing, at which nearly 100 projects of cooperation will be presented. The CAIC is a scientific and technological industry giant founded on the basis of the aerospace section of the former Ministry of Aeronautics and Astronautics Industry in June 1993. Through the development over the past 30 years or so, China's aerospace industry has expanded to a considerable size and reached considerable sophistication. So far, many models of strategic and tactical missiles and carrier rockets have been successfully developed, and a total of 36 aerospace launchings have been conducted, sending 41 satellites, including five from abroad, into outer space. At the moment, the development of China's Dongfanghong-3 telesat, Fengyun-2 meteorological satellite, and Ziyuan-1 resource satellite is making smooth progress and the first two satellites will be launched and go into operation soon. A prototype of the Long March rocket series is being developed, and the products in this series are going through systematization, generalization, and standardization, as a result of which the corporation is now capable of providing the international market with a wider spectrum of services. As to satellites, after starting the exportation of technology and parts, China is striving to improve its satellite technology and the ratio of satellite performance to price, in an attempt to be able to export complete satellites around 2000. The projects for cooperation presented today cover a number of areas, such as electronics, machinery and equipment, automobiles and auto parts, and real estate development. It is said that the corporation has begun adjusting its product mix and will soon start developing the following products as part of the "signature projects" in the development of China's aerospace products for civil purposes: a satellite information system, a mobile communications substation series, a global television transmission system, a satellite digital communications VSAT [as received] station, an aerospace satellite digital mobile communications and localizing system, and so on. Digital control, engineer control [gong kong 1562 2235], robot, detection radar, special chemical industry, special materials, and microwave, infrared, and millimeter-wave technlogy will also be considered key objects of development. Apart from strengthening cooperation with old and new partners in the above areas, the CAIC is also willing to expand the scope and size of cooperation in the following areas: Coinvestment in, or codevelopment of, such applications as communications, resource, meteorological, and navigational satellites and various kinds of scientific experiment satellites; provision of the ground application systems and equipment for various kinds of satellites; and the establishment and joint management of a satellite application system, with the CAIC's satellites and carrier rockets contributed as its share of investment; and so on and so forth. The person in charge of the corporation also answered questions from reporters. When a foreign reporter asked about the alleged exportation of M11 missiles by China to Pakistan, this person replied that the corporation does not have this missile model at all, so the alleged export of M11 missiles to Pakistan is pure rumor.
