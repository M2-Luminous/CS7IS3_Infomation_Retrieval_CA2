The new clause would call for the creation of a security presence [wujud amni] in the occupied territories and for the separation of Jewish settlers and Palestinians in sensitive areas. Meanwhile, the PLO attributed the failure of the talks held yesterday in Tunisia with Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator on the peace process, to Israeli reluctance to take effective measures in Hebron and other areas. According to the PLO, Israel only took cosmetic measures following last month's massacre in al-Ibrahimi Mosque.
