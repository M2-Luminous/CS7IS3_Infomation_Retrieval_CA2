The withdrawal of the Falcon Brigade, left some 2,700 US troops in Somalia and some 4,000 others off-shore. The United States was due to complete its troop withdrawal from the war-ravaged country by the end of this month, amid fears that renewed clan-warfare could escalate. A convoy of US troops came under fire near the Mogadishu port on Tuesday, while a group of Italian soldiers erecting tents for cholera victims in north Mogadishu were also shot at. UN officials said the Italians returned fire and wounded one Somali. None of the Americans was injured. Also on Tuesday, occupants of a white Toyota Land Cruiser fired at a US sentry position at the new port area. Last Sunday, about six Somalis jumped from a van and fired several shots into the American military compound. The Americans returned fire and seriously wounded two Somalis. Meanwhile, a group of Somalis erected a roadblock near the green line in north Mogadishu.
