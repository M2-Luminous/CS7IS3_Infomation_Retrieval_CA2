Total cost of the order for both companies is 3 billion yen. The ML will be built next to the assembly tower at Yoshinobu Launch Complex of the Tanegashima Space Center (Kagoshima Prefecture) to have a spare rocket on stand-by. The season during which rockets can be launched is restricted to 90 days, including both summer and winter, in order to comply with regulations that protect local fishing rights. NASDA hopes to improve launching efficiency by expanding the launch facilities. Not only can the ML be used to assemble rockets, it also can transport rockets excluding satellites and fairings from the assembly tower to the launch pad and be used as a launcher as well. ML No.2 with a spare H-2 rocket will be built as a stand-by next to the ML No.1 which was used for the H-2 launch in February 1994. Main features of ML No.2 include: 1) launch deck (ML body); 2) travel device and machine equipment including a launch stabilizer; 3) cooling water facility. The launch deck is 22 meters wide, 18 meters long, and 4 meters thick. The travel device can move at a maximum speed of 8 meters per minute on tracks. KHI's contract includes production and engineering of the ML body, travel device, relief tracks, and lighting equipment, as well as orbital replacement work. The cost of the order is 1.55 billion yen. On the other hand, MHI's contract for equipment, including the ambilical service pod to supply liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to the rockets, engine exhaust, upper deck, and cooling water facility to cool the launch stand, totals Â¥1.45 billion. Construction of ML No.2 is scheduled for completion in December 1994, in time for use during the third H-2 launch in early 1995. In case the rocket on ML No.1 runs into trouble, the rocket standing by on ML No.2 can be launched, thus avoiding launch delays of various experimental and future commercial satellites.
