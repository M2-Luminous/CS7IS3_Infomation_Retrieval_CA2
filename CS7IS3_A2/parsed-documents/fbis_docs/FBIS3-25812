"We'll receive more than 40 planes for civil use this year from the United States and Europe," Ye Yigan, President of the China Aviation Supplies Corp (CASC), said in an interview with BUSINESS WEEKLY. Most of the planes are made by the Boeing Co of the United States and Airbus Industrie, the France-based European consortium, Ye said. The world's civil aviation generally grows twice as fast as the global economy. "But China's civil aviation has grown by a larger margin," Ye explained. "That means we will buy at least several dozen aircraft per year." China has lowered its 1994 target for economic growth to between 8 percent and 9 percent from last year's 13 percent. However, the demand for civil aircraft remains brisk, especially with the mushrooming of local airlines. Ye has said that China's imports of aircraft have averaged nearly $2 billion annually over the past several years. China Aviation Supplies Corp, the country's leading trader in aircraft and ground equipment, has imported more than $10 billion worth of aircraft since 1980. The company is the designated main importer of civil aircraft, engines and other equipment, although a number of airlines can buy certain products from overseas by themselves. For example, Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines can import some spare parts through their own trading arms. Economists said China should retain unified management of aircraft imports, although the industry is being decentralized some. Ye said the construction of local spur lines was in full swing, generating a great demand for short- and medium-range aircraft. Many international aircraft makers are vying for sales and local manufacture of their planes. Ye said China would give priority to buying locally-made planes if prices are reasonable. He added that China is choosing appropriate partners for local production of aircraft, but he declined to give details. Ye said competition among foreign companies for a share of China's local airline manufacture is tough. China is one of the world's fastest growing markets for civil aviation, while many developed countries and regions remain bogged down by stagnant economies. Imports of ground equipment will also continue growing, Ye said. Last year China Aviation Supplies Corp signed $3.2 billion worth of contracts for imports of aircraft and related facilities. About $2.5 billion of the goods have been delivered. Ye said the recent normalization of Sino-French relations will help improve China's business with Airbus Industrie. "We will further develop and improve relations with the company in the future," he said. Ye pointed out that if Airbus Industrie completes scheduled deliveries this year, it will have provided China with 17 planes altogether.
