FR940630-0-00104 FR940630-0-00036 Response. The statute is very clear that application of section 3 only extends to HUD housing and community development programs. Comment. A few commenters requested that the rule include a list of HUD programs to which section 3 applies. Response. Because programs to which section 3 applies may change over time (new programs are created, existing programs are terminated), the Department declines to include in the regulation a list of section 3 covered programs. HUD programs that are covered by section 3 will contain reference to applicability of section 3 in their program regulations, guidelines, or notices of funding availability. Additionally, FHEO will attempt to publish annually, at the beginning of each Federal Fiscal Year, a notice in the Federal Register of HUD programs subject to section 3. Comment. One commenter asked that the rule clarify the relationship between part 135 and part 963. Response. Part 963 entitled ``Contracting with Resident-Owned Businesses'' was created before the recent amendments to section 3 by the 1992 Act. Section 3, before the 1992 amendments, while providing a preference for low-income persons, did not give priority consideration to residents of public housing, or to businesses owned by residents of public housing. Accordingly, the purpose of the part 963 program, at the time of creation, was to encourage (not require) PHAs, in their contracting, to award contracts to section 3 business concerns. To a large extent, the new section 3 regulations supersede part 963. Part 135 requires (consistent with section 3) that PHAs give preference in contracting to resident-owned businesses. Part 963 does not require preference in contracting with resident-owned businesses because part 963 is not based on statutory authority that mandates this preference. Part 963 is totally voluntary. Part 963 imposes a monetary cap on the amount of contract that can be awarded to a resident-owned business. (This amount is being increased from $500,000 to $1,000,000 in the conforming amendment rule being published under a separate rule in this edition of the Federal Register .) No monetary cap is imposed by part 135. Contracts covered by part 963 include contracts for the purchase of materials and supplies. Covered contracts under part 135, as discussed earlier in this preamble, do not include contracts for the purchase of materials and supplies because the section 3 statute uses the term ``contract for work.'' Part 963 complements section 3, and provides an effective means by which the section 3 contracting preference can be implemented. Definitions Comment. One commenter stated that the definition of ``business concern'' should include nonprofit enterprises. The commenter stated that nonprofit enterprises frequently are major sources of employment for low-income persons, particularly public housing residents. Response. The Department believes that one of the principal purposes of section 3 is to promote the growth of ``profit-making'' enterprises owned by low-income persons, and that substantially employ low-income persons, and to encourage business concerns that are not major sources of employment for low-income persons to increase their employment of these persons. Comment. One commenter stated that the definition of ``contractor'' was not consistent with the statutory language. The commenter stated that section 915 of the 1992 Act makes clear that section 3 covered contractors are contractors employed by public and Indian housing authorities and by units of local government receiving Federal financial assistance. The commenter stated that the definition for this term should be revised to state that a contractor ``is any entity employed by a public housing authority or a unit of local government to perform work on a section 3 covered project.'' Response. The Department declines to adopt the change recommended by the commenter. The statute does not limit contractors to those employed by HAs or units of local government. The requirements of section 3 attach to covered HUD assistance. The definition for ``contractor'' provided in the rule is consistent with the statute.
