"The report is groundless. A convoy of trucks was used, but only to repatriate Cambodians fleeing the fighting into Thailand," armed forces spokesman Lt Gen Anuson Kritsana-seni said. This was the only instance of a Thai convoy entering Cambodia without the permission of the Cambodian government, he said. Foreign news agencies quoted Ranariddh as saying yesterday that Thailand had helped Pol Pot flee Pailin. "Thailand will not be happy with us but we have pictures to prove it," the prince told reporters during a break in the second session of parliament. "I can show you a picture of Pol Pot, his house being attacked, and Pol Pot escaping with cars and a convoy of trucks driving on a tarmac road inside Thai territory," he was quoted as saying. The prince was adamant that the guerrilla leader escaped through Thai territory. "It was not inside Cambodia. Cambodia does not have such good roads in that region," he said, but did not produce the photographs. Anuson said such an accusation could destroy Thailand's image and insisted that Khmer Rouge leaders would be arrested and repatriated if found on Thai soil. First Army Region Commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo meanwhile said that the Army would fire a warning shot before opening fire should there be any further spillover of refugees into Thailand. Thai officers along the Thai-Cambodian frontier said last week that Thai authorities did not provide refuge to Khmer Rouge forces in the wake of the fighting in Pailin, allowing only civilians to enter Thai territory. Ranariddh meanwhile said his government was keeping the door open for talks with the Khmer Rouge. Reconciliation has been stressed by King Norodom Sihanouk, who on Friday returns to Cambodia from China, where he has undergone treatment for cancer. A Khmer Rouge spokesman in Phnom Penh said the nominal Khmer Rouge leader, Khieu Samphan, would return to the Cambodian capital to pay homage to Sihanouk.
