The second bomb went off at Climat, a store located in the exclusive Zone 9 of this capital. Firemen did not specify the type of explosives used in the attacks, both of which caused considerable damage but no casualties. The attacks were carried out on the Day of Constitutionality, just 24 hours before the peace talks between the government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) are due to resume in Mexico.
