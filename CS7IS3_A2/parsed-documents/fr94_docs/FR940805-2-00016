FR940805-2-00016 FR940805-2-00011 Alternative 2_Proposed Action: This alternative encompasses the activities addressed in Alternative 1 plus other actions necessary to meet environmental, regulatory, and security requirements and other mission objectives that would be taken within the ten years following the Record of Decision. The proposed action includes activities described in the Transition Plan Report to Congress, the Rocky Flats Strategic Plan, actions under discussion in connection with the Rocky Flats Cleanup Agreement that is currently being negotiated, and anticipated activities under the Federal Facility Compliance Act. Examples include, but are not limited to: •Materials management_consolidate all non-waste materials •Waste Management_store onsite and dispose of offsite; pretreat, if necessary •Upgrade buildings to meet the new mission and current regulatory requirements •Economic conversion to transfer buildings or property to private use or ownership •Deactivation of onsite facilities Alternative 3: This alternative assumes that offsite disposal facilities may not be available as envisioned in current plans, and involves programs that would create suitable facilities for prolonged storage of waste and other materials. The onsite activities included in Alternative 2, with the exception of economic conversion, would be encompassed by this alternative plus the construction of onsite facilities suitable for storing nuclear materials and transuranic waste until offsite disposition is available. Low-level waste and mixed wastes would be disposed of onsite. This alternative is consistent with the current mission statement, but involves design and construction of additional prolonged onsite storage and disposal capacity. Preliminary Issues To Be Addressed: The SWEIS will address the impacts of the alternatives to the extent necessary to make a reasoned choice among the alternatives, using available data where possible and by obtaining new data where necessary. In accordance with Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1500.4 and 1502.21), other documents, as appropriate, may be incorporated into the impact analyses by reference, in whole or in part. The following preliminary issues are presented to facilitate public comment on the SWEIS. This presentation is not intended to be all-inclusive nor to be a predetermination of impacts to be considered. 1. Land Use. The SWEIS will consider land use planning issues in consultation with the Citizen's Advisory Board, including economic conversion and potential land use restrictions based on residual contamination levels. 2. Economic Conversion. The impacts of converting buildings onsite and portions of the buffer zone to private sector usage, including the impacts of decontaminating land and buildings for economic conversion. 3. Environmental Restoration. The impacts of environmental restoration activities to remediate past releases to ground water, surface water, sediment, and soils. 4. Waste Management. The impacts of management (treatment, storage, and disposal) of solid and liquid waste, including residues, non-hazardous, hazardous, and mixed transuranic and low-level wastes. 5. Pollution Prevention. The SWEIS will consider appropriate and innovative pollution prevention, waste minimization, and energy and water use reduction technologies, including eliminating or significantly reducing (a) acquisition of unnecessary hazardous substances; and (b) energy, water, and related environmental impacts by promoting use of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. 6. Nuclear Materials. The impacts of storage and management of nuclear materials until their disposition can be determined. 7. Soil, Water, and Air. Potential impacts to soil, water, and air. 8. Sensitive Environmental Resources. Potential impacts to plants, animals, and habitat, including impacts to floodplains, wetlands, and threatened and endangered species and their habitat. 9. Cultural Resources. Potential impacts to cultural resources, such as historic, archaeological, scientific, or other culturally important sites. 10. Socioeconomic. Potential impacts to local and regional socioeconomic conditions and factors, including urban encroachment, employment, housing, tax base, and community infrastructure and services. 11. Environmental Justice. Potential disproportionate impacts of DOE activities on minority or low-income populations. 12. Transportation. Potential impacts on the environment and public health from the on- and off-site transportation of radioactive and/or hazardous materials, equipment, products, and wastes. 13. Public and Occupational Safety and Health. The radiological and non-radiological impacts on workers and the public from routine site operations and potential accidents. 14. Regulatory Compliance. The impacts of the alternatives on compliance of Rocky Flats with applicable Federal and State requirements.
