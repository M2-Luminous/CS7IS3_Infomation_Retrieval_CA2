Comrade Kim Chong-il in the work formulated the basic characteristics of the Korean-style socialism centred on the masses and its superiority, and the source of its durability and invincibility with perfect logic and crystal propositions and gave a comprehensive exposition of all the theoretical and practical questions arising in building true socialism centred on the masses. The article headlined "Famous Work Demonstrating Invincibility of Korean-Style Socialism" says that for their richness, profundity, truth, originality, scientific and revolutionary character the ideologies and theories expounded in the work gave the faith in certain victory to the people in our era who are struggling to achieve the victory of the cause of socialism and are a precious textbook of struggle and life for the revolutionary people. The article says Korean-style socialism centred on the masses is invincible socialism because it applies the great chuche idea and provides the masses with an independent and creative life. It quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: "Because it is the embodiment of the chuche idea, our socialism is a man-centred socialism under which man is the master of everything and everything serves him." The article further says: The basic characteristics and essential advantages of our-style socialism lie in basing on the chuche idea calling for thinking everything centering on the people and for making everything serve them. Today our socialism is victoriously advancing unshaken by any vicious manoeuvres of the imperialists and reactionaries because it is based on and guided by the chuche idea. Socialism is the life and soul of our people whereas the chuche idea is the life and soul of our socialism. The might of our socialism is that of the great chuche idea and as there is the chuche idea, no force can break our socialism. In our country the popular masses are taking part in the political life as masters of the state and society and leading an active and creative life as masters of economic life. Our socialism is indestructible socialism next because the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses has been successfully realized. The work consummates the questions arising in strengthening the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses which is the eternal vitality of our socialism. The party and the leader believe and boundlessly love the people and the people absolutely trust and uphold the party and the leader -- this is the true feature of our singlehearted unity. No force can break the might of our socialism in which the leader, the party and the masses are united singleheartedly. Our people will smash the anti-socialist moves of the imperialists and reactionaries and certainly achieve the final victory of the socialist cause in reliance on the might of the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses.
