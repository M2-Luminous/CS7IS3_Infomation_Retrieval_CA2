[Villegas] I invite all Colombians to vote today, we should go early to the voting tables to vote and elect en mass our future president. In our opinion, whoever occupies the Presidency can do so in a much more legitimate manner, with greater authority, depending on the extent to which a greater number of Colombians vote. The goal is to strengthen democracy, strengthen peace, and strengthen all the values and hopes of the Colombians. The goal is to defeat violence and those who still attempt, through terrorism, to impose their political will on this country. [Reporter] What report do you have on the situation in the nation at the opening of the voting tables? [Villegas] We understand that everything is perfectly normal. Nevertheless, yesterday there were some difficulties in southern Bolivar Department, in the province of [name indistinct] in the Santander Department. These were taken care of by the public forces, the electoral organization, and the local authorities. Early this morning, there were some terrorist actions in Medellin; however, we hope these will not hamper the normal development of the elections. The idea is for Medellin to reaffirm its desire to be a calm capital, as it deserves. One of the ways to do this is to participate in the elections. [Ruiz] Have the two delegates of the contending parties been sent to all the nation's municipalities as they requested? [Villegas] Presidential delegates were sent to each and every department in compliance with one of the mechanisms to give guarantees to the parties that are participating in these elections. Currently these delegates should be in the departments. We expect them to act as overseers of the electoral process and of the performance by the electoral officials, the electoral organization, and the public forces. They are to report to the appropriate authorities all their observations, all the irregularities that they possibly may observe in order to correct them. [Ruiz] Mr. Minister, Dario Arizmendi and our colleagues at Caracol station will now greet you. [passage omitted] [Arizmendi] A few moments ago we talked with Defense Minister Rafael Pardo. He told us that he wanted to study abroad, had sent applications to some universities, and wants to further study contemporary issues. He is most certainly thinking about his future. What will you do after 7 August? [Villegas] That is the big question. I still do not have an answer. [Arizmendi] Would you like a diplomatic post? [Villegas] There is nothing planned yet. We want to conclude a series of actions we have pending at the Government Ministry. One of these is precisely these elections. After that, we will have the time to think over what is more appropriate. [passage omitted]
