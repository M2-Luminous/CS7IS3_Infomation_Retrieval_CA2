He is in anguish over how to handle this problem. Hosokawa made a commitment during his recent talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to urge the PRC to make improvements on the human rights issue. However, there is the danger that President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders might toughen their attitude depending on how Hosokawa talks about this problem. On the other hand, if the prime minister limits himself to roundabout expressions, he may be criticized by the Western nations. The Foreign Ministry is rushing its preparations to have the prime minister ask China to respect human rights in accordance with the universal sense of values existing in the international community. At the meeting of leaders of the government and the ruling parties on 14 March, Hosokawa explained his upcoming China visit in the following terms, "We do not really have any major pending issues." However, after the U.S.-Chinese foreign ministerial meeting in Beijing ended in discord, things have become precarious. While it is not unusual for the United States, which has to decide on renewing most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment for the PRC in June, to push strongly for improvements in China's treatment of human rights, China this time took an unprecedentedly tough position using its "huge market" as a trump card. As for the stand that the prime minister should take during his visit to the PRC, the Foreign Ministry's policy is: While the prime minister will touch on the human rights issue, he will limit himself to circumspect expressions and will not go into concrete issues, such as the detention of prodemocracy activists, nor link this topic with the fourth yen loan. However, it is also reported that "the prime minister seems to be also considering making straightforward demands for improvements on human rights, which were avoided during past Liberal Democratic Party administrations, and making an explicit apology for the past war" (according to the prime minister's close aides). It will take some time for the final position to take shape.
