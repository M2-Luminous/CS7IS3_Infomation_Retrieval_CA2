According to Cai Cheng, vice-chairman of the Law Committee of the National People's Congress, also being prepared are rules and regulations that aim at stepping up protection of foreign economic and technical trade-related intellectual property rights. He said that these will allow customs a still bigger role in preventing goods produced by infringing upon intellectual property rights of others from being shipped out of China. For now, the attention is focused on the "Copyright Law". Cai added that law enforcement bodies will investigate "major and important" cases in cooperation with departments of science, technology, culture, public security, industry and commerce. The legislator cited a recent circular calling for a crackdown on counterfeit compact and laser discs. The circular was issued by the Communist Party Central Committee Propaganda Department and six government organs including the State Planning Commission and the State Press and Publications Administration. In response, Guangdong inspectors shut down 400 CD stalls and 50,000 discs were confiscated along with 3,000 video tapes. The cities of Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Shantou in Guangdong Province are setting up courts to try cases of intellectual property rights violation, in the wake of the establishment of a provincial court of the same type. In addition to the Guangdong Provincial Court, intellectual property rights courts are now operational in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, the booming special economic zone adjacent to Hong Kong. The central government, for its part, will improve its supervision of law enforcement by local authorities. "Problems such as ineffective implementation of laws and too-lenient treatment of law-breakers must be resolved," he said. While the government strives to do its best, Cai said, the non-governmental sector is encouraged to help. Cai was referring to lawyers and auditors as well as professional societies and associations in science, technology and culture. "When organized, these can provide services, including legal consultancy and investigation into complaints," he said. Cai cited the Intel-Protect Services (China) Ltd., a mainland-Hong Kong joint venture established last July, which is China's first and until now only non-governmental agency specializing in protection of intellectual property. One of the company's clients was Hazeline, a British soap producer, which late last year demanded investigation into alleged abuse of its trademark. Last month, IPS inspectors discovered the bootleg producer, a factory in Xiashan Town of Chaoyang City in Guangdong. Upon receiving the IPS report, local police shut down the factory. According to official statistics, an average of 13,000 cases of trademark abuse and counterfeited goods are reported every year, including 500 that directly affect foreign companies. Cai attributed this to the fact that intellectual property protection is still new in China. "But the country is sincere and serious in its effort to improve and will always be," Cai said. He noted that laws and government decrees published so far cover "almost every aspect of intellectual property." The country is now a member of the World Intellectual Property Rights Organization and has acceded to, among others, the Paris Convention on Industrial Property Rights Protection, the Madrid Convention on International Registration of Trademarks and the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. Cai's view is shared by Maria Wai-chu Tam, a Hong Kong barrister-at-law, who is concerned with the mainland's intellectual property protection work. "I'm optimistic," she said. "In just a few years China has made laws to go by and that's no easy task," she said. "The question is how to ensure their full implementation." China is also increasing its international contacts on intellectual property, cai said, citing an international symposium in May, at which Chinese officials and experts will consult their foreign counterparts on how to improve. The symposium will be featured by reports on the current situation and planned improvements in the protection of trademarks, copyrights and patents as well as judicial work, Cai said.
