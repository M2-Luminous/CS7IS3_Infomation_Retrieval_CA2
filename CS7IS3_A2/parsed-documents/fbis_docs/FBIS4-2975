The Vietnamese sent back home today included 51 men, 29 women, 22 boys and 15 girls. This brought to 3,425 the total number of Vietnamese migrants who had returned voluntarily this year, and to 42,038 the total number of returnees since the program started in March 1989. Vietnamese boat people in the detention centers on the territory staged one after another rounds of demonstrations and hunger strikes since the multi-national meeting held in Geneva in February this year passed a proposal on the Vietnamese repatriation. In a conflict at Whitehead Detention Center between Hong Kong police and camp prisoners last week, over 200 Vietnamese were hurt. A total of 557 canisters of tear-gas were reportedly fired at the detention center.
