And the Security Council still has to decide on France's military intervention in Rwanda for "humanitarian" purposes. Although the UN secretary- general is in favor, the proposal has so far met with a mixed response from the Security Council. But France has pushed forward without waiting. Different sources in the Zairian town of Goma, on the Rwandan border, report on the start of a supervised operation on the Zairian side by General Baramoto, a regime hard-liner. A C-130 aircraft has apparently already arrived there with a cargo of vehicles and other flights were expected during the evening and night. There are also reports of air activity in Kisangani. The troops sent to Rwanda have to come from Bangui, in the Central African Republic, Gabon, and Dijibouti. Other reports state that the French have apparently already crossed the border and are now in Cyangugu, where the Kamembe runway has already been repaired as Kigali airport was considered to be impracticable. [passage omitted] This pressure, which threatens to present the Security Council with a fait accompli, cannot be solely explained by the desire to end a genocide which has virtually reached its conclusion. For Paris, it is a question of going to the rescue of soldiers who are still with the government forces. But in addition to these "lost soldiers" who should be able to free themselves from the trap--some of them are West Indian and thus more likely to pass unnoticed--certain sources indicate that France is seeking to recover from the field certain experimental equipment that it was testing in Rwanda and does not want to fall into the hands of the Rwanda Patriotic Front: Light mountain tanks and combat helicopters with about a dozen rockets on each side. According to a source close to the U.S. State Department, the United States is aware that the French operation is a "cover" operation to conceal the rescue of two French groups, one of four people and the other of five, who are with Rwandan Government forces. They apparently want to get these French soldiers out because they "know too much." This source adds that the decision to intervene was made at the presidential level and not by the French Defense Ministry.
