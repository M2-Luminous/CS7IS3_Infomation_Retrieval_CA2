"I started taking pictures when I saw leaflets flying and police running from all directions," said Manuel Ceneta, a photographer from a French news agency. Ceneta said he was covering the ongoing National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People which adjoins the square, and then had his camera taken from him and his film exposed. A similar incident near the Tiananmen gate tower was also reported Monday, but police gathered the leaflets before the contents could be discerned, a witness said. It was not immediately known if the perpetrators of the incidents were detained. Chinese courts normally issue lengthy prison sentences for such actions which are regarded as "inciting counterrevolutionary activities." Also on Monday, KYODO NEWS SERVICE received a letter from an employee of China's diplomatic service company, Gao Hongmin, who stated that on March 21 he planned to distribute political leaflets in Tiananmen Square. Police took Gao away as he left the offices of a Western television company, where he left copies of the leaflet in the early afternoon. Gao's leaflet called for more democracy and for the government to rescind its description of the military crackdown on prodemocracy movement in Tiananmen square in 1989 as "a counterrevolutionary rebellion." China's capital has been a hot bed of political unrest since U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to Beijing 10 days ago and demanded the government to improve its human rights record. Nearly 20 of China's most well-known political dissidents were detained for questioning at that time. Meanwhile, police have also cracked down on protests by elderly victims of Japanese aggression 50 years ago. The protesters began appearing in Beijing before Saturday's visit by Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, with over 100 reported to have been detained. Spring is the traditional season for political protests in China. This spring coincides with the 75th anniversary of the May 4 democracy movement and the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
