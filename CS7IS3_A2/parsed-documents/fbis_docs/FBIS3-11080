"The courts are investigating and that is why I do not want to say anything about it. Period." He said there is nothing extraordinary about a case like this being investigated because this type of investigation occurs routinely. The interior minister called attention to the fact that when he was presidency secretary general, he requested several electronic searches of his and the president's offices. He also acknowledged that when he was in charge of the Office of the Prosecutor General, he would order electronic searches every 10 days because there were too many people who were tempted to listen in on what was being said. He said that one time, the electronic searches discovered a transmission device, but it did not go anywhere specific because it had been discarded for some time. The minister did not want to confirm whether an espionage center connected to La Torre de Las Delicias, the Defense Ministry, and Banco Latino really did exist. "I do not want to comment on that issue because I am waiting for some information." According to the minister, his office constantly has this problem, and this is one reason why electronic searches are routinely conducted. [passage omitted]
