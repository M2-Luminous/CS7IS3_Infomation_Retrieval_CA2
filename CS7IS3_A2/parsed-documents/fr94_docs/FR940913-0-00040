FR940913-0-00040 FR940913-0-00012 UNITED STATES INFORMATION AGENCY 22 CFR Part 514 [Rulemaking No. 102] Camp Counselors; Limitation of Program Participation AGENCY: United States Information Agency. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: By this notice the Agency adopts as final, and without change, the Interim Rule published in the Federal Register on April 11, 1994 (59 FR 16983), which amended 22 CFR 514.30. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule became effective April 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stanley S. Colvin, Assistant General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, room 700, United States Information Agency, 301 4th Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20547, (202) 619&hyph;6829. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 11, 1994, the Agency published in the Federal Register an interim rule with request for comments. The interim rule amended ยง514.30, which governs the administration of camp counselor exchanges conducted under the auspices of the Exchange Visitor Program. Specifically, this amendment permits repeat participation, in excess of two summers, for no more than ten percent of each Agency-designated sponsor's camp counselor exchange participants for a particular exchange year. Despite assertions received by the Agency to the contrary, the designation of exchange visitor sponsors and the administration of the Exchange Visitor Program are deemed to be foreign affairs functions of the Untied States. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)(1989) specifically exempts such functions from the requirements of the Act. Nevertheless, the Agency invited comments from the public on the matter. Three comments were received, all of them favorable. One comment from Camp America noted that the ten percent rule would provide opportunities to the greatest number of participants while minimizing disruption of existing programs. Another, from the Alliance for International Educational and Cultural Exchange, noted that the interim rule adopted a ``reasonable compromise'' to the concerns raised by Alliance members and the American Camping Association, although it noted for the record that camp counselor sponsors did not support the participation limitation for counselors. The Alliance also expressed a reservation regarding the ability of sponsors to ascertain whether an individual has previously participated in any other camp counselor programs, and recommended that the rule be modified to require only that a sponsoring organization be responsible for reporting its own repeat participation rate. Although the Agency is aware that sponsors may not have adequate resources to detect an outright fabrication about program participation by a prospective counselor, it is nevertheless incumbent upon sponsoring organizations to use every reasonable means at their disposal to ascertain that counselor's program participation history. This includes, but is not limited to, informing the counselor of the importance of the participation requirement and explicitly asking potential counselors about prior participation. The information collection requirement of this regulation has been submitted to and approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Agency certifies that this rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is not considered to be a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612. Accordingly, the Interim Rule which amended 22 CFR 514.30, published at 59 FR 16983 on April 11, 1994 is adopted as a Final Rule without change.
