Venkatachalam, associate editor of NATIONAL HERALD: "Indo-U.S. Relations"] [Text] India-U.S. relations have taken some hard knocks of late because of the remarks made by President Bill Clinton and American officials, particularly Ms. Robin L. Raphel, assistant secretary of state, on the sensitive subject of Kashmir. It is a matter of history that in the evolution of Western policy toward the newly independent nations of India and Pakistan, what was proper and legal according to the accepted international law and norms was not always followed. Cold War diplomacy and strategic considerations had their impact on the policy. Over a period of time, however, certain degrees of balance came to be restored in the relationship even before the Cold War ended. The big powers recognized that India has its legitimate national interest and this country on its part gave the benefit of doubt to those who were treading on its toes, conceding that it might not be intentional. The recent U.S. statement questioning the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India may not mean a change in the previous policy formulation as far as the U.S. is concerned. The American utterances, however, come at a time when Pakistan is engaged in a proxy war to destabilize the situation in the area, pursuing the same sterile policies which landed the subcontinent in costly wars in the past, hurting their people. In such a situation, India does not expect friendly nations to queer the pitch for her with statements that exacerbate the situation. For India, or for that matter for any country, it is a serious issue if its sovereignty and unity are questioned. The challenge to the fundamental facts of national existence cannot be glossed over with clarification and explanation. It cannot be that properly equipped foreign offices ignore historical facts. The circumstances in which India's secular policy rejecting the two-nation theory based on religious differences became an integral part of Indian thinking and ethos are too recent to be forgotten. The whole range of Indo-American relations is marked by several positive factors. The two great democracies share so many human values. The potential for mutually beneficial economic and business cooperation is enhanced by India's liberalized economic policies. In the cultural, educational, and technological fields, there are long-standing friendly exchanges. These have to be strengthened at the political level. With due regard to each other's vital interests, it should not be difficult to find solutions to problems arising from the reactivated U.S. policy on Kashmir and the possibility of its supply of some deadly F-16 aircraft to Pakistan which will adversely affect the security situation in the subcontinent. In the present context, it is a matter of satisfaction that there is an awareness of the issues involved and a measure of goodwill for India in responsible sections in the United States. At a recent hearing of the Senate Foreign Policy Committee, American senators were appreciative of India's vital concerns, including those on Kashmir. Some of the senators sharply criticized the administration's handling of South Asian affairs. Those who were critical of the utterances of Ms. Raphel included Senator Hank Brown, Republican; the former U.S. ambassador to India, Mr. Daniel Patrick [Moynihan], Democrat; and Senator Jesse Helms, Republican. Mr. Daniel Patrick [Moynihan] who visited New Delhi last month and had talks with the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, sought to assure India that there is no change in U.S. stand on Kashmir and America believes that the Simla accord provides a sound basis for the amicable settlement of the issue. To the extent that they recognize the need to reassure India of their bona fides, the American explanations and clarifications are welcome. A real concern for India's vital interest, which in no way conflicts with the national interests of other countries, can help in the ironing out of the differences that have cropped up.
