FR941117-0-00216 FR941117-0-00014 3. Preliminary Note The Commission proposed adding a preliminary note to Rule 10b&hyph;10 clarifying that the Rule is not intended as a safe harbor from disclosure obligations imposed by the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. 41 This note is intended to respond to claims made by litigants that Rule 10b&hyph;10 prescribes all the necessary disclosure relevant to a customer's securities transaction. 42 A few commenters addressed the inclusion of the preliminary note to Rule 10b&hyph;10, with equal support for 43 and opposition to 44 the note. One supporter suggested that the Commission could accomplish the same purpose of clarification in an interpretative release. 45 One opponent of the preliminary note argued that its existence would lead to frivolous claims against broker-dealers. 46 41 See Proposing Release, supra note 10, at 59 FR 12772. 42 See, e.g., Shivangi v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 637 F. Supp. 1001 (S.D. Miss. 1986), aff'd, 825 F.2d 885 (5th Cir. 1987); Krome v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 637 F. Supp. 910, 915&hyph;16 (S.D.N.Y. 1986); and Ettinger v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¶93,102 (E.D. Pa. 1986), rev'd, 835 F.2d 1031 (3d Cir. 1987). 43 See, e.g., Letters from Donald E. Walter, Compliance Director/Principal, Edward D. Jones & Co. (July 11, 1993); and Douglas L. Kelly, Director/Law & Compliance Division, A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. (June 13, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. 44 See, e.g., Letters from A.B. Krongard, Chief Executive Officer, Alex. Brown & Sons, Incorporated (July 14, 1994); and Jeffrey Rubin, President, InterCapital Assets, Inc. (June 13, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. 45 Letter from Douglas L. Kelly, Director/Law & Compliance Division, A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 13, 1994). This commenter also suggested that if a note were added to Rule 10b&hyph;10, a similar note also should precede Rule 15c2&hyph;13. At this time, the Commission is not adopting Rule 15c2&hyph;13. 46 Letter from A.B. Krongard, Chief Executive Officer, Alex. Brown & Sons, Incorporated, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (July 14, 1994). After reviewing the comments, the Commission is adopting the preliminary note to Rule 10b&hyph;10. The Commission is not persuaded that the existence of the preliminary note would lead to any additional litigation against broker-dealers. The preliminary note is merely making explicit a longstanding position that the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws may impose, given the circumstances, greater disclosure than what may be required by a specific rule or regulation. 47 47 See supra note 42. One commenter argued that the preliminary note provides no useful guidance because the Commission has not articulated a set of guidelines concerning disclosure requirements in addition to those required in a prospectus and under the Exchange Act. See Letter from Sullivan & Cromwell, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (July 15, 1994), at pp. 2&hyph;3. The Commission does not intend to specify key disclosure items under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Each circumstance is different and determining the materiality of any particular item of disclosure depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. B. Mark-Up and Mark-Downs in Riskless Principal Transactions in Debt Securities The majority of comment letters addressed the proposed amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 and the portion of proposed Rule 15c2&hyph;13 that would require mark-up disclosure of riskless principal trades in debt securities. 48 Generally, most commenters opposed the proposals on the grounds that the requirements would have detrimental effects on competition and market liquidity; would cause compliance difficulties; would create customer confusion; and are not based upon findings of abusive practices in the debt market. 48 Of the 344 comment letters received, 313 addressed the mark-up disclosure proposals. It has been argued by some commenters that greater price transparency in the municipal market could achieve similar goals as riskless principal mark-up disclosure without the alleged negative effects purported to result from mark-up disclosure. 49 Since the proposals were published for comment in March, progress has been made to develop price transparency in the debt markets. In particular, the MSRB has proposed a program that ultimately would provide same day price reporting of all transactions in municipal securities, including same day reporting of retail trades. This program is to be implemented in four phases. As proposed, the first phase of the MSRB program will collect reports of interdealer transactions and make available to the public daily high-low and average price figures for the most frequently traded issues (initially defined as those trading at least four times during the day). 50 These requirements will be expanded in phase two to include institutional customer transactions. The third phase will expand the daily reporting requirements to include retail customer transactions, and phase four will advance reporting times closer in time to the transaction, such as by the end of day or within a specified time period following the trade. In the initial phases of the MSRB's proposal, information regarding the prices and volume of transactions in approximately 80 to 240 issues would be reported each day. As each phase is implemented, the MSRB will review closely this information and system operations, with a view toward reflecting a greater number of issues and transactions in the reports. 49 See, e.g., Letters from A.B. Krongard, Chief Executive Officer, Alex. Brown & Sons, Incorporated (July 14, 1994); James D. McKinney, Partner and Manager of Fixed Income Dept., William Blair & Company (July 13, 1994); Thomas W. Masterson, Chairman, Masterson Moreland Sauer Whisman, Inc. (July 13, 1994); G. Frederick Kasten, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert W. Baird & Co., Incorporated (June 15, 1994); and Rauscher Pierce Refnes, Inc. (June 14, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. 50 To implement phase one, the MSRB, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Exchange Act, has filed with the Commission a proposed rule change to amend Rule G&hyph;14 of the MSRB Rules, which, once approved, will require the reporting of interdealer municipal securities transactions to a designee ( e.g., the National Securities Clearing Corporation) for compilation in a daily report and for use by regulators.
