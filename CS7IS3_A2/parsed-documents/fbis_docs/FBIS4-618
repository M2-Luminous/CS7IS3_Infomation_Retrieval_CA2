Describing the mood at grassroot level as "angry and frightening" SAPU National Secretary Pieter-Don Brandt told a news conference in Pretoria that the TEC's assurance on Tuesday that police members' election period allowances would be trebled to be on par with that of the NPKF had averted a SAPU strike which would have begun on Wednesday. However, widespread dissatisfaction remained about salaries. SAPU grassroot members were bent on striking from Wednesday but SAPU would not back any wildcat action, he said. Such members faced expulsion from the union. There were however still other "selective pressure mechanisms" which would be backed and organised by SAPU during the election period should the salary issue not be addressed. While strikes were for the moment ruled out there was a plan on the table for plackard demonstrations and mass meetings. Other options included American-style "blue flu", where people book off sick en mass. National organiser Bereng Kholoane said: "The salary discrepancies between the police and the NPKF is a slap in our members' faces. "After they (NPKF) had gone on a strike they got better salaries. (SAPU) union members' lives are in danger on a daily basis, they get killed on duty and they don't get half the salaries of the NPKF members." Although memoranda had been submitted to the government and the TEC on grievances, the only official response was a statement by Law and Order Ministry spokesman Craig Kotze that the morale in the police force was not low, Mr Brand said. An issue that would be taken up with the TEC was information that police officials that had been striking in self-governing territories, notably in kwaNdebele, had been given promotion. "This precedent is sending the wrong signal to the force as a whole. It seems that strike actions gets you something," said Mr Brand. This was especially disturbing as these self-governing police forces would soon be integrated into one police force, he added.
