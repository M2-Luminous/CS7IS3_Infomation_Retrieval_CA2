"It is a difficult responsibility that requires a lot of work in light of the uncertainty of the situation in the self-rule areas," said the official who asked not to be named. He added that the reluctance of some nominees to accept offers by the PLO to assume positions of authority in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho was understandable as the task of members of the new Palestinian authority is "nothing to be envied for." Asad 'Abd-al-Rahman, who was offered a position in the new Palestinian authority, told the JORDAN TIMES that he has not yet made up his mind on whether or not to accept the offer. "There is a very thin line between the enthusiasm I feel about the offer and the political suicide I might be committing if I do accept," Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman, who currently heads the 'Abd-al-Hamid Shoman Foundation said. He said fear of political suicide stems from three "legitimate" reasons; the first was the "not-so-promising Israeli attitude." "The Palestinian right to self determination does not seem to be a real concern for the Israelis and there are no guarantees that it will ever be," he explained. The second reason for Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman's reservations is his "lack of confidence in the ability of Western and international communities to convince Israel to ease the pressure off the Palestinians and help them accommodate their needs in the coming stage." "Last but not least," he added, "I have my doubts about the Palestinians' competence in managing, organising and running the self-rule areas in a manner that would meet the expectations of people in the occupied territories." Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman said that he realised that a decision on his part should be taken soon, but that before he makes any decision on the matter, he has to make "a clear cut evaluation of the whole situation." Commenting on the reluctance of other Palestinians leaders to be part of the new Palestinian authority, Ibrahim Qub'ah, a member of the Palestine National Council (PNC), said that in many cases, personal interests rise above national ones. He said that it was every Palestinian's duty to participate in forming and serving the new authority. "All competent politicians should help found the new authority, it is their duty towards their country," Mr. Qub'ah said. Asked whether he would accept such an offer, he said that there were more qualified politicians for the job than he was, but that he will be willing to accept a councilling position in the authority. Mr. Qub'ah added that despite the refusal of very few people to assume leading positions in the future authority, there are unqualified Palestinians seeking high power positions. "I would suggest the opening of training centres for our unqualified young men who will eventually take over." He said that to ensure a solid base for competent authority, a scientific approach should be adopted. "We can train and teach our people the science of management of utilities exactly like we trained the police forces," he added. Salih Ra'fat, a member of the Palestinian Democratic Union (FIDA) said that some leading Palestinians had their political reasons for turning down the offer of participating in the new Palestinian self-rule authority. One such leader, according to Mr. Ra'fat, is Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, who led the Palestinian delegation to the Madrid and Washington talks with Israel. "He (Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi) disagrees with Yasir 'Arafat's ruling methods," Mr. Ra'fat said. FIDA has opposed the self-rule agreement signed in Cairo on May 4 called on the Palestinian people to strive to eliminate the "restrictions imposed on them by the agreement," Mr. Ra'fat said. He added that being part of the new Palestinian authority was one medium to do so and that they (FIDA) would like to see more of their members nominated for leading positions in the new authority. Two FIDA officials, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and Azmi Shu'aybi, have been nominated for the new authority," but we are working on including at least one more FIDA official," Mr. Ra'fat said. He said that he "respected" Hanan 'Ashrawi's decision to decline the appointment in the new authority in order to devote herself and her efforts to the Independent Palestinian Commission for Human Rights, to which she was recently elected as commissioner. "It is only natural for Ms. 'Ashrawi to refuse the offer, for she has chosen the duty of monitoring the performance of the new authority," said Mr. Ra'fat.
