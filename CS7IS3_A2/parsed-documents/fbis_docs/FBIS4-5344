Chairman of the Democratic Party Yi Ki-taek, who was elected chairman of the committee, in his speech at the inaugural ceremony said that the present regime which had revealed its diplomatic incompetency and deceived the people was entirely responsible for the out-of-the-assembly struggle which the opposition party had to wage to check the "National Assembly ratification" of farm market opening. He warned that his party would intensify the all-people struggle if the authorities refused to shelve the signing of the "enforcement schedule of the Uruguay Round accord" and to proceed with the renegotiation of the Uruguay Round results".
