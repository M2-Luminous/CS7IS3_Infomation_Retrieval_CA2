Lithuania does not agree with such a term and is concerned, because Russia is again reproaching for infringements on human rights in the Baltic countries, which does not correspond to reality, says the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry document. Lithuania's reaction followed a statement made by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on Tuesday on Russia's vital interest in the CIS countries and the Baltics, which says that the Baltic states are the zone of Russia's most important interest and Russia need not withdraw its troops from the region. The Russian foreign minister also demanded to legalize double [as heard] citizenship. Only people of the independent Lithuania and power structures supported by them can decide what way of granting citizenship is to be opted for. And any pressure [words indistinct] (?as interference in the Lithuanian internal affairs), according to the statement of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry. The document says that Russia apparently has not given up its military influence in the Baltic states.
