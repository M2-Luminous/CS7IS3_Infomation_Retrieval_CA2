The letter, in particular, indicates that for Belarus, Ukraine ranks second, following Russia, as far as foreign political aspect is concerned, and expresses concern at the state of Ukrainian-Belarusian relations, at the absence of contacts at the top state level, and also absence of proper trade and economic relations. "We are convinced that the state of bilateral cooperation must be considered at the high governmental level in the very near future," believes Volodymyr Zheliba. The letter also says that Ukraine occupies the second place (14.9 percent), following Russia (69 percent), in trade and economic relations with Belarus, however the establishment of a joint trade house has been put off. No agreement has been concluded between the banks on mutual settlements and credit relations. Also, in the opinion of the Belarusian side, the issue of liabilities between our states remains unsettled.
