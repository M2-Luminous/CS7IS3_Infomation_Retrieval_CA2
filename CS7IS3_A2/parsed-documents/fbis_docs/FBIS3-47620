Unlike his predecessor Han Wan-sang, who was criticized for being a "sentimental unification proponent," Yi is voicing his negative opinions on North Korea, especially on human rights conditions there. Yi, 68, seems fully aware of the hardships Han faced during his 10-month-long tenure. Former Unification Minister Han was frequently criticized by conservatives within the government and the National Assembly for his sympathetic posture toward the North and was finally dropped from the new cabinet lineup. "So far, the new deputy prime minister is doing a fine job, coordinating the views of the NUB, the Foreign Ministry, and the Agency for National Security Planning on inter-Korean issues," an NUB official said. Opposition lawmakers and some government officials, however, expressed deep concern over Yi's hard-line stance on North Korea, especially concerning his recent remarks on the North Korean human rights situation. Early this month, Yi told reporters that it's about time North Korea recognized universal values, such as respect for human rights and welfare, raising the possibility that Seoul will take up the matter when inter-Korean dialogue resumes. "North Korea must also ride the global trend of reconciliation and co-prosperity, and for this we must tell the North Koreans things that may sound harsh to their ears," Yi said firmly in his first message to the public as unification minister. Noting that the most important human rights problem facing both South and North Korea is the issue of separated family members, he said it is shameful for all Koreans that these people still do not know whether their beloved are alive or not. "Meetings alone are no longer enough, we must make this relationship move forward to a higher goal," he said. "If they don't agree on our principle, we won't respond unconditionally to their proposal for a meeting." Since then, Yi has faced sharp criticism from opposition lawmakers and the press, who fear his remarks might over-shadow the ongoing nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang, now seemingly near a conclusion. Rep. Cho Sun-sung of the main opposition Democratic Party, a well-known expert on international affairs, accused Yi of having "acted counter to common sense" by making the remarks, that would be of no help for improving South-North relations at this sensitive time. Rep. Han Kwang-ok, a member of the party Supreme Council, asserted that Yi's statement put in doubt his desire to achieve national unification. Yi again echoed the importance of change on the part of North Korea Jan. 11. During his visit at the Office of Five Provinces of North Korea, located in downtown Seoul, he asserted that it is high time for the North to change. "Unification will be realized only after North Korea becomes different," he said. Yi further said if he met North Koreans in near future, he would describe to them the future unified Korea with respect for personal rights, guarantee of freedom and flow of justice, and ask them to make efforts to achieve making it. The NUB under Yi's leadership is reportedly studying multi-prong ways to address to the human rights conditions of North Korea step by step in the future. In initial stage, according to the NUB sources, the government plans to call for improved human rights conditions in the North in cooperation with international human rights organization like the Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Through these organizations, Seoul would ask Pyongyang to allow, for example, visits by human rights inspectors and to stop torture and all other forms of maltreatment of prisoners. On this stage, efforts could be made to resolve the dispersed family question on a priority basis without linking it to political questions, the sources said. But some NUB officials complained the new unification minister puts "too much emphasis" upon the resolution of the dispersed families problem. They feared that the NUB might end up as an agency dealing with personnel and commodities exchanges between the two sides, if Yi continues such policy. They say that Yi, a native of Kang-so, South Pyongan Province, now in North Korea, who himself was separated from his family during the 1950-53 Korean War, appears too personally involved with the dispersed family issue. Taking issue with Yi's recent remarks, North Korea strongly warned Jan. 7 that inter-Korean relations will fall into critical condition if Unification Minister Yi repeats such remarks. North Korea insisted that the South has tried to heat up confrontation between the South and the North by newly raising the issue of human rights in North Korea. It even threatened that the new unification minister of the South will never be allowed to set foot inside the North. Estimates on Yi's moves may vary but most people seem to agree the human rights situations in North Korea would be a main topic in inter-Korean negotiations in the not too distant future.
