Cathy Kellos reports the Mexican consul general has released a statement on the incident. The statement reads that: [Begin Kellos recording] Judging from the graffiti and posters left after the overnight attack, those responsible must have acted in solidarity with the indigenous peasant group that emerged on New Year's Day in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. But representatives say they are perplexed by the incident because the Mexican Government is taking measures to find a peaceful solution to the situation. Among the steps taken: The president of Mexico has decreed a unilateral cease-fire and has appointed a commissioner to negotiate with the group. The consulate says it has not received any threat or communication by anyone prior to this incident. [end recording]
