Parlacen President Jose Guerrero, who is a Salvadoran citizen, responded bitterly to the U.S. initiative, arguing that it goes against international agreements on the right to political asylum. Last week, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] announced the U.S. Government's intention to charge a fee to people who request political asylum to reduce INS expenses. The INS currently has more than 360,000 pending asylum requests. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno explained a few days ago that the fee will only be charged to those people who can afford to pay it and that it will not be mandatory. Nevertheless, the Parlacen president asserted, "To charge for political asylum is to exploit and profit from a human right we all have." Guerrero called the U.S. Government initiative "illogical," noting that it is being implemented "now in the 1990's, when there is a worldwide effort to strengthen human rights." Guerrero stressed that the United States will be the only country in the world charging for political asylum if the measure goes into effect. Gregg Breyer, the national director of the INS Asylum Office, has reported that his office is "flooded" with false petitions for political asylum and that petitioners know the chances are slim they will be deported.
