The guerrilla movements have now surfaced as a formidable enemy. They say they are willing to fight the subversives. It took one whole day, traveling along dirt roads, canoeing along the Catatumbo river, and cutting through the jungle to get to the villages of the Caricacha Buquira tribe of the Motilones Bari Indians. Almost 300 Indians, whose ancestors go back some 500 years, base their economy on fishing, coffee, cocoa, yucca, and wild fruits. "TV Today" came here after hearing about reports made by 16 Indian communities. The Motilones are angry with the guerrillas and the white settlers, who have moved onto their historically defined reservations.

The guerrillas have contaminated the river with oil, and there have been no fish in the river for the last few years. Fish are the basis of our diet. [end recording] The Indians filed a complaint against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the Army of National Liberation. Although there have been no clashes up to now, the Motilones Bari Indians threatened to burn the coca plantations they find on their lands. There are almost 4,000 Indians living all over the Catatumbo region who would enforce this request by the Motilones if the government representatives do not offer any solutions to the problem.
