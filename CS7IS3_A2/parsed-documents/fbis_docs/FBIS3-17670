The parliamentary press service told BNS the principal objective of the Latvian delegation was to coordinate positions on key questions of the Estonian-Russian and the Latvian-Russian negotiations. Latvia and Russia initialed an agreement on military pensioners that perplexed Estonian politicians. Since the troop withdrawal agreements must be ratified in the parliament, the Latvian Saeima delegation wanted to find out Estonia's standpoint on the pensioners' issue. In Nugis' opinion, the Latvian MPs "would have liked to take advantage of Estonia's critical position to build up a similar attitude in the Latvian parliament." Nugis stated, however, that Estonia will not officially condemn Latvia's position. "This is Latvia's domestic issue, but we don't rule out that it may complicate the future course of Estonian-Russian negotiations," Nugis said. "Estonia, however, is not going to change its position or make any concessions on this issue," the parliament speaker emphasized. In Nugis' words, the standpoints of the Estonian delegation for talks with Russia are consistent with the aliens law, which regulates also the problems of social guarantees for the retired Russian military, and the citizenship law. "Latvia at present lacks analogous legislation," Nugis noted. The Latvian Saeima delegation met also with Prime Minister Mart Laar and Rein Helme, chairman of the parliamentary National Defense Commission. The delegation included Maris Budovskis, chairman of the Saeima Credentials Committee and the Baltic Assembly Presidium; Juris Sinka, chairman of the Baltic Assembly foreign affairs committee and a member of the Latvian delegation for talks with Russia; Romans Apsitis, a member of the Saeima Law Enforcement Commission; and Baltic Assembly secretary Ance Anteniske. The meeting between the Latvian delegation and Nugis touched on the next session of the Baltic Assembly scheduled for May in Riga, as well as the initialing and ratifying of a cooperation agreement between the Baltic Assembly and the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg).
