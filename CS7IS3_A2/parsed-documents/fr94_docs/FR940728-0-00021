FR940728-0-00021 FR940728-0-00008 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AAL&hyph;05] Modification of Class D Airspace and Establishment of Class E Airspace, Adak, Anchorage Merrill Field, Bethel, Juneau, Kenai, King Salmon, and Kodiak, AK agency: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. action: Final rule; correction. summary: This document contains corrections to the final rule published on May 6, 1994. This final rule modified the Class D airspace areas at Adak, Anchorage Merrill Field, Bethel, Juneau, Kenai, King Salmon, and Kodiak, AK, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action established Class E airspace at these areas when the associated control tower was closed. This action will correct these Class E airspace descriptions to reflect that they extend upward from the surface to the overlying or adjacent controlled airspace. effective date: July 28, 1994. for further information contact: Robert C. Durand, System Management Branch, AAL&hyph;531, Federal Aviation Administration, 222 West 7th Avenue # 14, Anchorage, AK 99513&hyph;7587; telephone number: (907) 271&hyph;5898. supplementary information: On April 26, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule that modified the Class D airspace areas at Adak, Anchorage Merrill Field, Bethel, Juneau, Kenai, King Salmon, and Kodiak, AK, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action also established Class E airspace at these areas when the associated control tower is closed (59 FR 23621; May 6, 1994). The FAA inadvertently modified the Class E airspace designation by including an altitude in feet MSL above the surface. This correction will allow the Class E area's to extend upward from the surface to the overlying or adjacent controlled airspace.
