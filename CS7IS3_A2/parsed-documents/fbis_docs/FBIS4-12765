Local Arabs told our correspondent Moti Amir that soldiers opened fire at stonethrowers who attacked Israeli cars driving on the Ramallah-Nabulus road. According to them, the youngster was hit by the fire and died at the Ramallah hospital. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is looking into the circumstances of the incident. A youngster from the Dayr al-Balah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip was arrested near the industrial zone at the Erez checkpoint. He was carrying a knife and a Koran. An initial check revealed that he had been on his way to stab soldiers stationed at the checkpoint. At noon today, IDF troops demolished a building in which armed Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorists were believed to be barricaded. The house was surrounded early this morning, and the IDF imposed a curfew on Ramallah. The security forces tried for a long time to make the terrorists surrender. In the last few hours, Fatah members phoned Tunis to inform Yasir 'Arafat that the IDF had laid siege to the house of Dr. al-Wahidi, a Fatah member and a personal acquaintance of 'Arafat. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that IDF bulldozers demolished the house after all its inhabitants were taken out and after the terrorists were urged several times to come out and surrender. Our correspondent points out that Dr. al-Wahidi is the father of the terrorist Avir al-Wahidi. She was arrested about a year ago for taking part in the murder of Israelis.
