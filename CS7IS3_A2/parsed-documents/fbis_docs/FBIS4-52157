Saito told a press conference that the Japanese Government told the countries on Saturday about the contents of a news conference by Nagano in which he retracted earlier remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication. Japan also informed the countries of the contents of a separate press conference in Brussels by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in which the premier said he regretted Nagano's statements, he said. Nagano resigned on Saturday. The Japanese Government is currently considering whether further diplomatic measures are necessary to cope with criticism by Asian nations, Saito said. Saito said that Nagano's remarks were regrettable because it may result, even temporarily, in misunderstandings by other nations of Japan's position on its wartime activities. Former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa offered a frank apology for Japan's wartime aggression last August when he assumed the premiership. Nagano said last week that the Nanjing incident was a fabrication and that he still thinks it wrong to define the war as a war of aggression. His remarks touched off a wave of protest from Asian nations.
