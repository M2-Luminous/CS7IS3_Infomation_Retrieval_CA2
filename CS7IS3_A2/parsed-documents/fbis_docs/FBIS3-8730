For many months he has been trying to mediate peace treaties between inimical parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He is one of the most competent people to estimate, based on his own experience, the progress in the efforts at putting an end to the war in former Yugoslavia. Stoltenberg gave an interview to MLADA FRONTA DNES on this subject. [Palata] Mr. Stoltenberg, how do you evaluate the most recent peace agreement concluded between Zagreb and the Bosnian Muslims and Croats in Washington? [Stoltenberg] The Washington treaty is an interesting and important step in the right direction. I believe that the Muslims and Croats have embarked on the right road. They selected the correct time for this, and the document they signed is a very good basis for the peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Palata] Has the end of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina come any closer after the signing of the treaty? [Stoltenberg] I hope so. It seems to me that a new situation has arisen. Lord Owen and I have worked long and hard toward our goal, toward which the peace efforts must be aimed. Now, this may have succeeded, let us hope. The European Union took the initiative before Christmas. Now, the United States and Russia have also joined in. I do not believe that it would be possible to arrive at the final goal without the European Union, Washington, and Moscow cooperating together. [Palata] Does the treaty between the Croats and Muslims mean the end of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state? [Stoltenberg] No, certainly not. [Palata] Do you still believe that it would be possible to reestablish the country within its former borders? [Stoltenberg] Yes. No peace efforts can solve everything, however. For a long time we have been failing to find a solution without imposing an ultimatum. We have nine theoretical models here, which look different in the field and different when you view them from a negotiating table. They cannot be implemented without an agreement between the parties at war. We cannot force people to live together. Look at the Middle East. Despite the treaties that have been concluded, the situation still depends on whether certain people are able to live together. [Stoltenberg] Does the Geneva Peace Plan of the European Union have any importance after the agreement has been signed in Washington? [Palata] The Washington agreement is a basis for fulfilling the action plan. When you look simultaneously at the plan and at the agreement concluded in the U.S. capital you will see that they are based on the same principle. Moreover, the European Union has participated actively in drafting the Muslim-Croatian treaty.
