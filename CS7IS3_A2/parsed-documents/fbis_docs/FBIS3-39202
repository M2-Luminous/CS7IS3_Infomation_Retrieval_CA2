But at Commons question time he ruled out the use of ground troops in other areas of strife-torn former Yugoslavia as "not a practical proposition." Mr Major said there would be renewed diplomatic efforts to end the conflict following the NATO ultimatum. "No course in Bosnia is free of risks. That has been the case from the beginning and it is now," he admitted. But to do nothing in the face of mortar attacks on Sarajevo was not an option. Shortly after, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, reporting to MPs on the latest NATO initiative, said: "No one would pretend this was an easy decision. The risks are clear. So are the advantages if it succeeds." He called on the Bosnian Serbs to respond: "Their aims cannot be achieved on the battlefield nor by killing and mutilating civilians." [passage omitted] Mr Major said the measures agreed yesterday were intended "primarily to reinforce the peace process." He said: "There will be renewed diplomatic efforts to encourage all sides to reach agreement and stick to it. But I do not myself believe that doing nothing in the circumstances that have now arisen is an option that would be right for this House to adopt, or right for NATO. We do not favour purely punitive action. Force should not be used unless it is genuinely necessary and helps the chance of a peaceful settlement." Mr Major said NATO had warned all sides to cease the bombardment of Sarajevo. It has taken specific and carefully constructed decisions to reinforce the efforts of commanders on the ground. But the objective is to help the civilian population without changing the character of the UN role." Later he told Calum Macdonald (Lab Western Isles) that there was no "feasible or certain means of resolving the problem from outside. But the NATO decision of yesterday will put all parties under heavier pressure to stop the bombardment and make peace." Mr Macdonald said there could be no moral or logical justification for distinguishing betwen Sarajevo and other "safe areas" in Bosnia. "Will you undertake to work to extend the ultimatum issued in respect of Sarajevo to other safe areas?" he demanded. The Prime Minister replied: "We have to determine what is practical. To follow to its logical conclusion the concern you have set out would involve us becoming involved, very probably, with troops on the ground right across the whole area of the conflict. However strongly you may feel about the matter, that is not a practical proposition." In his statement, Mr Hurd told the House that the war would not end by military victory. He added: "A lasting settlement cannot be imposed. It can only be achieved by agreement between the parties." The Government now looked to the parties involved in the conflict, particularly the Bosnian Serbs, to respond. He insisted: "Their aims cannot be achieved on the battlefield, nor by killing and mutilating civilians. They should end the siege of Sarajevo to hand it over to UN administration. Such an agreement would mark a real step towards peaceful settlement." On NATO's move, Mr Hurd added: "No one would pretend that this was an easy decision. The risks are clear -- so are the advantages if it succeeds." It was the job of government "to test and retest options of this kind," said the Foreign Secretary. There is a strong British interest in maintaining the strength and solidarity of NATO. "In Bosnia, our interest lies in preventing the war from spreading, in helping forward the work for a peace settlement and in relieving the suffering of the Bosnian people. We judge that these interests are best sustained by supporting the NATO decision and working for its success."
