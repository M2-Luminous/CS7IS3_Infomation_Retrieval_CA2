At a press conference to mark the end of the two-day heads of state summit, he said the committee would deal with African conflicts at ambassadorial, ministerial and summit levels. It would implement an early-warning system to identify potential flashpoints and introduce measures to manage and resolve conflicts throughout the continent. Other African states serving on the committee are Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Mauritius, Benin, Chad, Egypt and Ethiopia. Dr Salim said the mechanism, established in Cairo last year, needed financial support to function efficiently. He said conflict resolution and peace-keeping had enjoyed a high priority in the leaders' summit. "There was a clear determination to see an end to the conflicts plagueing Africa. This culminated in the significant achievement of the agreement by both parties in the Rwanda conflict to introduce an immediate ceasefire." Dr Salim said the Rwanda Government and rebel forces were both committed to ending the devastating civil war and allowing the United Nations troops to provide protection and humanitarian assistance to refugees displaced by the conflict. Zimbabwe, Ghana, Ethiopia, Senegal and Zambia have each contributed a batallion of 800 men to the UN mission in Rwanda while Mali, Nigeria and Congo would send about 100 soldiers each. South Africa had pledged humanitarian assistance and possibly logistical support in the form of approved personnel carriers. Dr Salim also praised South Africa for paying its OAU membership subscription in full and called on member states who are in arrears to emulate their example. He said the best contribution South Africa could make to Africa was to remain a united, stable and peaceful society. In the long term, South Africa would contribute significantly to the OAU and Africa, particularly in the sub-continent. "We can expect South Africa in the future to play a major economic, political and security role in the continent," he said.
