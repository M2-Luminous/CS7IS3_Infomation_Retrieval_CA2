Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet presided over the meeting. On behalf of the prime minister, Minister and Director of the Government Office Le Xuan Trinh presented a report on the results of the government's activities during the first quarter of 1994 and on a number of top priority tasks for the second quarter of the year. Interior Minister Bui Thien Ngo briefed the participants on the situation concerning corruption and on the results of the anticorruption campaign. Finance Minister Ho Te presented a report on the movement for thrift. Trade Minister Le Van Triet briefed the participants on the situation concerning smuggling and antismuggling activities. The participants unanimously concurred that during the first quarter of 1994, in overseeing and managing state affairs, the government focused its efforts on key tasks and scored many results. Prompt efforts were made to grasp the opportunities offered by the outside world. Continued progress was made when it comes to balancing the state budget, mobilizing capital, and making payments. There was no indications of unexpected price increases. The industrial production continued to expand at a rate of more than 10 percent. Generally speaking, the socioeconomic development continued to bring about positive and steady results. In the meantime, efforts were made to improve the quality of cultural, social welfare, information, public health, and educational services. All those achievements have created a new momentum for the movement against social vices. Vigorous efforts were also made to step up diplomatic and external economic relations as well as firmly maintain political stability and public security and order. Prompted by a high sense of responsibility toward the people and the implementation of the National Assembly's resolutions, members of the government seriously examined the shortcomings and weaknesses they displayed in handling national affairs, especially in overseeing and directing the implementation of resolutions and directives of the National Assembly and the government. The ministers analyzed difficult problems in many fields, including the generation of capital for production promotion, reception of foreign investment capital, financial management, handling of budget overspending, and so forth. On pre-Tet and Lunar New Year's Days, positive steps were taken to deal with corruption, smuggling, and extravagance as well as encourage everyone to practice thrift. Nonetheless, only limited results were recorded. Extravagance remained rampant. Social vices continued to develop to a serious degree in some areas. Slow efforts were made to improve the administrative apparatus and administrative procedures. The government devoted much time to discussing and deciding on top priority issues to be resolved in the second quarter of 1994. For example, it is necessary for ministries, sectors, and localities to seriously implement the prime minister's directives on a number of tasks as follows: It is important to formulate plans to initiate the movement for thrift and against extravagance, work out measures to establish the capital market and draw investment capital for planned projects, make preparations for the stock market, take steps to perfect guidelines to the implementation of the local investment promotion law, prepare a draft law on tax reform, renovate the book- keeping system, apply the auditing system, regulate the currency exchange rate system and foreign currency control regulations, zone off targeted areas for economic development projects and other projects involving key sectors, prepare and adopt plans for the use of ODA[overseas development aid]-provided funds for the 1994-95 two-year period and the ensuing years, and accelerate the administrative reform program. Particularly, it is necessary to take resolute and urgent measures to improve administrative procedures. Also during this session, the government reviewed and adopted a number of draft laws and draft regulations to be submitted to the National Assembly Standing Committee. They include the draft law on amending or supplementing the law on military service, the regulations on the income tax to be levied against high-income earners, and the regulations on the rights and duties which go with the use of land in Vietnam by foreign organizations or foreign nationals. Speaking on this occasion, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet emphatically said: Because of their sense of duty toward the people and the National Assembly, all members of the government must review the ways they handle affairs falling under their responsibilities, intensify supervision and control workd a step further, and discover and take timely action against violations. It is necessary for all ministers to uphold the sense of responsibility toward the campaign against corruption, smuggling, and extravagance. It is important for them to exert tight control over budget revenue and spending, practice thrift, and renovate the financial and accounting management mechanisms to make them consistent with the new situation. It is imperative for all ministries and sectors to review budget revenue and spending sources, and adopt measures to increase budget revenue and do away with all indications of extravagance. The prime minister urged all ministries and sectors to remain sensitive to market demands, work out policies and mechanisms to stimulate production and make it appeal to the taste of local consumers, thereby effectively contributing to getting rid of smuggling activities. The government stressed: As far as the second quarter of 1994 is concerned, it is necessary to focus efforts on applying five major measures aimed at increasing budget revenue, stabilizing currency exchange rates, attracting foreign investment capital, carrying on the movement for thrift and against extravagance and smuggling, intensifying the administrative reform program a step further, and stepping up project implementation direction and project quality control work, thereby contributing to successfully implementing the seven groups of major tasks that the Government has set forth for the year 1994.
