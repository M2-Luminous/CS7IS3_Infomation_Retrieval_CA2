Shilina, Kiev State University; UDC 579.841.11] [Abstract] The broad range of human diseases caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well various plant and animal ailments induced by numerous pathogenic factors in the pseudomonads, primarily enzymes with a toxic effect, and the resulting immunodeficiency prompted a study of the immunosuppressive action of Pseudomonas aeruginosa extracts with respect to the cell immune response and an attempt to find the origin of the immunosuppressive factors. To this end, typical Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains separated from the sputum of pneumonia patients (Nos. 140 and 3,990) and strains which had been cultivated for a long time in nutrient media under lab conditions (Nos. 1,961 and U-1) were examined. In so doing, the effect of water-phenol, trichloracetic, and salt extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the delayed hypersensitivity of mice to the guinea pig antigen is studied. The study reveals that the salt extracts of the wild strains contain thermostable immunosuppressive factors of a lipid origin with a high mass (over 800 kD) which may be inactivated by trichloracetic acid and phenol. On the other hand, salt extracts of museum strains as well as water and phenol trichloracetic extracts produced from wild and museum bacteria strains do not display immunosuppressive activity. It is speculated that these factors may be a pseudomonad lipopolysachharide component and that the biological properties of pseudomonads are not related to impairments of the oxygen-dependent processes in macrophages.
