In the words of Professor Ruberti, the JRC's Institute for Prospective Technological Studies is a key component of the mechanism being set up by the Commission for the study and monitoring of developments in science and technology and for the assessment of research policy options. The institute, whose mission is to provide the Community and other European authorities with objective data and analyses on the broad trends in science and technology in Europe and the world, will work in close liaison with the organizations specializing in prospective studies and technology surveillance within the ETAN network set up in the framework of the future Programme of Targeted Socio-Economic Research under the European Union's fourth Framework Programme of RTD [research and technological development] (1994-98). At the same time as the establishment agreement was signed, the IPTS and Seville University signed a collaboration agreement. In addition, a European economic interest grouping (EEIG) composed of the IPTS and undertakings from several European countries will be created. The Cartuja site's role as a regional centre for research, technology and innovation will be further enhanced by the installation in the near future of Spain's Scientific Research Council next to the IPTS. The IPTS is one of the eight institutes of the Joint Research Centre. These institutes, each of which is specialized in a particular field (environment, remote sensing, advanced materials, etc.), conduct part of their activities under the specific programmes of the Framework Programme of RTD. They also provide scientific and technical support for the implementation of the Community's major policies in the field of the environment, energy, agriculture, etc. In the coming years, the IPTS will set up a "European Science and Technology Observatory." This observatory, working in liaison with the equivalent bodies at national and European level, will be charged with collecting, processing and disseminating information on research and technological development policies in the industrialized countries, and their evolution. In addition, a technology monitoring system will be developed to detect new scientific breakthroughs and technological innovations at an early stage, and to draw them to the attention of community policymakers.
