FR940907-2-00012 FR940907-2-00002 In applying for any of the proposed programs, a commercial fisherman must submit documentation, including salary, earnings, or crew-share statements and affidavits that demonstrate eligibility. NMFS believes the proposed eligibility criteria are reasonable. Two studies that produced socio-economic profiles on non-tribal Oregon trollers and California fishermen (the majority of which were salmon fishermen) for 1988 found: The average commercial fisherman received 34 to 56 percent of total family income from salmon fishing; total family income ranged from $50,000 to $54,000; 78 to 82 percent were married; if married, there were 2.8 children to support, with less than 50 percent of their spouses working; and West Coast salmon fishermen had a weekly income of $1,200 to $1,500 from salmon landings. Oregon trollers who fish in Alaska may earn 45 percent of their income from Alaskan salmon. The percentage of trollers who fish off Alaska is not available. A third study showed that more than one-third of the Washington fleet may have Alaskan salmon permits. This fleet appears to harvest off Alaska two to three times the value of the entire Washington State commercial landings, based on a review of 1985 and 1988 statistics. The proposed criteria also appear reasonable based on an analysis of fish ticket data for non-tribal and non-charterboat vessels for all species of fish landed in California, Washington, and Oregon. Of the 12,009 vessels that earned at least $1 in any of the years 1986 through 1993, only 2,879 appear to meet the proposed eligibility criteria. During 1993, these vessels collectively earned $9 million in West Coast salmon revenues, averaging almost $4,000 each, compared to a peak year average of $24,268. Data on non-fishing and Alaska fishing income are unavailable, but, when that income is included, it is expected to reduce the number of vessels that would meet the proposed eligibility criteria below 2,879. Assuming that crew size for trollers and gillnetters averages 1.4 crew members per vessel, potentially 4,700 fishermen may be eligible for the jobs program under the first four proposed criteria. Approximately 519 charterboats are licensed in Washington, Oregon, and California. If charterboats have an average crew size of 2.4, approximately 1,200 individuals could potentially apply for aid. California charterboats have been classified as either active_those that landed more than 100 salmon, or casual_those that landed from 1 to 100 salmon. Based on 1993 landings, 47 percent of the California charterboat fleet was designated casual. If casual charterboats are not likely to meet the proposed eligibility criteria, then applying the 53-percent estimate for active charterboats to the entire charterboat fleet within the area of the fishery disaster suggests that approximately 600 charterboat operators and crew members may be eligible to receive financial assistance under the proposed NEAP program. In Washington State, 2,000 tribal fishermen made landings in 1993, compared to 3,000 in 1990. This decline is largely attributed to salmon fishery closures. The current tribal population is approximately 17,500. Information supplied by the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission suggests that tribal revenues from salmon catches in Puget Sound declined by $13 million, comparing averages for 1990&hyph;92 to 1993. According to 1990 Bureau of Census data, Native Americans in the State of Washington had an average per-capita income of $6,646 in 1990. Tribal salmon catches in the other states indicate that there may be fewer than 500 additional tribal fishermen along the remaining coast. This is an uncertain estimate; NMFS specifically requests information on tribal participation in commercial salmon fisheries in response to this notice. V. Program and State Funding Targets NMFS anticipates that the proposed NEAP program would result in the following distribution of available financial assistance among the affected states and programs: 55 percent of available funds would be distributed to the State of Washington and 22.5 percent of available funds would be distributed to each of the States of Oregon and California.
