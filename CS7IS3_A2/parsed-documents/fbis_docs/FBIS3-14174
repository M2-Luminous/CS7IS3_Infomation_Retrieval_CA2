Informed sources have confirmed that the security authorities arrested hundreds of people in a major combing operation and that the detainees included a number of mullahs opposed to the government in Tehran, Shiraz, and Tabriz. According to some other reports, the current Revolutionary Guard exercises in the Gulf will now be reduced to only four days instead of the seven days originally scheduled. The sources did not say why that decision was made. An official source has strongly denied opposition claims that 25 armed clashes occurred recently in which about 300 Revolutionary Guard members were killed or wounded. The sources said that most of the detained mullahs are supporters of Ayatollah Mir Mohammad Rowhani and Ayatollah Hoseyn 'Ali Montazeri, both serious candidates for the Shiite leadership. [passage omitted] The government had some good news yesterday. It announced that it had reached agreements with Austria and Switzerland for the rescheduling of $1.2 billion of debts. Iran has also concluded a similar agreement with Germany for the rescheduling of $3 billion of debts. Current talks with Japan for the rescheduling of $1.4 billion are close to conclusion. Furthermore, India and China have agreed to hold negotiations for the rescheduling of Iran's debts. That is in addition to talks with 22 creditor countries from Malaysia to Brazil. Iran's short-term debts are estimated at $9 billion and its total foreign debts are believed to be $30 billion.
