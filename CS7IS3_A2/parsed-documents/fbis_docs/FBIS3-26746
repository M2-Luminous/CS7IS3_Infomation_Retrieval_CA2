The bidding is opened to both domestic and foreign firms, as long as they are a member of a related import and export association or foreign investment society. Bidding methods for these export quotas will be announced shortly. Commodities for which these methods provide an export quota are those announced by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC]. The quotas will be granted to enterprises that are members of business associations. Firms that are not members of any business association are not eligible to apply. Other provisions of these methods are: MOFTEC will be responsible for supervising and guiding the bidding. It determines the commodities to which bidding is applicable and will set up a special bidding committee to take charge of bidding for commodity export quotas. The bidding committee will be comprised of MOFTEC leading officials and related import and export associations. Specific work for export quota bidding will be done by related import and export associations. The bidding committee will set up a commodity bidding office at the related association to handle day-to-day affairs. The number of biddings will depend on each specific commodity. In principle, bidding will be held twice a year, each session one quarter ahead of the effective date. The bidding committee will designate specific news media to announce bidding notices. According to the provisions, import and export companies with MOFTEC-issued foreign trade licenses and membership in a related import and export association or a foreign investment society, manufacturing enterprises (limited to self-manufactured products), and foreign-invested enterprises (limited to self-manufactured products) are eligible to apply. According to the provisions, firms participating in bidding must fill out a "bidding application form" issued by the bidding office, and mail it in a sealed envelope or have it delivered to the bidding office. The day the bidding office receives the application is counted as the date of receipt. Names of the enterprises awarded quotas will be announced by news media appointed by the bidding committee. Provisions also specify that with the concurrence of the bidding committee, the bidding office reserves the power to revoke the bidding right for the following year of any enterprise that fails to make use of, transfer, or return the quota awarded it within a specified time. Quota-winning enterprises will be deprived of their right to bid for export quotas in the following year if it is found and established as true that they have transferred the awarded quota to another party without permission from the bidding office. If the export price of the commodities of an quota-awarded enterprise is lower than the coordinated price set by a related business association, the enterprise will be barred from bidding for that commodity for three years. Regarding improving and perfecting voluntary quota management, quotas for a single market will come under a regional quota management scheme for individual countries, which in turn is subordinate to a global quota distribution plan.
