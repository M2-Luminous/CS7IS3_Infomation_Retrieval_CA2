Likewise, 53 of the people who stayed in the Belgian ambassador's residence have returned to their homes after ending their illegal and irresponsible action. Right now, the German Embassy is still occupied by 21 people, and another 72 remain at the Belgian Embassy. All of them have this option: Abandon your irresponsible plan or condemn yourslves to remain for life under a roof which will be a voluntary cell. No one will attain, at any time, authorization to emigrate through violence and violation of Cuban laws and international legislation. Those citizens wishing to leave Cuba for diverse reasons which range from family, personal, and economic matters, to simple adventure, have been the object of a clumsy political manipulation, which is condemned to complete failure like all those contrived in over three decades of ravenous efforts against the Cuban Revolution. The Cuban authorities, as a goodwill gesture toward the nations with which it maintains diplomatic and friendly relations, have extended every recourse to the representatives of the embassies involved to solve the conflict in which they have found themselves entangled. Repeating: Only through work, intelligence, serenity, and intransigence can incidents of this nature be avoided and discouraged in the future.
