FR941206-0-00076 FR941206-0-00011 (A) For facilities with acid-water scrubbers, the owner or operator shall establish as a site-specific operating parameter either: ( 1 ) The maximum ethylene glycol concentration using the procedures described in §63.365(e)(1); or ( 2 ) The maximum liquor tank level using the procedures described in §63.365(e)(2). (B) For facilities with catalytic oxidizers or thermal oxidizers, the owner or operator shall establish as a site-specific operating parameter the baseline temperature using the procedures described in §63.365(f)(3). (ii) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed, the owner or operator of a facility shall comply with one of the following provisions: (A) For facilities with acid-water scrubbers, operation of the facility with an ethylene glycol concentration in the scrubber liquor in excess of the maximum ethylene glycol concentration or the liquor tank level in excess of the maximum liquor tank level shall constitute a violation of the chamber exhaust vent standard for sources using 10 tons. (B) For facilities with catalytic oxidizers or thermal oxidizers, operation of the facility with the oxidation temperature, averaged over the cycle, more than 5.6 ○C (10 ○F) below the baseline temperature shall constitute a violation of the chamber exhaust vent standard for sources using 10 tons. (e) The following procedures shall be used to determine compliance with the emission limits under §63.362(e)(2), the chamber exhaust vent standard for sources using 1 to 10 tons: (1) For facilities manifolding emissions from the chamber exhaust vent to a control device controlling emissions from the sterilization chamber vent, the owner or operator shall comply with the appropriate compliance provisions for the appropriate control technology (see paragraph (b) of this section). (2) For facilities not manifolding emissions from the chamber exhaust vent (to a control device used to comply with §63.362(c)), during the performance test required in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall either: (i) Determine the concentration of ethylene oxide in the sterilization chamber immediately prior to the operation of the chamber exhaust using the test methods and procedures in §63.365(c)(2); or (ii) Determine the efficiency of control devices used to comply with §63.362(e)(2) using the test methods and procedures in §63.365(d)(2) as well as the following: (A) For facilities with acid-water scrubbers, the owner or operator shall establish as a site-specific operating parameter either: ( 1 ) The maximum ethylene glycol concentration using the procedures described in §63.365(e)(1); or ( 2 ) The maximum liquor tank level using the procedures described in §63.365(e)(2). (B) For facilities with catalytic oxidizers or thermal oxidizers, the owner or operator shall establish as a site-specific operating parameter the baseline temperature using the procedures described in §63.365(f)(3). (3) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed, the owner or operator of a facility shall comply with one of the following provisions: (i) For facilities determining the ethylene oxide concentration, operation of the facility with the ethylene oxide concentration in the sterilization chamber (immediately prior to activation of the chamber exhaust) in excess of the 5,300 ppmv ethylene oxide concentration standard shall constitute a violation of the chamber exhaust vent standard for sources using 1 to 10 tons. (ii) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed, the owner or operator of a facility shall comply with one of the following provisions: (A) For facilities with acid-water scrubbers, operation of the facility with an ethylene glycol concentration in the scrubber liquor in excess of the maximum ethylene glycol concentration or the liquor tank level in excess of the maximum liquor tank level shall constitute a violation of the chamber exhaust vent standard for sources using 1 to 10 tons.
