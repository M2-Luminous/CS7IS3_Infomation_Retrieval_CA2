There is no need to procrastinate this process, said Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on Tuesday, upon conclusion of talks with his Moldovan counterpart, Mikhail Popov. In answer to a question from Interfax Kozyrev said: "Russia clearly understands that there must be no foreign troops in a sovereign state. However it's not easy to prepare an organized withdrawal of the 14th Army. This process will take time." According to him, "it's useless to speak about serious differences in the two sides' approaches to the times of withdrawal." "Both Russia and Moldova realize perfectly well the complexity of this issue, to which neither side has a clear answer. It's gratifying that no one has tried to tackle this problem unilaterally," Kozyrev noted. For his part, Popov said that the presence of the 14th Army in Trans-Dniestria [Transdniester] is "the most inconvenient part of the Soviet legacy in relations between Russia and Moldova." "We do not blame Russia for the resulting situation," he stressed. The head of Moldovan diplomacy said he hopes that the concrete times of withdrawal will be agreed upon during the next round of bilateral talks planned for July.
