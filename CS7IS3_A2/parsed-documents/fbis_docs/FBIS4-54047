The United States is seeking to encourage North Korea to be more transparent with its nuclear activities, including allowing full inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci discussed the North Korean nuclear question with South Korea's special envoy for nuclear issues Kim Sam-hun on Monday and the two met Tuesday with Yukio Takeuchi, deputy director general of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau. Washington has approved of North Korea's readiness to go along with IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities and decided to resume high-level talks with Pyongyang, suspended last July, in an effort to reach a political resolution to the stalemate. In Washington, U.S. Government sources said an announcement on the scheduling of the talks will be made in the near future. Tuesday's meeting in New York reportedly went smoothly as the three parties agreed on their position in dealing with North Korea in the future, the sources said. The sources stressed that the high-level talks could be forfeited and the issue referred to the U.N. Security Council if North Korea continues with the refueling of its experimental nuclear reactor in the Yongbyon complex north of Pyongyang without an agreement with the IAEA on inspecting the spent fuel rods. Takeuchi told reporters that the three exchanged views on the North Korean matter, describing the current situation as "knotty," but added that if the talks can be held, "I look forward to progress" on the issue. Takeuchi said that he had received no information that North Korea has halted its withdrawal of the spent fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor as demanded by the IAEA last week. Hearing that North Korea started removing the rods last week, the U.N. nuclear watchdog demanded a temporary halt to the operations in order to determine if any radioactive material had been diverted to military purposes. A refusal to halt the operations could prove to be an obstruction to the staging of the talks, and according to diplomatic sources, Gallucci said that it would be a problem if North Korea proceeded with the fuel rod removal.
