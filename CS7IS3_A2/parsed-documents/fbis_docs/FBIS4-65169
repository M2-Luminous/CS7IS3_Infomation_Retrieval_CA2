He said at a rally in front of the Aachen Cathedral that peace and freedom are only possible in a united Europe; this holds true also for the long-term safeguarding of the economic sector, jobs, and the social system. Following the most serious cyclical crisis since World War II, the order books are filling again now, the rate of inflation is about 3 percent and, for the first time in a long period, GNP is increasing again, said the chancellor. In his speech, which was repeatedly interrupted by some demonstrators, Kohl told his audience of approximately 3,000 that he advocated a common European policy in the struggle against organized crime. "The struggle against the mafia and international drug trafficking is an all-European responsibility," he said. He called upon foreigners living in Germany not to misuse their right as guests and to pursue political goals in a peaceful way: "We will not tolerate citizens being terrorized in the streets and squares." Kohl and Federal Labor Minister Norbert Bluem, the chief of the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU, and CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze stressed that almost every third job in Germany is marked by exports to other EU [European Union] member states. Kohl, who was received by roughly 100 demonstrators with shrill catcalls, called the protesters "descendants of the socialist migration of peoples." He said it was a great achievement for him to receive Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 11 May, shortly after the anniversary of the German capitulation, for talks on details of the definitive Russian troop withdrawal. In view of the European parliamentary elections to be held within five weeks (12 June), it is our duty "to do everything to build a Europe in which wars are no longer possible." In connection with German unity, the chancellor sharply attacked the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. He said he could tolerate criticism from the jobless in the new laender. However, he did not need criticism from the SPD, "which had long betrayed German unity." The Social Democrats had been prepared to "go down on their knees" before Erich Honecker, the chief of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Kohl said that "the flourishing landscapes" in the new federal laender were progressing well.
