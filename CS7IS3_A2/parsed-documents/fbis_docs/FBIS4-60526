FBIS4-60526 "drnes102_c_94007" FBIS-NES-94-102 Daily Report 25 May 1994 Egypt Fired Yemeni Envoy Shuts Cairo Embassy Fired Yemeni Envoy Shuts Cairo Embassy NC2505113894 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1040 GMT 25 May 94 NC2505113894 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Excerpt] Cairo, 25 May (MENA) -- The impact of the ongoing battles between North and South Yemen has reached the Yemeni Embassy in Cairo. Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah issued a decree relieving Yemen's Ambassador in Cairo 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghilan, a southerner, of his post and recalling him to Sanaa, appointing Ambassador 'Abd-al-Malik Sa'id, a northerner, in his place. Ghilan closed the embassy's electronic doors this morning, prevented staff from entering to assume their duties, and took refuge in his residence on the upper floor of the embassy building. The employees assembled in front of the building, causing a traffic jam on Amin al-Rafi'i Street in the al-Misahah area of al-Dukki. A police force imposed tight security around the embassy. A security source has stated that the goal of these security measures is to protect the embassy against storming operations or riots. Muhammad Fayid, a diplomatic attache at the embassy, told MENA that work was supposed to be resumed in the embassy this morning according to official instructions, which granted employees a four-day holiday for 'Id al-Adha. But he was surprised to find the embassy closed. Fayid said he learned that former Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghilan, who, as he put it, was recalled by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, grabbed the embassy keys from the inside guard and threw him out. Hence, he added, the embassy staff and diplomats were unable to enter to perform their duties and render services to the members of the Yemeni community in Egypt or to the Egyptians. Fayid commended the Egyptian efforts to resolve the Yemeni crisis and President Mubarak's appeal for a cease-fire. He said that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih responded to that appeal and accepted a cease-fire. But the southern leaders' decision to break away led the situation to explode, he said. He denied a separation of North and South Yemen, describing events as "a mutiny" by a group of renegades and affirming that the entire Yemeni people support unity. [passage omitted]
