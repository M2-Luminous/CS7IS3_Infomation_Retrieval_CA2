He pointed out three conditions for Yeltsin's success in the race, which, judging by all appearances, has already begun in Russia. "Yeltsin must realize the new political style and appear to the people not only as the leader of reforms but also as the person capable of reunifying the nations in the remaining 18 months. He will also need a reliable political and civic structure on which to rely for support and which he does not have now. He must run as a man acting on instructions from such a civic and political structure which can propel him to the post. Thirdly, society needs to know clearly who make up the presidential team, who are his comrades in arms and who are his possible successors. If these three conditions materialize "I will back Yeltsin proceeding from the fact that the president is now one of the main guarantors of stability in society," Burbulis said. He also pointed out that the accord on civic peace is not a lull between the branches of power but an expression of society's urgent need for stability. Burbulis called on all political parties to defend their positions within the frame of law.
