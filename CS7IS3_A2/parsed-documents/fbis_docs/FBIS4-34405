Francisco Waspa, president of the Association, said the action is intended to express the Indians' rejection of the aforementioned bills. We want to remind the government that a peaceful people exists and will continue to exist in Ecuador, but we are entitled to having our fair aspirations considered. Francisco Waspa said the association comprises 500 communities. He added that in the framework of respect for authorities and for public and private property, his associate will ask the government and the National Congress to comply with the following points: 1. The National Government must comply with the Commitment Letter [Carta de Compromiso] signed on 11 October 1992, which contains a list of 23 demands regarding nutrition, health, education, and strengthening of popular organizations. 2. We reject the mobilization of the public force as a measure of avoiding possible bloodshed because the Evangelical Indian peoples condemn violence and vandalism in principle. 3. The National Congress must suspend the religious education bill. The president of the Association of Evangelical Indians of Chimborazo says his organization is willing to suspend its action as soon as the government guarantees that its demands will be met.
