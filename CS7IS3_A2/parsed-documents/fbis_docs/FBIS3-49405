Redmond said UN officials had received new assurances from Bosnian Serbs and the Moslem-led Bosnian Government about the safety of aid flights, suspended after a rocket landed on the runway on January 5. The countries participating in the operation -- Germany, Canada, the United States, France, Britain and Norway -- had agreed to the resumption of flights, he added. Redmond said 21 flights into the Bosnian capital were planned for Tuesday. The first aircraft of the day would be a Canadian plane flying out of Ancona in Italy. An attempt was made on Sunday to resume the aid operation, but stopped after four flights because of the security situation around the capital.
