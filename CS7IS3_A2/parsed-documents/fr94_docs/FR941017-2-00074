FR941017-2-00074 FR941017-2-00051 Operation at uprated power levels will not result in increased noise generation for the majority of plant equipment. Some of this equipment, such as the main turbine and generator will operate at the same speed and thus will not contribute to increased offsite noise. Other equipment, such as reactor feed pumps, will operate at increased speeds; however, the majority of this type of equipment is located within plant structures and will not lead to increased offsite noise levels. The impact of a potential increase in noise from the cooling towers was considered. As described previously, operation of the cooling towers is controlled by the requirements of the NPDES permit. Operation of the facility at uprated power levels is not expected to result in operation of more cooling towers than are operated under current power limits. Thus the existing cooling tower noise levels would not be expected to change. However, the existing cooling towers may be operated for an increased number of days per year. The licensee qualitatively estimated that the cooling tower duty cycle would increase by a small amount (in terms of cooling tower-days per year). Thus, the current cooling tower noise levels would exist for a slightly increased number of days per year and the environmental effect of increased noise would be insignificant. The FES described the impact of plant operation on fogging in the vicinity of the facility. Fogging estimates were made for a number of locations near the plant. The FES discussed that the increase in fogging due to plant operation over the natural occurrence of fogging was expected to be minimal and not significant. The staff expects that operation of the plant at uprated power levels will result in only a minimal increase in fogging over that discussed in the FES. Thus, the impact of plant operation on local fogging, including operation at uprated power, remains insignificant. Makeup water requirements are not expected to change significantly, if at all, due to operation at uprated power levels. The circulating water system, service water systems and cooling towers are once-through systems and, as such, do not have makeup requirements. The licensee indicated that operation of the reactor at slightly (< 30 psig) higher operating pressures may lead to slightly higher valve packing leak rates. System leakage, however, is processed through the liquid radwaste system and returned to the condensate storage tank for reuse. Based on the above considerations, the staff concluded that the effect of makeup requirements at uprated power levels on the environment is not significant. Radiological Environmental Assessment The licensee evaluated the impact of the proposed amendment to show that the applicable regulatory acceptance criteria continue to be satisfied for the uprated power conditions. In conducting this evaluation, the licensee considered the effect of the higher power level on source terms on-site and offsite doses, and control room habitability during both normal operation and accident conditions. The licensee provided information regarding the radiological environmental effects of the proposed action in NEDC&hyph;32183P and supplemental information in the September 30, 1994 submittal. In Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of NEDC&hyph;32183P, the licensee discussed the potential effect of power uprate on liquid and gaseous radioactive waste systems. Sections 8.3 and 8.4 discussed the potential effect of power uprate on radiation sources in the reactor core during operation and post-operation, and radiation sources in the coolant resulted from coolant activation products, activated corrosion products and fission products. Section 8.5 of the Topical Report discussed the radiation levels during normal operation, normal post-operation, post-accident, and offsite doses during normal operation. Finally, Section 9.2 of NEDC&hyph;32183P presented the results of calculated whole body and thyroid doses at the uprated power and current authorized power conditions at the exclusion area boundary and the low population zone that might result from the postulated design basis radiological accidents [i.e., loss-of-coolant-accident (LOCA), main stream line break accident (MSLBA) outside containment, fuel handling accident (FHA) and control rod drop accident (CRDA]. In Section 8.1 of NEDC&hyph;32183P, the licensee stated that there will be only a slight increase in the liquid radwaste collection as a result of operation at higher power levels. The largest contributor to the liquid waste results from the backwash of the condensate demineralizers. The power uprate will increase the flow rate through the condensate demineralizers, with a subsequent reduction in the average time between backwashing. Additionally, neither the floor drain collector subsystem, nor the waste collector subsystem is expected to experience a significant increase in the total volume of liquid waste due to operation at the uprated condition. The licensee stated that while the activated corrosion products in liquid wastes are expected to increase proportionally to the power uprate, the total volume of processed waste is not expected to increase appreciably since the only significant increase in processed waste is due to the more frequent backwashes of condensate and reactor water cleanup (RWCU) system demineralizers. The licensee noted that backwashing is normally initiated as a result of high differential pressure rather than activity content and that this is expected to remain the case for operation under uprated power conditions. Based on its analyses of the liquid radwaste system, the licensee has concluded the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix I, will be met. Based on the above considerations, the staff concluded that the effect on the environment of operation of the liquid radiological waste stream at uprated power levels is not significant. The gaseous waste management systems, collect, control, process, store and dispose of gaseous radioactive waste generated during normal operation and abnormal operational occurrences. The gaseous waste management systems include the offgas system, standby gas treatment system (SGTS), and various building ventilation systems. The systems are designed to meet the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix I. In its power uprate submittal, the licensee has stated that the greatest contributor of radioactive gases are the non-condensible radioactive gases from the main condenser, including activation gases (principally N&hyph;16, O&hyph;19, and N&hyph;13) and radioactive noble gas parents. The increase in production of these gases is expected to be approximately proportional to the core power increase. These non-condensible radioactive gases, along with nonradioactive air due to in-leakage to the condenser, are continuously removed by the stream jet air ejector from the main condensers, and discharge into the offgas system. The flow of these gases into the offgas system are included with the flow of H 2 and O 2 from the recombiner which will also increase linearly with core power. Radioactive gases and H 2 and O 2 pass from the recombiner through an adsorber bed, holdup pipe, HEPA filters and exit the facility through the main stack. Gaseous activity effluent release rates are monitored down stream of the adsorber bed and alarms are provided in the control room. The licensee has stated that the operational increases in gases are not significant when compared to the current total system flow. The design basis for the offgas system is for activity release rates of 100,000 microcuries per second based on a mixture of activation and fission product gases and fuel leakage and a 30-minute holdup time. The system is designed to met the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR part 50, appendix I. Performance of the system at uprated power levels is expected to remain within the system design basis and, thus, to continue to meet the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix I. The contribution of gases to the gaseous waste management system from building ventilation systems is not expected to increase significantly with power uprate because 1) the amount of fission products released into the reactor coolant depends on the number and nature of the fuel rod defects and is not dependent on reactor power, and 2) the concentration of coolant activation products is expected to remain unchanged since the linear increase in the production of these products will be offset by the linear increase in steaming rate. Based on its review of the gaseous waste management system, the staff concluded that the effect on the environment of operating the gaseous radiological waste stream at uprated power is not significant.
