Chairman of the British-Korean Friendship Parliamentary Group Robert Parry said in a statement on February 6 expressed deep concern over the fact that at a time when a prospect of a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was being opened through the DPRK-U.S. talks, the U.S. hardline conservative forces were overruling the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and the agreement reached late last year and bringing the situation to a hopeless phase. He urged the British Government not to join in the anti-DPRK campaign launched according to the script written by the United States, taking into account the possible unfavorable effect on world peace and security of the catastrophic situation created by the reckless moves of the U.S. hardline conservative forces. The Asian Regional Committee for Supporting Korean Reunification released a statement on February 7 denouncing the United States for reinforcing its Armed Forces in South Korea and its neighbouring countries in a bid to stifle the socialist system established in Korea. It called on the world people to condemn the U.S. moves against the DPRK. Chairman of the Scientific and Technical Association of Tanzania S.J. Mabulla, in an interview with the KCNA correspondent in Dar-es-Salaam on February 2, demanded that the United States promptly stop forcing a comprehensive inspection on the DPRK and presenting a military threat to it, solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through negotiations, withdraw its nuclear weapons and troops from South Korea and discontinue large-scale nuclear war exercises for good and all. He called on the international community to strive hard to check the [word indistinct] on big [words indistinct] peace and reunification of the country. The Belgium-Korea Solidarity Committee in a statement on February 9 said that to finally solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and create a favorable climate for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea depended entirely on the U.S. attitude.
