Immediately on landing, President Lech Walesa, his wife, and the members of the Polish Government delegation went to the residence in Rashtrapati (presidential palace). The official part of the visit began on Thursday [3 March] at 0900 in the courtyard of the Rashtrapati palace, built in 1929 for the viceroy of the British Crown. The building, which has 240 rooms, is now the residence of the Indian president and houses the chancellery and the office of the government. The Polish delegation was greeted by President Shankar Dayal Sharma and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. President Walesa announced that Polish-Indian relations need to become more dynamic. Next, the Polish delegation went to Radzghat, the place where the body of Mahatma Gandhi was cremated; Gandhi was murdered on 30 January 1948, less than a year after India proclaimed its independence. In line with the tradition, Lech Walesa placed a wreath on the memorial plate in the mausoleum and planted a tree in the garden nearby. Afterward, he met with President Sharma in the Rashtrapati Palace. The presidents discussed, among other things, similarities in striving for independence of Poland and India. Sharma compared Poland's "Solidarity" period to the period when India fought for independence. Walesa stressed that Mahatma Gandhi was a model for Poles to follow in achieving political aims without resorting to force. President Walesa also met with a group of Indian Parliament deputies, during which both parties discussed economic development. The president also familiarized himself with the system of legislative powers in India, which was based on the British model, but adjusted to Indian reality. On Thursday, talks were held also by Polish Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej Olechowski and his Indian counterpart, Dinesh Siagh. During a party given in honor of the Polish guests by the Indian president, Lech Walesa stated that there are great possibilities for increasing trade cooperation, which, in recent years, has plummeted to a level that does not correspond to the potential and interests of both states. The visit of the president of the Polish Republic to India aroused considerable interest in Indian business circles. The 3 March issue of THE TIMES OF INDIA, the largest Indian daily, published a report on the situation and economic reforms in Poland, sponsored by companies interested in trade contacts with our country. Under the headline "Welcome His Excellency Lech Walesa and Danuta Walesa," the companies included their offers.
