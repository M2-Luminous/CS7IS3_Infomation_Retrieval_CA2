This was said by Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis during his speech at the special district congress of the DISI [Democratic Rally] Youth Organization [NEDISI] in Larnaca. Mr. Kasoulidhis added that the Greek Cypriot side has accepted the contents of the suggestion in the 21 March UN document on the condition that it also be accepted by the other side. He also said that our side could also make many demands for improvements to its own benefit, but it has not done so in order to facilitate reaching an agreement. Mr. Kasoulidhis continued: This acceptance has brought us to the end of the road and constitutes our maximum as far as constructive intentions and noble gestures. The spokesman added: As President Glavkos Kliridhis has also stressed clearly, our position is crystal clear: We will accept neither a new document nor changes in the current one. Mr. Kasoulidhis accused the Turkish side of lacking the political will to accept not only the confidence-building measures but also a Cyprus solution. A message of greetings from the Greek New Democracy party chairman was read and North Epirotes [Greeks from southern Albania] also addressed the NEDISI congress, which was devoted to the enslaved homelands of Hellenism.
