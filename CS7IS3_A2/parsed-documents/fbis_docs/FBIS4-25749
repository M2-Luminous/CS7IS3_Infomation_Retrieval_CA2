Mitsubishi will conduct a three-year expansion program worth 800 million pesos (29.6 million U.S. dollars) in its local subsidiary to double its car production by 1997. With the strong performance of the economy in the first quarter, coupled with the ongoing economic restructuring such as trade and investment liberalization and the stable political situation, more and more Japanese investors are eyeing the Philippines. The country's economy grew by 4.84 percent in the first three months of the year following the resolution of the power crisis and the government's bold economic reforms. Economic division director Kazuo Sunaga of the Japanese Embassy said today that Japanese investments into the country are expected to further increase following the country's much improved economic conditions. "I can confidently say Japanese investments will now start pouring," he added. He also cited the Philippines' edge over other ASEAN countries, noting that Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore are already saturated with Japanese investments. Japanese investments in the country amounted to 25.039 billion pesos (927 million U.S. dollars) since 1988 up to may this year followed by the United States with 16.536 billion pesos (612 million U.S. dollars).
