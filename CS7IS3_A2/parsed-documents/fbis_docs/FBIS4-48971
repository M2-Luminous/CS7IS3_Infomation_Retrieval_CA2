Airline hijacking, Mr. Chen said, was a commonly recognized serious crime. CAAC had adopted a series of security measures to prevent airline hijacking in the past two years. It required the Taiwan authorities to repatriate Mainland hijackers in line with the "Quemoy Agreement" signed in September, 1990. The Taiwan authorities, however, practised a policy of separating hijackers from the airlines and refused to repatriate them immediately, resulting in hijackers feeling confident of escaping punishment and was in fact a form of connivance with the hijackers. Mr. Chen said that in view of the responsibility for the safety of life and property of passengers including Taiwan compatriots and the desire to promote personnel and economic exchange between the two sides of the strait, the Mainland sincerely hoped that the Taiwan authorities would positively coordinate with the Mainland in jointly cracking down on plane hijacking and that the Mainland-based ARATS and Taiwan-based SEF would reach an agreement on the repatriation of hijackers as soon as possible. Mr. Chen also said that the Mainland had noted the promise made by the Taiwan authorities that they would not grant political asylum to hijackers and would punish them severely. It also noted the consensus achieved by ARATS and SEF on the repatriation of all hijackers in principle and reached a basic framework for the agreement regarding such repatriation. The Mainland thanked figures from various sectors in Taiwan for their support for repatriation of hijackers as soon as possible. Mr. Chen said he believed that so long as the two sides cooperated and made joint efforts to seriously crack down on the crime of hijacking and made immediate repatriation of hijackers, such crime would be halted and the safety of passengers and property guaranteed.
