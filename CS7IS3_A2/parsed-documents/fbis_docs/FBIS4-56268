Workers and peasants are unwilling to allow privatization of the Ecuadorean Social Security Institute, the state-owned telecommunications company, and the Ecuadorean Institute of Electrification. The FUT reiterated that the workers will take even more radical action if the government persists in its maniacal fervor to privatize state-run companies. The FUT president added that joint action by the FUT, the public sector, the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, teachers, craftsmen, small merchants, and other sectors would have serious repercussions that the government can only prevent if it stops hijacking profitable state-run companies to give them away to private businessmen.
