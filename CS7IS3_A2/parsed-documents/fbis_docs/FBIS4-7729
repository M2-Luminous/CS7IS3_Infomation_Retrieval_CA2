These circles have warned that "unless the regular Army of the Republic of Croatia halts its attacks on all Serb defense lines in Posavina [region along the Sava river] today," "the Srpska army will retaliate," from which the Serb side has refrained so far. This means, the circles have said, that the army of the Srpska republic "would begin with actions with all their forces and from all means at their disposal against the territory of the Republic of Croatia," as "attacks from long-range artillery and missiles systems from the left bank of the Sava river have been incessant over the past three days."
