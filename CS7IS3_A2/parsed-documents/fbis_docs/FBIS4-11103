FBIS4-11103 "drlat078_c_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 MEXICO Defense Secretariat Denies Human Rights Violations Defense Secretariat Denies Human Rights Violations PA2104191394 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 21 Apr 94 PA2104191394 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network Spanish BFN [Report by special correspondent Juan Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas] [Text] [Announcer Jose Cardenas] Special correspondent Santoyo will now report on the reactions in Chiapas to a bulletin released this morning by the National Defense Secretariat [Sedena] asserting that no member of the Mexican Army is guilty of violating human rights in the Chiapas conflict. Sedena says none of the 127 human rights violations reports is valid. Come in, Juan Carlos. [Santoyo] Although this bulletin is being treated with a certain amount of reservation here in Chiapas, some communities have reacted by saying these reports should be looked at more closely. Some people are not happy about the bulletin, particularly those who are being held at the Cerro Hueco Prison who seriously question this statement by the Sedena. They say it is the authorities who have the final word. The problems in Chiapas are increasing. Six days ago, on 21 April, to be exact, 380 people from the group known as the Three Knots returned to Ochuc. These people, who have been described as rural teachers disguised as peasants, were expelled from Ochuc because they were considered dangerous and destabilizing. A very serious incident occurred today. Two minors, one an eight year old and the other a 14 year old, were burned alive when their wooden shack was drenched with gasoline and set on fire. This is thought to be a revenge attack by some of those who had been expelled from Ochuc. The incident, which occurred in the village of Tobija some 14 km from Ochuc, is being investigated. Four people have been detained. Ochuc municipal President Emilio Gomez Santis traveled to Tuxtla Gutierrez to meet with the governor, Javier Lopez Moreno, so the proper actions could be taken. We in the media are concerned because arriving at Ochuc is very difficult. One man, who declined to identify himself and just said he was a local authority, gave us a very serious warning. After giving us some information, he said: The people are very upset. You might as well leave. You are still alive. If you came in a car, drive away because it could be destroyed. We cannot be held responsible for your lives. Of course, after this warning, we put some distance between ourselves and this town. These people are very upset, particularly because they are being forced to accept people they had expelled for political reasons. Some of the teachers, identified as members of the Democratic Revolution Party, have caused some problems in the municipality because most of the people here belong to or are followers of PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]. The number of dead will increase if what is happening there is not stopped. The last that I will tell you is that Jorge Gonzalez Torres, candidate for the Ecologist Party, is scheduled to arrive in San Cristobal de las Casas tonight. He will make a working tour in some local communities, and on Friday he will take water trucks to local Indian communities. In addition, National Action Party candidate Diego Fernandez Cevallos will make a tour from Friday to Monday. His public relations committee has gotten in touch with us in the media. It has been reported that we can use the press room set up by the federal government.
