Protection Force (UNPROFOR) logistics base in Pancevo over a month ago for the Nordic battalion will not go to the Moslem enclave of Tuzla in northern Bosnia. The tanks will be sent back to Scandinavia by the end of January. Following the Bosnian Serb authorities' refusal to permit any heavy weaponry passing through their territory, UNPROFOR and the Yugoslav army agreed that the tanks would be returned by rail to a Nordic country -- either Denmark, Norway or Sweden, reported the Belgrade daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI on Wednesday. The Yugoslav committee for cooperation with UNPROFOR said the decision was only to be expected as peace in Bosnia cannot be established with tanks even though some U.N. sources claim the Leopards are not offensive weapons and would only be used for patrolling. After two months of talks and accusations that Yugoslavia was obstructing passage of the tanks to Tuzla, international factors have finally perceived that they made a political as well as a military mistake, said Yugoslav army sources. The sources said it was made clear to UNPROFOR representatives that Yugoslavia was forced by international pressure to play host to the Nordic battalion and its 11 Leopard tanks, and that UNPROFOR had no grounds under any U.N. documents to send heavy weapons to Yugoslavia or Bosnia-Herzegovina. U.N. resolutions and documents state that all moves must be made with "the agreement of all interested parties," which on this occasion was withheld by the Bosnian Serb Republic, wrote VECERNJE NOVOSTI. It added that almost the entire Nordic battalion with over 1,000 troops and 200 vehicles had been transferred from Pancevo to Tuzla. The U.N. peacekeeper's role in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the scene of a fierce civil war for the past 20 months, is primarily to ensure delivery of humanitarian relief to the civilian population. UNPROFOR's mission, however, has been abused on many occasions to supply the Moslem side with arms. Evidence on this exists and has been presented to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.
