Information from the German Office for the Protection of the Constitution obtained by the Cologne EXPRESS newspaper (Sunday [19 June] edition) reveals they are increasingly trying to obtain "sensitive" goods necessary for the production of NBC weapons. The documents say that employees of the former Soviet KGB secret service have expanded the range of their spying activities in Germany. The goal is not to acquire know-how but to exert direct influence on firms and associations. Eastern secret services have also increased their activity through former Stasi agents who have not yet been detected.
