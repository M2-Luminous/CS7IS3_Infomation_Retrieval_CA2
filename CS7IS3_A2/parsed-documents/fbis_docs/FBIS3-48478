FBIS3-48478 "dreas017__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-017-A Document Type:Daily Report 26 January 1994 ANNEX Japan * Pressures, Influences on Coalition Analyzed 942B0013A Tokyo ZAIKAIJIN in Japanese Oct 93 pp 58-64--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942B0013A Tokyo ZAIKAIJIN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Article by Masashi Kunimitsu: "Hosokawa Coalition Government Neither `Temporary' Nor `Two-Tiered'"] [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], which has not become accustomed to its role as the opposition party, finds itself in a predicament where it uses the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in its former role as opposition party as a model. On the other hand, we would like to see the coalition parties become accustomed to their governing role quickly and fulfill their public pledges. The coalition cabinet has enjoyed smooth sailing in its initial days. According to mass media public opinion surveys, support ratings for the Morihiro Hosokawa cabinet are running at the lowest level of 70 percent recorded by the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN published in its morning edition of 24 August 1993, while others ranged above 75 percent, including a surprising 82 percent by the SANKEI SHIMBUN. The highest rating in the past was the 62 percent immediately following the inauguration of the Kakuei Tanaka cabinet in 1972 in a survey by the ASAHI SHIMBUN. These ratings reflect the fact that a majority of the general public welcomes the collapse of "1955 system." "Even in a questionnaire survey of bureaucrats in deputy department head and higher positions in central government agencies, conducted by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, 72 percent of the respondents welcomed the coalition government. The results of that survey clearly reflect discontent held against the former LDP government. When one views the reasons for the welcome such as "We can expect the implementation of new policies" and "We will be afforded the possibility of major policy options," one can visualize the rigidity that had set in because of the collusion between officials of the central government agencies and LDP zoku Diet members and the resulting discontent generated among middle and junior bureaucrats. During the past 20 years, no change whatsoever has been made in budgetary allocations concerning public works projects, welfare, and other areas. In summary, what this means is that even bureaucrats did not have freedom relative to policy options ever since the Tanaka cabinet or since control by Tanaka. This means that the LDP is indeed the organization that must undergo a thorough awakening and fundamental self-reform." Seeing that the coalition parties appointed popular Prime Minister Hosokawa and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata to the most visible positions, the LDP attempted to regain public support by appointing Yohei Kono who enjoys national popularity as LDP president, Ryutaro Hashimoto as Policy Research Council chairman, Shintaro Ishihara as acting chairman of the newly created 21st Century Council (Hashimoto serves as chairman) and a two-term junior House of Representatives Diet member to the Executive Council. "The fact that the LDP lost its majority status even in the House of Representatives when the Hata faction (current Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]) and Takemura group (current Sakigake [Harbinger]) seceded and was not able to regain its majority in the summer 1993 elections cannot be attributed solely to the lack of public popularity on the part of the then LDP president and prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa. If it were a case where elections can be won by purely pushing candidates enjoying public popularity, why is it that the momentum of the Shinjiyu [New Liberal] Club petered out and eventually forced a disbandment and return to the LDP? Why is it that when Ishihara took over the former Nakagawa faction after the sudden death of the late Ichiro Nakagawa the faction failed to expand and eventually joined forces with the Fukuda faction (current Mitsuzuka faction)? Why is it that when Hashimoto became LDP secretary general and assumed overall leadership, the LDP lost the House of Councilors election and its majority ranking. It is a case where none of these circumstances was favorably influenced by the popularity of the principal role player." The LDP is not being asked by the public to pursue policies aimed at running a popularity contest or temporizing. They seek a fundamental alteration of its diathesis. "A `prominent leading political party' is not supposed to create an exaggerated brouhaha over a simple administrative error wherein administrative bureau employees of the House of Representatives misread the roll call and demand a repeat of house elections. If there should be an omission in the roll call, all that needs to be done is for the speaker to ask whether any ballot omissions exist and to correct any omissions. Further, such elementary roll calling systems which are subject to errors should be abolished and action should be taken to submit a resolution or bill to implement a push-button balloting system as once proposed by the LDP itself. The LDP is acting just like the Social Democratic Party of Japan did at one time in a manner which is a metamorphosis of the latter's ox-walk [delay] tactics. We can only view such conduct as signifying that the LDP believes the SDPJ was once the model for opposition parties." Heckling Leads to Questioning of LDP Character "When nationwide attention was focused on Takako Doi's selection as the first female speaker of the House of Representatives and her acceptance speech, LDP Diet members heckled her in a very intolerable manner. Because, as expected, that situation was singled out for severe criticism by female LDP Diet members during their first talks with LDP President Kono and LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, we anticipated that such conduct would not be repeated. However, when Prime Minister Hosokawa gave his general policy speech on 23 August, senseless heckling, which could be better described as angry outcries, almost drowned out the speech to the point where it was inaudible. That conduct made one believe that the LDP is convinced that savage behavior manifested in angry outcries, irrespective of substance, plays a constructive role in making the Diet a place of lively activity. There is no way that creatures who cannot listen attentively to others are qualified to represent the public." Heckling is not an appropriate tactic in the Diet unless it is sharp, graceful, and humorous as well as "pithy, terse, and to the point." The late Takeyoshi Miki, who was called the "heckling general" in the prewar Diet, used heckling tactics that were typical of that standard. "Heckling tactics" used by current Diet members make one question their character. Reform of diathesis of this nature is required of today's LDP. "Since general policy speeches will be broadcast live by the Japan Broadcasting Service, close-up shots of Diet members shouting senseless utterances should be broadcast along with full name and electoral district. We must do so because the LDP is not about to take corrective action, unless forced to do so under such exposure." Considering that LDP politicians will not act unless under "external pressure," the public has no choice but to apply pressure externally to make the LDP take corrective action. There is no doubt that the Hosokawa cabinet enjoys a very high degree of support, but only the future will tell whether it will be able to respond to such expectations. When the LDP and Communist Party engaged in representative questioning they asked, "What's different between what you've said and the words of the former LDP?" and "You lack specifics," but so-called criticism voiced with an ulterior motive should be disregarded and Hosokawa should endeavor to fulfill his convictions. "The prime minister's first general policy speech was favorably received by the public. He clearly declared a change in era and launched anew a program for "responsible reform." Further, in connection with World War II, he recognized Japanese aggression and colonial control and apologized to the Asian people who suffered as a result. Germany took similar action immediately following defeat which means that Japan was late by about 50 years, but such a performance was something you obviously could not expect of the LDP. He also unequivocally pledged political reform within the year. The prime minister has stated that he will assume responsibility if that goal is not reached within the year. We must recognize that as a courageous stand." General Policy Speech Worthy of Recognition The national image launched by the prime minister in the form of a goal to "create a simple and sincere nation encompassing a lifestyle rich in substance and abundant in cultural traits" is strongly reminiscent in terms of renewed memories of something long forgotten rather than nostalgic feelings for those who can recall the days when the theme of a "cultural nation" was overly stressed in the postwar era. You might say the prime minister's words reflect a very harsh criticism of the "1955 system" which was contaminated by the principle of almighty money under economic supremacy. In connection with Japan's position relative to World War II, the prime minister has clearly determined it to be a war of aggression and honestly apologized to people of other nations who suffered damage and in his general-policy speech stated, "I once again express profound remorse and apology for the unbearable suffering and sorrow experienced by many people because of past acts of aggression and colonial control by our nation." Those Japanese officers and enlisted personnel who died during the war did not even dream of it as being a war of aggression, and more than just a few were convinced that they were fighting for the sake of emancipating the greater East Asian nations from imperialistic control of West European powers for the establishment of a coprosperity sphere while some members of surviving families of the dead probably sense inconsistency in the determination that it was a "war of aggression." However, mankind cannot demonstrate progress unless he is willing to recognize facts as facts and to follow up with the necessary corrective action. We must give recognition to the attitude herein that reflects a determination not to whitewash the past. However, if we were to refer to that war as the "Pacific war" as labeled by the United States, we would have to say that the description is reflective of the "historical view of the Tokyo war tribunal" which provides a distorted view of facts subservient to the U.S. perception of the war. The war that was waged by Japan did not cover only the Pacific, but covered Asia, including the Indian subcontinent, and should accurately be titled the "East Asian war" or "Asian war." Then and now, the United States, which treats the Pacific as a national defense zone, felt it would be difficult to draft young men for service as officers and enlisted personnel in an Asian war and used as a national policy the slogan, calling for protection of the Pacific defense zone. Therefore, to accept that term indiscriminately would be incorrect and tantamount to saying, "World War II was an unavoidable defensive war that was forced upon the nation." Now, we turn to the important topic of political reform, but an "ideological confrontation" exists within the coalition governing parties as to whether they should strive for a two major-party system or a form of government calling for a coalition of a fixed number of several parties such as three or four. Shinseito, Komeito, and the Democratic Socialist Party favor the two major-party system, while the Japan New Party, Sakigake, and the SDPJ prefer a multiple party coalition. Further, these differences have led to differences in the subject concerning a system combining single-seat constituencies with proportional representation in terms of increasing the authorized seats for the small electoral districts over those authorized for the proportional electoral districts or vice versa and in terms of whether priority should be given to a one-ballot system or a two-ballot system. Spreading "Fear of Ozawa" "The SDPJ feels it will face a crisis in the disappearance of the party itself, if a one-ballot small electoral district system is implemented. It would be better for a SDPJ unchanged from the past to disappear. However, ever since the SDPJ became a member of the coalition governing parties, its officials have made an honest attempt to change. For example, when South Korea published new information on the Kim Dae-jung incident of South Korea, the SDPJ in the past would have reacted boisterously as if it were Kim Dae-jung himself, but Deputy Chairman Kanju Sato of the SDPJ, who is chairman of the National Public Safety Commission, stated at a news conference that the issue is one which has already been settled in diplomatic channels, but that if something is still at issue concerning the incident, the matter should be handled through diplomatic channels, not an incident which should require action on the part of investigative authorities. His statement was completely in order, but for someone who viewed the SDPJ in light of past practices, his response was astonishing. Further, relative to the Defense Agency's airborne warning and control system (AWACS) budget, the SDPJ has not altered its basic policy of opposition, but even Kosuke Uehara, director general of the Hokkaido Development, Okinawa Development, and National Land Agencies, who previously spearheaded opposition, said in a news conference that we should handle the issue with caution but that he would comply with any decision made by the prime minister or director general of the Defense Agency. This may be somewhat of an uncomplimentary remark, but one wonders if there is such a "reorientation effect," just because the SDPJ became one of the ruling parties." However, the situation reflects a change for the better and support for the SDPJ is growing for that very reason." The Japan New Party and Sakigake fear that if a two major-party system is formed that they cannot ally themselves with the LDP and that, if they were to unite with the non-LDP forces, they would risk being controlled by Ichiro Ozawa, thus putting them in a position where they advocate a two-ballot system. This situation reflects the "fear of Ozawa" which also exists within the LDP. "A look at the process for forming the coalition cabinet and the lineup for the cabinet clearly indicates "Ozawa initiatives." Because Mr. Ozawa made an early decision to support Mr. Hosokawa for prime minister and formed Shinseito and unified faction after making four officials including Mutsuki Kato secede from the LDP, even if Sakigake including Masayoshi Takemura were to join hands with the LDP, it would have resulted in two more seats being controlled by non-LDP forces, making an LDP government impossible and forcing Mr. Takemura to join the non-LDP elements. It is fact that the intensity with which the situation was handled had a negative effect on unity." "As one views the cabinet lineup, it is only logical that Shinseito members with governing party experience filled important cabinet posts, because a decision had been made basically not to make any major changes from policies of the previous government. However, even then, they are all filled by Shinseito members, such as Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister; Hirohisa Fujii, minister of finance; Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry; and Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. Further, even the post of director general of the Defense Agency was filled by Keisuke Nakanishi, a confidant of Mr. Ozawa who ranks equally with Mr. Kumagai. This means that from the standpoint of universally accepted concepts, Shinseito controls the innermost core posts, including those covering diplomacy, basic industry (including agriculture), and the military. From a human sentiment viewpoint, it is not a case where one cannot understand the fear exercised against Mr. Ozawa in any potential confrontation." However, it would be a case of a fool judging everything by the one thing he knows, and it would show a lack of thorough analysis and shortsightedness "not seeing the forest for the trees," if one were to conclude that the situation with Mr. Ozawa is treated as a "two-tiered power system" like that which existed in the LDP under Tanaka, Takeshita, or Kanemaru as reported by the mass media. Election-System Reform Will Require Time "A two-tiered power structure represents a system under which an individual like Kakuei Tanaka--who, although a member of the Diet, has seceded from the LDP and is no longer a member of the ruling party; and above all, he is unable to perform in an official capacity and is unable to assume official or political responsibility because he is criminally accused--assumes an absolutely irresponsible position by influencing official authority. However, Mr. Ozawa is currently a representative official, or so-called secretary general or chief secretary of the second ranking coalition party, is a member of the governing party liaison council treated as an official agency and a member of the House of Representatives Political Reform Special Committee that must implement political reform, the most important problem facing the cabinet, and thus placing him in a position where he must assume responsibilities both officially and politically. He reflects qualitatively an entirely different individual compared to the two-tiered undercover kingmaker of the LDP government days. This is a case where the mass media does not have an accurate grasp of the facts or where they merely distort the facts to sensationalize their reports." "Moreover, under circumstances wherein there was no opposition party that would attempt to overthrow and replace the LDP, which established a stable government after winning a majority of Diet seats, there were many individuals including enough to spare who would truckle up to authority to become prime minister in the LDP, even after rebelling against Tanaka or even if Tanaka fired the last prime minister. And, even the LDP acted in such a disorderly way or the opposition party were to voice criticism, there was no chance whatsoever that the LDP would lose governmental power. It was under those circumstances that Tanaka, Takeshita, and Kanemaru were able to wield unlawful power. However, no longer will Ozawa fire Prime Minister Hosokawa because he dislikes him. Moreover, if Hosokawa resigns on his own volition and there are many people that want to replace him, the situation would be the same. As a minimum, the Japan New Party and Sakigake will probably secede from the coalition. And when that happens, the coalition will lose governing power. A strong opposition party known as the LDP will be vigilantly observing the situation with the intent of recovering governing power. The situation is now entirely different from the days when they spoke of control by the Tanaka faction or control by the Takeshita faction and Kanemaru or the Kanemaru-Takeshita-Ozawa days. Even if Ozawa wanted to become an undercover leader he would not be able to." If Shinseito loses governing power and the LDP resumes government control, it is quite obvious that the LDP will use its authority to "destroy Ozawa." Unless Ozawa is willing to tolerate that which is intolerable and bear that which is unbearable, he will be unable to realize even a single political conviction. Wherein lies the "two-tiered authority?" The answer is obvious. Further, the "theory of a temporary Hosokawa cabinet" is a topic that is popular with the mass media. If the main components of the political reform-related laws are not passed within the year, the prime minister will resign as he publicly pledged. Moreover, even if the main components are passed as law, the allocation of electoral districts must be handled by a third-party agency and decisions must be made on the establishment of the agencies and selection of staff. Even if the third-party agency is established, additional time will be required for allocation of districts if the laws provide for a two-ballot system centered on a proportional representation system as advocated by the Japan New Party. "The process to be handled by the third-party agency will be relatively smooth if the law provides for 300 single-seat districts and 200 seats for proportional representation with a one-ballot system, because a trial plan covering that approach was completed by the government's Election System Council during the LDP government days. However, if they decide on a different system, it will mean that district allocations will have to be completely revamped. It would seem that a reduction from 300 to 200 electoral districts would be a simple matter, but reallocation involves breaking up existing districts and merging several districts or altering traditional urban districts, inviting intense resistance. Even the establishment of the proposed 300 small electoral districts caused a lot of commotion. Changing that once more poses a very difficult task." The district allocations must be included in a legislative proposal and approved by the Diet, which means that even if the principal components of the reform legislation are passed into law as pledged by the prime minister during the extraordinary session of the Diet in the fall, the earliest that the district allocation plan can be submitted to the Diet will be during the next extraordinary Diet session where it will require debate, providing for passage next summer at the earliest. Moreover, since it will be a major reform, provision must be made for familiarization and preparatory periods. Since such a period will require at least "several months" according to veteran member of the Election System Council Tan Horie, professor of Keio University, actual general elections cannot be held until year after next in 1995 at the earliest. Moreover, there is the possibility that Diet deliberations can be delayed because of the myriad of issues outstanding, such as economic countermeasures and international economic negotiations. Hosokawa and Takemura Are Shrewd Individuals By just looking at the near-term political agenda limited to political reform, even if the Hosokawa cabinet endeavors to realize reform and enjoys the support of the public, it is obvious the task cannot be accomplished in one year. This means that the Hosokawa government must remain in power for more than one year. Needless to say, if the mass media forms a collusive relationship with the LDP for the sake of frustrating attempts at reform and thinks in terms of an early exit for Mr. Hosokawa, then the story will be different." If one were to analyze why a seemingly fragmented opposition group formed a coalition, one will find that they realized that any LDP government would dissolve and call for general elections of the House of Representatives whenever it was to the latter's advantage and recover its majority in both the lower and upper houses, forcing the opposition to resign itself into being permanent elements of that fate. The coalition was formed because the parties involved realized that it was necessary to control the authority to dissolve the House of Representatives as well as the authority to govern. I would think that they are determined to preserve unity, conduct concurrent upper and lower house elections two years later under the new system and continue in government. Now that they are in power, they must have realized the "value of being in power." Having come to that realization, they probably will not relinquish power so easily. To begin with, the purpose of political parties is to serve as the group and the means for implementing policies reflecting pledges made to the public whose goals cannot be achieved without being in control of the government. To embrace that thought process is logical whether it be the LDP or any other party and any party in power that says, "We are not ardently attached to our government authority," would be displaying an attitude that is tantamount to the abandonment of duties or position as politicians and party members. Further, the inaccuracy of the "theory of Ozawa authority" lies in the fact that advocates of that theory are not aware of the shrewdness of the Prime Minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. "The Hosokawa clan included Makitaka Hosokawa (pen name Yusai) first-generation head of clan who served and sustained, during the turbulent war days, prominent figures with strong personalities such as Akiyoshi Ashikaga, Nobunaga Oda, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, and Ieyasu Tokugawa. After Mitsuhide Akechi conquered Nobunaga at Honno Temple and his daughter Tama (Christian name Galatia) married into the Hosokawa clan, the former asked the Hosokawa clan to ally itself with him, but the latter rejected the request, while not allying itself with Hideyoshi, preserving the clan and demonstrating the presence of considerable resourcefulness and skills in conducting unflagging negotiations. It is said that that resourcefulness originated with experience gained during the feudal age and Chinese classics, while the current prime minister has been trained in the "Hosokawa clan discipline." The prime minister was tutored in Chinese books such as the Analects of Confucius, was exhorted by his grandfather Moritaka to meet with "first-class personalities" and has observed politics through frequent meetings with the late Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida. Hosokawa is also of a lineage including ancestors with brutal powers to act in connection with reform such as father of the revival of the Hosokawa clan Shigenori (8th generation) and Morihisa (14th generation). He has also observed the actions of his late grandfather Prince Fumimaro Konoe. He is no one to be disregarded." "Mr. Takemura is also an individual who has served as governor in the Omi region (Shiga Prefecture) whose `merchants are known for their shrewdness.' He vacillated somewhat between remaining an LDP member or becoming a non-LDP Diet member and in the end shrewdly assumed the key cabinet position of chief cabinet secretary. Moreover, he appointed as deputy chief cabinet secretary Yukio Hatoyama the eldest son of a distinguished family and member of the same Sakigake, while appointing as the prime minister's special assistant Hideyuki Tanaka also a member of Sakigake, thus consolidating the Prime Minister's Official Residence with close associates. Typical of Ministry of Home Affairs bureaucrats, he is of a character that defies conjecture." The LDP has been relegated to the status of opposition party, is overwhelmed by a on-rushing sense of desolation, lacks factional leadership, is short of funds, controls no cabinet posts, and is plagued with a psychological disintegration phenomenon. There's even the observation that it is more vulnerable than the coalition parties. Even in that sense, we are at a "new historical departure point."
