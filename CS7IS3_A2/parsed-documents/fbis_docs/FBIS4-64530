My program is ready. There is enthusiasm, optimism, on the part of the people, the financial markets. We will do our utmost to boost the economy and development, to eliminate bureaucracy and poor services. Consultations with the social partners will begin at 1500 hours Monday [2 May]. Tuesday evening we will start discussing names for the government. When will the government be ready? By the end of the week." Silvio Berlusconi feels like a prime minister-designate whose path ahead is a fast, downhill one, to be covered all in a single swoop. At 1500 hours he arrived from Porto Rotondo, where in the morning he inspected the security work going on at his two villas on the Costa Smeralda. After a brief visit to Marcherio to see his family, he returned to Arcore, where he installed himself in front of his fax machines and teleprinters to bring himself up to date on the day's political developments. [Testa] The Milan attorney's office is requesting [Northern League leader] Umberto Bossi's remittal for trial. Is this an obstacle to your government? [Berlusconi] No, I do not think so. The foundations of the alliance remain intact. The election results mean that the country's moderate majority enjoy political representation. By preventing the Left from acceding to government, we have done 80 percent of the work. Now we still have to do the remaining 20 percent -- to form a good government. There is already agreement on the program, condensed into a draft version of 24 pages. The government will be ready by the end of the week. [Testa] Will it also include ministers belonging to the National Alliance [AN]? Many people, including authoritative foreign politicians, are demanding that there be no neo-fascist ministers. [Berlusconi] There will be ministers of Forza Italia, the League, and the AN, too, of course -- but people who do not have an illiberal past. And there will also be people who do not belong to the parties of the alliance, people chosen on the basis of their capabilities. And also teachers, businessmen, managers, experts. [Testa] Perhaps from Segni's Pact? Tremonti, for instance? [Berlusconi] There is no agreement on this. We cannot rule out cooperation with individuals, but there are no contacts yet. Certainly, Tremonti is excellent. [Testa] Will Antonio Martino be foreign minister? [Berlusconi] I think that would be right. [Testa] And Dini treasury minister? [Berlusconi] I would say so. [Testa] What about the interior minister? Will it be a League member? [Berlusconi] No comment. I can tell you that the League has never officially made any such request. What it has requested, however, is responsibility for local government, but unfortunately the ministry cannot be split in two. [Testa] What about [Radical leader] Marco Pannella? [Berlusconi] I would like him to join the government. [Testa] Has the League reaffirmed its veto? [Berlusconi] No comment. [Testa] Certainly Di Pietro will not join your government. The Milan prosecutor's office remains unchanged. Are you disappointed? [Berlusconi] There have never been any approaches, either official or unofficial, by the prime minister to Di Pietro, who, I repeat, I greatly esteem. Those were just journalistic rumors. Be that as it may, I think the matter is now entirely closed. [Testa] Still on the subject of the Milan prosecutor's office, the magistrates have made it known that the corruption investigations will continue along their path. It is a long path. However, some people are in favor of a solution.... [Testa] Yes, I know. I have always said that accounts must always be settled. So I think that we must proceed, go ahead, and hold the trials. This, of course, so that justice can be done, with no desire for revenge. No, there must be no whitewashes, but I do believe that in the future we must also start considering possible solutions. In the past few days I have been pondering certain things. The political class has been almost totally renewed; the great prominence with which the media is reporting this and the dramatic television representation of the trials are themselves a kind of punishment, of atonement, as far as image is concerned. Then there are the businessmen: Often they had no other way to enable their factories to function... [Testa] One of the businessmen that has been charged is your brother, Paolo. Are you worried? [Berlusconi] Of course, it would be better for such things not to happen. But how can you expect a businessman to carry the cross? Be that as it may, I have not been active in public construction programs since 1976; there were things about it that I did not like. And I am glad that I made that decision. [Testa] With regard to the corruption trials, are you opposed to the presence of television cameras in the court rooms? [Berlusconi] I have always been so. It is barbaric; justice cannot be turned into trial by the masses. [Testa] Let us return to the government, to the problem of guarantors and the criticism that is leveled at you: namely, that the subject of supervision has himself appointed his own supervisors... [Berlusconi] I did not choose the three experts on my own. They were chosen on the basis of suggestions from several people. But I will be surrounded by guarantors, by ministers, by parliament, by the opposition forces, by the media, by the public, by the public prosecutors' offices, by the antitrust committee, by the television watchdog committee. Furthermore, there is no reason why the three experts cannot introduce further changes. [Testa] What about blind trusts? [Berlusconi] That is impossible in the case of enterprises and factories. [Testa] Will you sell your television companies? [Berlusconi] I am not even considering it. My appointment could last a year, a month, or a day. And I have five children. Anybody with a little common sense can understand that. [Testa] But has the president asked you to do so? [Berlusconi] No. Scalfaro is someone with a great deal of common sense. But I would also point out that people voted for me partly because they know that I will be able to distinguish between my own interests and the country's. They know that I will never make a decision that could benefit my own companies. People are sensible.
