Yun Se-tal over the recent scandal surrounding the misappropriation of public donations to charity by officials at some countries under his control. Yi Kyong-ho, assistant minister of home affairs, will be named new Kyonggi governor, a government spokesman said. The government also sacked O Song-su, Songnam City mayor who is being dismissed for his "problematic" wealth accumulation, and Kim Hak-kyu, Hwasong County chief, with regard to the charity scandal, the official said. Ha Yong-su, director-general of transportation and tourism affairs at Kyonggi provincial government, will receive disciplinary measures, according to the spokesman. The dismissals came after the Home Affairs Ministry completed Thursday its 10-day inspection of affiliated organizations including Kyonggi provincial government over the misappropriation of charity funds. The ministry's inspection was undertaken after the Board of Audit and Inspection announced last week that some government agencies had misappropriated charity funds donated by the public for other purposes. The dismissed governor had used donations for the poor for personal expenses and O was found to have forcibly collected 3.9 billion won from construction firms as charity funds, the spokesman said.
