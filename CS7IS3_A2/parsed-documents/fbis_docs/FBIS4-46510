NA: "Strengthen Discipline and Learn To Work in a New Way"] [Text] The chief of the Main Directorate of Indoctrination and Socio-Psychological Work of the Ministry of Defense, Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar, spoke to the attendees and instructor personnel of the Scientific-Research and Methodological Center of the main directorate on April 26. These meetings with educational officers who are studying at the two-month skills-enhancement courses have become a tradition. Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar called the attention of the officers to the political situation surrounding the Crimea, and related in detail the work of the Ministry of Defense [MO] delegation during the recent meeting of the ministers of defense of Ukraine and Russia in Sevastopol. Anatoliy Oleksiyovych, speaking of problems in the life and activity of the military and the tasks of the bodies for indoctrination and socio-psychological work, dwelled on such important elements as mobilization readiness, the development of new forms and methods of influencing the personnel, military discipline and the training of cadres for indoctrination and socio-psychological work. He pointed out in particular that the work of the bodies for VSPR [indoctrination and socio-psychological work] aimed at resolving the tasks of mobilization readiness is proceeding too slowly. This is explained by the fact, said Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar, that we have squandered progressive work experience in this area and appreciably weakened its base. The task was posed to the officers in this regard, and directions for activity were indicated, of teaching people during periods of measures relating to mobilization readiness, gathering the necessary information and creating a suitable educational-materials base. There are substantial areas of unfinished work that must be eliminated in the functional duties of the deputy battalion and company commanders for indoctrination and socio-psychological work with regard to the training and indoctrination of the more active core personnel from among conscript servicemen. It was pointed out that these classes (actions at various levels of combat readiness) should necessarily conclude with the combat coordination of the subunits and the active personnel. The chief of the Main Directorate for VSPR, speaking of the development of new methods of influencing servicemen, emphasized that we should have a creative approach to the indoctrination of people, rather than simply carrying over mindlessly the forms and methods of former party-political work, and make more extensive use of television and radio, newspapers and journals so as to create an information expanse not just within the Armed Forces, but also all around them. The capabilities of humanities training, the Centers for Culture and Leisure, ethnic studies rooms and unit clubs are also not being utilized to the full extent, the speaker pointed out. Opportunities in the regions where units are stationed should also be utilized more extensively in this regard. Particular attention was devoted to the upsurge in military discipline, and strengthening it. Concern was expressed with regard to the fact that some officers and warrant officers have been avoiding indoctrination work with their subordinates, and are moreover themselves not setting an example with regard to service. The tasks of the educational officers flow out of this; they should, figuratively speaking, take their place in battle in the prevailing situation. This signifies that they should not stand in for the work of the commanders, they should not duplicate them, but should rather supplement that work with the specific forms and methods that are characteristic of VSPR. It was understood that the deputy commanders for VSPR, in order to conduct indoctrination and socio-psychological work successfully in the collectives, have to improve their own knowledge and skills more actively, making maximum use for that purpose of the opportunities of the Professional Training Day in the units. All of the workers in indoctrination and socio-psychological work must be given opportunities for training on that day. Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar answered the questions of those in attendance after his speech.
