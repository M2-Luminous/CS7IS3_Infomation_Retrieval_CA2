Mr Lu, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said he hoped the two sides would reach agreement as soon as possible. "I think there is no major obstacle," he said in Beijing before meeting a delegation from the Hong Kong Chinese Manufacturers' Association. In Hong Kong, leaders of the Joint Liaison Group ended the first day of the 16th round of formal negotiations on defence land after progress was made in last week's informal meetings. British team leader Alan Paul said the informal meetings conducted since last Tuesday were "positive" and had succeeded in narrowing differences. "Both sides are doing their very best to bring these discussions to a successful conclusion as early as possible," he said. His Chinese counterpart, Chen Zuo'er, said the two sides were making progress. Both refused to give a date for the liaison group's forthcoming plenum, expected to be held by the end of the month. Last month, both [as published] sides failed to strike a long-expected deal on the military land, with China accusing Britain of a lack of co- operation. Mr Chen said Britain had withheld information which China had demanded for seven years. But he did not specify what was wanted. Britain said China had raised "new demands" including a request for a bigger naval basin and the with holding of one of the 25 military sites it had promised to give to the Government for redevelopment.
