There is no doubt that Egypt has not faced such a disturbing phenomenon in its modern history. Despite all the measures that the police are adopting with courage and devotion, the conditions that produce terrorism still exist, whether internally as a result of economic and social difficulties, the weakness of the political influence of the parties and the popular organizations, and the inability of some services to fulfill their role, particularly in the information field, or externally as a result of interference by some states that support the terrorists with money and political guidance. Combating and ending terrorism is difficult to accomplish through the security services alone. A studied and integrated plan to group the responsible ministries in a higher council for combating terrorism is needed. [passage omitted] The call for national dialogue shows the beginning of interest in and appreciation of the need to mobilize the efforts of all forces that believe in a civilized society and are against terrorism as a method of political action. Until such dialogue, which has caused much argument, takes place, the executive authority must establish this higher council to combat terrorism. This council should include the leaders of the political and party forces in order to have cohesion between the people and the government. Defense Minister Tantawi's statement came at the appropriate time, because it shows the readiness of the Armed Forces to secure the internal front within the framework of constitutional legitimacy. [passage omitted] After 20 years of peace following the October war, we feel that the phenomenon of terrorism exercised by groups that falsely call themselves Muslim have begun to represent a danger and threat to the internal front. This prompts us to ask about the role that the Armed Forces can play. Field Marshal Tantawi answered this question when he said that this can take place through coordination with the various ministries and services. The Armed Forces can provide many services to promote production and develop the services. But this must be done as part of a studied government plan. Nevertheless, coordination between the police and the Armed Forces has become necessary to raise the standard of performance against terrorism. I read a statement by Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi in AL-MUSAWWAR magazine in which he said some policemen are trained by the Army. This is good. But some manifestations indicate that either this is being done on a limited basis or that it is not part of a comprehensive scientific plan to raise the standard of the police force. [passage omitted] This is not a call to give the Armed Forces a bigger role over the other political, legislative, and executive authorities. This is a call for coordination among all the forces that live in Egypt within the framework of a civilized society based on democracy and human rights.
