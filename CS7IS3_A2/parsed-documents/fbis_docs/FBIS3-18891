According to an internal report on the experiences of the 3d Corps in Koblenz, there were problems with supplies and with the transportation of material both for the advance team and for the main contingent of the German unit. In addition, the rapporteurs advise against putting together foreign contingents from so many different units in the future. Such a varied troop could easily get into difficulties in critical situations, the report says. According to the 3d Corps, one of the "basic insights" gained from the Somalia mission is that for future missions "the core of an advance team must be kept ready." The personnel must be put together and be equipped, ready for action. It must be possible to load the equipment into the Bundeswehr transport planes ready-packed. Pallets destined for the Somalia mission were taken apart and the material was loaded into different planes; afterward, it was necessary to put it together "with great difficulties and over the course of days." Army beds and mosquito nets were missing for days. In addition, the rapporteurs suggest taking loading equipment -- that is, fork lifts or elevating trucks -- along on the first materiel transport. The advance team in Belet Huen would have had to unload its equipment with great effort by hand if equipment belonging to Canadian units had not been available by chance. Furthermore, the 3d Corps writes: "In order to unload containers from a ship, one needs container lifters, which are to be loaded on the first ship in such a way that they are available immediately upon arrival." In addition, because of the great number of containers it was impossible to know "where which container with what contents was at what time." According to the report, critical situations were "an exception at best," also because the entire mission was conducted from one base. The unit, which consisted of soldiers from more than 200 sections, would have been in much greater danger in a critical situation than a unified unit would have been. In addition, this variety did "not make" internal leadership "easier." Therefore, the 3d Corps suggests using "unified and cohesive units" in the future. One must also reconsider the command structure, because, as a result of the many tasks of the commander, a speedy reaction and command would have been "at least doubtful" in critical situations. The 3d Corps stresses that the materiel has proved its worth, even though "our gun is too heavy because of the amount of ammunition that has to be taken along." Independent reconnaissance for the Bundeswehr would also have been important. For future operations, one must work out a reconnaissance concept, which was not possible in Somalia because of constitutional restrictions. The report is restrained regarding the political assessment. However, it says: "In view of the changed quality of UN operations, a clear separation between Chapters VI and VII of the UN Charter is no longer possible. The transitions are flowing." There is great danger that one has to fulfill one's own assignment with military force, and is thus dragged into a mission on the basis of Chapter VII, which regulates combat missions.
