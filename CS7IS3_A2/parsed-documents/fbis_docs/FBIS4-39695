The letter was delivered through registered mail to the address: Sergey Filatov, c/o the President, Moscow, the Kremlin. Therefore, one would have thought, it is at the disposal of Boris Yeltsin's staff. This missive is an open letter, that is to say it is intended for public consumption. Which is why we feel free to disclose its contents. Having reminded the president that in August 1991 he lauded "Liberty," several of its employees complained that this radio station "has been in past years one of the targets of the KGB," which had infiltrated its agents there. They asked Boris Yeltsin to emulate Vaclav Havel who "has submitted information on the agents who worked at one time or who still continue to work for the Czechoslovak service," and "to declassify the list of KGB agents infiltrated (or recruited) in Radio Liberty. One can appreciate the radio station's employees' anxiety -- that any of their colleagues may turn out to be a secret enemy. Among those who signed the letter, there are not many names known to listeners -- but then this too is understandable because an average employee is often in no position to see who is who, and some help from the president of Russia, who is known for his ability to work in the realm of personnel, could be useful to such an employee. In the meantime, according to some information, the staff of the radio station financed by the U.S. Congress may be cut, especially in the process of the possible move of its headquarters from Munich to Prague. Most certainly, when personnel cuts are inevitable, employees not too certain of their future cannot but do their best to show their political loyalty while at the same time fingering those bosses who should be fired in their stead. Incidentally, some sources report that being discussed in Moscow is the following version of a reply to the letter -- to propose to President Clinton to declassify the lists of CIA agents at Radio Liberty, first in order to compare them with the Russian list, and second in order that the radio station's chiefs could see who of their employees are regarded by special services as pros.
