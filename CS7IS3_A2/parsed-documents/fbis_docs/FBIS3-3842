Over the years, Jiangsu has been one of the provinces delivering a large portion of its revenue to the central government. In 1993, Jiangsu's gross national product [GNP] totaled 255 billion yuan, an increase of 18.5 percent over the previous year. Per capita income in the year amounted to 3,270 yuan. The province delivered 7.6 billion yuan to the state last year. Shen Daren, who has held the offices of member of the Ningxia CPC Committee and secretary of the Jiangsu CPC Committee for 17 years, told this reporter that Jiangsu's 1994 economic growth is set at 12 percent, 3 percentage points higher than the country's average. At the same time, Jiangsu will seek unity of economic efficiency and growth. Shen Daren said that the purpose of the system of revenue-sharing between the central and localities, which came to effect commencing 1 January this year, is to enhance the state's capability of macroeconomic regulation and control. This will offer reliable guarantee for China's sustained, rapid, and steady economic growth. Thanks to this reform, Jiangsu and many other provinces will be in a relatively fair position for competition. However, it will also temporarily affect the interests of some parts of Jiangsu. To this end, Jiangsu's attitude is that local and partial interests should be subordinate to those of the central. Jiangsu will resolutely maintain the authority of the central government and proceed in all cases from the overall situation. The leaders at all levels in Jiangsu should explain this to the broad ranks of the people and seek unity of thinking. As the country's reform has entered a crucial stage, Chairman Shen said Jiangsu will implement the reforms introduced by the central government in a down-to-earth manner.
