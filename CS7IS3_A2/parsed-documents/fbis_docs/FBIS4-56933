Ricardo Levene will temporarily replace him. This move threatens to prompt another crisis in the country's top court, this time it is closely linked to salary demands by the sector's employees. Nazareno's resignation was considered today during a plenum in which only six of the court's nine members participated. The justices named Ricardo Levene to replace Nazareno for a period of 20 days. Levene held this post until 1993 when Julio Boggiano, the previous president of the court, took over. The decision was made known this afternoon. It has been decided "to elect a new president on 8 June at 1000." The resignation came just a day after a meeting on 5 May between Nazareno, Guillermo Lopez, Carlos Fayt, President Carlos Menem, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, and Justice Minister Jorge Mairano. The justices demanded a solution to the salary demands of judicial branch employees who have been carrying out a long term action plan. The executive branch told them the answer must come from the sector's budget and that the only alternative would be to freeze unfilled vacancies and make available funds pertaining to employees that have not yet been named. This alternative was confirmed on 5 May by Maiorano, who visited the Supreme Court to participate in a ceremony in which the informatics system was inaugurated. The decision to accept Nazareno's resignation was made during a meeting in which Justices Augusto Belluscio, Santiago Petracchi, and Gustavo Bossert did not participate. [passage omitted]
