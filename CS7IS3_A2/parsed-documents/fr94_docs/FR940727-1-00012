FR940727-1-00012 FR940727-1-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;70&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 Series Airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (Military) Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system. This proposal is prompted by an FAA determination that, in the event of a failure of the number 2 bus tie relay and the subsequent loss of electrical power source of the number 2 engine, an all-engine flameout event could occur due to fuel starvation during or shortly after a fuel dumping operation. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system due to a failure of the number 2 DC bus electrical relay and the subsequent loss of electrical power source of the number 2 engine. DATES: Comments must be received by September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;70&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;70&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On October 1, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;06, amendment 39&hyph;8392, (57 FR 47570, October 19, 1992), applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 airplanes, Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes, and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes. That AD requires revising the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include information to specify that electrical malfunctions may render the automatic fuel dump termination feature inoperative. That action was prompted by an incident in which the automatic fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system became inoperative, and fuel was dumped below the minimum allowable level. Dumping fuel below the minimum allowable level could lead to an all-engine-out condition. Since issuance of that AD, an in-depth review has revealed that the fuel dump shutoff system on Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A airplanes is such that, in the event of a failure of the number 2 bus tie relay and the subsequent loss of electrical power source of the number 2 engine, an all-engine flameout event could occur due to fuel starvation during or shortly after fuel dumping operations. This condition, if not corrected, could render the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system inoperable due to a failure of the number 2 DC bus electrical relay and the subsequent loss of the number 2 electrical power source. The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 28&hyph;208, dated April 14, 1994, that describes procedures for modification of the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system. This modification provides isolation of the engine fuel system, which entails installation of new fuel relays and, for certain airplanes, relocation of existing relays. Further, this modification also revises the electrical wiring for the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system to provide redundant electrical power sources, which minimizes the possibility of system loss in the event of a number 2 engine shutdown. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require modification of the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. Accomplishment of this modification will terminate the requirement imposed by paragraph (b) of AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;06 to revise the FAA-approved AFM, which cautioned that electrical malfunctions may render the automatic fuel dump termination feature inoperative. [ Note: On March 23, 1994, the FAA issued AD 94&hyph;07&hyph;07, amendment 39&hyph;8865 (59 FR 15853, April 5, 1994), applicable to certain Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F airplanes, to require a similar modification to terminate the requirement imposed by paragraph (a) of AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;06.] There are approximately 425 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 221 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 9 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $1,560 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $454,155, or $2,055 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
