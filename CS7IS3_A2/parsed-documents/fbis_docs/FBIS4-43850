It was determined that 3,024 donums of land belonging to the Turkish Cypriot Waqf appeared in the land registration records as Greek Cypriot properties; 88 donums appeared as belonging to the British Defense Ministry; and 24 donums appropriated by the Greek Cypriot administration under the name of the Cyprus Republic. The Turkish Cypriot experts who examined the land registration records starting from 1912 one by one, determined that 3,136 of the 4,638 donums in the closed area of Maras, belong to Abdullah Pasha Waqf and Lala Mustafa Pasha Waqf. The remaining 1,493 donums are properties which are not owned by the Wagfs.
