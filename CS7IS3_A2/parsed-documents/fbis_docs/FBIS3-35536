In the name of the Red Star and Red Eagle Battalions and on behalf of the militant nationalist forces, the joint command pledged to the martyrs and the Palestinian people in the occupied territores to take revenge on the occupation and the settlers. The two fronts appealed to the international community to act immediately to secure peace and protection for the Palestinian people under occupation, and called on the PLO command to learn from what is taking place in the occupied territories and to suspend the separate negotiations and the destructive partial deals which have catastrophic results on the Palestinian people. The two fronts hold the Israeli Army responsible for this crime.
