Khalykov, chief of the Turkmen State Railroad, by V. Veys, GUDOK correspondent: "The Site of the Meeting Is Ashkhabad"; Ashkhabad, date not given] [Text] As we know, the next, 11th meeting of the Council for Railroad Transport of the Commonwealth Member-States is to be held in Ashkhabad. In connection with this, Kh. Khalykov, chief of the Turkmen State Railroad, answers our correspondent's questions. [Veys] What caused this decision and what is the state of readiness for the coming meeting? [Khalykov] At the previous meeting in Voronezh, our railroad's proposal was accepted. It was supported by the government of Turkmenistan. We are preparing to receive and house the delegations, and wish to create for our guests the optimal conditions for work and leisure. The necessary accommodations have already been selected, and by the beginning of May everything will be ready to receive the delegations from the Commonwealth countries. [Veys] What are the main problems for the participants in the meeting to discuss? [Khalykov] We already have some preliminary outlines of the coming agenda, and they are the logical outcome of the decisions made at previous meetings. Most important, probably, will be the problem of applying a new procedure for making out transport documents and exacting carriage charges to transport freight in interstate and international service. Today each administration, each road must wait for someone, in order for them in turn to pay their debts. But how to do this in a civilized manner is the problem. The well-being of more than just the roads -- of the commonwealth and of the countries themselves to whom these roads belong -- depends on the correct solution to it. In Voronezh, incidentally, it was decided to convert to making settlements in Swiss Francs and, obviously, the first results of the clearing operations will provide a great deal of practical material for those participating in the meeting. The experts on the Council consider it quite important to include in the coming agenda for the meeting, questions of official-claim work, the application of unified norms for transporting freight in interstate service and the introduction of new locking-sealing devices. [Veys] What is the position of the Turkmen government on setting up relations with the railroads of the Commonwealth? [Khalykov] All the Council's decisions are interpreted positively. Right now Turkmenistan is actively developing its transport system. In fact, until the declaration of independence, our country had only spur railroad lines in the south and west. It is fully realistic and expedient to extend them in this direction, which will make it possible for Turkmenistan to have rail links with Iran and Turkey, and across them -- to other countries. Today our railroad is a member of the International Union of Railroads. The country's government has been of great service in this. [Veys] Is the Turkmen state railroad under any special conditions, as compared with other Commonwealth roads? [Khalykov] We have quite a few problems. It is particularly important today to develop a reliable base for rolling stock repair. We are seeking the possibility of manufacturing the basic elements of track installation and communication and signalization systems that are new in principle. We are also seeking to electrify the mainlines and acquire new diesel locomotives and railcars. This has been achieved to quite an extent through setting up warm relations with the railroads of the CIS countries, and with Russian and Ukrainian enterprises. Railroad specialists from European and Asian countries come to us more and more often. As the previous meetings of the Council showed, concern for our railroad is inseparable from the problems of other Commonwealth mainlines. It would appear that, for their more successful solution on a collective basis, it is important to improve the Council's work in the future, as well. Until the meeting in Ashkhabad!
