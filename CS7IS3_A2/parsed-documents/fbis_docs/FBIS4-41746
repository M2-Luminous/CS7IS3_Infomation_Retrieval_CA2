According to the premier, the draft laws include a series of major changes in the tax code for foreign investors. It is proposed to free enterprises with foreign capital from the profit tax for five years after registration, to remove the limitations on capital movement, and to give foreign investors (meaning businesses 100 per cent funded by foreign capital) the right to own land if they construct a new building or expand production. In addition, businesses with foreign capital will be able to keep all the profit in foreign currency which they receive by exporting goods they produce in Russia. The import of machines, technological equipment, spare parts, raw materials, and component parts for production uses will not be subject to taxes or customs duties.
