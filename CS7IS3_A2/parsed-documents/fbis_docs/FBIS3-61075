But the meeting between Colonel-General Andrey Nikolayev, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Border Troops, and Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev introduced some new nuances. When we were driving into Kaspiysk I read the following slogan in a prominent place: "The friendship of the USSR's peoples is inviolable!" And nearby, in a tourist center, the 41st Makhachkala Border Detachment was settling in. That's a sign of the times, G. Gereykhanov, the detachment's Acting Deputy Commander, sighed; we used to guard the border with Turkey and Iran in Nakhichevan, but the local branch of the Azerbaijani People's Front [APF] made our job intolerable. Bloodshed was just a step away -- officers were barely able to restrain their subordinates in the face of the constant threats and insults directed at them. In October 1992 the detachment was withdrawn from there, but without hardware and ammunition, with just its uniforms. The APF members did not even allow the Border Troops to conduct a military ritual, that is, leave with a color platoon. "Take your flag and beat it," they were told. Now the border with Turkey and Iran is virtually open here. Nor did other regions treat the Russian Border Troops with excessive consideration during the sovereignty bandwagon. Last February a border detachment was withdrawn from Lenkoran to Vladikavkaz. Again with just their passports, you know. But let us go back to the Makhachkala detachment. There is no heating at the tourist center and it is damp. The local population gave the strangers in green a cool reception. That may be why there is still less than half the full complement of officers here. The Lezgins' "Sadval" national-patriotic movement is campaigning to set up an independent state of Lezgistan in the area of Dagestan where they have compact communities and opposes the erection of internal borders between Russia and Azerbaijan. Recently a sentry was killed right at his post in the detachment. I saw from conversations with the Border Troops that they are impatient for a final political decision from Moscow on whether there should or should not be an internal border. However, that decision cannot be adopted without the sides' mutual participation. Col-Gen Andrey Nikolayev, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Federation Border Troops, met with Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev in Baku on 3 January. He spoke briefly about the results of the meeting: "For two years there had been no serious contacts with the Azerbaijani leadership on border issues. Today the other side takes an understanding view of these issues and agrees to consider our proposals. I think that we will reach agreement...." And agreement is needed. The external border with Turkey and Iran is guarded worse now that it was under the Russian Border Troops owing to poor technical equipment and inadequate cadre training. The upshot is that drugs, contraband, and weapons are being smuggled across the border. If you consider that Turks can enter this friendly republic without visas and then "pass" into Russia, there is no option but to put up a barrier. But who benefits from this? Today Azerbaijani leader Geydar Aliyev enjoys great prestige among his own people. He is above all respected for his commonsense approach to politics. The state's entry into the CIS is evidence of that. He is also respected for his firmness. When mass desertion from the army began, it is said that the shooting of two deserters and a promise not to punish those who voluntarily returned to their troop units made people see sense -- lines formed up outside military commissariats to return to bases. People in the Republic are now saying that the two power ministries -- the Defense Ministry and the National Security Committee [NSC] -- are opposing Aliyev. It is said that the President is not that young and it is time to share power. And a struggle for power has developed between the Defense Ministry and the NSC. Their methods include the following: They claim that the introduction of Russian Border troops on the external border marks a threat to Azerbaijan's sovereignty. The card of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is also played. During conversations with ordinary Baku people I often heard the following: There is nothing for us to share with Armenia, no one wants the the war (the surprising thing is that Azerbaijan and Armenia have not declared war on one another and are members of the CIS and the Commonwealth collective security system), it is those people who are fighting for power who want it. And one young Azerbaijani officer accompanying us admitted frankly that he is still meeting an Armenian girl living in Baku. What about the Russian Border Troops? Should they be in Azerbaijan? If so, what kind of presence should it be? Only time will provide the answers to these questions. But in our view, the role of the Border Troops has sharply increased since the Russian Ministry of Security was abolished. Along with guarding borders, the Russian Federal Border Service has begun implementing Russia's foreign policy in nearby foreign countries. "Russia is the place to which integration forces are looking today," Andrey Nikolayev told your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent. "You might say that the turning point was last September, when the CIS economic union was formed. We want to strengthen the Commonwealth of Independent States -- states with equal rights and duties. By closing external borders, the Border troops are helping to open up internal borders for the development of economic ties within the CIS." Asked what the Russian Federation will spend on guarding external CIS borders, A. Nikolayev replied: "In Armenia, Georgia, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan Russian Border Troops operate in conjunction with these states' subunits under the combined command of the Russian Federation Border Troops. Expenditure is split equally. In Turkmenistan expenditure will depend on the extent to which Russian Border Troops participate in guarding the border. We will cooperate with Kazakhstan and Belarus in providing troops with technical equipment and training cadres. The Russian Federation's national interests will not be infringed. We espouse the idea that there are CIS external borders which must be guarded together. "We must move on from a system of mutual rights to a system of mutual obligations."
