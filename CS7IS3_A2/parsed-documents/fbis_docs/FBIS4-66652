Some Truths About the Armed Groups" -- first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] [Text] The meeting between Layada, who at the time was an "emir" of the GIA [Armed Islamic Group], and Abderazak Redjam, who was in charge of information for the dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], well illustrates this determination by the FIS to take over terrorism. When Boukhamkham and Djeddi say that their bosses have made no commitment to bring an end to terrorism, they know whereof they speak. However the FIS, the initiator of the violence, does not control the armed groups; it is but one part of them. The student has sort of surpassed his teacher. But the dissolved party has never given up in its attempt to take over the terrorist groups. But this effort has been in vain, since the terrorist bosses cut the hierarchical link before the legislative elections, since they thought that the FIS's two leaders had failed in their mission to establish an Islamic state. The meeting between Layada, who at the time was an "emir" of the GIA, and Abderazak Redjam, who was in charge of information for the dissolved FIS, well illustrates this determination by the FIS to take over terrorism. At the beginning of 1993, the two men held a meeting in El-Biar, at La Scala, at the insistence of Redjam. It was decided to suspend the publication of the ENNAFIR (Redjam) and ECHAHADA (Layada) newsletters because their contents were contradictory. It was also decided to suspend the "Wafa" pirate radio station, whose news regarding the GIA's actions was untruthful. Indeed, during each program, that radio station announced that "thousands" of police and soldiers had been killed, that there had been epic scuffles, and other wildly inflated stories. But the meeting also addressed "the drawing up of a joint working platform in anticipation of a congress that would bring together all clandestine factions and the leadership of the dissolved FIS." Redjam's attempt to take over is clear. For the second meeting, Layada demanded that Mohamed Said, whose real name is Lounis Belkacem, be present, "for more credibility." The latter would not come and Layada refused to continue the discussions with Redjam. Another member of the FIS similarly issued an invitation to the GIA for the same purpose. A dispirited Omar El Eulmi, the president of the SIT [Islamic Labor Syndicate], was working under the command of Mansouri El Miliani. He charged Djaafar El Afghani with pleading his cause with Layada. Layada received him in a hut next to the Draa-Dis Mosque. "I expressed my wish to see El Eulmi join our organization, which lacked a figure of his stature in the religious area," Layada would say. He would go on to say that it was on the basis of El Eulmi's fatwas that elements from the armed groups had become uncontrollable, carrying out assassinations left and right. Interference by the FIS is not welcomed by the GIA's "emirs," who are already faced with constant leadership wars. So a defiant Layada stated that "the assassinations of certain intellectuals was the work of the FIS's clandestine leadership. Redjam had drawn up a list of intellectuals to be assassinated by small groups that the police were not searching for." The GIA thus saw its monopoly on terror threatened by the FIS. Also money was at the root of quarrels between the dissolved party and the armed movement. A major call for a return to order was necessary before Iqbal Madani returned some of the money he was holding in Morocco. How are the huge sums that come from holdups, racketeering, and gifts managed? The way in which the money coming from the holdup of the BEA [Algerian External Bank] on Rue de la Liberte was used will provide an idea: 100,000 French francs [Fr] were given to Abassi Madani's son Iqbal by Hocine Abdelhamid to "acquire weapons from Morocco and bring them in." Did Madani Iqbal abscond with the money? "These weapons did not arrive," Layada said. He met Madani Iqbal at the Khaled Hotel in Oujda. He demanded from him the money that had been collected abroad "while making a death threat against him." Madani Iqbal acknowledged the facts and hinted that the Fr100,000 had helped purchase the PM Uzis, which had been brought into Algeria. With Zaoui Ahmed present, "next the money collected by Madani Iqbal abroad, and which amounted to 750,000 dollars, was deducted." Doubtful that these funds had really helped purchase weapons, Layada made him "sign an IOU." To demonstrate "his good conduct with regard to the armed Islamic groups," Madani Iqbal offered Layada a batch of weapons hidden in his Mercedes. Madani Iqbal had purchased six other luxury vehicles and driven them into Algeria. When the events and the statements by the arrested terrorists have been reviewed, it becomes clear that the GIA, often led by semi-illiterates, is but a fragile assemblage of small groups led by local emirs who derive their authority from violence. The first groups formed before the electoral process was interrupted. Layada would be quick to be put on the scent of these new armed groups being put together. At a meeting at the Bachir El-Ibrahimi Mosque, the decision was made to "make contact with the other groups being put together so as to be better acquainted and adopt a common action strategy, and to move directly to armed action if that is necessary." One week later, representatives from the armed groups in Boufarik, Blida, Baraki, El-Biar, and the Casbah met at the Fares Mosque (Casbah). A dejected Khiar Mohamed, upon being named the coordinator for these groups, emphasized "the need to move to armed action by declaring a jihad against miscreants and anything that symbolized the state." Armed actions against representatives of the security forces, which are symbols of the state, were planned. The aim was also to acquire weapons. So it was following the June 1991 insurrection that armed groups began to form under the aegis of Chebouti Abdelkader, Mansouri El-Miliani, Allal Mohamed, and others. They went into action before the electoral process was interrupted (with attacks on the Blida courthouse, the Guemmar barracks, etc.). Layada went underground after the national gendarmerie burst into his home in Baraki, where he had been with some other terrorists. His life was saved because he hid behind his sister-in-law and fired on the darak's captain. The latter did not wish to fire back lest he kill the woman. Layada escaped and hid in Blida. But it was the events in Tamezguida that were to propel him to the rank of "national emir." Allal Mohamed, nicknamed Moh Leveilley, the head of the GIA, was wounded during the attack on the city Surete of Draria on 20 May 1992. He charged Layada, who at that time was his official driver, with reconstituting his groups. Allal Mohamed "chose to work in isolation in relation to the other armed groups led by Chebouti and Mansouri El-Miliani." Hocine Abderrahim, the financier behind the attack on the airport--who was sentenced to death and executed--, failed in his many attempts to bring them together. For the reconciliation meeting held in Zbarbar in April 1992, which was attended by Mansouri El-Miliani, Chebouti Abdelkader, and Hocine Abderrahim, Allal Mohamed had sent a representative. His attitude was that "he was not ready to accept working under the aegis of Mansouri El- Miliani or Chebouti because they were not action leaders and thus could not measure up to him." Layada returned to Algiers, to Draa Dis, so he could better supervise "Moh Levilley"'s armed groups. Incessant harassment by the police forced the latter to send his terrorists to Tamezguida (Blida). Touati Achour, the emir for that region, put storage rooms, which had long been readied, at their disposal. It was then that the famous reconciliation meeting took place that had been brought about in September 1992 by Allal Mohamed, whose ambition it was to become the national emir. His argument: "He had the hard core of the armed groups at his disposal." Chebouti, "armed with an MAT 49," Allal Mohamed, "armed with a PA, Si Ahmed Mourad, alias Djaafar El-Afghani--shot down in Bouzareah--, "armed with a PA," Hocine Abderrahim, and others were present. The fierce leadership battle had begun. Owing to the "disorder," the agenda was postponed. Chebouti kept his title as national emir and each armed group would "continue to be active in its area, according to its means." At dawn, the forces of the National People's Assembly [ANP] intervened. "Each man fled on his own without asking about the others." Layada, Chebouti, and Touati Achour would flee on foot through mountains and on trails until reaching Larbaa, where they found refuge in ammunition storage rooms. Makhloufi Said, who had boycotted "the Tamezguida meeting," was suspected to having collaborated with the security forces. It was only on the fourth day that Layada learned his boss had died. The post of emir had fallen vacant... Towards the end of October 1992, in a bungalow, which a woman had made available to them in Baraki, Layada was unanimously named national emir. A disheartened Afghan, Sedjane Khaled, the main ring leader of the attack on Khaled Nezzar, was charged with rallying the Afghan groups. Attia Sayeh, nicknamed "Younes," who was assumed to have been shot, and Djaafar El-Afghani's successor, was named the emir for the wilaya of Medea. These armed groups reused the GIA's acronym used to designate Mansouri El-Miliani's "dislocated" groups, the majority of whose members had rejoined Layada. The two round seals bearing the letters "GIA," which had previously been used by Mansouri El-Miliani, were recovered. As an aside, they had been manufactured in Pakistan. But it would not be soon before Layada fell as well. In March 1993 he traveled secretly to Morocco at the insistence of activists there and of whom, according to Layada, there was a great number (especially the "Afghans"), who had money and weapons and in no way felt concerned by being in Moroccan territory. When there, they explained to him that an Majlis Ech-Choura [FIS Central Committee] had to be put together and that another "national emir" had to be appointed, as he was accused of being "brutal" and "illiterate." They wanted to substitute a certain Khathir Ben M'hinda, nicknamed "Moussab," the emir of Constantine, for him. The meeting ended without this being accomplished, but Layada's term heading up the GIA was at an end. He was in fact arrested by the Moroccan [police]. Sid Ahmed Mourad succeeded him under circumstances that are totally unknown. As his temporary replacement, since he was killed last March, it has been reported that Sayeh Attia has been named. But for some days now, Attia as well is reported to have been killed. Does a new boss need to be sought from among the names that have been mentioned? In any event, the succession is a "tantalizing" one in view of the booty held by the GIA and confirmed by Layada.
