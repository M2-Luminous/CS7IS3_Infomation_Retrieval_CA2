FR940804-2-00021 FR940804-2-00008 Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993. Case History Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 26, 1994), the following events have occurred. On February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination (USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). On February 28, 1994, we named Acciaierie Valbruna S.r.l. (Valbruna) and Foroni S.p.A. (Foroni) as respondents in this investigation and issued antidumping questionnaires to both companies. These companies accounted for at least 60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b). We presented the questionnaire to Valbruna at its facility in Vicenza, Italy, on March 3, 1994, and to Foroni at its facility in Gorle Minore, Italy, on March 7, 1994. We received responses to Section A of the Department's questionnaire on March 21, 1994, from Foroni and on March 22, 1994 from Valbruna. On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the Department's invitation for such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we received rebuttal comments on this issue. On May 11, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes one class or kind of merchandise. (See May 11, 1994, Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from The Team Re: Class or Kind of Merchandise.) On March 31, 1994, we sent Sections A through D of the Department's questionnaire to Cogne S.p.A. (Cogne) because it requested that it be included in the investigation as a voluntary respondent. On April 14, 1994, Cogne notified the Department that it had decided not to participate as a voluntary respondent in the investigation. On April 26, 1994, the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination until July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the Federal Register (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28, 1994, pursuant to petitioners' request, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c) and (d). On April 29 and May 2, 1994, we received responses to Sections B and C of the Department's questionnaire from Foroni and Valbruna, respectively. On May 18, 1994, petitioners alleged that Valbruna sold the subject merchandise in Italy at prices below its cost of production (COP). Petitioners supplemented their original allegation on June 3, 13, and 22, 1994. Respondent rebutted the allegation on May 24, June 9, 15, 27, and 28, 1994. On June 24, 1994, we determined that petitioners' allegation provided a reasonable basis to believe or suspect below cost sales, pursuant to section 353.51(a) of the Department's regulations. Accordingly, we initiated a sales below cost investigation for Valbruna on June 24, and issued Section D of the Department's questionnaire on the same date. On May 20, 1994, we issued a supplemental questionnaire to both respondents. Valbruna submitted its supplemental response on June 6, 1994, and Foroni on June 8, 1994. On July 19, 1994, Valbruna requested an extension of time until August 5, 1994, to respond to the Section D questionnaire. The Department granted such an extension on July 20, 1994. Also, on July 20, 1994, respondent Valbruna requested that, in the event of an affirmative determination in this investigation, the Department postpone the final determination until 135 days after the date of publication of the preliminary determination in the Federal Register . Such or Similar Comparisons We have determined that all the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar merchandise. We made fair value comparisons on this basis. In accordance with the Department's standard methodology, we first compared identical merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market to compare to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix V to the antidumping questionnaire, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce.
