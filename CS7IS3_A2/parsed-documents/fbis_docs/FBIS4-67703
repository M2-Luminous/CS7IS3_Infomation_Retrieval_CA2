Four years ago, he came here from Bihar looking for work. To begin with, he tried doing menial jobs which, being a drug addict, he found too difficult. He then took to begging, until he stumbled down the more lucrative profession of selling blood. He says an agent from a private blood bank offered him Rs 40 for a bottle. From then, he has been a "regular blood donor," his only means of livelihood. There are more than 150 such Bhirus in the city, inhabiting public parks, railway platforms and busstands, who sell their blood to eke out a living. The dealers have identified them according to their blood groups and whenever they need a particular blood type, the professional donors are summoned. In the absence of adequate government facilities, private blood banks and nursing homes pay their donors about Rs 50 to Rs 70 for a unit, the charge between Rs 400 and Rs 700 from patient. The price shoots up if it is a scarce group like "O" negative. However, what is causing concern are the impurities and diseases transmitted through the blood, since the donors live in unhygienic conditions. A recent case, in which a patient acquired the AIDS virus after getting transfusion at a private hospital here, is considered to be the tip of the iceberg. The patient had tested HIV negative when he was admitted. Doctors do not discount the possibility that many more similar cases may have gone unnoticed, the patient falling prey to an un-related disease many years later. According to the health authorities, of the 54 AIDS cases detected in the city so far, 17 are believed to have been acquired through blood transfusion. Private blood banks are loathe to conduct the mandatory tests as they would cost about Rs 350 per donor. But in the absence of such checks, diseases like malaria, hepatitis and AIDS can get through. Amritsar is the only city in the state where licences have been issued to private blood banks, and a move is afoot to cancel them. But the owners have obtained stay orders from the court and thus the business continues. Though there are three licenced dealers in the city, they have opened retail outlets near all the prominent government hospitals. These were sealed by the authorities last week after an AIDS case was detected there. In nursing homes, too, blood banks are operating illegally. Relatives or friends of patients are made to donate blood with the nursing home keeping a part of it as their commission. The condition of the government-run blood banks, too, is far from satisfactory as there are hardly any regular donors or storage facilities.
