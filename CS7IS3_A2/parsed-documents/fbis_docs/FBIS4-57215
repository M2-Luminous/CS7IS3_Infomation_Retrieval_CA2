Here is this statement: On 11 May, a tragic new scene was played at the Haitian parliament with the alleged appointment of Justice Emile Jonassaint as provisional president of Haiti. We are frankly surprised that Attorney Jonassaint, who was a senator of the Republic, judge of the highest judicial authority of the country, and president of the 1987 Constituent Assembly, agreed to be a party to such a joke by shouldering the responsibility for such a crude violation of the same Constitution [of 1987], writes Firmin Jean-Louis. As president of the National Assembly, we make a point of drawing the attention of the entire nation and the international community in general to the fact that this new abuse of authority is assumed by only five out of 17 senators of the normalized Senate and by eight senators elected in the contested 18 January 1993 elections who are awaiting the verdict of the arbitration committee provided for in the New York pact. As of that moment, as an institution which has rules governing its functioning and a defined procedure, the Haitian parliament is not bound by this new political adventure which has no grandeur and no future. It is not a parliamentary act. Consequently, it is a usurpation of power and must be considered as such, Jean-Louis says. [passage omitted]
