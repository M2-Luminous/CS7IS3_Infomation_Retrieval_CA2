The State Duma May Not Support Them"] [Text] The Russian Federation Security Council and the General Prosecutor's Office are to supervise the implementation of the 5 trillion ruble program to control organized crime. This was announced at a press conference at the end of last week by Security Council Deputy Chairman Vladimir Rubanov and Acting General Prosecutor Aleksey Ilyushenko. On 23 June an expanded collegium will be held at the General Prosecutor's Office on the issue of fighting organized crime. The new program envisions international cooperation in controlling organized crime, as well as participation by a number of ministries and departments. According to Vladimir Rubanov, work is fully under way on implementing the program. Counterintelligence chief Sergey Stepashin reported that in combating organized crime, all regular and covert operation means will be employed. Approximately 800 experienced investigators are to be involved. Stepashin said that there is preliminary agreement with major banks on cooperation. In the very near future documents will be signed on dividing functions between the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] and the Internal Affairs Ministry. Stepashin admitted that in implementing the program, to make sure that the rights of 99 percent of citizens are protected, human rights will be violated to an extent. In this connection, the FCS chief expressed concern that the State Duma may not approve the proposed drastic measures. Responding to questions from journalists, Aleksandr Mikhaylov, chief of the FCS Press Service, who was present at the press conference, said: "If we recall history, in 1918 the capital was swept by robberies and lootings, with people afraid to go out into the street. And then a Moscow commission took emergency measures. The commission made sure that all criminals were caught and shot." In the present conditions, Mikhaylov said, "any tough measures which will be taken with respect to the criminal world will be supported by society."
