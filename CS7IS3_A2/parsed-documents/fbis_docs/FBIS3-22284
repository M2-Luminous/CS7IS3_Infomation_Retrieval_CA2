The article, authored by Sun Pinghua, former deputy secretary general of the China-Japan Friendship Association, points out that some Japanese non-governmental organizations have been enthusiastic about China's efforts at afforestation, sand control and improving rural living conditions. China now has more than 66.7 million ha of barren hills and swamps waiting to be greened, and every year large areas of land are engulfed by sand or threatened by flood, drought, hail or mud-rock flows. Without well-planned, long-term and consistent efforts to improve the environment, China's climate will be affected, as will the climate of China's neighbor, Japan, Sun states. Since its establishment in 1984, the Green China Fund has been making efforts to enhance domestic afforestation and international cooperation. Sun says he hopes that Japanese afforestation organizations can have more contacts with the fund so that Japanese friends will be able to support China's greening activities. The cooperation also requires government involvement, according to Sun. The increased acid rain over Japan have catched [as received] a growing public attention. Some Japanese questioned if it was the result of the untreated coal burning of the Chinese factories. "To reach the conclusion, proof based on scientific researches is needed," Sun noted, adding that this also calls for the cooperation of both sides. During the past few years academic seminars have been held between Japanese and Chinese scholars. However, few of them were related to greening and environmental problems.
