Speaking about his attitude towards Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's decision to appoint his representative in the Crimea, Meshkov said "this happened at the most difficult stage of the establishment of the Crimea's statehood, on the eve of the elections to the parliament." "But we will do everything possible in order that elections go off successfully on 10 April," he added. He said that the Crimea has lost Valeriy Gorbatov, who has been appointed Kravchuk's representative in the Crimea, as its citizen. Meshkov also spoke about the results of his trip to Cyprus where he had reached an agreement to open a Cypriot trade office in the Crimea. Documents to this effect will be signed during Cypriot leaders' visit to the Crimea.
