FBIS4-33533 "drlat110bb_94011" FBIS-LAT-94-110 Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS OAS Secretary General Baena Soares Interviewed OAS Secretary General Baena Soares Interviewed PY0606150394 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1805 GMT 5 Jun 94 PY0606150394 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO Portuguese BFN ["Exclusive" interview with OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena Soares on 2 June; place not given] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [AGENCIA ESTADO] The first test of the OAS resolution signed in Santiago to punish attacks against democracy was the coup d'etat in Haiti, but the organization has subsequently been relegated to the sidelines. Why? [Baena Soares] People say the OAS had three opportunities to apply the Santiago Resolution No. 1080, as if it were a soccer game. They say the OAS lost the first game in Haiti, tied the second in Peru, and won the third in Guatemala. But things are not like that. This is not a game. These are political situations with changing circumstances that require individual treatment. The OAS reacted to the coup immediately. The other positive aspect is that not one member country recognized the de facto government. The third positive result was the organization of an OAS mission under Augusto Ramirez Ocampo which created a favorable climate in the OAS for the signing of two commitments. Nothing new happened subsequently. Everything was included in those two documents. The crisis could have been solved five months after it started. [AGENCIA ESTADO] Why did it not conclude? [Baena Soares] Because of ambiguous behavior, rhetorical support attitudes, and disagreements over OAS decisions, we have not faced the real cause of the problem yet, that is, the coalition between Haitian military and entrepreneurs. That association of interests never accepted the election result of President Jean-Bertrand Aristides. Everything we have done has been peripheral. I think it was not necessary to resort to the United Nations. Compulsory sanctions or recommendations yield the same result or they have no result because both depend on the political willingness to apply them. OAS measures on Haiti were not fully implemented. There was a lot of enthusiasm at the time of voting, but very little enthusiasm to implement them. [AGENCIA ESTADO] There are indications that the United States could be preparing an invasion of Haiti. You made your opposition to the initiative clear. Why? [Baena Soares] The OAS mission in Haiti is a civilian mission. That was the mandate I received from member countries. It is also necessary to see things from a practical point of view. Haiti was invaded and occupied (by the United States) for 19 years. The result was the Duvalier era and General Avril. The consequences of this continue to affect the country today. Therefore, I doubt there is a more effective solution than a peaceful solution, a negotiated solution, to encourage Haitians themselves to define what they want. [AGENCIA ESTADO] We were already negotiating with the Haitian generals but at the moment of surrendering power they went back on their word. [Baena Soares] Why did they go back on their word? Because they felt they had support. I have already seen this film on Haiti three times. We must attack the causes of the problem. [passage omitted]
