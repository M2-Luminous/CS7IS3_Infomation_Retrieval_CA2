It is not quite clear to Russia yet how this will be formulated from the legal point of view. The details will evidently be coordinated in the course of further negotiations, the special envoy of the Russian president, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, told journalists in Moscow on Wednesday. According to him, Russia continues to support the idea of Muslim-Croat integration. "It will be even better if an interesting legal form, capable of drawing a final solution to the problem nearer, is found," Churkin said. In comments on the wish that the Russian leadership would "take a better-balanced stand" expressed by the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, Churkin said: "The very fact that all Bosnian sides complain from time to time that the stand taken by Russia is not balanced well enough points to its correctness and objectivity."
