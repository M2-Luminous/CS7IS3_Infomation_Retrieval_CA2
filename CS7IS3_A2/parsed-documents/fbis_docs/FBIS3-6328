The companies include such leading firms as Pasco Corp., Asia Air Survey Co. and Kokusai Kogyo Co. Pasco and Asia Air Survey Co. were each told to pay 200 million yen, the highest penalty ever brought against a private company for bid-rigging in relation to public works projects. The total of fines also marks the third highest sought by the FTC in such cases. The highest penalties in a bid-rigging case totaled some 1 billion yen against contractors in Saitama Prefecture, near Tokyo, in 1992. The FTC said the aerial survey companies, through one Tokyo-based land measurement association, continued prearranged biddings from around 1984 for map production orders placed by the Construction Ministry's Geographical Survey Institute. The firms also arranged illegal bidding for tenders held by the government and municipal governments for aerial photographic surveys from 1988 to 1992. They reportedly set up intercompany cooperative bodies in several regions to fix successful bidders and contract prices beforehand, the commission said. In February 1993, the FTC ordered the contractors and association to end bid-rigging practices.
