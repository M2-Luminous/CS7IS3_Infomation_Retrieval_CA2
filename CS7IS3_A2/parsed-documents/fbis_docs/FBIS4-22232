For nearly a year, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the presidential structures have been developing and discussing a draft of the basic directions that Ukraine's regional economic policy should take, but so far, as in the case of most key normative and legislative decisions, this document has not been approved by the Supreme Council, even though the president has cited this draft on many occasions in his speeches. As one who took part in drafting individual provisions of the above document at a certain stage of its preparation, the author of this article believes that the implementation of economic independence requires that the state regional policy guarantee local governing organs the following essential powers: a) to make policy regarding the development of education, health care, culture, and other aspects of the social infrastructure, taking into account the historical, national, and demographic characteristics of the given region. Unfortunately, because of the economic crisis, practically nothing is being done at this time to solve these problems; b) to implement measures directed at the socioeconomic revival of the country's rural regions. Towards this end, it is necessary to develop regional programs, based on the national program for social rural renewal, specifying the necessary sources and funds to finance these objectives; c) to create finance and budget as well as credit and banking systems, which would interact with the state system. The regions should have the funds they need to pay for their socioeconomic programs, drawing on various sources of revenues into the budget and into extrabudgetary funds; d) to create a regional taxation system, which would make it possible to create local budgets. As a matter of expediency, a single-channel mechanism for setting up local budgets and allocating their funds should be introduced, based on the premise that they be formed from the bottom up. At present, the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine is inclined to allow only a two-channel system of creating budgets -- through parallel deductions into the local and state budgets; e) to form and regulate the prices of goods and services that are produced by enterprises in the local economy, as well as the prices of other producers' goods, by applying economic levers (taxes, benefits, subsidies, credits). As a matter of fact, pursuant to a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, beginning with this year, the prices of consumer goods and services are to be regulated at the expense of local funds. 5 What should be the directions and mechanism of economic change in the regions? Economic changes will be successful only if the state and the regions comprehensively coordinate their actions. The rules for making the transition to the market should be defined at the state level, while the mechanisms for implementing these rules should operate at the local level. For example, take an important measure on the road to a market economy like privatization. The Supreme Council having passed laws on "large" and "small" privatization, it is up to the regional organs in charge of privatizing state and communal property to implement these laws with the help of an appropriate mechanism -- the creation of investment funds, surety companies, opening of privatization deposit accounts, conducting competitions, auctions, etc. At present, however, the most important thing is to determine what is state-owned and what is communally owned. A battle is being waged over this, making it possible for sharp operators from the local nomenklaturas to conduct so-called property "privatization." That is why the president's edict, which elevates the role of regional subdivisions in charge of privatizing state property, is appropriate. This will make it possible to establish a clearer division between state and communal property and create regional and local communal property funds. It is desirable that local government organs, taking into account territorial features and regional privatization plans, be able to complete most of the "small" privatization of objects this year. Due to bureaucratic red tape and the absence of a well-defined organizational and normative mechanism, the privatization of housing is almost frozen. So far, only some 20 percent of the housing fund has been privatized in Ukraine's cities. The principal cause of this slowdown is that people have been given no guarantees that they will be provided with housing and municipal services. I believe that it is necessary to speed up not only the privatization of housing, but, first and foremost, the privatization of enterprises that provide housing and municipal services. The regional mechanism of economic change requires the necessary levers to foster the development and growth of business enterprise, and, above all, small and medium-sized businesses. In most developed countries, these businesses account for 60 to 90 percent of the total number of enterprises, and their share of output volume constitutes from 40 to 60 percent. Therefore, most questions with respect to the operation of small and medium-sized businesses should be decided locally --beginning with the registration of the relevant business entities and ending with the creation of regional markets for the sale of production. In addition, local government organs should create economic conditions designed to best promote business enterprise: tax benefits, financing, subsidies, etc. At the same time, they should use the same economic levers to restrict business activity that is undesirable in a given region. Although we already have a state law on business enterprise, we have still not worked out a mechanism for regulating the development of business enterprise on a given territory. This mechanism should include the preparation of a regional program (business plan) for the development of business enterprise, the creation of the necessary infrastructure (information and consulting firms, educational centers, investment funds, etc.), the passage by the representative organs of government of certain normative acts on the economic regulation of business development, etc. An essential direction of market-oriented change at the regional level is the creation and development of a market infrastructure, which includes commercial banks, exchanges, advertising, auditing, insurance, and other companies. At present, Ukraine has close to 250 commercial banks. This number is much too small to serve the country's business community. For example, in the United States, there is a banking institution for every five to ten thousand people. But perhaps the interests of a territory are affected most tangibly when we talk of creating the so-called free economic zones (VEZ). According to some sources, there are currently nearly 2,000 VEZ of more than 20 different types in existence in the world. It is possible to find small territories (up to 10 square kilometers in area) in every region of Ukraine that could be turned into free economic zones and serve as centers for attracting foreign investment and technology and for special-purpose means of organizing production that could then be gradually expanded throughout the rest of the territory. But the most suitable territories for free enterprise zones are in the Ukrainian Black Sea region and the border regions in the western part of Ukraine. These territories are conveniently located in transportation and economic terms and ecologically less polluted. The necessary documentation has already been prepared or is in the process of being prepared for free enterprise zones in Zakarpattya, Mykolayiv, Odessa, and Chernivtsi oblasts. Final decisions on the creation of the VEZ are being held up in the center's bureaucratic offices. It would therefore be more expedient to hand over most questions regarding the creation of free enterprise zones and the terms on which they function to be decided by the regional authorities, which would take into consideration interest in creating the appropriate type of VEZ. It is legitimate to ask: is it not possible that the free enterprise zones might result in the realization of separatist aims? As a matter of fact, this fear arose when the government organs of Zakarpattya put forward a proposal for a free enterprise zone in Zakarpattya Oblast. It is true that nowhere else in the world does there exist a free enterprise zone of the kind they have proposed. And if we take into consideration that this proposal calls for the administration of the Zakarpattya VEZ to be autonomous of the state, this is only a step away from political independence. What has been put forward in the Zakarpattya VEZ proposal generally applies to all regions of Ukraine. It is a demand, first and foremost, for economic independence. But then why separate the entire oblast in administrative terms from the state system of government? This being the case, I believe that questions associated with the determination of the status of a free economic zone should be subject to approval by the center. The regional mechanism of market-oriented change can function efficiently only if it includes measures for the social protection of the population of the given territory. The implementation of the directions and mechanisms of economic change in the regions requires rather serious organizational measures and, primarily, certain decisions by the central governing organs, as well as the will and desire of local leaders, broad popular support, and, above all, a sense of overall responsibility for the future of our integral independent Ukraine.
