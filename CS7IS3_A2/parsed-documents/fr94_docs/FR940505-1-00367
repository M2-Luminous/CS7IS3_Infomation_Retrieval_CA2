Such coating application methods shall be approved in writing by EPA. (iii) Solvent cleaning operations; storage and disposal of VOC-containing materials. Cleanup solvents used for surface preparation, equipment cleanup, and thinning operations, including storage and disposal of VOC-containing materials, shall be subject to the provisions and requirements of §52.2961(a), Solvent cleaning operations.
