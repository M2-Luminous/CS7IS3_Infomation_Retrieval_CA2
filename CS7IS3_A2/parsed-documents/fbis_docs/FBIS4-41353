Leonid Kravchuk: The Last Dash -- to the East"] [Text] The closer we get to the finishing line of the election race in Ukraine, the clearer it becomes that the only hot favorites are Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma, who enjoy the affection of the Republic's west and east. It is not impossible that the "in-between" position of Crimea may prove decisive in this politico-geographical polarization of opinions. As for Yuriy Meshkov, he has again demonstrated his skill at vanishing from his native climes at the right time, once again provoking Kravchuk into sharp actions in Crimea. The expectations of the Simferopol president may, however, not be vindicated: It is mainly the Kiev president who has until recently been scoring points out of confrontation. Much as KOMMERSANT-DAILY supposed on 21 June, Kravchuk could not resist the temptation to capitalize on the absence of Meshkov, who left for Geneva at a crucial moment with no special objective. Yesterday Kiev already announced the annulment (by Kravchuk's edict) of Meshkov's edicts of 4 May "On Items in Republic of Crimea Ownership" and "On the Privatization of State-Owned Enterprises of the Republic of Crimea" as "not being in line with Ukraine's legislation." This is just one of the signs of the Ukraine president's sudden attention to economic questions. This same election race should perhaps be seen as the reason for Kravchuk's turn toward the economy: His rival, Kuchma, has a special liking for the economy, on which he builds his campaign. Kravchuk's economic breakthrough has touched on rather delicate matters. Having shown an inclination to break down customs barriers with the European Community (as part of the partnership agreement he signed the other day), the president nevertheless decided to beef up the customs service with respect to Russia. Kravchuk's reasons (he shared them with the workers of the "Azovmash" joint-stock company in Mariupol) boil down to the phrase: "It pains me when the country is being hurt." The president remarked: "It is inadmissible that the already none too rich Ukraine's market should be laid waste. If the border were now opened, a considerable proportion of consumer goods and agricultural produce would be carted away to Russia." And this is true: You need only look at the rugged rows of Ukrainian shuttle traders outside the Kievskiy rail terminal in Moscow who exchange fatback at almost dumping prices for the Russian ruble, which is a picture of health (compared to the Ukrainian karbovanets). By his other edict the president demanded that Ukrainian producers declare, within 10 days flat, their hard currency in a bid to stem its outflow from the Republic. That is to say, he has thrown down the gauntlet to Kuchma. Now Kravchuk, known in the western regions as a "guarantor of the independence of a united and indivisible Ukraine," has a chance to melt the hearts of the promarketeers even in the eastern lands, which are Kuchma's turf. In fact, "eastern" coal miners and steelworkers were rewarded the other day with edicts solving their financial problems.
