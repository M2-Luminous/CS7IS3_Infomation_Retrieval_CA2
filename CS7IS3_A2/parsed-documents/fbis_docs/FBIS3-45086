Experts are working on ground station facilities and testing equipment and the satellite, called Fengyun-2 (FY-2) will be launched sometime this year. FY-2, the third Chinese meteorological satellite since 1988, will be located in geostationary orbit 35,800 kilometres above 105 East Longitude which runs through west-central China, CMA officials said. They said the satellite will be able to monitor meteorological changes over a third of the globe. Meanwhile, China is to import a supercomputer from the United States to improve its newly-opened medium-range numerical weather prediction (NPW) system, which can forecast changes four to 10 days in advance. The U.S. machine will replace the domestically-made Yinhe 2, China's most advanced supercomputer. CMA officials also said a new continental weather station will be set up this year at a place 3,816 metres above sea level in West China's Qinghai Plateau.
