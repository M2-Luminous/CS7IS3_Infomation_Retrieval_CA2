Adrian Nastase is of the opinion that the transition to the new phase would be possible only when the political parties have formed "a certain idea of what a parliamentary majority means." The executive president of the PDSR also said at the press conference of Tuesday, 4 January, that President Iliescu could not possibly draw a new parliamentary map, because the present one was the result of the electoral process, but that he could endorse subsequent agreements between parties relying on the political pact in principle which can forego a possible discussion about the formation of a new parliamentary majority, and, consequently, of a new government. While reasserting the openness to dialogue with other political parties, for a wider parliamentary support, Adrian Nastase said that if his party fails to obtain it so, it might consider the variant of withdrawing its confidence in the government and of switching to the opposition ranks. The recourse to early elections is accepted by his party, Mr. Adrian Nastase said, only as an ultimate solution, because the chances of having the present parliamentary representation proportions changed are very low, as a recent IRSOP [Romanian Institute for Opinion Polling] poll shows, he said, adding that this choice might present the risk that a low voting rate could raise doubts as to the legitimacy of the future legislative forum of Romania.
