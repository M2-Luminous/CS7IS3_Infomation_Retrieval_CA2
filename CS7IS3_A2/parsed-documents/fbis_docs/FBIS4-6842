Kim Won-ki, a member of the party's supreme committee, said the panel had discussed the demand, which party chairman Yi Ki-taek expressed to reporters on the plane carrying him back from the United States, and agreed to cancel it. "We talked about the coalition cabinet but reached the conclusion that this is not the appropriate time to make such a demand. Our party has no plans to mention the demand anymore," he said. Chairman Yi had urged President Kim Yong-sam to disband his cabinet, set up a pan-national crisis management organ and form a coalition cabinet.
