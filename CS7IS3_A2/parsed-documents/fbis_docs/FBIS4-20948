Senate President Juan Carlos Duran, the top leader of the ruling Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR), said Paz Zamora's decision to withdraw from political life is personal. Duran said the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) must now weigh the situation and define its political future. Miguel Urioste, acting president of the social democratic Free Bolivia Movement (MBL)--which is allied to the MNR--said the time is not right "to prey on a fallen man" because this would hurt the image of Bolivian democracy, adding that "history will judge what has happened." Deputy Ricardo Paz Ballivian, of the opposition Conscience of the Fatherland (Condepa), regretted Paz Zamora's decision, adding that the former president was "deeply affected" by accusations against him and his family. "A party is an institution that cannot disappear because it is an alternative for the Bolivian people," said Paz Ballivan regarding the MIR--the party he founded--and its future. Deputy Jerjes Justiniano, of the leftist Democratic Socialism Alternative (ASD), said Paz Zamora is a "scapegoat" for things done by some MIR leaders, adding that "institutions are not bad, only the men leading them are bad." Jorge Landivar Roca, head of the Nationalist Democratic Action (ADN)--a former MIR ally and member of the ruling coalition that governed the country between 1989 and 1993--said Paz Zamora's recognition of mistakes during his presidency was an act of "courage." Current MIR President Oscar Eid--who is also involved in the trafficking report--said his party will not discuss its immediate future until the investigations on the alleged "narco-links" are concluded. Eid said that when undisputable MIR leader Paz Zamora resigned, the party lost its main "orientation." Eid added: "Our former leader recognized his mistakes with dignity and courage. Just as achievements receive praise, errors have a cost." MIR block leader Carlos Borth said party followers are disoriented and paralyzed by their leader's resignation and the accusations against various MIR leaders. Borth said he will ask for an emergency meeting to analyze Eid's possible separation and to form a new executive board. During the week MIR leaders testified before the Justice and Judicial Police Committee of the Bolivian Congress, the body responsible for investigating the alleged "narco-links." Paz Zamora is considered to have the most important international career of the past years. He issued a dramatic message on 26 March ending his political career under the burden of accusations linking him with drug trafficking.
