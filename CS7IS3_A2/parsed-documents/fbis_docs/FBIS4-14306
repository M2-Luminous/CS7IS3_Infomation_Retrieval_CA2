I am also certain that the government will seriously study the bid made by U.S. IT&T. Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal Al Sa'ud replied to a question on whether he had received a pledge from the American side to speed up the Middle East peace process and said: As Mr. Christopher has noted, they are endeavoring on this path and the U.S. is hoping and is determined to contribute in speeding up the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and in pushing forward the other processes. Prince al-Faysal was asked about the outcome of the discussions on the Arab-Israeli peace talks in the other processes. In reply he said that the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques told Secretary Christopher that he hoped that during his current visit to the states in the region, progress would be achieved and that serious and persistent efforts would be made toward a just and comprehensive solution in the Syrian process. He also reaffirmed the need to advance on the Lebanese process. Asked if he was prepared to lift the boycott of Israel the Saudi Foreign Minister said: Yes. We have discussed the question of the boycott and as you know this issue was reviewed within the framework of the Arab League. We expect and we hope that progress will be made in this respect after the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. We also hope that this will take place after progress has been made in the other processes of the talks. Moreover, Christopher replied to a question on the foreign ministers' meeting in Europe next week on Bosnia and whether he had discussed the matter with Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev yesterday and whether he had any reaction to a report released in Geneva today on the situation in Gorazde and he said: The contact group must be given the necessary time to explore the matter with the various sides but only after they are given the opportunity which will enable them to do that. He indicated that the contact group would present a report to the foreign ministers of the countries concerned. He added: We discussed this issue in general terms yesterday and we wanted to give the contact group, which has links with many sides, the opportunity to explore the matter but as soon as possible. We will move quickly to start the talks on Thursday and Friday. He expressed the hope to see this take place at the appropriate time in the near future. He indicated that this was the moment which would give the opportunity to achieve some progress in the context of NATO's clear success in Gorazde. Responding to a question on the lifting of sanctions on Iraq, Secretary Christopher said: I believe that the statement I have made is self-explanatory on this subject. However I can say that I believe that when the Security Council member states see that Iraq is not complying with the resolutions and the existing sanctions, these states will realize the importance of maintaining these sanctions. I also believe that it is high time the U.S. and all those interested in the situation in Iraq stood together to prevent Iraq from getting the impression that there will be any easing of the sanctions. Responding to another question, Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal Al Sa'ud said: I would also like to refer you to a statement made by the Gulf Cooperation Council on the subject and which I read at the beginning. Moreover, I would like to say that these sanctions, in our opinion, are an integral part and Iraq must commit itself to implement all the Security Council resolutions, particularly the resolution on the recognition of the Iraqi-Kuwait borders which is considered to be the core of the conflict. We do not wish to see a repetition of this conflict in our region. Thus, we must ensure that this point in the UN resolutions is fully implemented; and we would also like to ensure that what is going to be implemented is not only related to the issue of weapons mentioned in the resolutions. I also reaffirm what Secretary Christopher has said to the effect that this common stand which we are adopting is not a hostile stand toward the Iraqi people but it is a stand aimed at ensuring that the conflict is not repeated in the future between Iraq and the countries in the region, as this would cause further pain to the people of Iraq and the peoples of the region. If anybody is responsible for the situation in which the people of Iraq find themselves, the government of Iraq is certainly responsible. In a nutshell, the UN resolutions deal very clearly with the humanitarian aspects; therefore, the government of Iraq is entirely responsible. Asked whether he has discussed with Gulf ministers the situation in Yemen, Secretary Christopher said: Yes, during my meeting with the GCC ministers and during my meeting with King Fahd the situation in Yemen was discussed. The ministers and King Fahd insisted on the need for the two parties concerned in Yemen to resolve their disputes for the sake of peace in the region. The Saudi foreign minister might want to add something to that. At this point, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal spoke and said: Thank you. I believe that our two positions reflect our hope that all disputes, whatever they may be, are resolved through negotiations and talks. Furthermore, many Arab and other sides are intervening in this respect and we hope that these disputes will be resolved peacefully and amicably within the framework of Yemen's unity.
