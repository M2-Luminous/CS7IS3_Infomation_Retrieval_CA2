Do you think it is possible for you to take unified actions with the SDPJ? [Takemura] I am not that optimistic. I do not think we will immediately form a unified faction or start official policy meetings. However, since we are in a similar position, we felt that we are close to each other and that we need to cooperate. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You are clearly standing against Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. [Takemura] I am not willing to take a stand against Ozawa. I simply could not agree with his way of thinking. I am sure he will change more and more. Therefore, I will not assume a presumptuous stand by saying that I am anti-Ozawa. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Sakigake is viewed as a "liberal" force that confronts the "new liberals," including Ozawa. [Takemura] Ozawa explained that his liberalism is "new liberalism that gives consideration to the weak." If he really means it, then I affirmatively accept it. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the disputes being created over the political world's reorganization? [Takemura] Constitutional, diplomatic, and security issues are foundations. We need to coordinate while listening to each party's opinions. Political technique is another important essence that needs to be considered. As I look back at the experiences I had during the Hosokawa administration, I think we should not form a coalition unless we are willing to accept mutual differences. It is necessary for us to attach importance to cooperation with parties we think we can reach fundamental agreements in such areas as forming decision-making rules. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the Hata administration? [Takemura] In his policy speech, the prime minister said that "the ideology of the Constitution became ever more important." Immediately after his inauguration, however, he referred to the right of collective self-defense. I think the series of remarks made by the chief cabinet secretary, the foreign minister, and the Defense Agency director general reflect the true nature of the current administration. I have a strong feeling of physical disorder. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The people's attention is focused on the timing of the lower house's dissolution, and whether a general election will be held under a system of multiseat constituencies or a mixture of single-seat constituencies and a proportional representation system. [Takemura] I am trying not to think about Diet dissolution. I think it is reasonable to have the next election under the system that is a mixture of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. However, I do not mean to deny the prime minister's constitutional right to dissolve the Diet. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] When do you think the bill for redrawing [House of Representatives] electoral districts will be approved? [Takemura] We need a certain number of days for deliberation. It is possible that it may not be passed smoothly if the government or parties get involved. I think we should quietly deal with the issue as if we were waiting for a Supreme Court decision. We have to avoid creating confusion by hinting at the possibility of Diet dissolution. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How are you going to fight the next general election? [Takemura] On the basis of the assumption that the next election will be held under the system that is a mixture of single-seat constituencies and a proportional representation system, we would like to seek wide-ranging cooperation with parties and political forces. We want to give backing to as many fine candidates as possible. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you think Japan should deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development? [Takemura] The United States and the ROK are having discussions [with the DPRK] more patiently than Japan thinks. For some reason, however, debates are being held in Japan on the assumption of launching an economic or naval blockade. I have an impression that Japan is too hasty. It is very dangerous. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How are you going to reform the tax system? [Takemura] I am of the opinion that apart from the ruling parties' discussions, we need to have discussions only within Sakigake or with the SDPJ and some members of the Japan New Party. We need to reduce taxes. I think all parties are beginning to understand that a tax hike is inevitable too [sentence as published].
