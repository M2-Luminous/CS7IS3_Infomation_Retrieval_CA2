FR940810-1-00054 FR940810-1-00009 (3) In conducting performance reviews, HUD will rely primarily on information obtained from the recipient's performance report, records maintained, findings from on-site monitoring, audit reports, and the status of the line of credit. Where applicable, the Department may also consider relevant information pertaining to a recipient's performance gained from other sources, including litigation, citizen comments and other information provided by the recipient. A recipient's failure to maintain records in the prescribed manner may result in a finding that the recipient has failed to meet the applicable requirement to which the record pertains. A recipient's failure to submit a performance report in the prescribed manner may result in a finding that the recipient has substantially failed to meet the requirements of the program. * * * * * 14. Section 570.903 would be revised to read as follows: §570.903 Review to determine if the recipient is meeting its CHAS responsibilities. (a) Review timing and purpose. HUD will review an entitlement grant recipient's CHAS performance prior to acceptance of a grant recipient's annual certification under §570.303(l) to determine whether the recipient followed its HUD-approved CHAS for the most recently completed fiscal year, and that any housing activities assisted with CDBG funds during that period were consistent with that CHAS. (b) Following a CHAS. The recipient has taken all of the planned actions, and has met the goals described in its annual plan. This includes, but is not limited to: (1) Pursuing all resources identified in its investment plan which the grantee indicated it would pursue; (2) Providing certifications of consistency, when requested to do so by applicants for HUD programs for which the grantee indicated in its investment plan that it would support application by other entities, in a fair and impartial manner; and (3) Not hindering implementation of the CHAS by action or wilful inaction. (c) Disapproval. If HUD determines that an entitlement grant recipient has not met the criteria outlined in paragraph (b) of this section, the recipient will be notified and provided up to 45 days to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has followed its CHAS, considering all relevant circumstances and the recipient's actions and lack of actions affecting the provision of housing covered by the CHAS within its jurisdiction. Failure to so demonstrate in a timely manner will be cause for HUD to find that the recipient has failed to meet its certification. A complete and specific response by the recipient should describe: (1) Any factors beyond the control of the recipient that prevented it from following its CHAS and any actions the recipient plans to take to alleviate such factors; and (2) Actions taken by the recipient, if any, beyond those described in the CHAS performance report to facilitate following the CHAS, including the effects of such actions. 15. Section 570.910 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (b)(9) to read as follows: §570.910 Corrective and remedial actions. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (9) In the case of an entitlement recipient which has failed to submit a previously due performance report in the prescribed manner, delay making the grant until any outstanding performance report has been properly submitted to HUD.
