Upon his arrival Wednesday, he expressed hope that with the mediation of Russia the talks between the authorities of Tajikistan and the opposition leaders will lead to accord and peace in this Central Asian republic. Answering the questions put by Interfax, Grachev backed further protection of the Tajik-Afghan border by collective efforts of CIS peacekeepers. He said though that he expressed the view of a military man since the solution of the problem is solely within the competence of political leaders of the CIS states. The term of the Russian troops in the republic expires on December 31, 1994, in line with the understanding between Dushanbe and Moscow. Grachev believes that the protection of the Tajik-Afghan border meets the interests of Russia's security, as well as of the 200,000-strong Russian-speaking population. Grachev said that during his meetings in Dushanbe with the Tajik leadership he intends to discuss the military-political situation in the republic. Grachev arrived in Tajikistan to take part in the military exercises which are being held near the Tajik-Afghan border. Taking part are units of the 201st Russian Infantry division, Russian border guards, military units of Tajikistan and Uzbek peacekeepers. Grachev said that taking part in the exercises are about 50 warplanes, 300 units of various military technology, 100 artillery pieces and mortars, 60 air defence weapons and about 2000 servicemen.
