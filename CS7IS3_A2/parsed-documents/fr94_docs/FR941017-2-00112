FR941017-2-00112 FR941017-2-00064 The Contracts also provide a death benefit that is the greatest of: (1) Purchase payments made (less partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges); (2) Accumulation Value at the end of the valuation period; and (3) the ``step-up'' death benefit, 2 plus purchase payments made, less withdrawals and any surrender or withdrawal charges taken since the last ``step-up'' death benefit anniversary. The ``basic'' death benefit is equal to the Accumulation Value, or to the sum of the purchase payments made less partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken. The death benefit in excess of the ``basic'' death benefit and the ``step-up'' death benefit, constitutes the ``step-up'' death benefit. 2 The step-up death benefit is the initial purchase payment. At each step-up death benefit anniversary, the current Accumulation Value is compared to the prior determination of the step-up benefit, increased by purchase payments made and reduced by partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken since that anniversary. The greater of these becomes the new step-up benefit. The step-up anniversaries are (i) With respect to the Alpha Account Contract, the Contract date and every sixth Contract anniversary thereafter, and (ii) with respect to the Alpha Flex Account Contract, the Contract date and every eighth Contract anniversary thereafter; provided, however, the step-up death benefit will no longer increase once the Annuitant reaches age 75. 6. No sales charges are deducted from premium payments under the Contracts. However, a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') will be assessed if the Contract is surrendered or partial withdrawals exceeding certain amounts are taken during (i) The six-year period from the date purchase payments are received and accepted, with respect to the Alpha Account Contract, and (ii) the eight-year period from the date purchase payments are received and accepted, with respect to the Alpha Flex Account Contract. With respect to the Alpha Account Contract, the maximum CDSC imposed is 6% of the amount withdrawn during the first two Contract years, scaled downward until the seventh Contract Year when there will be no charge. With respect to the Alpha Flex Account Contract, the maximum CDSC imposed is 8% of the amount withdrawn in the first Contract Year, scaled downward until the ninth Contract year, when there will be no charge. After the first Contract year, a Contract owner may withdraw once each Contract year 10% of the Accumulation Value as of the last Contract anniversary as well as purchase payments held beyond the applicable CDSC period, without the assessment of a CDSC. In no event will the CDSC under either Contract exceed 9% of purchase payments. Proceeds from the CDSC may not cover the expected costs of distributing the Contracts. Any shortfall will be recovered from Jefferson-Pilot's general assets, which may include revenues from the mortality and expense risk charge deducted from the Separate Account. 7. Various fees and expenses are deducted under the Contracts and the Separate Account. A charge may be deducted for premium taxes when annuity payments begin or from purchase payments, as required by the particular jurisdiction. Applicable premium taxes depend on the payor's then current place of residence and generally range from 0% to 5.0% of purchase payments or the amount annuitized. Jefferson-Pilot represents that the amount that it will recover for premium taxes will not be greater than the amount of premium taxes required to be paid. 8. The administrative charges to be assessed include (i) An Annual Contract Fee of $35 per Contract year during the Accumulation Period only, and (ii) an Administrative Expense Fee equal to an annual rate of .15% of the assets of the Separate Account during the Accumulation and the Annuity Periods. Jefferson-Pilot guarantees that it will not raise these administrative charges for the duration of the Contracts. Jefferson-Pilot also represents that it does not expect that the total revenues from the administrative charges will be greater than the total expected cost of administering the Contracts, on average, excluding distribution costs, over the period that the Contracts are in force. 9. There will be a charge of $25 for each transfer after the first twelve transfers in each Contract year prior to the Annuity Date and for each transfer after the first four transfers after the Annuity Date. Jefferson-Pilot does not include periodic automatic transfers made under the Dollar Cost Averaging Program when calculating the free transfers that may be made during the Accumulation Period. Jefferson-Pilot represents that it does not expect that the total revenues from the excess transfer charge will be greater than the total expected cost of administering transfers, on average, over the period that the Contracts are in force. 10. A daily charge equal to an annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets in each Subaccount attributable to the Contracts will be imposed to compensate Jefferson-Pilot for bearing certain mortality and expense risks it assumes in offering and administering the Contracts and in operating the Separate Account. Of this amount, .65% is attributable to mortality risks, and .60% is attributable to expense risks. The charge for mortality and expenses risks will be assessed during the Accumulation Period and the Annuity Period. The aggregate charge is guaranteed by Jefferson-Pilot not to increase for the duration of the Contracts. The charge may be a source of profit for Jefferson-Pilot, which will be added to its general account assets and may be used for, among other things, the payment of distribution, sales and other expenses. Jefferson-Pilot currently anticipates a profit from this charge. 11. Jefferson Pilot assumes certain mortality risks under the Contracts. The mortality risk arises from Jefferson-Pilot's contractual obligation to make periodic annuity payments (determined in accordance with Jefferson-Pilot's annuity tables, which are based on the 1983 Table of Individual Annuity Mortality and, for variable annuity options, on an assumed investment rate of 31/2%, and other Contract provisions) regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual annuitant lives. Contract owners thus are assured that neither annuitant's longevity nor an improvement in life expectancy generally (which is greater than expected) will adversely effect annuity payments the payee will receive under the Contracts. This eliminates the risk of outliving the funds accumulated for retirement. Mortality risk also is assumed in connection with payment of the death benefit prior to the Annuity date because the death benefit guarantee could exceed the Account Value. Also, Jefferson-Pilot assumes a mortality risk arising from the fact that the Contract does not impose any surrender charge on the death benefits. 12. The expense risk assumed by Jefferson-Pilot is that its actual expenses in issuing and administering the Contracts and operating the Separate Account will exceed the amount recovered through the administrative charges, which are guaranteed not to increase for the life of the Contract. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission, by order upon application, to conditionally or unconditionally grant an exemption from any provision, rule or regulation of the 1940 Act to the extent that the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
