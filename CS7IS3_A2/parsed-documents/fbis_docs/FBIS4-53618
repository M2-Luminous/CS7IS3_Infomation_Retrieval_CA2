FBIS4-53618 "dreas099__a94017" FBIS-EAS-94-099-A Daily Report 3 May 1994 ANNEX Japan MAFF To Overhaul Current Food Control System MAFF To Overhaul Current Food Control System OW2005085494 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN in Japanese 3 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2005085494 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] It was learned on 2 May that the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] mapped out a package of reform programs for the current food control system three years ago to overhaul the current food control system which puts the production, distribution, and sales of rice under the government's direct control, switching them to the "government's indirect control" and limiting the government's role to the stockpiling and quarantine of rice. The Agricultural Administration Council is expected to hold full-fledged debates on the food control system on the eve of Japan's partial opening of its rice market. Although Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Minister Mutsuki Kato has said "The government still intends to keep the current food control system in place," the package of reform programs for the food control system is likely to greatly affect the debates. The package of reform programs mapped out by MAFF is comprised of a "reform program for rice management policy" and a "reform program for the tariff system on imported rice." According to an informed source, MAFF mapped out the package in late 1991 when pressure was building on Japan to open its rice market at agricultural negotiations under the Uruguay Round of GATT. The final draft agreement put forth by then GATT Director General Dunkel included the principle of "tariffication without exception" which aimed to replace all import restrictions with tariffication. The package of reform programs that SANKEI SHIMBUN obtained on 2 May gives a "very dire picture" of the current rice production in Japan and points out that "the people ask the government to provide a smooth supply of rice in response to changes in the demands of consumers for rice and to deal properly with the growing trade of rice in black markets." The package stresses that its primary objective is to "take advantage of rice tariffication to overhaul the current food control system and build a new rice control system under which Japanese rice growers enthusiastically work in paddy fields and the needs of consumers are met." Specifically, the package calls for a full relaxation of the current paddy-field reduction system (production adjustment) and stresses the need to transfer the body responsible for enforcing the system from the government to such producer organizations as the National Federation of Agricultural Cooperative Associations. The package also calls for the creation of a system under which rice growers themselves decide whether to reduce their paddy fields, and under which there is a "price guarantee," with the area of paddy field and the variety of rice established to get rice growers to resume production. The package calls for the creation of another system under which the difference between the "standard sale price" and actual sale price by rice growers is paid to rice growers. The package of reform programs points out the need to replace the current license system with a simple application system for collectors and wholesalers in the distribution system and to liberalize the distribution of rice by abolishing various restrictions. The package calls for introducing futures transactions in rice wholesale markets that open under the government's licenses, but makes it mandatory for wholesalers to obtain licenses from the government to participate in the rice wholesale markets. The package of reform programs aims to largely acknowledge the freedom to produce rice, the freedom to sell it, and the freedom to buy it on the principle of market and competition by overhauling the current food control system which makes it a principle for the government to control the rice. Under a new rice management policy, the government will only work out the basic plan for production and distribution of rice, and its stockpiling and quarantine. The package of reform programs, however, acknowledges the government's management of rice in case of an emergency situation like the recent rice crisis following the poor 1993 rice crop.
