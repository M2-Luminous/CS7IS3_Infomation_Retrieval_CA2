The ministers were obliged to implement a UN resolution imposing sanctions on Libya. --During his visit to NATO Headquarters in Brussels, which begins today, the prime minister will sign a document pertaining to Poland's joining the "Partnership for Peace" program. The government authorized the prime minister to place his signature, Andrzej Wieczorkiewicz (under secretary of state in the Council of Ministers Office) told journalists. He also said Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski will not attend the Brussels meeting. Detailed principles of our participation in the program will be subject to negotiations to be conducted with those who will participate in it. Lithuania and Romania have already declared their willingness to join. --The Council of Ministers heard a report from the foreign minister concerning the fact that the treaty on Poland's association with the EC has gone into effect. In accordance with an agreement signed in mid-December 1991, the treaty became effective on 1 February. Poland his signed the treaty for 10 years, which does not mean, however, that we will automatically join the Western European Union in 2004. But what will happen is that, from now on, we will have influence on decisions made in Brussels. Joint association agencies will be established. The extent of our relations with the countries of "the 12" will also be widened: Apart from trade, it will include the flow of capital, services, and labor. --Labor Minister Leszek Miller presented an up-to-date report before the Council of Ministers concerning work on a social contract. This coming Friday [4 February], substantive negotiations are to begin among the government, trade unions, territorial self-governments, and employer organizations. Both the Council of Ministers and its chief "are eager to sign an agreement on social guarantees as soon as possible." So far, the different parties have managed to come to agreement on certain technical aspects. It is already known that negotiations will be conducted in six groups. The government will be represented by the following ministries: Labor and Social Policy, Health, Land-Use Management and Construction, and Education. Let us recall here that Prime Minister Pawlak declared his willingness to sign a social contract as far back as his inaugural speech in the Sejm. When asked when the contract will be signed, Labor Minister Miller refused to set a date. All he said was that the groups will continue their work for several months, while the negotiations are supposed to be "long and intensive." According to a communique issued by the [government's] Press Office, the Council of Ministers authorized Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz to coordinate work on the contract. Minister Miller, for his part, informed journalists that supervising all of the work will be leaders of the Council of Ministers Economic Committee (the committee subordinated to Deputy Prime Minister Marek Borowski) and the Council of Ministers Sociopolitical Committee (subordinated to Cimoszewicz). --The government proposed an amendment to the Transport Law and also debated devoting part of the Treasury's shares for purposes of reprivatization. The ministers failed to reach a decision on the issue.
