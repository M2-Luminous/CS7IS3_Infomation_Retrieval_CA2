Toini Kankaanniemi, minister for development aid and the party's only representative in cabinet, submitted his resignation to the premier after Aho denied him the right to vote against the government during a ballot to decide who would sign the country's EU membership agreement this weekend in Corfu. The parliamentary group of the Christian Party decided later to leave the government and refrain from naming a new minister. All seven members of the party in the 200-member parliament oppose Finland's plans to join the EU. Last week the government defeated a no-confidence motion on its plans to join the EU next year, with members of the Christian Party abstaining. The government, which was set up in April 1991 after general elections, also includes Aho's Centre Party (former Agrarian Party), the Conservatives and the Swedish Party, representing the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. With the withdrawal of the Christian Party, the government has backing from 108 MPs.
