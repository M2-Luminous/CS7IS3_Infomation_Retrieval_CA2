CONACOM says it has requested from the Haitian Armed Forces [FADH] the application of concrete measures to guarantee the safety of all the country's sons regardless of political credo. CONACOM's message further states that it is more than time to put an end to the maneuvers of politicians who use FADH members to arbitrarily attack their political adversaries. The party says it has asked President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to see to it that the gathering initiatives that he is organizing abroad during this month of January contribute to pave the way for a true national conference. This national conference is to be held in Haiti and supported by the international community as soon as possible, with the participation of the political and social sectors that agree to work for the establishment of at least an internal democratic state of law, and for the short-term application of the Governors Island Agreement.
