Uhde rejected any speculations aimed at the division of Europe into different spheres of influence. Democratic principles and abiding by the law are values most respected by the Czech Republic in evaluating states' authority. Rigelnik stated that Slovenia would never forget the Czech Republic's contribution to the recognition of the independent Slovenian state. He said that the clear majority of Slovenian residents had been for their homeland's independence. However, if they had not been backed from abroad and "by friends", it would have been more difficult to attain independence, he said. Uhde and Rigelnik expressed their interest in working out and adopting a standard Czech-Slovenian agreement on friendship and cooperation. Rigelnik stressed that Slovenia was part of Central Europe, and that for 70 years it has been forcedly pushed to the Balkan region. He described as unacceptable such efforts of "other subjects" which he did not specify. Rigelnik said that Europe still lacked a defence identity, a shortcoming which surfaced in its relation to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Referring to the reinforcement of the Russian military presence in the former Yugoslavia, he admitted that Russia was trying to strengthen its position in the Balkans. Europe needs inspiration to consider its own set-up. That is why we must play an active role, he emphasised. As to the West European protectionism, Rigelnik said that the Western Europe was willing to negotiate "with us", but that it was pursuing its own interests. Therefore a joint attitude of Slovenia, the Czech Republic and other countries undergoing transformation is important so that they can attain conditions of advantage in the process of their integration with Western European structures. Rigelnik described Slovakia as a stable country. Its economy stabilised last year but it faces high unemployment, he added. Uhde told Rigelnik that the Czech Republic was relatively stable from both political and economic points of view.
