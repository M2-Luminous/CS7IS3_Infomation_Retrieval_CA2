The reason is an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the area from Hadera to Jericho. Vets from Bet Dagan visited Jericho this week and determined that some 4,000 lambs had died from the disease. They have also vaccinated more than 3,000 sheep in the Gaza Strip to prevent the disease from spreading there.
