He added, however, that at this stage it is impossible to say that an agreement between the PLO and Israel has been attained. [Gabay] What answer will you give the Israeli Government today following the unequivocal negative reaction of the PLO Executive Committee? [Sha'th] In our answer, which we will send to Amnon Shahaq today, we will declare our intention to continue the negotiations toward achieving an acceptable memorandum of understanding regarding all the outstanding problems. The two original delegations will resume their regular sessions. [Gabay] Does Yasir 'Arafat share your opinions? [Sha'th] Certainly, because there is no return from the declaration of principles. In our meeting with 'Arafat, which has just ended, we decided that with goodwill we will be able to solve all the problems. [Gabay] What, then, did the Liaison Committee do for three days in Cairo? [Sha'th] We agreed with the Israelis not to publish the understandings reached, and a few understandings were indeed reached. You must remember, though, that no agreement or memorandum was attained. I hope that Israel will not leak the understandings, because I will construe any Israeli leak a breach of promise. [Gabay] According to what you say, the Liaison Committee will not be reconvened in Cairo soon, as Peres claimed. [Sha'th] The Liaison Committee, headed by Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] and Shim'on Peres, convened this week only to unfreeze the talks, seeing that this is its job. It scored some progress, and now we will immediately start to deal with the details in a thorough manner. The Liaison Committee did attain a certain breakthrough. [Gabay] Why did the PLO Executive Committee reject the memorandum of understanding reached in Cairo? [Sha'th] The Israelis were mistaken to talk about an agreement in Cairo, when in fact there was no such agreement. The final agreement will be reached only after the committees end their deliberations. [Gabay] Was progress made on the issue of border crossings, as the Israelis claimed? [Sha'th] No progress answering the Palestinians' aspirations was made on this issue. Controversial points remain in other issues as well.
