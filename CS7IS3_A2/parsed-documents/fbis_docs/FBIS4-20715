At the meeting, the council amended the 1993 budget. The council also reviewed the progress of various 1993 economic and social programs and current year's programs, to which an estimated budget of 100.9 million dinars[D] was allocated (compared with D172 million in 1992 and 1993). The council also declared itself pleased with the major initiatives taken on a regional and national scale in order to boost the spirit of solidarity during Ramadan, which resulted in D170,000 worth of aid for the underprivileged (this amount will be distributed to 6,863 needy families). Add to this the effective support offered by the seven solidarity restaurants opened in Bizerte, Menzel Bourguiba, Zarzouna, and Tinja to help 820 disadvantaged individuals. The governorate has also received a large quantity of clothing, for distribution to these 820 citizens. Similarly, the governor informed the council that a solution had been found to several other social problems, like those involving workers at the Ichkeul quarries, closed because of damage to the environment, or the dockers of the Bizerte commercial harbor. On the other hand, the council took note with pleasure of the 17-percent drop in additional job applications, which totaled 3,394 in 1993 compared with 3,983 the year before; this was due to a decrease in the number of school dropouts and an increase in the number of young people applying for training in the area's various vocational schools. Apart from that, a study of the economy disclosed that planned 1994 regional investments amounted to D100.9 million, of which 60 percent will be allocated to productive sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, and the industry, 28 percent to basic community facilities, and 6.4 percent to cleaning up and pollution control. Speaking of the tourism sector, the governor stated that construction of at least two hotels will start in 1994, the owners having completed all required procedures, whereas, two other tourism developers are about to complete their applications.
