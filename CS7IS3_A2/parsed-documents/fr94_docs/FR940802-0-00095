FR940802-0-00095 FR940802-0-00019 (i) Potential Economic Effects on Individual Trappers Several commenters stated that the regulation could have a significant economic impact on individual trappers dependent on this customary and traditional practice. The loss of opportunity for some trappers to take a few or an occasional wolf while same-day-airborne could mean a substantial reduction in seasonal gross value of the individual trapper's income. The potential for such impacts is likely minimal but difficult to ascertain in light of contradictory public responses. The Service received few comments from individuals who claimed that the regulation would significantly impact them economically. Some individuals experienced in wolf hunting and trapping contend that, because the opportunity to shoot wolves same-day-airborne is very limited, few wolves are taken by such methods. Other individuals who have hunted and trapped wolves indicated that shooting wolves same-day-airborne should be allowed because it constitutes the most or only effective means of trapping wolves. However, there is no compelling evidence that individuals are likely to suffer significant economic hardship over loss of limited opportunities to legally shoot wolves same-day-airborne. (j) Relationship Between the Prohibition of Same-Day-Airborne Taking and the Purposes, Missions and Policies of the National Wildlife Refuge System in Alaska Some commenters questioned or disputed whether there was any legitimate relationship between the prohibition of same-day-airborne shooting of wolves and wolverines and the legislative purposes or missions and policies applicable to Alaska refuges. In addition to the legislative purposes of each refuge, there are various other applicable legislative mandates, missions and policies which guide or must be considered in management of Alaska refuges. Collectively, our legal mandates and mission and policy guidance direct management emphasis on Alaska refuges at conserving, protecting and enhancing fish and wildlife resources in their natural diversity to meet a broad spectrum of public needs and benefits. In this case, the Service carefully evaluated the implications of allowing same-day-airborne shooting of wolves on Alaska refuges. Though it poses no immediate biological threat, there is no biological or management need for allowing same-day-airborne shooting of wolves and very few people benefit from the additional opportunities it provides. The Service balanced the limited benefits of allowing same-day-airborne shooting of wolves against the associated law enforcement and ethical problems, and the increased law enforcement costs of allowing this activity. The Service ultimately concluded that prohibition of same-day-airborne shooting of wolves and wolverines would serve to collectively benefit or further the legal mandates, purposes, missions and policies applicable to management of the national wildlife refuge system in Alaska. Applicable Service policies concerning ethical standards and fair chase were discussed in the proposed rule document. (k) Undermines or Interferes With State's Ability to Control or Manage Wolves and Affected Prey Species Some commenters argued that the same-day-airborne prohibition takes away or undermines an effective management tool of the State to control wolf populations to benefit game species. State officials have asserted that same-day-airborne allowances are intended only to provide a reasonable harvest opportunity for trappers, and are not intended for predator control or management purposes. It is our evaluation that the Service's same-day-airborne prohibition will not undermine or interfere with State wolf management or control programs.
