Speaking afterwards, Rybkin said all factions had agreed to his proposal for a Russia's Choice candidate to become his First Deputy and the RC is expected to inform him about its choice by 11:00 on Sunday. Four other Deputies to be elected from the LDP, Women of Russia, Communists and the New Regional Policy alliance are yet to be named. It was also agreed that the Duma council would compromise all faction leaders, each of them having one vote, as well the Speaker and his Deputies, Rybkin said. Heads of the parliamentary committees may also attend council meetings. There will be as many as 21 committees but the dispute is over the four main committees: international affairs, defence, security and economics, Rybkin said. He hopes that some sort of compromise can be struck as the factions meet on Sunday. The Speaker believes that the two chambers of the Federal Assembly must work in the same building but "once this did not happen", they will have to stay put at their present locations rather than spend time and energy to reverse things. Rybkin has also called for a single staff to the Federal Assembly. But once the Federation Council has created its own staff, the Duma will have to follow suit, he said. For his part, Democratic Party leader Nikolai Travkin said there was no objection to the candidacy of Mikhail Mityukov as First Deputy Speaker. In his words, the Communists and Women of Russia may nominate Valentin Kovalyev and Alevtina Fedulova for the posts of Deputy Speaker. The LDP may name either its leading member Viktor Kobeleyev or former Soviet Deputy Prime Minister in the Ryzhkov government Vladimir Gusyev. However, it is not ruled out that the party may nominate Vladimir Zhirinovsky as its choice, Travkin said. The DP leader says that if agreement is reached on electing the candidates in a package, this can be done within a day's work. Failing this, he said, the Speaker will hold a series of consultations with the representatives of each faction over the weekend. The council of factions will meet at 12:45 on Monday to try to resolve the issue before the Duma goes into session at 14:00, Travkin said.
