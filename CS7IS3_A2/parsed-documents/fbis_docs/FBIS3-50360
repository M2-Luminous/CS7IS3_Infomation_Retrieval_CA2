"Trade unionists envisage strikes in the mining sector, and that is why it has been decided to create the RKS. For the time being, we have declared a strike alert in the mines. We have marked out specific dates for strikes, Andrzej Andrzejczak, the chairman of the "Kontra" National Commission [KK] said, but he nonetheless declined to cite them. The RKS demands from the government that, among other things, it equalizes disproportions in pay for miners and that it restore the ratio of pay for miners to the national average at a level of 2:1; hold back increases in prices; enact immediate debt restructuring for mines; and create a mining bank, which would allow mines to be made independent of the "usurious rates of the banks." "Kontra" also demands that mining be recognised as a strategic industry, that the government promises to procure permanent coal reserves, that annual and anniversary bonuses be free of tax, and that the right to a retirement pension after 21 years' work underground be introduced.
