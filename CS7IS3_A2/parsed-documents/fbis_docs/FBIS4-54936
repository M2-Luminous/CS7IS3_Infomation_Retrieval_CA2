[Begin Szekeres recording] Something important has happened today in Hungary. At the second free elections, finally, and once and for all, Hungary has became a democratic country. Very many citizens, much more than expected, have participated in the elections and no significant irregularity occurred today. Whatever the result of the elections, the point is that this decision has been made: Hungary, once and for all, became a democratic country. The MSZP hopes that when the ballot boxes are opened and the votes counted, it will be the MSZP with the largest number of votes. We hope that in the next three weeks the style and content of the election campaign will change. We decided to maintain the style, political content, and ideology that have been represented by the MSZP candidates in the past weeks. This is a calm and moderate political style dealing with the problems of society and seeking professional solutions. We would like for Hungary, after the second round of elections on 29 May, to have a politically moderate and viable government. [end recording]
