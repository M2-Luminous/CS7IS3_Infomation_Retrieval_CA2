The prime minister has thus admitted that we are obliged to accept it. What else can we do? We cannot proceed with the process of economic liberalization if we reject the agreement. Our share in international trade is only one percent and our situation could get worse if we stay out of this multi-party international agreement. The permanent committee of the commerce ministry had recommended to the government that the country should participate in multi-party trade so that it is not left alone. The world has divided into many small and large trade groups. On one side are the major economic powers like the United States and Japan and such powerful groups as the European Economic Alliance. On the other side are the developing countries like India burdened with foreign debts. A few advanced nations are monopolizing international trade. It is their voice that is heard on all the economic and trade platforms. Despite their majority, the voice of the developing countries is lost like that of a "flute in a drum band." Mr. Rao said that our government has done what was the best thing to do. According to him if India had not opposed some of the Dunkel proposals resolutely, the Uruguay decisions would have hurt our nation. There is not doubt that India and other developing countries have managed to remove some problematic provisions in the Dunkel proposals, however, we cannot claim that our efforts to protect our interests in the area of agriculture and intellectual assets have been successful. Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji has also admitted in the Parliament that he was not satisfied with the decision of importing nations to keep the same system of garment imports at the rate of import quotas for the next 10 years. The nation, especially the opposition parties, are opposing the Dunkel proposals. They fear that it will make us lose our economic autonomy and our nation will be forced to become a slave of the economic powers. They call this agreement contrary to the farmers' interests. They claim that the result of the farmers' hard work will be devoured by the foreign companies. They are also asking while opposing the government that it should resign since it cannot protect our national interests and should stay out of this agreement. The talks and debates that had been going on in our country over the Dunkel proposals for the last seven years have made the situation even more complex, instead of clarifying it. The government did not try to clarify this situation. This made the Dunkel look scary to the nation. When the Uruguay talks began in 1986, India had strongly opposed intellectual asset rights, use of services, and rules for investment, and had asked that these be kept out of the proposals. It was neither supported nor approved. India demanded that clothes trade be made a part of the agreement, however, because of the direct and strong opposition by the United States, it was kept out. India has to be satisfied with begging for mercy. Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji is correct in saying that give and take is required in international agreements. However, what did we get in exchange for what we gave? All we see are empty promises and serious challenges. This naturally augments suspicions and fears. The fact is that our nation's economic future has become uncertain instead of becoming secure. In the chess game of Uruguay talks, the group of industrialized nations have set in and the pawns of developing countries like India are being beaten. A year ago, there was a fear that a trade war will start among the affluent nations. This has gone now and is replaced by the fear that exploitation of developing countries will increase. India is an agricultural nation. Its economy is based on agricultural production. Therefore, the interests of the farmers cannot be neglected at any cost. Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji has tried to assure the Parliament that full attention will be given to such important issues as government subsidy to the farmers, public distribution system, patenting of seeds, and drug prices. The farmers will have the right to store seeds, use them again, and barter with each others. Not only this, they will have the right to sell their products in any international market. The agreement does not have much responsibility for naturally developed genes and the patenting the genetic process. There are no restrictions on investment policies. Still, Mr. Mukherji has not answer to the fear that this agreement will affect drug prices. The government says that it will control prices by encouraging production of domestic drugs. Whatever happens now, since we had no alternative but to accept the Dunkel proposals, we should prepare ourselves for the upcoming challenges. We can be successful in getting our fair share in international trade if we are determined and follow the right path. We must start a major campaign on war footing to make our economy export oriented. In order to face the unfair situation created by the affluent nations, we have to expand bilateral cooperation with some nations. At the same time, we must strengthen cooperation among the developing nations. All this cannot be done at once. We will have to work for a long time to attain it, only then can we be successful. Only a stable government can do that. Therefore, we must end the efforts to create political instability.
