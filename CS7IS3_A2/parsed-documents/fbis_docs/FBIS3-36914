"Payment of debts to regional radio and TV centres for the fourth quarter of 1993 has begun today and will be carried out according to a schedule approved by the Finance Ministry", government spokesman Valentin Sergeyev said on Thursday quoting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. He added that all the debts will be paid in the first three months of 1994. According to the spokesman, the prime minister will meet the demand of leaders of the communication trade union who urged a meeting with him. The prime minister "understands the complexity of the situation and requests the heads and work collectives of regional radio and TV relay centres to continue work", according to the spokesman. On Wednesday the prime minister promised that the debt would be paid by stages, however, communication workers said they had heard enough of such declarations and urged a concrete decision on the matter. In the meantime, communication workers in Azerbaijan decided to follow suit and threatened to cut off broadcasts from Russia if Moscow fails to its half a billion rouble debt for leasing TV relay stations in Azerbaijan.
