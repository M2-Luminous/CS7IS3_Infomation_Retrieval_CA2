The objective of these negotiations is to remove the obstacles that are hindering the implementation of the autonomy agreement in Gaza and Jericho. Some progress has been made in the Civilian Affairs Committee meetings, but the negotiations continue to go around in an empty circle. Responsible Palestinian sources said that the obstacles, which are considered the responsibility of the Security Affairs Committee, consist basically of a matter of phrasing because the two delegations are currently writing up the general agreement. This is why they have returned to the issues they had discussed in the previous negotiations, whether in Taba or in Cairo. The same sources said that the Civilian Affairs and Legal Affairs Committees will resume their meetings later today. The Palestinian sources noted that some progress has been made in the meetings of the Civilian Affairs Committee. Agreement has been reached over transferring the water authority, as well as over the basic principles of communications and radio frequencies for security and civilian purposes. The Palestinian and Israeli negotiators had agreed during their negotiations in Taba within the framework of the Civilian Affairs Committee to set up two Palestinian television stations. MENA has learned that there are basic obstacles facing the course of the Security and Legal Affairs Committees. Regarding the Legal Affairs Committee, the Palestinian side rejects the paper Israel submitted at the end of the last round on the legal jurisdiction of the Palestinian autonomy authorities, as well as the definition of who is Israeli and how to apply the law on such a person if he commits a crime in the Palestinian autonomy areas, and what happens if foreigners commit crimes in these areas. The sources added that if Israel does not accept the legal jurisdiction of the Palestinian autonomy, this means that in practical terms the Palestinian sovereignty over these areas becomes null and void. The Palestinian sources pointed out that with respect to the Security Affairs Committee, the negotiations continue to revolve in an empty circle of arguments and counter-arguments regarding the security of the settlements, joint patrols on the lateral roads, and the agricultural land around the settlements which Israel wants to annex to these settlements under security pretexts. This means that the Palestinians will abandon around 47 percent of their territories and their security responsibilities between the autonomy areas in Gaza and Jericho on the one hand, and Israel on the other. Palestinian sources in the Security Affairs Committee have described the negotiations as complicated. They address all issues that are raised in every round. According to the same sources, going back to these issues forms part of the framework of formulating the general agreement. The same Palestinian sources said that General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff and head of the Israeli delegation, was forced to leave Cairo yesterday evening for Israel to inform Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres of the course of the negotiations and the results they have reached so far. This comes before the expected meeting on Thursday and Friday in Bucharest between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. In another development, sources from the Palestinian delegation denied that Israel has gone back on its promise to release 5,000 of the 10,400 Palestinian detainees, as was announced at the end of last week's round of negotiations. Some sources had mentioned that Israel wants to release only 4,000 detainees instead of the 5,000. The same sources believe that the Palestinian side is still negotiating to release all the Palestinian detainees within a general and comprehensive amnesty on Israel's part so that a basis of mutual confidence between the Palestinian and the Israeli people can be established. The Palestinian sources mentioned that Israel is currently refusing to release the Hamas detainees who carried out operations against the Israeli authorities after signing the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles on 13 September in Washington. They also refuse to release those who have carried out operations killing Israelis. On the other hand, other diplomatic sources believe that the announcement by Hamas that it is ready to recognize Israel on condition that it withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Strip removes all Israeli settlements, and that it hold real elections for the Palestinians, comes after the three operations Hamas carried out in Israel in response to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. These sources believe that these operations were a political message to start political dialogue with Israel after Hamas has realized the importance of taking part in the political process from inside the Palestinian political institution, not from outside. The same sources said that this proves the honesty and soundness of the PLO's political course.
