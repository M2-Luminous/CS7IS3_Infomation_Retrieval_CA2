This visit's aim is to submit the Yemeni president's message to Iran's president, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, to hold talks within the framework of mutual relations, as well to exchange views on most important regional and international issues. To this end, in a meeting that was held by Iran and Yemen's foreign ministers, expansion and strengthening of ties between the two countries in political and economic fields, as well as the international situation, were discussed. During the talks, the two sides stressed unity and solidarity among the Islamic countries as (?necessary for combating) plots hatched by the enemies of Islam in view of the two countries' common history and religion. The two countries also expressed their willingness to expand mutual relations. In this connection, Iran's foreign minister, Dr. Velayati said: The foreign forces cannot guarantee regional security, hence expansion of cooperations among the Islamic countries is necessary for strengthening the world of Islam. Dr Velayati said: If such a strong cooperation existed in the world of Islam, the enemies of Islam would not dare to occupy Palestine in the heart of the Islamic countries. In part of his speech, Iran's foreign minister informed the Yemeni foreign minister of Iran's support for the reunification of Yemen, and described as effective the solving of Yemen's problems and the existence of a powerful Yemen in creating stability and peace in the region. The realities of political conditions and equations in the region and the world are such that these countries have no option other than a realistic attitude toward regional issues. Such an attitude requires them to move in a direction in which expansion of all-sided regional relations, both political and economic, should enjoy top priority. At any rate, the experiences of the past few years have shown that although the regional countries, due to certain problems, have failed to have desirable relations, there are valuable chances, a sound and logical use of which can strengthen solidarity among the regional countries more than ever in the past. In this connection, the Yemeni foreign minister's visit to Iran is an effective step that can be assessed within the framework of long-term objectives in expanding all-sided cooperation. These objectives are expected to receive further attention of the two countries' officials and to obtain desirable progress during the Yemeni foreign minister's visit to Tehran.
