Song, who is also minister in charge of the State Science and Technology Commission, made these remarks during an eight-day tour of Jiangsu Province, East China, which concluded today. Accompanied by Yang Xiaotang, vice-governor of Jiangsu Province, Song Jian inspected the high-tech development zones at Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou, and some high-tech enterprises in Kunshan, Changshu, Zhangjiagang, Jiangyin, Wuxi and Yixing, which are all located in the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou high-tech industrial belt. Song said that a high-tech development zone should be different from an economic development zone. It should pay more attention to apply domestic research results and encourage and attract domestic large and medium-sized enterprises, research institutes and higher education colleges to establish enterprises in it to develop high- tech and new products for export. Song noted that at present, China's high-tech industry is still in the embryonic stage and high-tech development zones should provide the embryonic industry with a base for development. Efforts should be made to foster some big enterprise groups whose annual production output value would reach one billion to 10 billion yuan each so that they can compete in the international market. He said that it was necessary to attract some people with master's degree or a doctorate and some people who have studied abroad to work in the leading bodies and administrative bodies of high-tech development zones. Remuneration should be divided into different levels, so as to improve the rewards for intellectuals, experts and management. Those enterprises with high productivity can raise the rewards for their workers and staff members before the others.
