If the actual values are below the standard for that year, no emission surcharge is due. If the emissions level for any class of nonroad engines exceeds the standard for that year, a surcharge would be due based on the difference. The surcharge would be determined by multiplying the difference by the number of pieces of equipment in the class for the fleet and then by the surcharge rate of $10,000 per ton. It is important to note that so long as a fleet continues to replace equipment at historical rates, no surcharge would be charged. In most other ways the declining average NO X program for nonroad engines is similar to that for onhighway engines. They will both begin in 2000. In order to provide flexibility, EPA is proposing to allow individual fleets to join together into larger fleets for determining compliance with the fleet standard. (Because of the different NO X standards for the Sacramento nonattainment area, individual fleets in Sacramento may only join with other fleets in Sacramento. Likewise, individual fleets in the South Coast Air Basin and Ventura County may only join together with fleets in the South Coast Air Basin and Ventura County.) This provision should accommodate those fleets which may turn over slower or more quickly than the average, notwithstanding any effects of the enhanced vehicle program. Additionally, it could benefit very small fleets. The flexibility to join together should ease the impact of the steady reduction in the fleet average emissions allowed on any fleets with special compliance problems. However, EPA is not proposing to allow averaging between different nonroad equipment classes because, due to the very different uses, there are few benefits to outweigh the complications an averaging scheme could create. For the purpose of calculating surcharges, EPA will assume that all engines certifying at or below 1.5 g/bhp-hr NO X have emission factors of 1.5 g/bhp-hr and that all engines certifying above 1.5 g/bhp-hr NO X but at or below 2.5 g/bhp-hr NO X have emission factors of 2.5 g/bhp-hr. However, if EPA permits use of engines certified at or below 2.5 g/bhp-hr NO X in the South Coast or Ventura after payment of a lifetime emissions surcharge, as described above in section C.(3)(a), such engines will be treated as if they were 1.5 g/bhp-hr engines for the purpose of in-use fleet average emissions calculations.
