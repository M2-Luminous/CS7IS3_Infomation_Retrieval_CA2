The terms for entry and stay he decreed concern nationals from CIS and other countries as well as citizens of Russia's republics, not signatories to the Federative Treaty. From now they will require a special invitation, agreed with local authorities, to be allowed into Yakutia. Besides, foreigners must identify their planned whereabouts, including the name of the street and house number, explain the purpose of their arrival and the duration of their stay in the republic. In some instances, an applicant may be forbidden entry or be deported before his or her term of stay is up. Reasons for this could be actions detrimental to national security, public order, the established traditions and moral standards, custom, currency, and other regulations of Russia and Yakutia.
