This decision was reached at a routine conference of the council of CIS industrial enterprise chief designers. "Some 5,000 plants in six of the biggest Commonwealth countries will be able to pass their customers information on the parameters, cost, and terms for selling their output, and to obtain similar information on other producers' materials and products," Leonid Gancharik, chairman of the chief designers' council and general director of the "Tsentrsistem" Science and Production Association in Minsk, said. "Subscription to the service will make it possible to obtain regular thematic information without any additional request being made, along with an analysis of the market situation regarding availability of goods and their price. Above all, shipments of output under intergovernmental agreements will be placed under operational control." The creation of this global information network is very important today. Simply reducing crosshauls and "freeing up" middlemen will have enormous benefits -- accurate knowledge of the market situation plays a fundamental role in the fate of enterprises. Similar information structures have long been in operation in many industrially developed countries. Any enterprise with ordinary telegraphic communications, a phone line with a modem, or a fax can link up with the system. These information "nerves" will join up at republic and regional centers. For instance, there will be 12 of them in Russia, linked by high-speed modems. There will be no "main" center in the system -- all of them will have absolutely equal rights and technical capabilities. Nor will any country have priority in obtaining, processing, and transmitting important production and economic information.
