The CWM was carried round-trip between the company's plant in Ube City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, and Singapore to study changes in quality as preparation for its practical application. Ube Industries has determined that long-distance transport is possible, and based on the results of these tests, plans to market its utilization to electric power companies and other potential customers. The CWM that was transported consists of 70% finely powdered coal and 30% water with a small amount of additives. The advantages of CWM are that it can be transported in tankers just like heavy oil, and because CWM can be stored in tanks after unloading, it is easier to protect the environment than with conventional coal. Ube Industries plans to produce the CWM in New South Wales, Australia, and ship it to Japan. Many times in the past Ube Industries has manufactured CWM and actually used it in combustion tests to get an idea of its practicality, but the remaining problem was whether CWM could withstand long-distance transport from Australia. For the Ube-Singapore round-trip CWM transport test, which was a longer distance than one-way transport from Australia, Ube Industries obtained the cooperation of Nippon Yusen, Nissho Iwai, and Tsurumi Transportation (Minato-ku, Tokyo). Two-thousand tons of CWM were carried about 20 days while the effect on quality of the rolling of the ship's hull and the heat of tropical temperatures was studied. As a result, Ube Industries concluded that long-distance transport is feasible with modifications to heavy oil tankers. Ube Industries announced, ``With the completion of these transport tests, we have overcome the technical problems for the practical application of CWM,'' and the company will now work toward its utilization in Japan. CWM produced in China is already used in part as a fuel source at thermal power plants, but Ube Industries will market its Australian product as a stable supply of CWM. If business talks bring favorable results, Ube Industries will build a plant at Newcastle in New South Wales.
