Sweden and Finland appeared ready for compromise on a range of issues involving the price of the entry ticket and EU concessions on aid for less-developed regions and Arctic farmers. But Norway remained at loggerheads with the EU over its refusal to give countries of the Union increased access to its fish-rich waters, or to accept limits on its fish exports. And Austria refused to relax restrictions on polluting truck traffic across the Austrian Alps. The EU wants them lifted by the end of the century, but Austria has insisted that they remain in place until 2004. EU ministers were preparing final compromise offers on membership terms to put to the four candidates later Monday, with Germany, Denmark and Britain urging the Union to compromise. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel warned that enlargement was necessary for Europe's economic and political stability. "It would strengthen the EU as an anchor of stability for Europe," he said. German diplomats have often stressed the EU's failure to absorb the four relatively wealthy applicants would be a poor signal to poorer countries next in line for membership, such as Poland and Hungary. The Greek chairman of the EU's Council of Ministers, Theodoros Pangalos, denied that the applicants were being confronted Monday by "take-it-or-leave-it" offers. But he warned that candidates which failed to accept membership terms by midnight, or at the latest by dawn (0630 GMT) on Tuesday, would not be able to enter the EU on the target date of January 1, 1995. The four applicants are among the richest countries in Europe. They all have economies bigger than the EU average. By EU rules, this means they would normally get a proportionately smaller share of the Union's agricultural support hand-outs, while at the same time paying more than the average into the EU budget. The EU has offered to bend its rules to give special support for the fragile Alpine and Arctic agriculture, but the applicant countries want the Union to go further. But diplomatic activity was concentrated on trying to keep Norway and Austria in the talks despite their hard line on fish and Alpine pollution. "Our goal is to complete the negotiations with the other applicants," Norwegian Trade Minister Greta Knudsen told a press conference. But Norwegian Fisheries Minister Jan Henry Olsen made it clear Norway was betting on an EU climb-down over fish. He said Norway was not prepared to increase catch quotas for foreign fishing boats, but added: "We are ready to continue the negotiations." The EU itself was divided over the issue, with Spain, Portugal and Ireland pressing for the right to fish in Norwegian waters and other countries less willing to let the issue sabotage the negotiations. Norway's last attempt to enter the EU, in 1972, foundered over the fisheries issue. Kinkel said: "This should not be allowed to happen again." There was also little movement on the Alpine trucking issue, although the negotiators were said to be searching for a face-saving formula which might satisfy the Austrian public that anti-pollution standards would not be cut. And the EU was divided over concerns that the applicants would tilt the Union's balance of power towards its richer countries, and also give the smaller members relatively more weight at the expense of the larger ones.
