FR940830-0-00052 FR940830-0-00011 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION 49 CFR Part 1002 [Ex Parte No. 246 (Sub-No. 12)] Regulations Governing Fees for Services Performed in Connection With Licensing and Related Services_1994 Update AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission adopts its 1994 User Fee Update and revises its fee schedule in compliance with the regulatory requirement that its fees be updated annually. The fee policy changes also are adopted to improve the Commission's user fee program. EFFECTIVE DATE: These rules are effective on October 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kathleen M. King, (202) 927&hyph;5493, or for costing questions David T. Groves, (202) (927&hyph;6395), or John C. Pertino, (202) 927&hyph;6229. [TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721.] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission's 1994 User Fee Update is adopted substantially as proposed in our notice of proposed rulemaking published at 59 FR 29586 (June 8, 1994). However, due to recent Congressional action concerning tariff filings and the delay in implementing optical imaging for tariff filings, Fee Item (74)(i) relating to the filing of tariffs, rates schedules, and contract and/or contract summaries including supplements, is set at $13 rather that $15. Also, the description of Fee Item (85) involving valuation of railroad lines in conjunction with purchase offers is being revised to clarify that the fee applies to offers to subsidize a rail line. The Commission concludes that the fee changes adopted here will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the Commission's regulations provide for waiver of filing fees for those entities which can make the required showing of financial hardship. In addition, the fee policy changes adopted here will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because those changes only involve minor revisions of the Commission's user fee policy. Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision.
