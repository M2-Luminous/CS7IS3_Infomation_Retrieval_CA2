Major Eric Chaperon, spokesman for the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR], said the 168 soldiers and 51 vehicles were blocked at Rogatica, 35 kilometres (20 miles) from Sarajevo, and were unable to move forward or to retrace their steps. He said only that the British troops were being blocked "for administrative reasons." French and Ukrainian troops in the same convoy, which left Sarajevo on Saturday, were allowed to carry on and reached Gorazde on Monday. Chaperon dismissed suggestions that the British were "hostages." "We have not used the term `hostage' in similar past incidents and we have no reason to use it now," he said.
