I recall with satisfaction my visit to the Republic of Croatia in the spring of 1993 and the understandings and agreements concluded on that occasion. Those agreements have inaugurated an important stage in the development of bilateral relations and facilitated a better knowledge of our cooperation possibilities and of the stands promoted by our countries in connection with various international matters, particularly with regard to the efforts to find a political solution to put an end to the conflict in the area of former Yugoslavia. Mr. President, your visit to Romania opens new prospects for the development of cooperation between our countries and for the implementation of the political desire expressed by both sides to promote a fruitful long-term cooperation. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation that we will sign as well as the other cooperation accords that will be finalized during your current visit are proof of this will of our two countries and also create the necessary premises for the implementation of this will. We are close countries, situated in the same region. Consequently, we are objectively interested in developing ever more substantial ties in the political, economic, and cultural fields. Mr. President, the situation in the region is a handicap for the establishment of normal relations at the bilateral or multilateral level. The armed conflict, the immense loss of human lives, the huge material destruction, and the drama of the refugees represent an unacceptable situation vis-a-vis the aspirations for peace, better life, and democracy which have animated the nations in this part of Europe after the liquidation of the totalitarian communist system. Both of us are fully experiencing the effects of the embargo, at a time when our economies, which are in a period of transition, are least prepared to support them, particularly since there are no compensations. But then, we do not expect anyone to compensate us for our huge economic losses incurred as a result of the observation of the sanctions imposed by the United Nations. The best compensation for us is a speedy normalization of the situation in the former Yugoslav area. The deadlocked peace negotiations, the risk of possible air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the latest trend toward further escalation confirm the imperious need for all parties involved to renounce all confrontation, to end the fighting and military actions, and to show maximum responsibility with a view to finding a political solution to the conflict. Even before the start of the armed conflict, Romania spoke out for a political solution to the Yugoslav crisis. We are convinced that no effort should be spared to end the armed confrontations and agree on some appropriate settlements, which should reflect and observe the interests of all sides involved. In this spirit, we welcomed the recent accord between Croatia and FRY, as an important and essential step toward a political solution, as well as the recent tentative moves toward easing tension in Sarajevo, which can facilitate an understanding between the three sides on a political solution regarding the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are convinced that, thanks to the ties of friendship and cooperation which Romania maintains with all the successor states of former Yugoslavia, we are making a contribution -- alongside of the efforts of the international community -- to restoring stability and a climate of trust among these states and ensuring security and peace in this part of Europe, where we are living. In this peaceful endeavor, no effort is futile. Allow me to raise my glass to the development of Romanian- Croatian relations and to the well-being and peace of our two nations. To your health, Mr. President, and to the health of the distinguished guests.
