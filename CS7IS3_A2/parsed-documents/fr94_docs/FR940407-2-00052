FR940407-2-00052 FR940407-2-00030 [Docket No. GP94&hyph;5&hyph;000] Railroad Commission of Texas, Tight Formation Determination_Texas 156, Spraberry (Trend Area) Formation, FERC No. JD94&hyph;02876T; Preliminary Finding Issued April 1, 1994. The Railroad Commission of Texas (Texas) determined that the Spraberry (Trend Area) Formation (Spraberry Formation), underlying the Preston and Shackelford Units in portions of Midland County, Texas, qualifies as a tight formation under section 107(c)(5) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission issues this Notice of Preliminary Finding that the determination is not supported by substantial evidence. Background 1. Texas' Determination On February 15, 1994, the Commission received Texas' notice determining that the Spraberry Formation underlying the Preston and Shackelford Units in Midland County, Texas, qualifies as a tight formation. Parker & Parsley Development Company (Parker & Parsley) is the applicant before Texas. The recommended area is approximately 52,000 acres in size. The record shows that the Spraberry Formation consists of three distinct productive intervals_the Upper Spraberry, Lower Spraberry, and Dean formations_and that these reservoirs have been producing oil and/or gas for more than 40 years. The record further shows that there are approximately 182 currently active wells in the Spraberry Formation within the recommended area and that at least 100 additional wells have been produced to abandonment. The record also indicates that natural fractures enhance the permeability of the formation. Texas concluded that the Spraberry Formation meets the Commission's permeability guideline based on: (1) Pre-stimulation pressure buildup test data from one well drilled in the recommended area, the Preston Unit Well No. 3414&hyph;A ( # 3414&hyph;A well); (2) Type curve data from 22 stimulated Spraberry wells, 17 of which are located outside of the recommended area; (3) Core tests from three wells within the recommended area; and (4) A table from the ``Atlas of Major Texas Oil Reservoirs'' (1983) showing that the average permeability to oil in the Spraberry (Trend Area) formation is zero. Texas' finding that the formation meets the Commission's oil and gas flow rate guidelines is based on pre-stimulation flow test rates from the # 3414&hyph;A well, which was drilled late in 1992. 2. Regulations/Commission Precedents To qualify a formation as a tight formation, §271.703(c)(2)(i)(A) of the Commission's regulations requires the jurisdictional agency to determine that the expected in situ (matrix and natural fracture) gas permeability throughout the pay section is 0.1 millidarcy (md) or less. 1 §271.703(c)(2)(i)(B) of the regulations requires the jurisdictional agency to show that the expected pre-stimulation stabilized natural gas flow rate, against atmospheric pressure, for wells completed for production in the formation is not expected to exceed the applicable maximum flow rate specified in the table in that section (290 Mcf per day in this case). 2 Finally, §271.703(c)(2)(i)(C) of the regulations requires the jurisdictional agency to show that wells completed for production in the formation are not expected to produce more than five barrels of crude oil per day, prior to stimulation. 3 According to Texas, the Spraberry Formation meets these guidelines. 1 18 CFR 271.703(c)(2)(i)(A) (1993). 2 18 CFR 271.703(c)(2)(i)(B) (1993). 3 18 CFR 271.703(c)(2)(i)(C) (1993). However, in Order No. 99, the Commission defined a tight formation as ``a sedimentary layer of rock cemented together in a manner that greatly hinders the flow of gas through the rock.'' 4 The Commission held in a prior preliminary finding that: 4 Order No. 99, FERC Statutes & Regulations, Regulations Preambles (1977&hyph;1981) ¶30,183 at 31,261. The Commission established guidelines on permeability and flow rates to be used to evaluate the physical characteristics of the rock in the formation in order to show that the formation is tight, which should have been the case prior to the onset of sustained production from the formation. (emphasis added) Accordingly, the Commission further clarified [in Order No. 99] that the objective of the rule was to ``provide incentives to develop tight formations, not to provide incentives to develop all formations with low pre-stimulation production rates.'' 5 As a result, the Commission did not intend to permit a formation that does not actually meet the definition of a ``tight formation'' to qualify based on currently low permeability and flow rate values that are merely a side effect of prior conventional levels of production.'' 6 5 FERC Statutes & Regulations, Regulations Preambles (1977&hyph;1981) ¶30,183 at 31,276.

A final order affirming the tight formation determination was issued by the Commission (64 FERC ¶61,225) after the applicant supplemented the record with data showing that original reservoir conditions also met the Commission's guidelines.
