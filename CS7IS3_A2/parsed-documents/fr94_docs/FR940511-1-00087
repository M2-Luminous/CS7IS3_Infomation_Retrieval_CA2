FR940511-1-00087 FR940511-1-00013 Also, the health-based for a one-in-a-million risk level for octabromodiphenyl oxide using standard intake and exposure assumptions is 0.1 mg/L. No leachate data are available for this waste. However, the Agency assumed an upper-bound leachate concentration of 0.2 mg/L based on the solubility of octabromodiphenyl oxide. Assuming a dilution factor of 100 is achievable during migration to the nearest drinking water well, the concentration in potable water would be below that of concern. As a result, EPA is proposing not to list this waste stream based on low estimated exposure to toxic constituents. ii. Wastewaters. While the Agency has no quantifiable concentration data on octabromodiphenyl oxide found in the wastewaters, adequate data exist on brominated dibenzofurans found in the generated wastes. Brominated dibenzofurans were detected in some of the record samples from octa- and decabromodiphenyl oxide processes. Studies conducted for EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics and by research groups in Germany and the Netherlands show that brominated furans can be formed during the manufacture of brominated diphenyl ethers, as well as during their fabrication into polymers. The evidence currently available to the Agency indicates that brominated dioxins and furans may range from 30&hyph;100% as toxic as their chlorinated counterparts. Using this approach, a record sample of wastewater from the octabromodiphenyl oxide unit showed a maximum toxicity equivalent of 3.7×10 ^7 mg/L of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin (TCDD) equivalent. Assuming a 100-fold dilution of the waste prior to reaching a drinking water well, the level would be below the MCL for 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD, which is 3×10 ^8 mg/L. The Agency selected the highest toxicity value in making this analysis. Based on this evaluation, the Agency is proposing not to list this waste stream for brominated dibenzofurans, because EPA believes that estimated exposure levels to toxic constituents are sufficiently low so as to not pose a threat to human health and the environment. The Agency was unable to quantify levels of octabromodiphenyl oxide present in wastewaters. However, the solubility of the chemical is only 0.2 mg/L. The flow of wastewaters from this process represents less than one percent of the total amount of process wastewater injected. The health-based level for a one-in-a-million risk level for octabromodiphenyl is 0.1 mg/L. Due to the high level of dilution occurring prior to injection, the resulting concentration of the toxic chemical expected to reach drinking water aquifers is well below levels of concern. e. Wastes From the Production of Decabromodiphenyl Oxide _i. Solids. The production of decabromodiphenyl oxide generates solid wastes consisting of collected spilled product. Only limited analytical results were obtained from the record sampling of this waste and no TCLP leachate data were obtained for this compound. However, the Agency assumed an upper-bound leachate concentration of 0.2 mg/L based on the aqueous solubility of the constituent. The health-based level for a one-in-a-million risk level for this compound is 0.35 mg/L, (assuming exposure of drinking 2.0 L/day for a 70 year exposure period) so the concentration in the leachate is already below the level of concern before any further dilution. Therefore, the Agency is proposing not to list this wastestream. ii. Wastewaters. The manufacture of decabromodiphenyl oxide also generates a wastewater stream. The Agency was unable to quantify the amount of the product in the wastewater stream. Based on the process chemistry, however, a small amount of product would appear in the stream. The solubility of decabromodiphenyl oxide is less than 0.2 mg/L. This chemical has a health-based level of 0.35 mg/L so the leachate concentration is already below the level of concern even before the subsequent significant dilution occurs. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to not list this wastestream. f. Wastes From the Production of Tribromophenol _i. Solids. Solids from the production of tribromophenol (TBP) consist of spilled materials, off-specification product and spent filter cartridges which were used to remove entrained TBP particulates from the gaseous hydrogen bromide coproduct. The one plant manufacturing this chemical mixes the three wastes together prior to shipment off site for land disposal. Most of this waste is sent to a Subtitle C hazardous waste facility. However, some is being sent to a Subtitle D landfill. Inadequate toxicity data for tribromophenol (TBP) have prevented the Agency from establishing a human health reference value for tribromophenol (TBP). Therefore, as previously discussed, the Agency performed a structure activity relationship (SAR) analysis in order to provide a provisional human health reference value for this compound.
