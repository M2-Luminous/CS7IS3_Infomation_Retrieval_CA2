The premier made the remarks at the House of Councillors Budget Committee amid recent sharp gains by the yen against the U.S. dollar. "Enacting the national budget for the current fiscal year and promoting deregulation should stabilize foreign exchange rates," Hata said. The 73.1 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 was to be approved at an upper house plenary session later in the day. Hata also told the committee that the government is taking appropriate measures against the currency turmoil by maintaining close contact with the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers.
