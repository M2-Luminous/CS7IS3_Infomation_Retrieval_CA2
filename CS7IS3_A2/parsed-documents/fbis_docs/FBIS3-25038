In a hard hitting statement on Friday, Rukoro also denied that he had voiced criticism of lack of Government action concerning the alleged involvement of Minister of Justice, Ngarikutuke Tjiriange, and deputy Home Affairs minister, Nangolo Ithete, in illegal ostrich dealing. He said that no such subject had been discussed at Cabinet. On the subject of his future attendance at Cabinet meetings, Rukoro said that "following an amicable and comradely discussion between the Right Honourable Prime Minister and myself it was agreed that my regular attendance at Cabinet meetings was no longer necessary in view of the following: as a rule Deputy Ministers do not attend Cabinet meetings in their own right but only in the absence of their substantive Ministers whom they are deputising; His Excellency, the President, however, has the power to invite any deputy minister to attend a particular session or all sessions of Cabinet by way of a special consideration. "Since I was President of the NNF [Namibian National Front] and SWANU [South-West African National Union] when I was initially appointed as deputy minister, it was agreed between HE [His Excellency] the President and myself that by virtue of my leadership of NNF and SWANU, I shall be made a regular attendant of Cabinet meetings. I resigned the aforesaid positions last September and ever since then, strictly speaking, I had no justification attending Cabinet meetings in my own right. "It is therefore clear that the decision mutually arrived at between the Prime Minister and myself is nothing but a normal regularisation of my position and status as ordinary deputy minister in Government on a par with other deputy ministers." Rukoro concluded by saying that both he and the Prime Minister were "happy" with this arrangement.
