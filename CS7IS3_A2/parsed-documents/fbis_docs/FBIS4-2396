After a nine-day inspection, Hu Ping described Pudong's development and opening up as having very good momentum and being full of promise. He said: SEZ's should compete with one another in their development and opening up. Relying on preferential policies in development and opening up was a historical step of the past. Of course, the existing preferential policies will remain unchanged, but SEZ's should rely on their own functions in development hence. Pudong, as China's largest development zone, is making efforts to do so. For instance, it is taking a further step to improve foreigners' living environment, including providing a better shopping environment for foreign employees' wives and first-rate educational facilities and faculty for their children. These are the developments of their own functions, in relying on a superior environment of intangible factors to attract more investors. Hu Ping said: The State Council has all along supported Pudong through its loan policy, and this support will not change. However, the development of Pudong has been proceeding very rapidly, and attention should be paid to making effective use of limited funds. I do not think that the present difficulties concerning a shortage of funds will affect Pudong's speed of development.
