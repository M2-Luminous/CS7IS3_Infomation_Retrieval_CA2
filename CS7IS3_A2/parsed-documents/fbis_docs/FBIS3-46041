"The Vatican must sever its so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan, recognize (that) the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China and Taiwan is part of Chinese territory," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Beijing requires all countries with whom it has diplomatic relations to recognize it as the sole government of all China. It views Taiwan, the island to which defeated nationalist forces retreated after the civil war, as an outlaw province. The Holy See "must also stop interfering in China's internal affairs, including its religious affairs," the spokesman said, referring to unofficial Chinese congregations gathering for worship. "This is (a) matter of principle which should be solved in the first place in Sino-Vatican relations," he said. The pope expressed hopes on Monday to visit China. It was the second time in less than a year that he has voiced such an ambition. He said he did not want to forego a chance to build relations with Beijing and the state-sanctioned church, which is dependent on the communist party. But he added that much needed to be done ahead of establishing full diplomatic relations. After the Chinese communists came to power in 1949, Beijing and the Vatican severed ties and the Holy See recognized Taiwan. The Chinese government has created an official church but many among the country's Catholic population remain loyal to the pope, gathering in groups in a so-called "church of silence" supported by the Vatican.
