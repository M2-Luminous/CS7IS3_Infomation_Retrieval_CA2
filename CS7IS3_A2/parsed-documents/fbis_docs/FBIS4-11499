The Association of Foreign Journalists in Peru (APEP) said in a communique released today that this event "is an isolated act of censorship against freedom of the press, which should not be allowed to be repeated." The communique adds that the cameraman "was forced by the president himself to erase part of the film taken during his visit" to the prison for terrorists in Yanamayo, Puno Department, at the Bolivian border. According to the communique, the film that was erased includes footage of a group of women inmates, who read a document related to their situation in the presence of the visitors. The communique says "the correspondents and the world were thus deprived of information of public interest, when there was not even a warning of any restrictions" on the correspondents who visited the prison.
