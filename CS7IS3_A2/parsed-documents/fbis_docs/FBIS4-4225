Mr. Chen stressed that air safety work undertaken by CAAC had to be done in accordance with the law and regulations covering various items including the sale of tickets, checking of tickets, inspection of luggage and passengers, examination on board the plane and the handling of hijacking. Responsibility had to be clearly defined and to be held by officials on duty. The practice of safety coming first with the emphasis on precautions had to be employed. Possible hijackers and incidents likely to pose a threat to air safety have to be dealt with on the ground and not let them develop to the airborne stage. As for hijacking incidents, they have to be fully investigated right to their end. Responsibilities for hijacking have to be distinguished clearly while effective measures to preventing hijacking have to be sought after. Hijacking incidents have to be seriously handled, the director said. Since the beginning of last year, CAAC has issued a succession of rules, regulations, decisions, instructions and notices for strengthened air safety while at the same time greatly increasing the number of air security personnel, equipment, and facilities for the strict implementation of safety inspections and precautions. Mr Chen said that such measures had achieved success to some extent in countering hijacking. The authorities uncovered six hijacking attempts, arrested 45 suspects who hid firearms and weapons restricted according to law and seized a number of dangerous items and contraband articles.
