FR941019-2-00119 FR941019-2-00080 Section 2 of the Clayton Act, known as the Robinson-Patman Act, 10 prohibits price discrimination in certain circumstances. Historically, the Commission has enforced this provision. 10 15 U.S.C. §§13&hyph;13b, 21a (1988). 2.3␣Federal Trade Commission Act Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (``FTC Act'') declares unlawful ``unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.'' 11 Pursuant to its authority over unfair methods of competition, the Commission may take administrative action against conduct that violates the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, as well as anticompetitive practices that do not fall within the scope of the Sherman or Clayton Acts. The Commission may also seek injunctive relief in federal court against any such conduct under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act. Although enforcement at the Commission relating to international deceptive practices has become increasingly important over time, these Guidelines are limited to the Commission's antitrust authority under the unfair methods of competition language of Section 5. 11 15 U.S.C. §45 (1988 & Supp. 1993). 2.4␣Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (``HSR Act''), 15 U.S.C. §18a, provides the Department and the Commission with several procedural devices to facilitate enforcement of the antitrust laws with respect to anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions. 12 The HSR Act requires persons engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce to notify the Agencies of proposed mergers or acquisitions that would exceed statutory size-of-party and size-of-transaction thresholds, 13 to provide certain information relating to reportable transactions, and to wait for a prescribed period_15 days for cash tender offers and 30 days for all other transactions_before consummating the transaction. 14 The Agency may, before the end of the waiting period, request additional information concerning a transaction (make a ``Second Request'') and thereby extend the waiting period beyond the initial one prescribed, to a specified number of days after the receipt of the material required by the Second Request_10 days for cash tender offers and 20 days for all other transactions. 15 12 The scope of the Agencies' jurisdiction under Clayton §7 exceeds the scope of those transactions subject to the premerger notification requirements of the HSR Act. Whether or not the HSR Act premerger notification thresholds are satisfied, either Agency may request the parties to a merger affecting U.S. commerce to provide information voluntarily concerning the transaction. In addition, the Department may issue Civil Investigative Demands (``CIDs'') pursuant to the Antitrust Process Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1311&hyph;1314 (1988), and the Commission may issue administrative CIDs pursuant to the Act of Aug. 26, 1994, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;312, §7; 108 Stat. 1691 (1994). The Commission may also issue administrative subpoenas and orders to file special reports under Sections 9 and 6(b) of the FTC Act, respectively. 15 U.S.C. §§49, 46(b) (1988). Authority in particular cases is allocated to either the Department or the Commission pursuant to a voluntary clearance protocol. See Antitrust & Trade Reg. Daily (BNA), Dec. 6, 1993. 13 Unless exempted pursuant to the Act, the parties must provide premerger notification to the Agencies if (1) the acquiring person, or the person whose voting securities or assets are being acquired, is engaged in commerce or any activity affecting commerce; and (2)(a) any voting securities or assets of a person engaged in manufacturing which has annual net sales or total assets of $10 million or more are being acquired by any person which has total assets or annual net sales of $100 million or more, or (b) any voting securities or assets of a person not engaged in manufacturing which has total assets of $10 million or more are being acquired by any person which has total assets or annual sales of $100 million or more; or (c) any voting securities or assets of a person with annual net sales or total assets of $100 million or more are being acquired by any person with total assets or annual net sales of $10 million or more; and (3) as a result of such acquisition, the acquiring person would hold (a) 15 percent or more of the voting securities or assets of the acquired person, or (b) an aggregate total amount of the voting securities and assets of the acquired person of $15 million. 15 U.S.C. §18a(a) (1988). The size of the transaction test set forth in (3) supra must be read in conjunction with 16 CFR 802.20 (1994). This Section exempts asset acquisitions valued at $15 million or less. It also exempts voting securities acquisitions of $15 million or less unless, as a result of the acquisition, the acquiring person would hold 50 percent or more of the voting securities of an issuer that has annual net sales or total assets of $25 million or more. The HSR rules are necessarily technical, and should be consulted, rather than relying on this summary. 14 15 U.S.C. §18a(b) (1988 & Supp. 1993); 16 CFR 803.1 (1994). 15 15 U.S.C. §18a(e) (1988). The HSR Act and the FTC rules implementing the HSR Act 16 exempt from the premerger notification requirements certain international transactions (typically those having little nexus to U.S. commerce) that otherwise meet the statutory thresholds. 17 Failure to comply with the HSR Act is punishable by court-imposed civil penalties of up to $10,000 for each day a violation continues. The court may also order injunctive relief to remedy a failure substantially to comply with the HSR Act. Businesses may seek an interpretation of their obligations under the HSR Act from the Commission. 18 16 16 CFR 801&hyph;803 (1994). 17 16 CFR 801.1(e), (k), 802.50&hyph;52 (1994). See Section 4.22 infra. 18 See 16 CFR 803.30 (1994). 2.5␣National Cooperative Research and Production Act The National Cooperative Research and Production Act (``NCRPA''), 15 U.S.C. §§4301&hyph;06, clarifies the substantive application of the U.S. antitrust laws to joint research and development activities and joint production activities. Originally drafted to encourage research and development by providing a special antitrust regime for research and development (``R&D'') joint ventures, the NCRPA requires U.S. courts to judge the competitive effects of a challenged joint R&D or joint production venture, or a combination of the two, in properly defined relevant markets and under a rule-of-reason standard. The statute specifies that the conduct ``shall be judged on the basis of its reasonableness, taking into account all relevant factors affecting competition, including, but not limited to, effects on competition in properly defined, relevant research, development, product, process, and service markets.'' 15 U.S.C. §4302. This approach is consistent with the Agencies' general analysis of joint ventures. 19 19 See, e.g., U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Guidelines for the Enforcement and Acquisition of Intellectual Property (Proposed), §4; Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy and Analytical Principles Relating to Health Care and Antitrust, Issued by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, Sept. 27, 1994, Statement 2 (outlining a four-step approach for joint venture analysis). See generally National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85 (1984); F.T.C. v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447 (1986). The NCRPA also establishes a voluntary procedure pursuant to which the Attorney General and the FTC may be notified of a joint R&D or production venture. The statute limits the monetary relief that may be obtained in private civil suits against the participants in a notified venture to actual rather than treble damages, if the challenged conduct is within the scope of the notification. With respect to joint production ventures, the National Cooperative Production Amendments of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;42, 107 Stat. 117, 119, provide that the benefits of the limitation on recoverable damages for claims resulting from conduct within the scope of a notification are not available unless (1) the principal facilities for the production are located within the United States or its territories, and (2) ``each person who controls any party to such venture (including such party itself) is a United States person, or a foreign person from a country whose law accords antitrust treatment no less favorable to United States persons than to such country's domestic persons with respect to participation in joint ventures for production.'' 15 U.S.C. §4306(2) (Supp. 1993). 2.6␣Webb-Pomerene Act The Webb-Pomerene Act, 15 U.S.C. §§61&hyph;65, provides a limited antitrust exemption for the formation and operation of associations of otherwise competing businesses to engage in collective export sales. The exemption applies only to the export of ``goods, wares, or merchandise.'' 20 It does not apply to conduct that has an anticompetitive effect in the United States or that injures domestic competitors of the members of an export association. Nor does it provide any immunity from prosecution under foreign antitrust laws. 21 Associations seeking an exemption under the Webb-Pomerene Act must file their articles of agreement and annual reports with the Commission, but pre-formation approval from the Commission is not required. 20 15 U.S.C. §61 (1988). 21 See, e.g., Cases 89/85, etc., Ahlstrom v. Comm'n (``Wood Pulp'') (E.C.J., Sept. 27, 1988), 1988 E.C.R. 5193, [1988] 4 C.M.L.R. 901. 2.7␣Export Trading Company Act of 1982 The Export Trading Company Act of 1982 (the ``ETC Act''), Pub. L. No. 97&hyph;290, 96 Stat. 1234, is designed to increase U.S. exports of goods and services. It addresses that goal in several ways. First, in Title II, it encourages more efficient provision of export trade services to U.S. producers and suppliers by reducing restrictions on trade financing provided by financial institutions. 22 Second, in Title III, it reduces uncertainty concerning the application of the U.S. antitrust laws to export trade through the creation of a procedure by which persons engaged in U.S. export trade may obtain an export trade certificate of review (``ETCR''). 23 Third, in Title IV, it clarifies the jurisdictional rules applicable to non-import cases brought under the Sherman Act and the FTC Act. 24 The Title III certificates are discussed briefly here; the jurisdictional rules are treated below in Section 3.1. 22 See 12 U.S.C. §§372, 635 a&hyph;4, 1841, 1843 (1988 & Supp. 1993) (Because Title II does not implicate the antitrust laws, it is not discussed further in these Guidelines.) 23 15 U.S.C. §§4011&hyph;21 (1988 & Supp. 1993). 24 15 U.S.C. §6a (1988); 15 U.S.C. §45(a)(3) (1988). Export trade certificates of review are issued by the Secretary of Commerce with the concurrence of the Attorney General. Persons named in the ETCR obtain limited immunity from suit under both state and federal antitrust laws for activities that are specified in the certificate and that comply with the terms of the certificate. To obtain an ETCR, an applicant must show that proposed export conduct will: (1) Result in neither a substantial lessening of competition or restraint of trade within the United States nor a substantial restraint of the export trade of any competitor of the applicant; (2) Not unreasonably enhance, stabilize, or depress prices in the United States of the class of goods or services covered by the application;
