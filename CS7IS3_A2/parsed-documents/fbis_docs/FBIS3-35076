Some are even inflating these differences more than the enemy. Some are trading in them, as if betrayal of the homeland's unity is a profitable trade. Some become angry and rancorous every time there are reports that the Yemeni brothers are about to reach an agreement to contain their differences and sign a document of pledge which will safeguard the dignity of the one Yemeni homeland and maintain its great pride. Some Arabs' hostility to all forms of unity wherever it may be is an old but new hostility. We know that it is in their interest to maintain this hostility. We also know that they are not annoyed when they are accused of regionalism, conspiring against unity, and of having a continuous willingness to strike at the nation's dearest principles and convictions. It is important for them to maintain their own interests, which contradict those of the one Arab nation. It is also important for them to hold on to their privileges and trivialities, which harm the one nation's privileges. Therefore, they continue to stand in the trench of fragmentation against the trench of unity. They also continue to stand in the front of putrid regionalism against the front of honorable supporters of pan-Arabism. Their stand and press cannot but be a continuation of their stands toward every unionist plan which carried great hopes through the efforts of sincere people or which left behind many wounds as a result of disappointment caused by those who are hostile to these hopes as well as the unionist hopes and aspirations. Yemen's unity came as a painful strike to all Arab separatists. The unionists' concern to protect and entrench this unity harms those who used their press, money, movements, and connections against the nation efforts to eliminate the elements of its weakness, chief of which are division and fragmentation. Therefore, we look forward to the meeting of Yemeni brothers in Amman, the capital of reconciliation and accord, with joy, hope, and optimism in order to achieve a big step on the road to entrenching Yemeni unity and striking a strong blow to the faces of the enemies who are most hostile to our unity, liberty, and dignity. This takes place at a time when we need some joy after the Gulf tragedy took away all our joy for reasons that are no secret to anyone and with means that are known to all.
