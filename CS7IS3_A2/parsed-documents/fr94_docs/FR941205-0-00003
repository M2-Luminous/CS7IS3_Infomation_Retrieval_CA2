FR941205-0-00003 FR941205-0-00001 This course of action is necessary so that OPM may utilize its resources in the most effective way and in a manner most beneficial to enrollees. It is in the best interest of enrollees that OPM ensure that FEHB Program contracts are administered so that benefits to enrollees are optimum and the costs to enrollees and the FEHB Program are minimized. OPM shares the concern of the Congress, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) about contract administration under the FEHB Program. In order to improve standards and oversight of insurance carriers and enhance our overall program operations to improve service to OPM's customers, additional emphasis needs to be placed on functions that, of necessity, are given lower priority when staff are occupied with applications, negotiations, and open season materials review. During 1995, OPM will redirect resources to projects designed to address weaknesses in the oversight of contractor performance as well as improve communication with FEHB enrollees to ensure that we and our participating carriers are meeting their needs. In future years, we will prioritize functions. While OPM is not required to issue regulations that clarify existing policy, we understand that there is interest in this issue, and we wish to give all parties an opportunity to comment. We are publishing the regulation at this time before interested HMOs begin the time-consuming application process. Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(A) of title 5 of the U.S. Code, I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking. The interim regulations simply clarify OPM's policy under which it invites applications from HMO's interested in participating in the FEHB Program. E.O. 12866, Regulatory Review This rule has been reviewed by OMB in accordance with E.O. 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they primarily affect OPM's administrative procedures.
