Memorandum of Accord Has Avoided Acute Political Crisis" -- first two paragraphs are introduction] [Text] Sergey Shakhray has unexpectedly become a key figure in the disposition of political forces this spring. His parliamentary speech in support of the amnesty has muddled up quite a few people's cards. Our talk took place in the new office of the minister for nationalities affairs and regional policy on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment. Five months ago a hail of bullets flew through these windows on the third story of the White House. Now they look onto a peaceful view of the Moscow River. [Ustyuzhanin] Sergey Mikhaylovich, a number of your former kindred spirits have now turned on you with accusations of a shameless act of betrayal. [Shakhray] It is the same old story. The moral aspect was left out of the debate about the amnesty altogether. It was obvious to all that both sides were to blame for the events of 3-4 October last year, albeit to differing degrees. These events were preceded by a creeping usurpation of power without any formal violation of the Constitution by the Supreme Soviet. The president cut this Gordian knot by formally violating the Constitution. The result was the assault on City Hall and "Ostankino" and the shoot-out at the White House. It was an episode of civil war. The logic of civilian clashes does not know of any precedents for identical punishment. First of all the victors put the vanquished on trial, later the tables are turned, and so on ad infinitum. And at every stage of this process innocent people become casualties. There is only one effective way to get out of strong-arm confrontation, and that is through an act of reconciliation. And we have now proposed one. [Ustyuzhanin] Are you not oversimplifying things? [Shakhray] To many people it is was clear that 1994 could have become a year of civil war. The charge of confrontation that had accumulated over recent years had become too powerful. For a time we lifted this threat. But the amnesty act relegated the "Russia's Choice" bloc to the political wilderness. Hence the sharp reaction to the other parties' peacemaking initiative. [Ustyuzhanin] What in your view are the principal political gains of the amnesty? [Shakhray] The whole of society has won. I know the reaction from the regions -- it is a sigh of relief. The heads of administrations with whom I spoke recently are requesting that we take further steps in this direction. The president, government, parliament, and those who benefited by the amnesty are all winners by this. The president and the Duma will cooperate closely (surprisingly, this is happening at the moment), passions will finally die down, and "Democratic Russia's" censure will abate. It will become apparent that the interests of the Duma and the president coincide, at least tactically and temporarily. Some of the Duma deputies, who came to the Duma with the aim of freeing the Lefortovo inmates, have kept their promise and a potential hotbed of conflict has thus been extinguished. Although their interests and those of the released Lefortovo prisoners will probably diverge in the future. [Ustyuzhanin] What makes you say this? [Shakhray] New leaders have appeared within the Duma itself, they do not want confrontation, it is important to them to retain the image of initiators of civil reconciliation and to accumulate political capital. The fact that Rutskoy and Khasbulatov are free is also advantageous for the president. The juridical and political bases of their bid for power have now entirely vanished. Anyone may return to power, but only through elections. Which is great! This in itself is a step toward reconciliation. The main point is that the Memorandum of Accord has become the valve which has let off steam from the acute political crisis expected in April or May. [Ustyuzhanin] Why in April or May, and what crisis are you talking about? [Shakhray] In society today we are currently witnessing a struggle between three elites -- the Moscow elite, the regional elite, and the sector elite. Moreover, the latter two elites have begun to move closer together. For its part, the Moscow elite has concentrated over 70 percent of the entire country's banking capital in the capital's banks, and it has powerful levers of influence on the authorities. All of these forces are seeking a leader and middlemen to help the competing sides avoid clashes. One way of letting off steam might have been a demand for the president to "surrender" his premier and his cabinet. The amnesty, however, has disrupted the already established "combat alliances" and thrown their plans into disarray. The amnesty has basically saved Chernomyrdin's skin. [Ustyuzhanin] Sergey Mikhaylovich, judging by your analysis, this summer we will witness universal brotherhood.... [Shakhray] There is still a long way to go before we reach that stage. The country has gained a temporary breathing space, a pause. This is the one thing we can thank the amnesty for. But it is only a breathing space. Unless we exploit it, we could see a repetition of the events of October. And then a new figure would appear at the forefront of the political stage -- the man in shoulder boards. The establishment of order in the country would then cost far more lives. We must do much more to achieve brotherhood. [Ustyuzhanin] What exactly? [Shakhray] Right now orthodox Christians, Muslims, and all other Russian faiths should hold funeral services for the dead. We all need to beg forgiveness of the families of the killed and wounded, to acknowledge that it is impossible to define who is right and who is guilty by juridical methods. Our leaders need to repent most of all. The package of documents adopted by the Duma offers this opportunity for repentance and civil reconciliation. Right now it is important to give the new parliament the chance to work at full throttle. The economy will suffocate without laws. After all, there is virtually no time left for the Duma to finish its work -- 22 months. It would be offensive and shameful to waste these months on new political clashes.
