Ciller was shocked by reports published by Turkish newspapers yesterday that the deposit accounts will be converted into Turkish lira and that the exchange bureaus will be closed. She quickly called Yaman Turuner, the head of the central bank, and Aykon Dogan, minister of state responsible for economic affairs, from Istanbul to instruct them to make a detailed statement. Ciller answered a HURRIYET correspondent's question in Eskisehir, saying: "That is out of the question. Who stands to gain from such rumors? Even the military regimes would not put that process into effect. I have already given an instruction for an official statement on the affair." Later, Aykon Dogan issued a written statement. He said: "There is no need to intervene in foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency is not in short supply on the markets. No pending transfer in foreign currency exists in the central bank or the other commercial banks." The central bank also issued a statement. It said: "Our people must ignore such rumors and maintain their deposits and investments in any way they wish without anxiety."
