His artillery has shelled Knin, Sarajevo, Tuzla, and all the other towns with Muslim majorities -- without making any distinction between civil and military targets. This general has become Greater Serbia's protector, the symbol of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. The appointment was on Belgrade's hills, far from the din of war. [Pellizzari] Why did you relentlessly shell Gorazde, a UN safe area? [Mladic] We attacked after the Muslims had attacked us for 15 days. They were firing on our positions in an attempt to link up with the other safe areas which are under their control -- not to defend themselves, but in order to spread the war in Serbia and Montenegro. [Pellizzari] The snipers were targeting children too, and the shells were falling on hospitals. [Mladic] You should have asked Izetbegovic these same questions two years ago, when they attacked our military hospital. Or in 1991, when the Croats were beheading women and children on the banks of the Korana river, or when they blew up Serbian homes with people still inside them, and then sang "Thank You, Germany" in German. [Pellizzari] Near Tuzla, late at night, you also fired on UN Blue Helmets. [Mladic] The report you saw is completely false. The clash took place in the night of 29 April. The Blue Helmets fired 72 shells, killing nine people and wounding others. They attacked because they want to transform Tuzla into a NATO airfield. In the past, they could move very freely in that area, and they did not fulfill their commitment to station Russian officers there. [Pellizzari] Why do you always prefer Russian Blue Helmets? Do they favor you? [Mladic] No, they are neutral. But a great country must intervene in this war in which all foreign countries are intervening. [Pellizzari] Tito, however, did not believe all that much in Slav brotherhood and in Russia's disinterested involvement in this area. [Mladic] This is a political question, and I do not wish to answer political questions, ever. However, I will make an exception. Without Tito and his drunken followers, this war would have never taken place. In any case, it was not us who started it. [Pellizzari] Any agreement or compromise reached with you becomes fragile, uncertain. You were supposed to move away six tanks, under UN supervision, but instead you did things your own way. [Mladic] It is a small episode. [Pellizzari] Yes, but a significant one. [Mladic] This is my country, and my country is sovereign within its borders. I am the one who decides where to locate troops and military equipment. Just as you decide at Aviano or Falconara [Italian air bases]. [Pellizzari] Is there any difference between a war fought between armies and a war fought against unarmed civilians? [Mladic] I have studied Hannibal, Alexander the Great, the Crusades, and World War I and II. This is the most difficult and the strangest war ever to have been fought on earth. It is a different conflict because our enemies were citizens in our own state. And it is a low-intensity war, as military experts say -- one decided abroad, by Europeans, by the Americans, by the Turks. [Pellizzari] You see things in a very black-and-white fashion, with all the blame on one side. [Mladic] Listen, to quarrel there must always be two sides, and to make peace you need two sides too. But the greatest blame must go to those who attacked us. We are defending our people and our land, and here we can see the international community's double-dealing. Instead of being neutral, the United Nations, too, has provided the Muslims with fuel and arms which were sent together with the humanitarian aid. [Pellizzari] There is one village that you have always refrained from attacking. [Mladic] Yes, Suni, where the Ustashas killed my father during World War II. I never found my father's grave. The majority of the population there are Muslims, but I never attacked those people. I would have been accused of wanting to take revenge for family reasons. [Pellizzari] Sum up your biography in a few sentences. [Mladic] I was born in Bosnia and I am like many other Serbs who were born there. I attended all the various military schools, and went through all the various ranks. But I have a tragic fate. Toward the end of the 20th century, I must use weapons to react against the extermination of my people. [Pellizzari] You have a very bad reputation in the Western press. You are the symbol of ethnic cleansing. [Mladic] I am aware of it. I am a general and I am more aware than others that war is a very dirty business. This word ought not even exist in human speech. Weapons are a terrible invention. I believe that even toy weapons ought to be forbidden throughout the world, from north to south. [Pellizzari] If some day politicians decide that this war must end, that the embargo must be lifted, and that Mladic must step aside, what will you do then? [Mladic] Politicians start wars, and generals carry them out -- it is like this everywhere. Again, it is politicians who decide when the moment has come to put an end to war. But this war's true warlords are to be found in the West. The Serbian people are awaiting their decisions. The fewer aircraft take off from UN bases, the easier will it become to achieve peace in this region. The key to the war lies in NATO's command. NATO is an alliance to defend its member countries, but no one here has ever threatened any of its member countries. [Pellizzari] You place the Serbian nation above all other considerations. [Mladic] There are two sacrosanct things in life: my country and my women. The soil and women bear life. In fact, only a few among them have any say in the battles waged between armies. Mrs. Thatcher wants to do so. She is helping the Croats and Muslims, this is why they are losing. After mothers, wives, and daughters, it is soldiers who most loathe war. [Pellizzari] The conflict in Bosnia looks like a religious conflict. [Mladic] Perhaps we Serbs are no better than others, but we are not any worse either. Nor are we a tennis ball that can be struck in all directions. Nor do we want to become like an Amazonian tribe on its way to extinction, or like a rare species confined to a reserve. Islam wants to penetrate into Europe, and the West will see it grow like a mushroom. However, I have always showed myself humane toward enemy soldiers. I may add that I have prevented the conflict from spreading. [Pellizzari] How do you mean? [Mladic] When shells start flying, they can fly in all directions, even very far from here. Toward the Pyrenees, toward Siberia. Let me remind you of the attempt in Sarajevo, in 1914. [Pellizzari] Why do you prevail in battle? [Mladic] I have a mind of my own, but I want no publicity. Ultimately, publicity does not allow you to live. Contrary to what is being said and written, I am not waging a war against the Croatian or the Muslim people. I am waging a war against their leaders, and against those instigating them from abroad. I respect my enemies, but I do not hate them. This is why I win.
