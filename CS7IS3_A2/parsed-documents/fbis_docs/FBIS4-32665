Kozinc, who chaired the government's housing commission, resigned under pressure from the public indignant that officials in newly-independent Slovenia should have greater privileges than those enjoyed by functionaries in the defunct communist regime. The commission was paying out up to 100,000 Deutsche marks' worth of housing credits from the state budget at interest rates one-sixth of those paid by the man in the street for a housing credit from a commercial bank. The favourable credits were used for a variety of purposes other than housing, such as building a swimming pool in the pation in the case of rightist M.P. Irena Oman. Kozinc himself benefited from the scheme to the tune of 70,000 Deutsche marks in housing credits. Kozinc is the fifth minister to resign from the cabinet of Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek in recent months, which means that one-third of the ministers have been replaced under a cloud.
