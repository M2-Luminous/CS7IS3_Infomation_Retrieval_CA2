While the adoption of the law on identity cards by the Macedonian Assembly is waiting for "better times," the Interior Ministry is preparing a "counterstrike"--it will start to issue the new identity cards as early as April, and possibly the beginning of June. Regardless of whether the new law is passed or not, legal form will be ensured by applying the old law, but with changes in the regulations. To put it more simply, the form of the identity card will be changed, which the ministry has the right to do, just as in the case of the change in passports. Black Number The Interior Ministry decided on this step because the present situation with the use and issuance of identity cards, in which real chaos prevailed (red, blue, and plastic-coated ones are in use), is becoming increasingly untenable. Standardization of the main civil document has also become necessary in order to clear up definitively the question of who is and who is not a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia. According to Blagoja Toskovski, a chief at the Interior Ministry, the current process of determining the status of Macedonian citizenship is definitive enough to give an answer as to how many citizens Macedonia has. The information simply shows that many residents, knowing that they did not meet the conditions for obtaining citizenship, did not even request it, but are continuing to reside in Macedonia, using the old identity cards, obtained in various ways. That is the so-called "black number," whose magnitude is unknown, and which can only be determined by issuing new identity cards, which, however, can only be obtained on the basis of having received citizenship. This step is an attempt at finally clearing up the dilemma of who is a citizen of Macedonia, and all those who will not meet the conditions for obtaining a new identity card will have the status of foreigners; they will be easily identified, and they will have to regulate their stay in Macedonia in accordance with the rules for residence by foreigners. Prediction "Indisputably it is necessary to adopt the law on identity cards. That does not mean, however, that it should be postponed indefinitely, because the situation `in the field' is already intolerable. The Interior Ministry will wait for the law to be passed, but if that does not happen we will start issuing the new forms for identity cards this spring," Blagoja Toskovski said. As the situation regarding passage of the law on identity cards stands now in the Assembly, the Interior Ministry will probably have to start without this law. The positions of the deputies' groups still remain unchanged: The opposition is stubbornly insisting that identity cards be written only in the Macedonian language and the Cyrillic alphabet, including the citizen's name, and the coalition itself, in addition to being divided, has not decided what it should definitely accept. Specifically, the PDP-NDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity-People's Democratic Party] is insisting that the entire contents of the identity card, including the name of the owner, be written in the language and script of national minorities, as well as the Macedonian language and Cyrillic script. The Liberals, as usual, still have reservations; that, however, does not mean that they possibly might not join the SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia], which accepts the government's proposal that the identity card should be written in the Macedonian language and the Cyrillic alphabet, and the name of the citizen in parentheses and in the language and alphabet of the national minorities. There are predictions that since we will have elections this fall the law will not even be supported at all, because of fear of a possible loss of support among some of the voters. [Box, p 3] Identity Cards as Cards The new identity cards will have the form of cards made from a stronger material without a protective foil. The first page will have the photograph of the bearer, together with the owner's first name and surname, and his birth certificate and registration number. "Republic of Macedonia" will be at the top, but without the state seal, which is also the alternative used in the new Macedonian passports. The data on the date and place of birth will be entered on the second page, and the bearer's fingerprint will be impressed in a special place. Otherwise, it is planned that the replacement of identity cards will be carried out within one year, but the Interior Ministry thinks that the entire operation can be completed in a shorter time, in view of the capabilities of the system, which makes it possible to issue 300,000 identity cards in a month.
