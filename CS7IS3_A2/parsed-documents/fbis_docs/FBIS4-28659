Saito told a press conference the government has not yet made a decision on whether it should immediately change its Official Development Assistance (ODA) policy toward China. He said Japan has conveyed its concern about the test and explained again the contents of its ODA guidelines hammered out in 1992, which state that recipient countries should promote disarmament. Japan will continue to urge China to stop conducting nuclear tests, he said. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa suggested in Beijing on Sunday that China's nuclear test could influence Tokyo's future loans to China.
