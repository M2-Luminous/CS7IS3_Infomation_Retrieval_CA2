FBIS4-8626 "dreeu073_h_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-073 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 HUNGARY Ethnic Hungarian on Slovak Government Ethnic Hungarian on Slovak Government 94P20597 94P20597 CSO [Editorial Report] A leading parliamentary representative of Egyutteles [Coexistence], the main political organization of Slovakia's Hungarian minority--which numbers 600,000 in a population of 5 million--said in a recent interview that he believes the minority's political position is now considerably stronger than it was under the recently ousted government of Vladimir Meciar, despite the absence of Hungarians in Slovakia's new government. In an interview published on 18 March in the Hungarian-language Bratislava daily UJ SZO, Istvan Harna, who represented Egyutteles at the negotiations on the formation of the cabinet, told an unidentified interviewer that the new government will be forced to take into account the views of the Hungarians because the Hungarians "now hold the balance in parliament." Without their vote, Harna said, the parliament "cannot pass any laws," and if the coalition parties fail to "keep their promises" to the Hungarian minority, its representatives can "hold back" their votes "at any time." As he sees it, the Hungarians are in a more advantageous position than if they were in the government, because "if we had even one minister, we would share governmental responsibility, and we would have to support the cabinet even if it did not satisfy our demands." At the same time, Harna expressed disappointment that the anti-Meciar coalition had not been more willing to accommodate the Hungarians. He dismissed as a political ploy the fact that at one point during the negotiations the anti-Meciar groups had offered him the post of finance minister, saying they had done so "only because they were forced to" when all the other parties refused "to accept the responsibility" for the ministry that is the "most trouble." No serious attempt was made to include the Hungarians in the government, Harna said, because the anti-Meciar Slovaks contended that "Meciar would, with his demagogic populist statements, use the Hungarians' participation to incite public opinion against the new government." While saying that there was "some truth" in such contentions, Harna declared that it still was "not principled" to leave the Hungarians out of the government, because if their vote is needed, then "the rules of democracy" dictate that they should be included. Nevertheless, Harna indicated that the Hungarians will be able to take advantage of the new political situation to get some significant concessions. Taking into account the "public mood and Slovakia's interests," he said, they agreed to support the government even if they could not join it, but in return they made eight demands. Evidently referring to Hungarian demands for more local government power--which Slovaks have criticized as an attempt to loosen Slovakia's hold on Hungarian-inhabited areas--Harna said that at first the anti-Meciar coalition called the demands "irredentist," but later the coalition "realized that they are not, and accepted them." Moreover, the Hungarians will apparently be given an increased role in education, which they consider a key area. According to Harna, the new government will establish a "separate Hungarian division" in the Education Ministry, and its leading officials will be chosen on the basis of the Hungarians' recommendations. While the Hungarians will not get any state secretary positions, Harna said, the government has agreed to "take into account" the Hungarians' opinion when appointing "leading officials" in any ministry that has a particular impact on the Hungarian minority.
