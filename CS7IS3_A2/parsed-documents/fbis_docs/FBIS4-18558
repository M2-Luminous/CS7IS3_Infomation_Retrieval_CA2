The 1995-2000 budget prepared by the Defence Council, chaired by President Francois Mitterrand, meant that some projects still in the research or development stage might be delayed, a defence official said. But programmes relating to the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, the Rafale fighter aircraft and the Leclerc tank would be maintained, officials said. Some projects however were to be delayed or see their credits staggered over time, notably the NH-90 transport helicopter and the M5 nuclear ballistic missile. The four-nations NH-90 helicopter, developed jointly with Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, is to be maintained though its cost will have to be cut by 20 to 30 percent, the officials said. In addition to a second nuclear-powered aircraft carrier planned for after 1998, the Horizon frigate programme, developed jointly with Britain and Italy, could go ahead as early as next year. The draft budget is to be approved by parliament early next year.
