Summary Under section 1886(d) of the Social Security Act (the Act), a system of payment for the operating costs of acute hospital inpatient stays under Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) based on prospectively-set rates was established effective with hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1983. Under this system, Medicare payment for hospital inpatient operating costs is made at a predetermined, specific rate for each hospital discharge. All discharges are classified according to a list of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). The regulations governing the hospital inpatient prospective payment system are located in 42 CFR part 412. On September 1, 1993, we published a final rule with comment period (58 FR 46270) to implement changes to the prospective payment system for hospital operating costs beginning with Federal fiscal year (FY) 1994. For cost reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1991, hospital inpatient operating costs were the only costs covered under the prospective payment system. Payment for capital-related costs had been made on a reasonable cost basis because, under sections 1886(a)(4) and (d)(1)(A) of the Act, those costs had been specifically excluded from the definition of inpatient operating costs. However, section 4006(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100&hyph;203) revised section 1886(g)(1) of the Act to require that, for hospitals paid under the prospective payment system for operating costs, capital-related costs would also be paid under a prospective payment system effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991. As required by section 1886(g) of the Act, we replaced the reasonable cost-based payment methodology with a prospective payment methodology for hospital inpatient capital-related costs. Under the new methodology, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, a predetermined payment amount per discharge is made for Medicare inpatient capital-related costs. (See subpart M of 42 CFR part 412, and the August 30, 1991, final rule (56 FR 43358) for a complete discussion of the prospective payment system for hospital inpatient capital-related costs.) B. Major Contents of This Proposed Rule In this proposed rule, we are setting forth proposed changes to the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems for both operating costs and capital-related costs. This proposed rule would be effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994. Following is a summary of the major changes that we are proposing to make: 1. Changes to the DRG Classification and Relative Weights As required by section 1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act, we must adjust the DRG classifications and relative weights at least annually. Our proposed changes for FY 1995 are set forth in section II of this preamble. 2. Changes to the Hospital Wage Index In section III of this preamble, we discuss revisions to the wage index and the annual update of the wage data. Specific issues addressed in this section include: •FY 1995 wage index update. •Changes in the reporting of hospital wage index data. •Revisions to the wage index based on hospital redesignations. •Impact of the revised hospital wage index. •Occupational mix adjustment. •Research on refinements to labor market areas. •State labor market options. 3. Other Changes to the Prospective Payment System for Inpatient Operating Costs In section IV of this preamble, we discuss several provisions of the regulations in 42 CFR parts 412, 413, 485, and 489 and set forth certain proposed changes concerning the following: •Definition of and payment for transfer cases. •Review of DRG assignments. •National average standardized amounts for FY 1995. •Outliers. •Rural referral centers. •Determination of number of beds in determining the indirect medical education adjustment. •Disproportionate share adjustment. •Changes affecting essential access community hospitals (EACHs) and rural primary care hospitals (RPCHs). •Clarification of payments to rural referral center/EACH hospitals. •Direct graduate medical education payment. •Other technical changes. 4. Changes and Clarifications to the Prospective Payment System for Capital-Related Costs In section V of this preamble, we discuss several provisions of the regulations in 42 CFR parts 412 and 413 and set forth certain proposed changes concerning the following: •Evaluation of provisions relating to obligated capital for hospitals subject to lengthy certificate-of-need (CON) process.
