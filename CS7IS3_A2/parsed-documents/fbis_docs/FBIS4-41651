He made this statement while answering questions from journalists at Athens airport before his departure to Russia. A really historic document has been signed, he said. It was under preparation for a very long time, almost two years. Europe is now the only continent that has lifted all discriminatory measures against Russia. Indeed Russia, of course, gets certain dividends from this. The states of Europe get a very rich Russian market, and they too, will not lose out by having signed this document. The president thanked the Greek leadership and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou for their involvement in the preparation of the agreement, and for creating most favorable conditions for the work of the Russian delegation.
