FBIS4-48439 "drafr097_e_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-097 Daily Report 18 May 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Ugandan Troops Deployed in Southeast; Koromah Men Arrested Ugandan Troops Deployed in Southeast; Koromah Men Arrested AB1805173594 Gbarnga Radio ELRL in English 1400 GMT 18 May 94 AB1805173594 Gbarnga Radio ELRL English BFN [Excerpts] Ugandan troops of the expanded ECOMOG [Economic Community of West Africa States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], of the multinational African peacekeeping force in Liberia, are today being deployed in the southeast of the country. The Ugandan peacekeepers are travelling by sea to Maryland County, where they will be received by county officials, chiefs, elders, and ordinary citizens, as well as UN officials including Ambassador Trevor Gordon-Somers. The deployment, which has been described by observers as long overdue, is in compliance with the Cotonou Peace Agreement, which mandates the disarmament, encampment, and demobilization of NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] soldiers under the auspices of the expanded ECOMOG. The deployment of the Ugandan contingent in the southeast follows several hours of talks during discussions between UN Envoy Trevor Gordon-Somers and former NPRG [National Patriotic Reconstruction Government] President Charles Gankay Taylor last evening. The meeting, held at the Executive Mansion in Gbarnga, is believed to have centered on removing the obstacles in the way of the peace process. The slow pace of the deployment, which is a prerequisite for the disarmament exercise of all fighting groups in the country, has been the main hurdle in carrying out the military aspects of the Cotonou Accord. (?Commercial) interests in the factional fighting within ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] has been dragging the peace process to the brink of collapse. Nigerian and Ghanaian [as heard] troops of the old ECOMOG have been selling arms to the opposing sides within ULIMO. Intelligence sources in ECOMOG revealed last week that the Guineans were selling arms to the Mandingo faction of ULIMO, while the Nigerian contingent is in the business of arms sales to the Krahn elements of ULIMO. [passage omitted] News just coming in from Monrovia says the forces loyal to the leader of the Mandingo faction, Mr. Alhaji Koromah, are being surrounded in Monrovia by security forces. Some have been arrested and are presently under detention at various headquarters in Monrovia, awaiting interrogation by the joint security. General Koromah [title as heard] is alleged to have imported mercenaries into the country under the guise of being businessmen in the city. According to reports from Monrovia, some of the mercenaries are now selling towels, clothes, [word indistinct], and other valuable items, while others are directly [word indistinct] with Mr. Koromah and with Sierra Leonean and Guinean ECOMOG soldiers.
