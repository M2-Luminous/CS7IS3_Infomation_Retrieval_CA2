"Give me a minute!" several eager voices were resounding through one of the meeting halls in the Great Hall of the People, the shrine of China's top legislature -- the National People's Congress (NPC). Joining in the "shouting contest" were several NPC delegates from Heilongjiang Province in northeast China attending a group discussion of the province delegation today. They were trying to catch the attention of Sun Weiben, the provincial party secretary who was presiding over the group discussion. Among other people sitting back in big arm-chairs around the hall, Chinese Premier Li Peng was smiling quietly at the scene. Sun spoke out at last, pointing to one delegate: "Please speak first." It was 11:45 [0345 GMT] in the morning. Sun had just suggested that Li Peng make a final speech at the group meeting before the time for lunch. To Sun's surprise, Fang Chunzi, a female deputy of the minority nationality of Korean, jumped to her feet and said: "Please give me a minute, I want to say just one thing." The presider had no choice but to agree to the request of the representative of women and minority nationalities, who is also a senior engineer working on a forest farm. She said: "Lumbermen work hard all year round and make great contributions to the country. But their wages are not stable, and their livelihood is difficult. I wonder whether the premier knows such problems. I hope that the government will solve them as soon as possible." Precisely a sixty-second speech. Before the presider could even utter a word, a woman owner of a chicken farm stood up at the other end of the hall, saying: "Give me a minute too!" Speaking with a strong local accent, Liang Fengying went on to say: "I am a representative of farmers. Though I don't till in fields, I want to speak on behalf of farmers who elected me as an NPC deputy." She used her own example to ask people who get rich first to help other people become prosperous. "Why should not the prosperous provinces in the country help other less developed regions? They should be able to do what I, a farmer, can do." Her simple, frank speech was applauded by everyone in the hall. But the speech lasted longer than one minute. It took three minutes and fifty seconds, precisely. Although the presider repeatedly announced that time was getting late since the premier would attend the afternoon full meeting of the NPC session, many deputies raised their hands high, saying loudly: "Give me a minute! Give me a minute!" In turn, an engineer, a manager of a state-owned enterprise and other persons stood up and took the floor, asking for more government support for state enterprises. A smiling Li Peng listened attentively to the speeches of the deputies throughout the meeting, jotting down something on a handy padbook from time to time. He told the deputies that every difficulty that the province faces is on the government's note and will be dealt with carefully. He called on the deputies to have confidence and make concerted efforts from the top to the bottom level, in order to bring youthful vigor to the province's out-dated industries. In still another breath, he answered the questions by the deputies one by one, saying that the State Council will specially study the problems faced by the province in the near future and help solve them. When all was said, persisting applauds echoed again in the big hall. The deputies expressed their thanks to the premier by clapping their hands. Li said with a smile: "I'd like to hear opinions from the grassroots deputies very much."
