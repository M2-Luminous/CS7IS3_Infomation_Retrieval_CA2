Tihomir Vinkovic reports: [Vinkovic] Following six hours of talks an agreement has been reached whereby both sides agree that the cease-fire will take effect at noon on 25 February. All future offensives or attacks are ruled out. All propaganda pitting one side against the other must come to an end. The lines of contact will remain as they are at the time that the cease-fire comes into effect. UNPROFOR will be positioned in sensitive areas to safeguard the implementation of the cease-fire. All heavy weaponry will be placed under UNPROFOR supervision or withdrawn from the lines of contact; mortars are to be moved 10 km away and and tanks and artillery 20 km away by noon on 7 March. On 25 February a joint commission under UNPROFOR auspices will be set up in Kiseljak. This commission will work to solve points of dispute. Following the signing of the agreement, General Ante Roso said: [Roso] "A new time requires a new dialogue. I believe that this sums it up. As is written in the text, the cease-fire by noon of 25 February [sentence as heard]. It is laid down in a relatively detailed way. Further on, there is the technical part. I hope it will be realistically possible to implement what was signed today. Everything requires a period of time. Every beginning is the beginning of an end. Hence, this is a beginning. I believe that enough is said in my definition of this signature: a new time, new dialogue." [Vinkovic] Rasim Delic said: [Delic] "All this depends on the two of us, actually on those units and formations that are under our command. I think that the points stipulated in the agreement and principles from the annex to the agreement are of a nature that will enable the implementation of all this. Of course, all this is to be implemented on the ground, and hard work remains to be done. I think that by this we are creating conditions for our politicians to reach an agreement which, I hope, they are going to do soon. This should be speeded up. "As regards soldiers, they are always ready to put into practice agreements aimed at the political resolution of the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has been topical for such a long time." [Vinkovic] The UN secretary general's special envoy Yasuhi Akashi, who attended the talks and witnessed the signing of the agreement in addition to UNPROFOR Generals Cot and Rose, called this moment an historical one.
