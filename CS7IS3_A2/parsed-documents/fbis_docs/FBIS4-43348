Instead of these talks, there should be an international conference on the Bosnian issue," two members of the Bosnian presidency said Wednesday [8 June] at a press conference in Brussels. Mirko Pejanovic, a Bosnian Serb, and Ivan Komsic, a Bosnian Croat, are both part of the Bosnian presidency and both took part in the peace talks in Geneva. "The key question of how much territory should be given to the parties involved has ensured that the peace consultations in Geneva always end up in an impasse," they said. "Instead of the talks in Geneva, there should be an international conference with the five major powers (namely Russia, the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany), the European Union, the United Nations, and the Conference of Islamic Countries," Pejanovic and Komsic said on behalf of the Bosnian presidency. Russia had already suggested organizing a similar conference, but the other partners were not interested for the time being. "The idea of a federation with cantons must form the basis of a complete peace plan for Bosnia," Pejanovic and Komsic said. In order to stress that this is feasible, they pointed to the Washington Agreement whereby the Bosnian Muslims and Croats would set up a federation on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This federation has since been formed, a president has been elected, and a government is being put together. "The international community must take care of the rest," Pejanovic and Komsic said: "The return of refugees, the setting-up of `miniprotectorates' around the most important cities along the lines of Mostar and Sarajevo, and the temporary control of the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina." Furthermore, the European Union should agree to the accession of Bosnia to the Union, according to Pejanovic and Komsic, especially with an eye on the economic reconstruction of the country, "which is currently a mess." In order to guarantee security, Bosnia must be able "to join NATO," they said. Pejanovic and Komsic are in Brussels to hold talks with the European Commission. They will also be received at the Belgium Foreign Ministry.
