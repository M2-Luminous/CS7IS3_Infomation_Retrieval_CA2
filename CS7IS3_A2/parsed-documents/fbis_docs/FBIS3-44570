Spokesman Wu Jianmin reiterated this position at a weekly press conference here this afternoon, when asked to comment on reports about worries some incumbent Hong Kong Government employees have about their status after 1997. "As stipulated by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Adminitrative Region, Hong Kong Government employees working in all departments before the establishment of the Special Administrative Region, shall retain their jobs, their seniority shall be preserved, and the standard for their salaries, subsidies, fringe benefits and service conditions shall not be lower than before," Wu noted. "Therefore, it is needless to have any worry in this connection," Wu said. On Sino-British talks on Hong Kong, Wu said that China has made it clear to the British side that if the British side sincerely hoped for the restoration of the talks, it should withdraw the partial political reform package from the Legislative Council. "The British side should have been more than clear about this position of the Chinese side. Therefore, one can say that the entire responsibility for the termination of the negotiations rests fully on the British side," he said. "The position of the Chinese side concerning the talks remains unchanged. The door to the talks stays open. But the key is the attitude of the British side. "Without withdrawing what has been submitted, it is not possible to have the talks resumed," Wu stressed.
