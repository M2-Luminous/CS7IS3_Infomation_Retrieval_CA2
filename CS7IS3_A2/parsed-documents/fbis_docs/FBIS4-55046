It is apparent from the report that the regulations on the protection of state property were violated in the years 1990-92. The minister said that, when he took up his post, he halted the transfer of all property until new mechanisms were approved for the sale of real estate and chattels and that all the functionaries responsible for violating the regulations had been discharged. At the same time, he suggested to the main Military Prosecutor's Office that it consider whether any crimes had been committed. It released a statement in which it said that the findings were not sufficient to justify suspicion of criminal activity. Last week, the government approved material on the sale of real estate with the proviso that state administration bodies be given the option of having it transferred to them free of charge. Other property will be sold at auction by real estate agencies or will be exchanged for apartments. Special materials, such as weapons and munition, will be sold to interested parties who hold a special license for trading in these goods.
