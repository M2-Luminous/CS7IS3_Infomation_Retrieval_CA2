FBIS4-2799 "drchi072_a_94005" FBIS-CHI-94-072 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General Regulations Issued To Respond to Dumping Allegations Regulations Issued To Respond to Dumping Allegations OW1204143594 Beijing XINHUA in English 1414 GMT 12 Apr 94 OW1204143594 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government today published regulations to speed up the official responses when other countries make allegations of dumping against Chinese exports. The move comes at a time when more and more Chinese export items are being put under anti-dumping investigation and having anti- dumping taxes imposed on them. A document signed by Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation (MOFTEC), says that when China's export commodities are accused abroad of dumping, China's chambers of commerce for imports and exports, or the association of enterprises with foreign investment, will be responsible for organizing the response to such allegations. If entrusted by the defending party, they can retain competent foreign lawyers, well-informed about China, to answer the suits in the courts. The new regulations, 24 articles long, are aimed at protecting the lawful rights of Chinese production and export-oriented enterprises, preserving the market for China's export commodities, and suitably answering cases brought in courts abroad accusing Chinese exports of dumping. The regulations, stipulating in detail the procedures and methods to answer such lawsuits, demand that the departments concerned conduct better market investigations, and adopt necessary means to avoid the occurrence of foreign anti-dumping cases. A MOFTEC official attributed the increase in anti-dumping suits against Chinese commodities to the retrenchment of trade protectionism in western countries and the discrimination against Chinese export commodities, and to the disorder in China's foreign trade in some areas or some enterprises. Thus, the new regulations ask the enterprises to answer suits actively. Otherwise, all or part of their rights to apply for export quotas and permits will be taken away. In addition, part or all of their rights to conduct foreign trade would be taken from them if circumstances of infringement are serious, and they may also be fined.
