Affiliates of the most important political organizations of the Russian Federation have begun to appear in the provinces like mushrooms after a heavy rain, and not two days had elapsed since the presentation of the regional branch of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] in Tatarstan, at which Sergey Shakhray was present, before Russia's Choice speedily made its presence known. True, Yegor Gaydar himself did not grace the gathering of future Kazan party members with his presence. His faction was represented by Valentin Mikhaylov. It is he and Aleksandr Shtanin, his recent Power of the People Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet parliamentary group colleague, who are the coordinators for the creation of the regional branch of the Russia's Choice party. It was expected that the most radical part of Kazan's democratic movement would unite under the aegis of this party. But few familiar faces were encountered. The elections to the organizing committee were prompt, therefore. The 25 participants in the meeting voted unanimously for the nominations of Georgiy Semenov, lecturer at the Kazan State University, and Yevgeniy Kozhevatov, Oleg Talanov, and Damir Galyautdinova, deputies of the city soviet. The last of the above-mentioned had run in December on the federal slate of Russia's Choice. It was he who became chairman of the Kazan branch of Gaydar's party. The draft program and rules were not discussed at the meeting: The contents of the basic party documents have merely been noted as yet. Revisions will not, most likely, be made to the clauses that deal with the principal goals of Russia's Choice. These are, in particular, "political support for and protection of the rights, liberties, and safety of the citizens and the formation of an effective market economy, civil society, and democratic state based on the rule of law." There are already, apparently, branches of the new party in all districts of Kazan and in Bugulm, Almetyevsk, Bavly, and Arsk. Today their representatives are to meet for a conference to form a regional organization of Russia's Choice. Yesterday's meeting delegated the emissaries to this party undertaking. The self- nominees began their account of their career with the words "I was never a member of the CPSU," which evoked the audience's great approval. It is not hard, therefore, to anticipate who will be a principal opponent of the Tatar branch of Russia's Choice also.
