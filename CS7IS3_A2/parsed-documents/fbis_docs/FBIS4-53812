"We have in mind the establishment of a Northeast Asia security dialogue which will go in tandem with the ASEAN Regional Forum," South Korea's Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs Yi Chang-chun told reporters. "Our idea, however, is in the formative stage. We have yet to develop it," he added. Mr Yi made the remarks before South Korea's paper on security cooperation was to be discussed yesterday afternoon by officials convened at the special preparatory meeting for the ASEAN Regional Forum being held in July. Citing historical realities, difference in political systems and economic development, the paper advocated a "gradual approach" to multilateral security cooperation in Northeast Asia. The paper stressed the need for respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-aggression and restraint. It also emphasized the need to remove mutual distrust and build mutual confidence. The paper argued for regional cooperation to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. "While making continued efforts to resolve North Korea's nuclear issue within the existing framework and on the basis of international consensus, cooperation among the countries in the region is needed to strengthen the global regimes for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction," the paper said. "Regional cooperation is also needed in other fields of arms control, including the regulation of missile technology," the paper added. But preventive diplomacy, particularly conflict prevention, is crucial to security cooperation in Northeast Asia, it went on. For the benefit of "enhancing transparency," the South Korean paper called for exchange and discussion of defense white papers, provision of data to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, regular meetings of defense officials, and exchange visits of military personnel and of naval vessels. The paper also suggested cooperation in non-combat activities, joint training programs and participation in UN peacekeeping operations.
