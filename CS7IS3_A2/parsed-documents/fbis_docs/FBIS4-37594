Yemeni Scholar Fatwa Berated 5. Study Draws Attention to Importance of Chinese Muslims 6. Official Sees Japan as Fertile Soil for Islam DEVELOPING CURRICULA TO AVOID PREACHERS' DECLINING STANDARDS In his 300-word column "In Truth I Speak" on page 1 Chief Editor Samir Rajab says it is "wrong to assume that the Awqaf Ministry is responsible for the declining standards of preachers and imams or for the narrow-mindedness of some of them, who see nothing but torture, vengeance, and the bald-headed serpent from the grave in our forgiving religion." He explains that these preachers graduate from al-Azhar and that all the ministry does is to distribute them throughout its mosques all over the country after training them. He says he does not find it surprising that "some of these preachers are sometimes accused of being behind the waves of extremism and violence because of the issues and topics they raise in their sermons, which are often used as a source of income." To handle the problem, Rajab suggests to al-Azhar that it develop curricula at its institutes, colleges, and schools. He stresses that other "educational, cultural, and sports establishments" must back the security apparatus positively and effectively. PLAN TO FIGHT EXTREMIST THOUGHT A 300-word report by Muhammad al-Abnudi on page 2 states that "The Awqaf Ministry has prepared a new plan to refute extremists' allegations and fragile arguments by preparing counter-arguments in response to the books from which they draw their information." According to the report, a working group of 18 specialized scholars in the various areas of thought will list the books the extremists read and provide counter-arguments for every point argued in these "suspicious books" that distort their thinking. According to the plan, these specialists will teach the arguments to four groups totalling 120 imams working for Awqaf. The working group will start the search for these books on 15 June and lessons will begin next week. The subjects to be studied, explained, and taught include the application of Islamic shari'ah, repudiation, apostasy, preaching good deeds and prohibiting evil, rulings on the permissibility of action, and the treatment of non-Muslims in a Muslim community. U.S. COMPANIES' CONDUCT SEEN AS OFFENSE AGAINST MUSLIMS A 300-word report by Ashraf Abu-al-Hawl on page 21 claims that the famous McDonald hamburger restaurants and Coca Cola are committing a grave offense against Muslims by printing the Saudi Arabian flag, with its characteristic Islamic statement "there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger," on bags and soft drinks cans that are "dumped in wastebaskets or trampled underfoot" after their contents have been consumed. YEMENI SCHOLAR FATWA BERATED In the 500-word "In All Frankness" column on page 6 Basyuni al-Halawani maintains that "Yemeni scholars have indulged in a cheap game with some of them trying to plunge Islam into the war of grudges raging on the soil of sad Yemen," giving the enemies of Islam the chance to distort its image. He notes that Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Daylami, dean of the al-Iman College at Sanaa University and a member of the supreme committee of the "northern" Yemeni Reform Grouping, has made an Islamic ruling on the "permissibility of killing children, women, and old people, burning and destroying public utilities, and seizing the properties of the southerners." "If he really made that ruling, in the form published by some Arab mass media, then al-Daylami is not fit even to be a mu'adhdhin at a mosque, let alone a dean of al-Iman, faith, and college," al-Halawani contends. He states that Islam has a clear-cut stance on "wars of grudges motivated by satanic whims" and that there is no need to plunge the name of Islam into such affairs. He regrets that "most Islamic states are afflicted with a type of scholar who always tries to employ Islam to serve the greed and ambition of some Arab rulers." Stating that scholars' primary duty is to work to close ranks and eliminate grudges, he maintains that "those who volunteer to justify whimsical and criminal conduct that is rejected by Islamic shari'ah are accomplices to evil-doing and aggression and will burn in hell." STUDY DRAWS ATTENTION TO IMPORTANCE OF CHINESE MUSLIMS Dr. 'Abd-al-Halim 'Uways writes in a 2,000-word article on page 6 about "Muslims in China: A big Minority Under Communist Control." Citing conflicting statistics on the number of Muslims in China, he maintains that they are "no fewer than 80 million." He draws Muslims' attention to "enormous human resources" that deserve attention and care, stating that it is in the higher interest of Islam to be in the middle of that "ocean" of Muslims in a country that "might become the first or second power in the world." Describing Muslims' social and cultural conditions in China as wretched, he goes on to identify a "pressing need to teach Muslims in China and the countries that were in the communist grip the basic principles that link them with the sound creed and pillars of Islam." For this he suggests measures recommended by a study by Dr. Ahmad Anis, former vice president of the World Islamic Islamabad University. The recommendations include providing imams and Muslims in China with the necessary religious education, helping Chinese and other Muslims learn Arabic as a means of communication with the Islamic world, helping Chinese Muslims to build better Islamic academic establishments all over the country, organizing publications, seminars, and cultural, academic, and intellectual conferences, helping Chinese Muslims understand, preserve, and convey their culture and traditions, and helping them to become good, moral citizens. OFFICIAL SEES JAPAN AS FERTILE SOIL FOR ISLAM A 600-word report by Tariq 'Abdallah on page 20 cites Muhammad 'Ashur Hamzah, manager of the Kubah Islamic Center in Tokyo, stating that "Japan is fertile soil for Islam if it is presented with the right image." Hamzah calls on Islamic states and institutions to intensify efforts to promote Islam in Japan by building mosques and Islamic centers and sending trained preachers who have been taught Japanese.
