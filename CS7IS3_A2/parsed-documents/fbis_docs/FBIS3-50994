He had already pictured to himself that he and his family would travel to Washington, where he would be in charge of Chile's embassy in the United States. He had even practically finished packing his suitcases. But fate and [President-elect] Eduardo Frei decided otherwise. He will be the successor to [Finance Minister Alejandro] Foxley, as well as to [Copper Corporation Executive President Designate Juan] Villarzu. Eduardo Aninat, 45, is a Catholic University graduate in economics. He has a PhD in economics from Harvard University. He is well known in Chilean circles for his negotiating skills. President Aylwin entrusted him with the task of negotiating Chile's external debt in 1990. He is married to Teresita Sahli, and has six children. He has always been linked to the private sector and to economic affairs through his firm of management consultants -- Aninat, Mendez, and Merino -- which will have to lie dormant for several years. At the president-elect's personal request he headed, until recently, a special commission, also including Fernando Leniz and Ramon Aboitiz, which was in charge of several aspects pertaining to the handing over of power. Aninat explains that the reason behind this is that the new administration wants to commence its period of office by working, and to that effect a seminar is to be held for the first time on the coming 13 March. It will be addressed especially to leading figures from foreign companies, who will have the chance to listen to presentations made by the new government's team. This tall man, with a clear gaze and prematurely gray beard, speaks with great deliberation and in a reassuring tone. He keeps toying with a pencil while he speaks. Nothing seems to disturb him or, least of all, annoy him. He says that he does not have any obsessions, and has but one pet dislike: "I do not like people who bore you to tears by talking too much." Warm and unaffected, he is now getting ready to leave his office, located in one of the few houses left near El Bosque Street, which is at present lined with high-rise buildings. As of March he will occupy the best offices of the 12th floor at 120 Teatinos Street, right in downtown Santiago and only a step from La Moneda -- precisely he who enjoys nature and ecology so much. He says that when he leaves the Finance Ministry he will return to Valdivia [where he has his ranch]. [passage omitted] It seems that you are in the same situation Minister Foxley was in. When he was installed as finance minister he commented that it had fallen upon him to dance with the plain lady of the cabinet. Do you hold the same views now? [Aninat] No... I believe I am going to dance with one of the gorgeous ladies, but the great challenge is to keep her beautiful and prevent others from handling her roughly. [Garcia] Are you concerned about this? [Aninat] I have one very clear thing in mind... I would rather lose my post as finance minister than put the stability that cost us so dear in jeopardy, not even for a single minute. [passage omitted] [Garcia] You were associate coordinator for foreign policy of Frei's campaign management team... You accompanied him to his meetings with [Mexican President Carlos] Salinas de Gortari, prior to the signing of NAFTA. You have been adviser to [Argentine Economy Minister] Domingo Cavallo. After having been involved in foreign affairs for such a long time, were you disappointed with the fact that you were left without the embassy in Washington? [Aninat] That was a very interesting challenge which we came to believe would become a reality. My wife Teresita and I were ready to take that challenge, and were little by little planning our lives to accommodate this new reality. We were to have left in April. And yet by an odd quirk, and by virtue of the post I am going to hold, I am not going to totally abandon this, because undoubtedly the free trade agreement with the United States must be handled by the Finance Ministry. Nevertheless, now you will have me as minister and not as ambassador. [Garcia] NAFTA became at one time Foxely's great banner. Will you try to follow in Foxley's footsteps with regard to that issue? [Aninat] No, I think that there are many issues, and the agenda ought to be more diversified, more flexible, more in keeping with modern times! -- he says, rapping with his index finger on the blue book on the table -- Frei's economic program. There will be other issues; not the ones Foxley had to deal with, but it goes without saying that NAFTA will be high on the list of priorities, even though it will be one among many. [Garcia] And what are you going to do with all the work you have done, all the folders you prepared to take over as ambassador? [Aninat] I am going to give them to my dear friend and fellow party member, [Foreign] Minister [-designate] Carlos Figueroa Serrano, next week. [passage omitted] [Garcia] It has been said that there is a marked resemblance between you and Foxley, and that because of this one should expect "more of the same thing." Is that correct? [Aninat] I would venture to say that we will now take strides while ensuring continuity, but there will also be a greater variety and complexity of issues. [Garcia] Do you uphold your criticism of the economic team, namely that it lacked boldness in moving forward more quickly? [Aninat] I do. I think that after a difficult first year, 1990, the period 1991-93 was characterized by some favorable objective conditions that would have enabled some areas to be streamlined more speedily. [Garcia] Such as? [Aninat] The modernization of the whole apparatus of government itself and an earlier incursion into capital markets, even though a good bill has been submitted to Congress. [Garcia] The same one that has been sitting there for a year, and has not yet been passed? [Aninat] Yes, but one must bear in mind that the executive branch is not entirely to blame for that. [Garcia] Chile has been rated internationally as Plus Triple B concerning investment risks. Many people wonder what the use of this classification is, if there are not a greater number of companies that can invest abroad, if the AFP's [Pension Fund Managing Companies] are limited, if banks are unable to invest abroad... if there are also so many restrictions to bringing in and remitting capital abroad. [Aninat] That area, which is quite complex, is one of my favorite subjects, because what Foxley and I tried to do with the famous Eurobonds was to fully place Chile's name on voluntary financial markets. [Garcia] And that has been accomplished. [Aninat] But it was properly accomplished, thanks to that first signal at that time. We have therefore indeed derived benefits from something that you omitted -- the perception, the classification of risk country has not only improved with regard to how foreigners assess us, but also as to how Chilean businessmen themselves and local agents view our country. I deem that the domestic investment rate would not have been as high as it currently is if we had not managed to attain that favorable reinsertion abroad. [Garcia] But we continue to talk at the level of perception. We have a country of a quality that very few in Latin America can dream about. Can we take better advantage of this situation? [Aninat] Progress must be made. I would like to coordinate my work with other members of the cabinet, and especially with the Central Bank, to continue to make progress on what you are talking about. We need a greater presence abroad for the Chilean AFP [Pension Fund Administration Boards], and the gradual participation of first class (he emphasized this) Chilean banks abroad. I feel the same way about the insurance companies and the investment funds. In other words, continue to internationalize our financial market further to integrate it with the rest of the world. This does not mean taking on anything and in any order. [Garcia] Where is the limit? [Aninat] The idea is not to be liberal just for the sake of being liberal; things should be done scientifically. And sometimes the private sector, or part of it, either because it's the fashion or the passion, tend to jump in with both feet without evaluating all of the risks. [Garcia] How can you pretend to be moving faster on the internationalization of the Chilean economy if you said that the Chilean Central Bank "is excellent but conservative?" [Aninat] It seems that all the central banks around the world are conservative, and in this sense they are an interesting counterbalance for many pressures. But I am lucky, excuse me for speaking in the first person, to know the five current bank members very well. Therefore, I believe the issue of coordination and communication with the Central Bank will go well... At least that is my intention. [Garcia] You said you want to work to motivate all Chileans. If when you take over the ministry there are 4 million poor people, how many fewer will there be six years from now? [Aninat] I would not dare to establish a goal in figures now, because I am just now -- as some people say -- reading the specific tasks ahead. What is clear is that Chile has the moral, ethical, political, and social obligation to drastically reduce the number of Chileans affected by poverty. And in particular, it has the obligation to improve the situation of the 1.2 million people who live in extreme poverty. [Garcia] Will an important part of the resources be appropriated to them? [Aninat] An important part of the administration will be dedicated to them. And this goes beyond resources. It means evaluation, costs, benefits, and the rational use and greater sophistication of the many social programs. [Garcia] What does that mean? Is that a criticism of the effectiveness of social spending over the last four years? [Aninat] It is not a criticism. But if on the one hand one studies what has been done in the different types of programs in health, housing, social security, and on the other studies the requirements of the new times, it can be seen that some of these programs were created more than two decades ago. I believe the time has come to review whether the type of development, administration, and management involved in social spending is appropriate for 1994. [Garcia] But does that mean the same amount of resources, the same amount of taxes? [Aninat] There is a legislative mandate that must be respected. The tax debate is already over, and therefore the key issue here is growth. We must have growth in order to continue to improve equity and increase social spending. This is essential. [Garcia] Are you afraid of the threat posed by the international recession which is still hanging over our country? [Aninat] I am not afraid of it, but rather concerned about it. I believe we should put it clearly. With Germany registering a negative growth rate this year, and France and Italy a zero growth rate, and in the Group of Seven only the United States beginning to recuperate, we must necessarily behave with extreme cautiousness. [Garcia] What does that mean? [Aninat] It means that the level of spending in our economy should be entirely consistent with its level of income and with its potential productivity. [Garcia] Based on that, would you support reducing the current level of spending? The 1994 budget provides for expenditures surpassing the growth rate of the economy... [Aninat] I cannot yet draw such a specific conclusion, but I would say that as far as making income consistent with spending is concerned, what we have begun to do is to examine the final figures of the economy in the last quarter of 1993, to see whether there is actual consistency or whether supplementary measures must be enforced. [Garcia] What is your perception of what might occur in the world economy in 1994? [Aninat] I believe the world economy will very slowly begin to recuperate. It will be a slow, partial, and unequal recuperation, with several countries still remaining stagnant. [Garcia] Could 1994 be even more complex for Chile? [Aninat] It might eventually turn out to be more complex. [Garcia] The balance of trade is expected to register a deficit that will be considerably higher than the one registered this year, which will be at approximately $900 million. [Aninat] Our current account deficit remains within limits that we can manage easily. Therefore, what we and the Central Bank should do is carefully evaluate, as a whole, the evolution of the terms of exchange, the balance of trade performance, and the current account deficit. [Garcia] You have said that you do not yet want to set any targets. Do you believe Chile can expect a one-digit inflation rate for 1997, as Villarzu stated? [Aninat] As I have already told you, I cannot make categorical, specific statements now. But what I can promise all Chileans is that the target of continuing to gradually reduce inflation will remain a priority for the Finance Ministry. [passage omitted] [Garcia] Your slogan has been "not hasty, but in-depth privatization." What would be your first suggestion for privatization? [Aninat] I would like to carefully study the list of enterprises that are currently run by Corfo [Production Development Corporation], and which are of various types. There are enterprises in the areas of shipping, transport, water supply, and sewage, there are agriculture undertakings, etc. [Garcia] What would you suggest be done with them? [Aninat] As I am saying, I believe it is high time that the list be very carefully studied in order to establish targets and priorities on a careful timetable, so as to make progress in a determined manner toward the private sector in those areas. [passage omitted] [Garcia] What are your plans for Codelco [Copper Corporation]? [Aninat] I believe we need a sophisticated, comprehensive view of large-scale mining. First, because Chile has a comparative and also absolute advantage in the area and, therefore, cannot mortgage this sector. Consequently, from the viewpoint of the country, it is necessary to continue promoting investment in the mining sector. [Garcia] The point is how to do it, with a privately-owned or state-run Codelco? [Aninat] We have a state management problem in the sector. We have therefore thought about creating a holding with branches managed by independent corporations run by standard regulations. What is a necessary step. Creating self-supporting branches with responsible management. [passage omitted] [Garcia] Did you participate in the design of the economic program? [Aninat] I did in various parts, especially and very deeply in the foreign policy chapter. [Garcia] Don't you think your own perceptions are bolder than those of the program in terms of liberalization and privatization? [Aninat] I would say perceptions are the same, with some differences in rate or speed.
