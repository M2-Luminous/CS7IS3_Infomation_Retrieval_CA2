Within days of Pakistani prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto's vile charge at the Geneva meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission that New Delhi was violating Kashmiri human rights, the U.S. State Department has taken Pakistan to task for its failure to protect the rights of non-Muslims who have been subjected to frequent extrajudicial killings, disappearance, and arbitrary arrests. The report has said that religious zealots continue to discriminate against and persecute non-Muslims basing their activities and part on discriminating legislation against religious minorities. [sentence as heard] Pakistani leaders have abused the international fora not only to internationalize the Kashmir issue, but also sought to publicize lies and launched a hysterical tirade against India. Both the union finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, have done well to expose the real face of Islamabad at Geneva. The State Department report is, by and large, in conformity with similar reports of human rights violations catalogued by the Amnesty International, the Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union. Members of Pakistan's Hindu, Christian, Ahmediyas, Sikh, Bahai, and other minority communities were banned from contesting general seats in the elections in 1985 and were restricted to voting in a system of separate electorate for minorities. Ahmediyas have also suffered widespread discrimination, suppression, and violence since they were declared non-Muslims in 1974. The U.S. State Department report has referred to extrajudicial killings, often in the form of staged police encounters, resulting in the death of suspects as also death resulting from physical abuse of prisoners and detainees by police. It says there continues to be persuasive evidence of misuse of police powers. Corruption, including extortion, is rampant. Police and jailers often use force to coerce confession and to compel detainees and prisoners to discriminate others. Although police in Pakistan are required by law to obtain a warrant before entering a private home, this legal requirement is complied more in breach than in compliance and Pakistan is using the law of blasphemy against minority groups such as the Christians. This law is a threat to freedom of expression and belief and it continues to allow exploitation and intimidation in the name of religion. Another discriminatory law against minorities pertains to separate electorates. It not only violates the international convention on civil and political rights but also the joint electorates concept under the 1973 constitution. The most recent encroachment on religious freedom is a requirement that religion be listed on the national identity cards. Such a practice amounts to religious apartheid. Even though Pakistan has acceded to the universal declaration of human rights, its laws violate article 25 and 18 of this declaration. Pakistan has moved away from its founding principle of religious freedom. Laws such as the convention law clearly violate basic principles of international human rights. Pakistan is also a signatory to basic human rights conventions. But its laws stand in direct contradiction to the principles found in these treaties. In a new 74 page report, the Amnesty International said last December that torture, including rape, in the custody of police, paramilitary, and armed forces is endemic in Pakistan. The report further said that members of these forces have been allowed to torture and kill with impunity. Victims and their families feel great difficulties and danger, if they try to seek redress.
