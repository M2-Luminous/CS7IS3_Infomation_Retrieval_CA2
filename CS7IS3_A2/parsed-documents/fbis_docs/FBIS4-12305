These proposals are being put forward to both Pakistan and India formally and informally. Although the exact nature of the proposals has not come up at the official level, it has been guessed from newspaper reports that their foremost aim is to do away with nuclear arms proliferation in South Asia. As Pakistan has made it clear that the nuclear program in the subcontinent is linked to the Kashmir issue, the United States has put forward some proposals to resolve the Kashmir dispute. According to the latest report, the United States has proposed to Pakistan that the Kashmir dispute be put on hold for some time. Meanwhile, a conference is to be held and attended by Pakistan, India, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China to discuss all the aspects of security in South Asia. The conference will propose a strategy that guarantees and becomes a source for stability for the South Asian subcontinent. The United States will expect from any such conference some strategy to prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms in the region. If Pakistan has refused to accept this proposal, there are solid reasons behind it. First of all, it is not clear what the intention of putting the Kashmir issue in cold storage is and what the demands after the strategy is adopted would be. Will it mean that Pakistan should stop raising its voice against Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir? Likewise, will it mean that Pakistan should not raise the Kashmir issue at international fora? In other words, will it mean that Pakistan should stop its moral, diplomatic, and political support to the Kashmiris? It is obvious that this will be impossible and unthinkable to Pakistan. The American proposal also does not make it clear when the proposed conference will be held and the outcome of the deliberations emerge, and whether that outcome will be acceptable to Pakistan? Another strong objection to the proposal is that its basic aim is not to resolve the Kashmir issue, but to put forward a strategy that prevents the proliferation of nuclear arms and missiles in South Asia. In Pakistan's view, giving preference to this issue has the similar connotation of dangling a carrot before the horse. The Kashmir issue is the root cause for all the problems and hardship in the South Asian subcontinent. As long as efforts are not taken to resolve the issue in accordance with the UN resolutions, no other problem can be resolved. If the Pakistan Government adopts a stance that the above U.S. proposal is impractical and unacceptable in the present context, it is fully understandable. We hope that the Pakistan Government will not bow to any kind of external pressure and will not take up as worthy of consideration proposals such as putting the Kashmir dispute on hold and initiating discussions on the Kashmir issue. Despite all the political differences between the opposition and the government, the entire nation and political circles are unanimous and united on Kashmir and on Pakistan's nuclear program. The government should never be cowed by any external pressure and should remain as firm as a rock on its principled stand. The entire nation is behind the government on this question and it need not have any anxiety over it, but it should make the country's policy clear to the external forces with more vigor and clarity.
