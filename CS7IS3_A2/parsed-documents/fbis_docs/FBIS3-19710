In fact, the American press agency KNIGHT-RIDDLER FINANCIAL has asked Italians -- via the CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research] -- to express their opinion. Now then, 20 percent of the interviewees did not even believe that it would be possible to form a new government without holding new elections. A more substantial proportion (36 percent of the interviewees) believed that it would be necessary to wait for at least three months to know the name of the new tenant at Palazzo Chigi [government seat]. The majority of the voters' sample (somewhat over 50 percent) is predicting that an understanding will have to be reached among forces belonging to more than one coalition in order to give birth to the Second Republic's new government. Today, the simple truth is that none of the three alignments expects to win a majority of the seats in parliament. "Reserved" surveys show that the progressives are in the ascendant, that the center is doing better than expected, that, conversely, Forza Italia's momentum is diminishing within the right-wing coalition, and that, in the north, [League Secretary Umberto] Bossi's war on [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi will lead to considerable upheavals in the polling booths. A general settlement is being predicted: The Right and the Left will be almost even, with the center holding the balance. This is why the proposal to form an "institutional" government is gaining momentum as the electoral campaign develops. This would be a transitional, politically neutral government, which would only be requested to complete the electoral reform by introducing a majority system, and then step down. The "institutional" nature of the Palazzo Chigi team has already been referred to by Spadolini [Italian Republican Party (PRI) Senate speaker], and [Mino] Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI], and later by [Achille] Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] and Berlusconi. The last two, however, subsequently qualified their statements. The PDS secretary explained that he was envisaging, if need be, a "caretaker" government, but he rejected -- with no less than four "no's" -- the possibility that men from Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters] might join the same government as Berlusconi's representatives. Forza Italy retorted by utterly rejecting what it called "palace agreements or makeshift arrangements which smack of historical compromise -- a solution favored by the communist or paracommunist coalition...." A nondescript government, deprived of any particular color, is therefore a simultaneously envisaged and rejected prospect. However, a weighty alternative prospect cannot be ruled out, namely, that of a government backed by a genuine political majority. This is a convincing hypothesis, which is being increasingly mentioned in the various leaders' statements and speeches. The center, occupying the middle camp, is particularly open to the prospect of alliances. It is looking about to make its choice. A temporary agreement with Martinazzoli would not be unwelcome to Occhetto, although even yesterday the PDS secretary realized how difficult it was to steer the progressive ship: As soon as [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema spoke again of [Prime Minister] Ciampi, [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti, [Rete leader] Orlando, and the Greens once again confirmed their opposition. An agreement with the center would enable the PDS leader to offset the weight of his alignment's extreme wings, and begin to implement his strategy, namely, setting up a left-center axis. Of course, such things are not mentioned in the course of an electoral campaign and, as a matter of fact, Occhetto is not mentioning them. However, two days ago he explained that, in any case, his party will be a "central" force within the next government. Was he thinking in terms of a government including center-left and center-right? This is, in fact, the prospect that the pole of freedoms fears most. Berlusconi is aware that, all things equal, the center would prefer Occhetto to him. He knows that his only chance of conquering Palazzo Chigi lies in obtaining an absolute majority in parliament or approaching such a majority close enough to "involve" single elected representatives of the PPI [Italian Popular Party] and Segni's Pact for Italy in supporting the government. Above all, he knows that only an overwhelming majority, bordering on 50 percent of the vote, would enable him to clip the wings of his loathed ally, Bossi. However, it is unlikely that any of this will happen. Bossi is an action man, is imaginative, and is convinced of one thing at least: The alliance with Forza Italy could be fatal for the League. The prospect of freeing the bandwagon [League nickname] from Berlusconi's grip is probably becoming increasingly attractive to Bossi with every passing day. Therefore, it is not inappropriate to put forward a third hypothesis: a government formed around a platform, backed by Occhetto's -- and Bossi's -- votes: a basic platform, including the introduction of federalist elements, the completion of the electoral reform, and the beginning of tax reform; a government which the League might well be prepared to back, particularly if led by a personality from the north...
