To this end, the economic staff of President Kim has been engrossed in pushing for financial reform. The obsolescence of the finance sector had long been cited as a fundamental reason for manipulation of the economy by the rich and the powerful for their own monopolistic ends instead of it being nourished to provide benefits to all sectors of society. After thirty years of such manipulation, the income gap has widened to a point were it could spark social conflict, which could throw further economic development into a dilemma. Against this backdrop, the implementation of the real name financial transaction system had given fresh hope to all. The real-name system was pushed decisively ahead in last August last [as published] by an emergency presidential decree as the core part of the administration's economic reforms. The real-name financial system was to eradicate all kinds of underground economic malpractices including speculative transactions and black market deals. The second stage of interest rate liberalization was another achievement of the new administration. The second phase called for the liberalization of interest rates on all loans excluding government policy loans. The deregulation of lending rates was aimed at bringing financial market mechanisms back to normal in a bid to correct the distorted flow of funds. The prolonged control of interest rates had functioned as a nucleus giving birth to mammoth underground curb markets. Despite the drastic financial reforms, they have failed to bring about hopeful surge in investment activities and equitable prosperity. The recent economic trend rather signifies the sufferings borne by the general public. During the first two months of this year consumer prices rose by 2.4 percent threatening already to surpass the target of 3 percent stipulated in the government's New Economy plan. Last year, the annual inflation rate was recorded at 5.8 percent, reaching far beyond the target level for the year. On the contrary, the rich extravagantly spent on imported goods with new money. Equipped with abundant liquidity, the rich play in the casino-like stock market. As a result the unprivileged still stand deprived of hope. More gloomy the benefits of increased exports which are made by the appreciation of the Japanese yen are monopolized by big businesses. [sentence as published] The lopsided business boom could tear the economy into two extremes, i.e., excessive boom for big businesses and serious suffering for small businesses. The fundamental reason for the negative trend lies in that the financial reforms were pushed largely in the context of political show off. The primary purpose of the real-name system was to bring the underground markets out into the open, thus to lawfully divert unlawful funds into industrial purposes. Nevertheless, the government was just busy enough to trap illegal funds under their control utilizing tax probes. Such a political and bureaucratic approach immediately produced an uneasy economic environment discouraging business activities. The depression of business activities was amplified by the significant increase in the collapse of small business firms. More than 40 percent of their funds had been secured from the curb markets. Upon implementation of the real name system, the curb markets were virtually frozen causing small business firms to suffer financial difficulties. Although the government instantly came up with measures to offer financial support, the effects bore little results. What was important to the government was the fact itself that the real-name system was implemented rather than the content on how the new system would affect the economy. Actually, the real-name system implemented by the government did little but provide legitimacy to illegal financial transactions by the use of borrowed names. Out of a total of 33 trillion won in financial assets estimated to have been traded under non-real names, only six trillion were changed into real names, which implies some 27 trillion won of assets still are hidden under borrowed names disguised as real. The government plan for the second phase of liberalization of interest rates was not effective either in terms of invigorating financial market functions and correcting underground financial transactions. The government did not allow free deposit rates under the second phase. After implementation of the real-name system, the liberalization that had been needed desperately was the decontrol of deposit rates. Affected by the real-name system, the underground funds were frozen and the velocity of money has significantly fallen. Meanwhile, the government has continuously supplied new money in a measure to rescue business firms from their financial difficulties. Theses two factors combined to put the economy into a trap of liquidity. Under this situation, the need for decontrol of deposit rates was absolute in order to have financial institutions absorb the excess liquidity and channel the funds into productive investment. Most defective of the government's financial reforms, the independence of the central bank was put off for good. The revision of the law for an independent central bank was on the list of major election pledges made by President Kim. The independence of the central bank carries crucial importance as it halts the vicious political business cycle. It is a general consensus among economists that only an independent central bank can pursue a stable monetary policy that may be politically unpopular yet in public interests. The current uneasy economic trend may be termed as another vicious business cycle escalated by political pressure in the absence of the independence of the central bank. Immediately after taking office the administration unveiled a 100-day economic boosting measures in a bid to restore vitality to the stagnant economy. The 100-day plan was not adequate at all as it did not take into account the structural dilemmas faced by the economy. After the collapse of the large bubble of speculation, the economy had been experiencing structural stagflation. Thus the prime economic task was to maintain a stabilization policy and then to reform the structure. Many economists pointed out that should an expansionary policy be adopted the stagflation would spread rapidly to every sector of the economy. The 100-day stimulus plan was considered by economists as a political scheme to turn the economic trend into a mood of celebration. The 100-day plan called for massive expansion of money supply, pushing business firms to initiate new investment ventures. Concurrently the plan called for sharing the pain asking workers to abide by low wage increases and business firms to freeze prices of goods to control inflation. During the 100-day plan some six trillion won in new money was poured into the economy. The new printing of money did not stop here. In the wake of implementation of the real-name system, the government initiated another round of injeting new money to soothe adverse impacts. With this, some four trillion won was printed. Meanwhile the liberalization of interest rates brought about a third phase of money expansion as a measure to reduce a possible hike in market interest rates. Some two trillion won was again released on this account. As feared in the beginning, the money expansion set inflation on fire which is now pushing the economy into a state of disorder. To make matters worse, the government has successively yielded to foreign pressure to open domestic financial markets. Last year some five trillion won in foreign funds flowed into local securities markets as hot money to blow a speculation wind. Encouraged by the inflow of foreign funds the stock market index rose to nearly 1,000 points which is the highest since 1989. The massive inflow of foreign capital raises public concern that it paralyzes economic stabilization by making monetary policy impotent in controlling money supply. This year, another 10 trillion won in foreign funds is yet to come. Overall, the defective financial reforms are producing an economic quagmire. Thus corrective measures are needed to remedy the limping real-name system, such as early implementation of the global income tax system. Without a global tax system, the real-name system functions little because the system has no tool to penalize illegal transactions. Once the global system is installed, the lenders of names will have to pay taxes. Thus, the irregular transactions under assumed names would disappear. From the legal point of view, a legislative measure is necessary to outlaw financial transactions under assumed names. The decontrol of deposit rates remains another task of the government. The controlled low deposit rates continuously discourage national savings making scare funds available for industrial purposes. From this, the problem of printing new money and the rise in underground curb markets has naturally stemmed. The revision of the central bank law must be hurried in order to have the financial reforms function the right way. To root out irregularities, the severance of the unhealthy tie between politics and economics is a prerequisite. It is a tie that has subordinated the central bank to the Ministry of Finance as a window to print money. The Ministry of Finance has had the central bank serve virtually as a money pump for political spending. With no power to resist this, the central bank could only wring its hands as the economy endured disastrous inflation of 20 to 30 percent per year. The painful experience of money pumping was repeated again last year. The financial reform plan made by the government includes the major overhaul of the existing financial industry structure to modernize the obsolescent market system under the heavy-handed guidance of the Ministry of Finance. A serious concern rises that the government's determination of business boundaries for each financial institution and restructuring of the financial industry may rather deteriorate the development of financial market functions because it will legally erect entry barriers and limit free business activities. The arbitrary government intervention has been the major cause for the prolonged obsolescence of the finance industry in Korea. The government plan may well be regarded as another bureaucratic attempt to build an iron wall against the growth of market viability. The ultimate choice for the government to take is to allow full-fledged deregulation and let financial institutions determine autonomously the relevant industry structure and operation rules to their liking. If a free hand is given, a competitive market mechanism will be formed to push each institution to develop its own specialty for survival. And the efficient industry structure will emerge as an evolutionary process based on market needs in a long run perspective.
