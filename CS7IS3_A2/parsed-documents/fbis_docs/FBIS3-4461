He said: The development of the market economy requires the strengthening of legislation work and the market economy is precisely the economy of the legal system. Without a perfect legal system as an guarantee, it is impossible for us to establish and develop the market economy. Although a big improvement has been effected in the quantity and quality of legislation over the past few years, many problems have cropped up in the linkage to law enforcement. We have seen a serious situation of refusing to observe laws, to enforce laws, and to punish law breakers. Many laws, rules, and regulations that are urgently needed are still missing. We still lack sufficient laws to control some obscene and gambling articles on the cultural market. We need legislation to strengthen macroeconomic control. Otherwise, we will be unable to ensure the demands of socialism and to ensure the balance between total supply and total demand. Then, unfair competition and operation will emerge. With regard to the methods to resolve the above-mentioned problems, Sun Weiben said: We should use the reform spirit to strengthen legislation work and organically combine legislation work with the process of reform. At the same time, we should strengthen the drawing up of local rules and regulations. In this regard, we should have foresight and adopt measures in advance. We should strengthen the supervision over law enforcement. Laws are a mere scrap of paper if they are not supervised and enforced. Sun Weiben said: Now, supervision over law enforcement is a weak link. To effect a steady and rapid development of the socialist market economy, we must strengthen supervision in the following three levels: First, the supervision by people's congress; second, the supervision by media; and third, the supervision by the masses. At the same time, we should give full play to the role of people's deputies, understand the voice of the masses, pay attention to the work concerning the masses in electoral areas, and do tangible deeds for the masses.
