The participants held: The amendment further specifies the CPPCC's nature, position, and role in state politics, thereby specifically stipulating the CPPCC's key functions; and designates the principal content, format, and procedure for political consultation and democratic supervision. It has importance significance for regulating and enhancing political consultative tasks. It has been learned that the "CPPCC Constitution" adopted in 1982 has been a good one. The constitution has played an important role in initiating people's political consultation in a new era. As a result of continual progress in China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization drive, as well as continual development in the people's political consultative tasks, we need to make necessary amendments to certain provisions of the constitution in accordance with different actual conditions. Committee members held: It is appropriate to add a provision in the general program, namely: "The CPC-led multiparty cooperation and political consultation system shall prevail and develop for a long time." The new provision, connected with the proposed amendment for the Constitution adopted by the First Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], embodies the characteristics and superior features of China's socialist political system. To further specify and enhance the CPPCC's duties, committee members have added clauses that stress the leading position of the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and socialist basic line during the primary stage of socialism including, "regarding economic construction as the central task"; "enhancing the socialist spiritual civilization drive"; and "promoting the development of a socialist market economy." Committee members held: Adding clauses to the general provisions on the CPPCC's tasks -- including "political consultation means that we hold consultation before making major decisions on general and specific state and local policies, and on other important political, economic, cultural, and social issues, and that we also hold consultation on important issues while implementing policy decisions"; and "democratic supervision means that by making suggestions and criticisms, we carry out supervision over the implementation of the state constitution, laws, regulations, and general and specific major policies, and work performance of state organs and personnel" -- is a new experience we have learned from enhancing China's socialist democracy and people's political consultation in the past 10-odd years. Such new clauses have important significance in regulating and promoting the CPPCC tasks. Concerning the attachment of an extended explanation which reads "organize various parties, organizations, and people from various circles attending this session to participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs" to the key functions of political consultations and democratic supervision, members maintained: Apart from being an organization conducting cooperation and consultations with the CPC and various democratic parties, the CPPCC is also an important organization for various mass organizations, representatives of all nationalities, and persons from various circles who have participated in the CPPCC, to conduct consultations and discussions of important problems concerning the state's general policies and principles as well as the life of people; and to exercise democratic supervision through suggestions and criticisms. The CPPCC's consultation and supervision encompasses a wide range of activities, including consultations, discussions, suggestions, criticisms, as well as all sorts of ensuing activities, such as inspections, fact-finding tours, investigations, studies, and submitting proposals and motions. These are also various forms of participation in the administration and discussion of state affairs. Adding such an extended explanation to the CPPCC's key functions is conducive to extensively encouraging the enthusiasm of units and individuals who have joined the CPPCC, bringing into play the CPPCC's overall superiority, inspiring its work initiative, and serving China's modernization drive in a more satisfactory way. Members noted: Enhancing the construction of a clean and honest government is an important task of the whole society; adding the passages "enhancing the construction of a clean and honest government" and "having the right to report, expose, and participate in the investigation and examination of violations of discipline and law" will further define the rights and obligations of CPPCC organizations and members; and is conducive to displaying the superiority of CPPCC organizations and members, and promoting the construction of a clean and honest government as well as a socialist legal system. Adding the passage "through proposals, motions, and other forms" to the constitution to clearly list duties exercised by members, such as submitting proposals and motions, will enable them to play their role better. During their examination and discussion, members have also put forward many good opinions and suggestions on how to make this draft amendment more perfect.
