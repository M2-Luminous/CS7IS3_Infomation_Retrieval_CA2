The number is not seen as considerable when compared to the Republic's total population -- only one in every 85,000 people does not want to be a citizen of Kazakhstan, according to chief of the passport and visa department of the Republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs Umirbai Musayev [name as received]. The official said that most inhabitants of Kazakhstan will soon exchange Soviet-era passports for plastic identification cards for use inside the Republic. Foreign travel passports will be issued only to those who have to travel for business or other reasons. Those who so wish may hold both a plastic ID and a travel passport. But while the former is issued for a token price, the latter will cost the individual a pretty penny. Although the ID cards will carry information about the holder's citizenship, they can hardly be valid for travel even to the neighbouring countries. Free travel outside a republic is a moot question for the governments of the former Soviet countries.
