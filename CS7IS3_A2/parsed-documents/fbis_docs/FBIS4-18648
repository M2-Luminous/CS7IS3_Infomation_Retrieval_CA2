Future Italian programs and investments in China and "greater collaboration with the aim of consolidating positions gained" were discussed, a government communique said after the meeting. Italian exports to China last year amounted to four trillion lire (2.45 billion dollars), mostly in industrial machinery, and China in 1993 jumped from 20th to 14th place among Italy's export markets, the communique said. Mayor Huang Ju later had talks with Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta focussing on prospects for the "particularly dynamic" area around Shanghai and possible "Italian participation in the development of the Pudong area," a foreign ministry communique said.
