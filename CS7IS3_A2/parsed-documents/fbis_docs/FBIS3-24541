The transplants survived in 11 rats (36.7 percent) as clusters of neural and glial cells. [.sup]3[/]H-thymidine was incorporated into the neurosecretory cells to varying degrees. The most active proliferation of neuroblasts was found in rats injected with the [.sup]3 [/] H- thymidine four weeks or eight weeks after the transplantation. Rats injected 16 weeks after transplantation demonstrated a considerably lower level of proliferation. Average volume of nuclei and nucleoli grew with time. The degree of differentiation of large-cell supraoptic and paraventricular neurons in the transplanted tissue varied as it would in normal ontogenesis.
