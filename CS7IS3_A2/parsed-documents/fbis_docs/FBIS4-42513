The M3 money supply is expanding at a double-digit annual rate, and during the rest of the year will hardly achieve the target of 4 to 6 percent which is to make possible an inflation-free economic growth. In spite of that, key interest rates have been further lowered to this day, while the Bundesbank announces at every turn that, in principle, it will hold onto its money supply concept. One can find an attempt to resolve this contradiction in the bank's latest business report. Although it admits "inconstancies in the shorter-term money supply development," it stresses at the same time that the longer-term links between the growth of the money supply and price development have "not been decisively touched" by it. The M3 money supply remains "a suitable nominal anchor for a stability-oriented monetary policy." But probably it is not quite that simple. First, the question arises how the Bundesbank actually knows that the money demand function, which statistically depicts the dependency relationship between money supply and price level, has remained stable since the German currency union. With the data for the expanded currency area of the German mark, available only since 1990/91, it is very difficult to estimate precisely these longer-term links. If the Bundesbank, however, is in possession of such computations, it should not withhold them from the public. Furthermore, one must take into consideration that the monetary development of recent years was not only characterized by "inconstancies" due to temporary shocks, but above all by an unusually high growth trend: The M3 money supply from January 1992 to today shows an annual growth trend of 8.2 percent; the "expanded M3 money supply" even grew at a rate of about 10 percent per year. If one prefers this latter figure, since it also takes into account the shifts to the Euromarket due to minimum reserves, one must note that the monetary expansion for over three years has been almost twice as high as the Bundesbank's target figure. If one were to trust in the stability of the medium-term connection between money supply and inflation--as the Bundesbank does--one would have to arrive at the conclusion that German monetary policy is clearly on an inflationary course. But since there are no signs whatsoever of this, one cannot avoid putting into question, in principle, the quality of the M3 money supply as an indicator. That may seem more radical than it is. After all, even the Central Bank Council--despite all official declarations--has never held to this self-chosen compass in the 11 rounds of interest rate lowerings it initiated since the fall of 1992. Hence it would be time for the Bundesbank to also officially part from its illusion of a money supply policy. The central banks of other large countries, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, took this step years ago. The Bundesbank is probably shying away from this, above all, because it fears negative effects on its credibility. That can hardly be expected, however, since the money supply targets were handled rather liberally in the past also. Of the 20 target settings announced since 1975, only 10 were actually achieved. With such a "hit score," it can hardly be because of the money supply concept that the Bundesbank managed to achieve such a high degree of reputation. One cannot convince markets with mere declarations of intent. Rather, the decisive fact was that the Bundesbank, when in doubt, has always used its maneuvering room in decisionmaking in favor of the goal of price stability. In this light, German monetary policy has succeeded not because of, but despite, the money supply concept to preserve its credibility. Yet one should not overtax the patience of the markets. A renunciation of the money supply concept is probably difficult for the Bundesbank because thereby it would have to express within the Central Bank Council, and also in public, that the current monetary policy can no longer be oriented along a--practically objective--medium-term target line. Thus it would become clear how complex the business of monetary policy has become: The interest rate level on the money market must continually be controlled so that a stable price level can be achieved, even in the medium term. Since monetary impulses affect the value of money only in a delayed fashion, the Bundesbank cannot be guided solely by the present inflation rate, but must also take into account and cope with a great number of indicators. This decisionmaking process would have to become more transparent by breaking with the money supply concept, and also imbue public discussion with a new quality. Instead of a futile debate on ever new interference factors in M3, there could be a comprehensive discussion of how one can conduct a stability-oriented monetary policy even without a money supply target. Not least of all, such a conceptual clarification would be fitting in order to provide clear leadership on the part of Germany in the upcoming debate on the monetary policy strategy of the European Central Bank. The European partners can hardly be won over to a money supply concept to which the Bundesbank itself does not adhere. So there are good reasons for the Bundesbank to separate myth from reality better than in the past. If it wants to stick to the money supply concept at any price, it must prove convincingly that a stable link between money supply and inflation is still valid, and must also express this in its policy. If it wants to continue proceeding "pragmatically," it should refrain from constantly reiterating its money supply strategy, and rather should clarify on the basis of which criteria it actually makes its decisions. Anything else is not very compatible with the claim to credibility.
