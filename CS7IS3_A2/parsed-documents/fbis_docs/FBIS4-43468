Adopting a tone which will disappoint Tory Euro-sceptics, Mr Hurd defended the Belgian Prime Minister from attacks in the British press, saying he had "presided well" during Belgium's EC leadership last year. M Dehaene has been depicted as an arch-federalist. Mr Hurd said that while he was not Britain's preferred choice, he could be acceptable. Giving evidence to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Mr Hurd said the Government was backing the candidacy of Sir Leon Brittan, former Home Secretary who is now the EC's external trade commissioner. Until recently, Sir Leon was thought to be out of the running as other countries resisted the idea of a free-market British candidate. However, in recent days, he has received the backing of Italy's new Right-wing government and perhaps of Greece as well. The decision may be made in Corfu on June 24. That evening, the EC's heads of government will dine there to discuss the candidates. But diplomats believe there is also a growing risk that it will fail, occasioning the need for a second dinner in September, probably in Germany. A few weeks ago, M Dehaene was starting to look like a certainty. He had the firm support of Paris, which liked him because he is a French speaker, committed to further European integration and, on past record, inclined to suspicion of unfettered free trade. France managed to persuade the Germans to look favourably on him. One advantage M Dehaene had was that he was not Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch Prime Minister. Mr Lubbers had upset Chancellor Helmut Kohl by granting Britain opt-outs on currency union and the Social Chapter at Maastricht, by being hesitant over German reunification and by championing Amsterdam as home for the future European Central Bank. Mr Lubbers's party lost elections last month and though he is likely to stay on as a caretaker, he is now available for the EC job. Earlier this month, President Francois Mitterrand and Herr Kohl came near to annointing M Dehaene. That was a disaster. To choose him now is to admit that the 12 are run by France and Germany. Suddenly, M Dehaene, who British sources were recently describing as "unstoppable," is looking distinctly stoppable. The Italians, Spanish, Greeks and British all incline towards other candidates. If one or two of these can only pluck up the courage to say so to the Franco-German axis M Dehaene's candidacy would be dead.
