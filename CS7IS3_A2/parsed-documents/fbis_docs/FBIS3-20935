Helmut Werner, the new Mercedes-Benz chief executive officer [CEO], appointed in May 1993, has great ambitions. His company, a subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz group, will gain market shares in the future. Sales--down to 508,000 vehicles in 1993 compared with 522,000 the year before--are expected to reach 570,000 vehicles in 1994, and between 850,000 and 900,000 in 1998, at the end of the five-year plan started this year. Last year was difficult. The company lost money on cars and trucks (trucks were already losing money in 1992). Sales declined by three percent, to 64.6 million German marks [DM] (about 219 billion francs [Fr]). They should rise by five percent this year, reaching DM68 billion. Cultural Revolution In support of this prospect, Mr. Werner indicated that sales during the second half of 1993 achieved an annualized rate of 300,000, thanks to the Class-C compact car introduced last summer. Apart from that, Mercedes plans to expand its line with a van called Viano, a small convertible, an all-terrain vehicle to be manufactured in Alabama, and a Class-A "mini" to be introduced in 1997. Innovation in the product line is the first direction of Mr. Werner's strategy. The second one is structural reform. Mercedes eliminated 11,000 jobs in 1993 and will eliminate another 8,000 this year. But this policy, in addition to "adding to the recession spiral," is wearing out. Mr. Werner explained that, from now on, they must take into account the productivity of capital, not just that of labor. In other words, machines must be made to work more efficiently. Mercedes will use three methods to achieve this end: relocation--one Mercedes vehicle out of 10 will have to be manufactured outside of Germany "in the intermediate term," compared with one in 50 at present; increased subcontracting (60 percent of components in 1998 compared with 55 percent now); and, finally, cooperation with other manufacturers. Mercedes is currently negotiating setting up plants in Korea and in India, in cooperation with the local group Tata. This policy implies cost savings, which amounts to a cultural revolution at Mercedes where engineers used to rule the roost. The five-year plan was reduced by DM3.3 billion, down to DM 18.7 billion for investments and DM16 billion for research and development. Mr. Werner said he was confident as to the capacities of the German industry which, for the new age, "possesses greater potential" than its U.S. and Japanese competitors.
