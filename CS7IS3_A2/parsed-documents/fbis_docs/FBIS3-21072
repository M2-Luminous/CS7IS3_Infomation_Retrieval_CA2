The plant will serve 15 of the region's communes. This plant, unique in France in many respects, aims at "zero pollution." Once it goes into service--it is scheduled to begin operations in late 1996--it will process each year about 100,000 tons of household waste "produced" by the 200,000 inhabitants of the 15 communes that have joined in partnership under the umbrella of an intercommunal syndicate headed by the deputy mayor of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Mr. Michel Pericard. Its standards for waste purification are 2 to 12 times as strict as those currently required in France. "For some ejecta, pollution levels are not even measurable today," said Mr. Pericard. For example, even the water-vapor plume released through the plant's smokestack will be eliminated with the help of condensation equipment. "We have accepted a financial sacrifice to obtain these results," admitted Mr. Pericard, noting that the cost of waste processing would be 498 French francs [Fr], versus Fr370 in the past. Dubbed "Azalys," the project was developed by Novergie (a part of the Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez economic interest group) at a total cost of Fr355.8 million. It also takes special pains with "final residues": the sludge that will be used in laying road underpaving, and treated oven-smoke residues. Those residues will be rendered "inert" before storage. Described by Mr. Pericard as a "technological showcase," the project was approved after 10 years of negotiations among the region's communes and represents a step toward meeting the target of eliminating all discharges of untreated waste by the year 2002 set forth in legislation enacted on 13 July 1992.
