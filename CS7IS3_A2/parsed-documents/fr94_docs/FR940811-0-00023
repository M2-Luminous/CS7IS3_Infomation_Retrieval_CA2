Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the control cables, which may lead to the inability of the thrust reversers to deploy, and subsequently, adversely affect stopping distances and controllability of the airplane on the runway during landing, accomplish the following: (a) Within 100 hours time-in-service or 1 month after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs earlier, perform an inspection to determine the tension of the control cables of the thrust reverser, in accordance with British Aerospace Airbus, Ltd., Campaign Wire 76&hyph;CW&hyph;PM6031, dated May 12, 1994. If the tension of any control cable is outside the limits specified in Chapter 76&hyph;11&hyph;0 of the Airplane Maintenance Manual (AMM), prior to further flight, correct the tension of that cable, in accordance with the campaign wire. (b) Within 100 hours time-in-service or 1 month after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs earlier, perform an inspection to detect breakage, damage, wear, or signs of corrosion (swelling) of the control cable of the thrust reverser, in accordance with British Aerospace Airbus, Ltd., Campaign Wire 76&hyph;CW&hyph;PM6031, dated May 12, 1994. (1) If the control cables are free of discrepancies, prior to further flight, lubricate the cables in accordance with the campaign wire. (2) If any control cable is broken, damaged, worn beyond the limits specified in Chapter 27&hyph;00, Figure 201, of the AMM, or corroded, prior to further flight, replace the discrepant cable with a serviceable cable and lubricate the cables, in accordance with British Aerospace Airbus, Ltd.

Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
