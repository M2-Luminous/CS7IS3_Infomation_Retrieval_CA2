The minister said that he must obey the law, but within the limitations of the defense of national interests. Minister Cardoso described the attitude of the deputies as sabotage to the country. He regretted that his party, the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] did not walk out of the plenary while the presidential veto on the wage increases were voted. Cardoso said that, despite the serious attitude of congressmen, there is no reason to speak of closing Congress. The minister considered the attitude of military men as exemplary. He does not believe, however, that the irresponsible behavior of congressmen should be a pretext to attack democracy or Congress as an institution.
