This was the assessment given by Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto in Sunday's [6 March] TURUN SANOMAT. According to Haavisto, the transition to the EU's pricing system means that the production price of certain products will be halved and the value of stockpiled products will fall. According to Haavisto, 3 to 4 billion markkas in national agricultural support will be needed after the transitional period. This year direct support to agriculture will be 6.5 billion markkas. In TURUN SANOMAT Haavisto gave concrete figures for the additional support that Prime Minister Esko Aho said he believed would be necessary in the Eduskunta on Friday. Social Democratic circles have already been fairly critical of calls for additional support. The matter could also cause conflict in the government, since Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, the National Coalition Party chairman, has said that current levels of agricultural support ought to suffice even in a period of transition to the EU. For his part Interior Minister Mauri Pekkarinen indicated on Sunday his readiness to finance the additional expense of EU membership by taking additional loans.
