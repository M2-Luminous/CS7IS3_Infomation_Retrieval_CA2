FR940721-1-00002 FR940721-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;84&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Aerospatiale Model ATR42&hyph;300 and &hyph;320 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42 series airplanes. This proposal would require an inspection to determine the model and orientation of certain flight control rods, and replacement with modified rods, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by reports of corrosion found on the pitch trim and rudder trim rods. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent problems associated with corrosion of the flight control rods, which could compromise the required strength of these items. DATES: Comments must be received by September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;84&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from Aerospatiale, 316 Route de Bayonne, 31060 Toulouse, Cedex 03, France. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sam Grober, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;1187; fax (206) 227&hyph;1100. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;84&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;84&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion The Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42 series airplanes. The DGAC advises that corrosion has been detected on the pitch and rudder trim fail-safe rods installed on these airplanes. (This corrosion was found during inspections that were conducted as a part of a sampling program carried out by the manufacturer.) In some cases, corrosion apparently was caused by water accumulating in the lower part of the rods and freezing; the rods in these cases were installed with their open end oriented upwards (rather than downwards), which allowed water to accumulate between the internal and external tubes of the rod. Some cracking was associated with corrosion in these cases. Such corrosion could compromise the required strength of these flight control rods. Aerospatiale has issued the following service bulletins which address the identified problems: a. Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0071, dated February 23, 1994, describes procedures for inspecting the elevator trim rod and rudder trim rod to determine the orientation of the open rod end. It also describes procedures for replacing rods having open ends that are oriented upwards with rods on which the open end of the rod is oriented downwards. A downward-oriented rod end will prevent the accumulation of water between the internal and external tubes of the rod. The DGAC classified the material contained in this service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;003&hyph;053(B), dated January 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. b. Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0048, Revision 2, dated May 16, 1991, describes procedures for reversing the installation of the ends of the elevator tab and rudder tab control rods so that the open end of the rod is oriented downwards. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin as ``recommended.''
