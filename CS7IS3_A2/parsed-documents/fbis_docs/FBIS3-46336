Sources say the Shenzhen City CPC Committee has drawn up an outline of the idea, to which Deng Xiaoping responded: "Must Do (go ahead)!" Jiang Zemin, mainland state president and CPC general secretary, and State Council Premier Li Peng also agreed to the concept. By this concept, after 1997, people with Shenzhen permanent residency and a permit issued by a local policing unit can travel freely into and out of Luohu Customs. Foreign goods shipped in through Luohu Customs will not count as imports and will be exempted from import duties (except a few commodities such as tobacco and wine). In Shenzhen, mainland people can catch a glimpse of trade commodities from all over the world. Similarly, mainland domestic products shipped from the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone will not be seen as exports. Foreign businessmen will have a chance to observe trade in all good domestically made products in Shenzhen. Shenzhen hopes to become a "365-day, forever open Guangzhou trade fair." The outline, described as a "choice that spans the centuries," forecasts that by 2010 ,Shenzhen's per-capita GDP will reach $70,000, more than Shanghai's $30,000, Taiwan's $40,000, and Singapore's $60,000. The 1.2 billion mainland population will throw their weight behind the program to push Shenzhen ahead of the four Asian little dragons in 2010. The $70,000 is the result of calculations on the World Bank's price parity theory (PPP) on four types of purchasing powers, not a lone estimate by the mainland. The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone currently occupies 327 sq m. There is 160 sq m of land worth development, 100 of which are under actual development. Land use rights over the remaining 60 sq m has been transferred with compensation. The trend shows weak reserve strength for the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone to sustain future development and the necessity of incorporating Baoan and Longgang Districts into the special zone, adding another 1,700 sq m of land. However, there must be effective measures for operations against smuggling and personnel movement management in the future, or there will be a series of problems. To abide by the general principle of "Hong Kong ruled by Hong Kong people," after 1997, the 3 million Shenzhen population will remain excluded from elections in Hong Kong. There is still a difference between "Hong Kong people" and "Shenzhen people." Only thus can Beijing keep its word to the whole world. The idea of building a large bonded area was floated when Shenzhen discovered that there were no longer any preferential policies to speak of in the first special economic zone with the opening up of the entire mainland; also there had been talk of converging with Hong Kong with the approach of 1997. Shenzhen was the second local government to raise such an idea. Hainan Province once suggested the concept of a "special customs area," which was shelved and finally rejected by Beijing last year. Shenzhen officials stated that improvement of zone border management must start right away. It will take into account the experience of Hong Kong and bonded areas around the world, study it, draft relevant ordinances and policies, while picking the Shatoujiao and Futian bonded areas to undergo pilot projects in preparation for modern, international cities, experiences gained there will be popularized. In fact, Shenzhen has started arranging for this year's investment "basket," which is leaning toward water, electricity, land transport, and communication and expanding resource allocations for ports, airports, highways, and high-speed railroads.
