It was reported that "Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa asked U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher during talks on 23 June, to urge North Korea to resume negotiations with Japan for establishing North Korean-Japanese diplomatic ties, and ordered the Foreign Ministry's working-level offices to begin preparations for negotiations with North Korea." This report seems to indicate that North Korea has not responded in any particular way to Japan's proposal for negotiations on establishing diplomatic ties, and that Japan is now asking the United States to take the role of a mediator. However, it is a more convincing analysis that North Korea and Japan are holding behind-the-scene contacts for resuming negotiations on establishing diplomatic ties under the situation in which South-North summit talks are being held while the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks are being promoted, and that the United States and Japan have discussed this issue. In particular, we need to take note of the fact that working-level offices of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's have set out preparatory work for negotiations with North Korea. In early January, when North Korea and the United States announced their agreement on the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks and the nuclear inspection issue after a series of working-level contacts in New York, Japan announced that it had sounded out North Korea's intention to resume negotiations on establishing diplomatic ties between the two. Last year, the Japanese Government had decided to exclude the nuclear issue from the list of preconditions for resuming North Korean-Japanese talks. It seems that Japan sounded out the possibility of resuming negotiations for diplomatic ties with North Korea by sending the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] delegation, including Hajime Fukada of the House of Councillors, to Pyongyang late last year, right before making the above decision. Then, on 9 January, then-Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata officially expressed Japan's will to resume negotiations on establishing diplomatic ties with North Korea. North Korea, however, reacted coldly to Japan's initiative. Noting Japan's ambition to become a "military power" and a "nuclear power," North Korea denounced Japan's "maneuver to isolate and ruin the Republic [konghwaguk korip malsal chaektong]" under the pretext of the nuclear issue. It continuously denounced remarks made by Hata, the Japanese Foreign Minister at the time, which pointed out the North Korean nuclear issue as a cause for misgivings in the entire Asian region, thus pouring cold water upon Japan's active attitude. Eventually, the Japanese proposal for resuming negotiations on diplomatic ties with North Korea could not be realized as the nuclear issue underwent vicissitudes at the brink of a worsened phase of sanctions. At that time, insisting that North Korea ruptured the eighth round of negotiations, Japan voiced its policy that it would not hold negotiations on diplomatic ties unless North Korea first proposed a meeting. It is well worth recalling Japan's explanation about the background to the change in original policy that resulted in the proposal for negotiations to North Korea. A Japanese Foreign Ministry official explained that the Japanese proposal is "aimed at giving indirect aid to U.S.-North Korean negotiations over the nuclear issue." The following, however, cannot be disregarded: With the possibility of rapid improvement in South-North and North Korean-U.S. relations bringing Japan's isolation to the fore, Japan wants to secure the right to speak about issues on the Korean peninsula and nuclear issue. From this viewpoint, a series of recent visits to North Korea by delegations of the SDPJ and the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan [LDPJ] lend support to the resumption of dialogue between North Korea and Japan. Their visits have been made on the basis of the background and logic similar to that seen in last January. In particular, the SDPJ delegation's visit to North Korea is noteworthy. The SDPJ played the role of a coordinator behind the scene in adopting a joint declaration by three Japanese political parties in September 1990 in which they agreed to the principle of an early establishment of diplomatic relations with North Korea. Furthermore, there have been negotiations regarding the SDPJ's participation in a new coalition cabinet since the Hata minority coalition cabinet resigned. This shows the high possibility that the SDPJ's ideas will be reflected in Japan's policy on North Korea. According to the NAEWOE NEWS AGENCY, the SDPJ delegation headed by Director of the General Affairs Bureau Kazo Watanabe held talks with the Workers Party of Korea on 12 June and discussed the North Korean nuclear issue, Japan's policy toward North Korea, and ways to develop relations between the two countries. It is learned that in the talks, North Korea insisted that the Japanese authorities abandon its hostile policy against North Korea and cooperate in resolving pending issues in conformity with the spirit of the joint declaration issued in September 1990 by the three Japanese political parties. In particular, the SDPJ delegation met Kim Yong-sun, party secretary of North Korea who is known to be the person actually in charge of negotiations on diplomatic relations with Japan. An LDPJ delegation headed by Vice Secretary-General Taku Masaki visited North Korea on 14 June, although what was discussed in their talks has not been learned. Musuko Miki, wife of former Japanese Prime Minister Miki, also visited North Korea on the same day and held talks with President Kim Il-song. Whether Japan officially proposed the resumption of negotiations on establishing diplomatic ties and how North Korea reacted to Japan's proposal, if it was made, will soon be learned. It is clear, however, that North Korea and Japan are headed for the thawing age. It is proved by the confirmed fact, even if it was a minor move, that North Korea began to resume issuing visas to Japanese tourists on 21 June. North Korea suspended issuing visas to Japanese tourists in June 1993. The Chungoe Travel Agency, the general agent of the state-run Korea International Tourist Company of North Korea in Japan, said that it began to gather tourists in mid-May upon the notification on resuming visa issuance by North Korea. Prior to this, in early June, it was reported that Japan expressed its willingness to give economic aid to North Korea through international organizations even before the establishment of diplomatic relations under the precondition of a solution of the nuclear problem in a diplomatic way. Japan mentioned assistance in development of a light-water reactor, participation in the Tumen River development project, and emergency food aid as concrete methods of its economic aid to North Korea. Since it is hard for the Japanese Government to give direct aid to North Korea before establishing diplomatic ties with it, the Japanese Government is reportedly considering methods to support it by forming a consultation body for supporting North Korea with international organizations, such as the UN Development Plan and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], or related countries or organizations, such as Japan, the United States, the ROK, and the World Bank. Experts say that while promoting sanctions on North Korea, the United States has certainly understood that sanctions cannot be imposed without active participation by China and Japan. This means that Japan plays a great role as North Korea's economic cooperation partner. They note Japan is now required to participate in efforts to resolve the nuclear issue through negotiations. They view that the discussions between Japanese Prime Minister Koji Kakizawa and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on resuming North Korean-Japanese dialogue under this situation were very significant.
