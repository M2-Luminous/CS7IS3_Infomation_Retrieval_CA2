Narisma] [Text] The Philippines and South Korea yesterday signed an investment guarantee agreement aimed at bolstering the entry of more Korean investors into the country. The agreement, concluded after 13 years of negotiations, seeks to address the concerns of Koreans investing for the first time in the Philippines. It contains provisions on the settling of commercial disputes, the right of investors to remit investments or profits, and protection from expropriation. Officials of the Board of Investments said the accord also grants national treatment status to Korean investments, but within the bounds of existing Philippine laws, such as, foreign ownership restriction on land and exploitation of natural resources. The officials said that this status means that whatever laws or policies on local investors will also be applicable to Korean businessmen. Although substantial investments from South Korea had been coming in even without the investment agreement, Trade and Industry Secretary Rizalino S. Navarro said the pact is still important particularly for new Korean investors. "Many brand-name Korean companies relocated their export-oriented plants here without the agreement, but the small and medium Korean companies who are investing overseas for the first time need this because they are unfamiliar with operations abroad," Navarro pointed out. The Koreans are ranked sixth biggest foreign investors in the Philippines during the past five years, accounting for P4.34 billion [Philippine pesos] or 5 percent of the total foreign equity of P94 billion infused during the period. Among the biggest Korean companies already operating here are STC Corp., Amkor/Anam, Pohang Steel, Ssangyong Corp., Dong Corp., Lucky- Goldstar, Samsung Corp., Kia Motor, Hyundai, and Daewoo Corp.
