According to this document, to which NOTIMEX had access, the leaders will repudiate "any measure that affects free commercial development, goes against international legal principles, and worsens the people's living conditions." Although the final document does not make a direct reference to the Cuban or Haitian situation, it does describe the economic blockade as "incompatible with the current international economic and political situation." The heads of state or government who will participate in the summit that is to be held in this Colombian city on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, manifest their support for the UN resolution that demands the elimination of this type of measure. The first part of the document refers to commerce and integration as factors that further Ibero-American development and recommends the adoption of macroeconomic reforms, as well as the strengthening of the business sector. The participants also propose that restrictive commercial practices be eliminated and underscore their commitment to multilateralism and commercial opening. Cooperation and mutual assistance, including the exchange of information, are considered indispensable for countries in the region to adapt to the new international order, according to the text. In order to overcome the obstacles that prevent a greater level of competition in interregional and international commerce, the heads of state or government will recommend that preferential treatment be granted to less developed countries. At the meeting, which will be inaugurated by host President Cesar Gaviria next Tuesday, they will propose that the government's role in several countries be redefined and that priority be given to the rationing of expenses in other countries. This recommendation, mentioned in the 15-page document, aims to promote having the governments in the area concentrate their efforts in strategic areas, such as education and health, for the well-being of their people. After evaluating the Ibero-American forum's development -- its first meeting was held in Guadalajara, in the western Jalisco State of Mexico, on July 1991 -- the participants will propose that a work method be established for future summits. The proposal's objective is for statements to concentrate on a specific area so as to avoid having another long list of topics that are frequently unconnected and incomplete," in the next summit, scheduled to be held in Argentina in 1995.
