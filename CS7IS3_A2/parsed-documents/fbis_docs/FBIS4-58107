CONTENTS: 1. Asyut Group Escalates Operations, Suhaj Group Seeks Dialogue 2. Brotherhood Calls For Boycotting Serbian Supporters 3. Islamists To Run University Professors' Club Elections 4. Writer Advocates Mediation Between Police, Islamists 5. Government Policies Seen as Cause for Violence 6. Birth Control Seen as Conspiracy Against Muslim Nation 7. Ennahda Leader Interviewed on Tunisian Situation, Prospects ASYUT GROUP ESCALATES OPERATIONS, SUHAJ GROUP SEEKS DIALOGUE A 350-word report by Qutb al-'Arabi and 'Adil al-Bahnasawi on pages 1 and 7 says that the Islamic Group has claimed responsibility for the assassination of Brigadier General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi, commander of Asyut security forces, and his bodyguard. "In a statement faxed to AL-SHA'B" the group said this was "the sixth in a series of operations to confront human right violations in prisons." The report cites a statement issued by the Islamic Group in Suhaj "denouncing violence and the killing of innocent people", originally published in the London-based AL-HAYAH. Issued at a seminar in Suhaj, Upper Egypt, the statement affirms that the Islamic Group "does not object to engaging in any dialogue to solve problems" and that "it calls for laying down arms, renouncing violence, and resorting to law, reason, and logic to contain the crisis." The report also notes that "the security service in Asyut has discovered a detective in the Dayrut police station who cooperates with the Islamic Group." The detained detective revealed that "other officers are working for the Islamic Group," the report says. BROTHERHOOD CALLS FOR BOYCOTTING SERBIAN SUPPORTERS An unattributed 100-word report on page 7 notes that "the Muslim Brotherhood has called on all Muslims to declare a political and economic boycott of the states that support the Serbian aggression against the Bosnian Muslims." The Brotherhood suggests that specialized institutions be set up in individual states to "supervise the boycott measures." The report adds that the Brotherhood blames the major states and the United Nations for Serbian crimes and condemns the "failure and capitulation of the officials in the Arab and Muslim worlds in their stance on the Serbian aggression." ISLAMISTS TO RUN UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS' CLUB ELECTIONS A 150-word report by 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad on pages 1 and 7 says that "current Islamic representatives" will hold elections this month to select members of the professors' clubs at the universities of Cairo and al-Zaqaziq. WRITER ADVOCATES MEDIATION BETWEEN POLICE, ISLAMISTS In a 1,200-word article on page 9, Muhammad Abu-al-Futuh expresses surprise at the "persisting bloodshed and series of mutual executions between police and Islamic groups." He regrets the absence of "serious and sincere attempts" to end this situation, since the victims are always the sons of the Egyptian nation. He notes that security campaigns will not succeed in overcoming extremism, since prevailing conditions provide adequate soil for the growth of more violence. He argues that the only approach guaranteed to put an end to this bloodshed is mediation by Muslim scholars to reconcile the two sides. GOVERNMENT POLICIES SEEN AS CAUSE FOR VIOLENCE In a 2,000-word article on page 3, Dr. Rafiq Habib argues that "terrorism has become an excuse for sustaining the ruling regime and justifying Mubarak's continued to rule." He says that the regime has divided Egyptian society into "terrorists and non-terrorists," the latter being the government which, protected by the law and the media, tightens its grip on all and remains unaccountable. Habib adds that it is wrong to believe the government media campaign, which alleges that we are up against a terrorist phenomenon financed by foreign states. He contends that this campaign seeks to present the situation as a battle between the Islamic groups and society, thereby authorizing the government to play the role of the policeman who protects society. But the truth is that these groups are against the government, not the people; they are working to overthrow the regime. The writer says "the armed Islamic protest" provides strong evidence that "the regime is no longer capable of realizing society's aspirations" and that the present policies divide society and make violence the only effective approach. Habib says that the problem lies in the fact that "we are subject to imported values and are being ruled by a regime that draws its legitimacy from Western systems at a time when our original values are buried inside us." He adds that the policies of the present regime are merely fulfilling the terms of the West, from which the regime benefits in the form of financial and political support. Finally, he calls for rectifying the basic causes of unrest and for reevaluating the government policy in order to avoid further bloodshed. He advises the regime to ally with the people instead of the West. BIRTH CONTROL SEEN AS CONSPIRACY AGAINST MUSLIM NATION In a 4,000-word article on page 5, Labor Party Secretary General 'Adil Husayn writes about the UN population conference recently held in Cairo. Citing the Koranic verse "there is no moving creature on earth but its sustenance dependenth on God," he says the old Western call to curb the population increase in order to save limited resources runs counter to God's promise to provide all creatures with their needs. Showing how the world population balance shifted in favor of the "oppressed world" in the 1950's, he argues that this shift is part of "the heavenly arrangements that herald the approaching triumph of the faithful." The pharaohs and tyrants of this age reject this and seek to change it as much as they can. He notes that "they are plotting to annihilate mankind on our continents, with the Islamic nation heading their targets, of course." Husayn contends that birth control in the Arab and Muslim world is unjustified, since Arab and Muslim populations are not large enough to exploit the abundant natural and financial resources. He believes that the people should stand up to the "official media" to prove that increasing our birth rate is "a blessing that warrants no regret or apology." He expects the population policy to be completely different "when patriotic Islamists" rule the country. ENNAHDA LEADER INTERVIEWED ON SITUATION, PROSPECTS In a 1,500-word interview with Ennahda leader Rached Ghannouchi in Tunis by Lutfi Bin-Ramadan, published on page 8, Ghannouchi relates how the government, fearing the Islamic movement's success in the 1989 elections, set out to uproot Islamists in collaboration with the communists and all anti-Muslim currents. Describing the situation in the wake of recent elections, Ghannouchi says that "it is a battle between a corrupt, totalitarian dictatorship and a civilian society with all its Islamic, secular, and patriotic categories that struggle for their public and private political and religious freedoms." He expects these "farcical elections to inspire a national front involving all the factors of the civilian society to fight dictatorship until the people's will is liberated." Arguing that the people's boycott of the elections indicates a public rejection of the ideas and personalities imposed on them, Ghannoouchi says that "the apparent state of peace is merely the lull that precedes the storm." Although the regime has exploited world conditions that are going against Islam and the Islamic movement, the liberal and democratic powers inside and outside the country realize that the battle against fundamentalism is only a pretext for the regime's suppression of public and individual freedoms. It is opening the door to corrupt currents, he says. Touching on the situation in Algeria, Ghannouchi notes that Algeria enjoys a distinctive status in the Arab Maghreb. He believes that the situation in Algeria is ready for an inevitable change and that "the Islamists are coming under the leadership of the Islamic Salvation Front." Because of its fragility, Tunisia will be the most affected by what happens in Algeria, he adds. Ghannoouchi wishes the Tunisian regime had been as flexible, prudent, and clever as the Jordanian or Moroccan regimes in dealing with the inevitably escalating Islamic current. "It could have achieved a degree of openness and freedom of change, cleared the political climate, and engaged in a serious dialogue with all the cultural and social powers to develop a coexistence formula," he says. However, he finds it unlikely the regime will take such a rational course.
