Did the bus lines you called to strike respond? [Ladera] Up until now, all bus lines affiliated with the union have complied with the union mandate. One must acknowledge when the workers are right. We have said that the government owes us money and that the government has to pay. [Acorte] What is the amount the national government must pay for the special student bus rates? [Ladera] The government owes us 300 million bolivars. It owes the rest of the nation's transportation sector approximately 3 billion bolivars. This amount was due by May. By July the subsidization system should be changed. It is sad that the deputy transportation and communications ministers say there is corruption [words indistinct]. One asks: How can there be corruption on the outside without corruption on the inside? So, to avoid this problem, and for the students and transportation workers to be happy, we should change the subsidization system that expires on 31 July. [Acorte] Last night, in a news conference, Foreign Relations Minister Ramon Escovar Salom, national government spokesman, announced the government already has enough funds to pay the money owed for the special student bus rate -- the subsidy. Did you receive any notice to suspend the strike? [Ladera] We have not received any notice. I also heard the foreign minister. I also want to say publicly that this strike is not fostered by any political motive. I know Dr. Caldera very well. I am a great admirer of Dr. Caldera. Therefore, there is no political issue here; this is not what is prompting this action. We are motivated by a desire to avoid problems in today's Venezuela. I also want to tell the students that their bus rate will not change and that we will not refuse them transportation, regardless of whether or not the government pays us. Therefore, the students do not have to protest, because the student bus rate has not....[pauses] If there are irregularities, if a driver refuses to transport a student, please report him. However, we do not want to give the impression that we are protesting because of the special student bus rate. [Acorte] In your opinion, what is needed to end the strike? Would it be the cash payment of the money owed, or would you accept government vouchers? [Ladera] We are not going to accept vouchers. If the government has the money, it should pay the workers, either by check or in cash, whichever it prefers. We can accept the payment in installments -- whatever the government wants. No matter what, we want our payment.
