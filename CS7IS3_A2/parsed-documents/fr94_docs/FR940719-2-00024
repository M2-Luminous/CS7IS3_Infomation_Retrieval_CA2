FR940719-2-00024 FR940719-2-00004 Announcement of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation's Pending Evaluation of County Grain Sorghum Insurance Programs AGENCY: Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Agriculture. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) is announcing intent to evaluate its grain sorghum program. This announcement solicits public comment and suggestion for improvement and increased participation in FCIC's grain sorghum program. DATES: Submit written comments and suggestions by July 18, 1994 to assure consideration. ADDRESSES: Evaluation Division, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, P.O. Box 419293, Kansas City, MO 64141. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Vondie W. O'Conner, Jr., Acting Director, telephone (816) 926&hyph;6343. (Address is listed above). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation conducts continuing evaluations of its insurance programs. Crop evaluations provide valuable insight into how well programs are operating, the extent to which they are serving the customer, the quality of the customer service provided, the program strengths, the program weaknesses, and program cost effectiveness. Evaluations provide information necessary for FCIC to work for the continued improvement of its crop insurance programs. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 directed that FCIC take necessary actions to improve the actuarial soundness of multiple peril crop insurance and to achieve, on and after October 1, 1995, a projected loss ratio not to exceed 1.10. Therefore, crop programs experiencing high loss ratios and high net losses are priority programs for FCIC to evaluate. For crop years 1989&hyph;1993, FCIC's grain sorghum program experienced a loss ratio of 1.66 and a net loss (premium less indemnity) of approximately $71,000,000. The evaluation will include a review of actuarial and underwriting performance; the accuracy of existing program dates (sales closing, final planting, acreage reporting, and contract cancellation); the effect of unit division and related rate impacts; the determination of insurance coverage, an analysis of cause of loss, frequency and severity of losses and other pertinent program factors. In addition, loss adjustment procedure and training will be evaluated. Done in Washington, DC on May 10, 1994. Kenneth D. Ackerman, Manager, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation.
