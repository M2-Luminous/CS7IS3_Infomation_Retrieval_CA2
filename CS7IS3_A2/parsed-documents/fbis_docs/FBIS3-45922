Although this theory has been criticized by some people, he has never changed his point of view. During his inspection tour of the south in early 1992, he repeatedly stressed, on different occasions, the need to grasp the opportunity and thus increase China's comprehensive national strength. Why has Deng adhered so persistently to the opportunity theory? According to sources in Beijing, this was the conclusion Deng drew from his assessment of the world situation. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in late 1978, Deng Xiaoping reassessed the world situation then, and pointed out that although the danger of another world war still existed, forces for world peace had outgrown the forces for war, so it was not quite possible that another world war would break out, and it would be possible to maintain world peace for a fairly long time to come. According to this conclusion, Deng corrected Mao Zedong's opinion of the 1960's that another world war was inevitable and could even break out suddenly, and put forward a new thesis that peace and development were the two main themes of the contemporary world. Deng Xiaoping also adopted the national administrative guideline of focusing efforts on economic construction on the basis of this conclusion. In Deng's eyes, a peaceful international environment did not come easily. The opportunity must not be let slip, otherwise, it may not come again. So China must grasp the opportunity and accelerate its development. Some experts on international affairs in Beijing also agreed that for China, whose per capita GNP is many times smaller than the developed nations, it is indeed necessary to make good use of the current peaceful environment to quicken economic development. They pointed out that after the end of the Cold War, in the global sphere, the U.S.-Soviet rivalry for world hegemony as a factor causing the outbreak of a world war no longer exists, the world situation is going to ease, and the occurrence of a major war has become quite impossible. However, in the regional sphere, the degree of turbulence has been aggravated. According to a statistical report published by the World Priority Office [shi jie you xian shi wu suo 0013 3954 0327 0341 0057 0523 2076] on 9 November 1993, 29 wars broke out in the world in 1992, more than 6 million people were killed in wars, and total global military expenditure exceeded $600 million. This indicates that the issue of peace has not been resolved. Moreover, regional unrest in Europe remains, and an unprecedented arms race is occurring in the Asia- Pacific region. The world is not as stable as some people expected. On the contrary, the situation has become more complicated. In such circumstances, if China fails to grasp the favorable opportunity to quicken its development, it will certainly regret it in the future, because such historic opportunities are rare. According to sources, Deng Xiaoping's idea of "grasping the opportunity to accelerate development" has profound content. A nation's rise or decline is contingent on its comprehensive national strength (mainly its economic strength). Many developing countries and regions have maintained sustained economic development over 20 to 30 years. This made Deng Xiaoping realize that "development is the last word." He said: "What is the greatest danger China could face? In my view, it is a situation where China fails to develop its economy, lets the opportunity slip, and continues to lag behind other nations. What is the greatest hope of the common people of China? In my view, it is their demand for quickening reform and opening and boosting the economy as quickly as possible so that they can lead better lives." "The final solution to problems lies in economic development." "If the economy is developed, everything will be easy to handle." "The settlement of all issues in China relies on economic development." Recently, he stressed again: "In the remaining years of the 20th century, the situation will be favorable to China, so I think that the pace of development in the next few years should not be slow. Problems should be solved in the course of development, and development should be promoted through reforms. We should not be affected by the criticisms of some foreigners. They do not want to see a prosperous China. They are not doing well at present and are failing to sustain their development. This is precisely an opportunity for us." This shows that Deng's idea about accelerating development is related to his keen intention to compete with the developed nations by enhancing China's economy so that China can be freed from the unfavorable position of being subjected to pressures and constraints from other nations. At the same time, while calling for quicker development, Deng did not allow people to rush headlong into disorderly action. He stressed: "Those who are able to develop should not be obstructed, and localities with favorable conditions should be allowed to develop as quickly as they can. As long as attention is paid to efficiency and quality, there is nothing worrying about the process of developing an outwardly oriented economy." This shows that although Deng is keen on continuously raising the economy to a new stage in a few years, he did not call for an unrealistic growth speed; instead, he requires that development should be made solidly, steadily, and in a well-coordinated way to achieve good economic efficiency. It is wrong to think that Deng only hopes for a high rate of growth without regard to whether the economy is overheated or whether the people can endure it. According to the same sources, in order to further implement Deng Xiaoping's instruction that "development is the last word," the top CPC leadership has decided to make concrete arrangements by pooling their collective wisdom at the second session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], which is scheduled to open on 10 March. The keynote of the NPC session will be the acceleration of reform and opening up, and the meeting will mainly deal with the following three issues: First, the issue of reform and development. This year is the year of reform in China, and economic reform will make major progress. Measures for reforming the management system in state- owned enterprises, the banking system, the finance and taxation system, the investment system, and the foreign trade system, which are known as the five pillars of the socialist market economy, will be put into practice so that better institutional conditions for economic development will be created. In order to prevent these reform measures from triggering off another upsurge in inflation which goes beyond the people's endurance, the authorities will adopt the option of making gradual and orderly progress and effecting gradual transition by carrying out the reform measures in phases. On the other hand, some new ways to develop will also be found in order to really shift economic development to a path of enhancing economic efficiency rather than mainly relying on increasing output value and expanding the scale of investment. Second, the issue of maintaining political and social stability. On this issue, the top CPC leadership reached a consensus of opinion: "Development is the goal, reform is the driving force, and political and social stability is the guarantee. It is hoped that development will be made through reforms, and the people's living standards will be improved along with economic development. Only then will political and social stability be maintained, and this will in turn promote the reforms." As many reform measures will be adopted this year, more contradictions and more unstable factors may arise. Therefore, the authorities hold that it is necessary to discover and resolve problems in good time without delay, and problems must not pile up because this could trigger a major crisis. All problems should be solved as soon as they appear. Work teams should be dispatched to institutions and localities where many problems exist and cannot be solved. It is necessary to study forecasting trends and prepare to deal with possible problems. Third, the issue of personnel adjustments. The top CPC leadership has reiterated the need to further streamline the administrative structure, especially in institutions which are overstaffed. That is to say, people who do not perform actual duties or who are incompetent in their work will be relieved of leading positions. It is known that as the tasks of reform become more arduous, some economic experts have proposed that more cadres with knowledge of economics should be appointed to the State Council and concerned departments, and some have even proposed that such cadres should be selected from Shanghai, because Shanghai is playing a more and more important role in the country as a whole and is also a place where many talented people gather. People will see whether the CPC leadership adopts this proposal by observing personnel appointments at the NPC session in March.
