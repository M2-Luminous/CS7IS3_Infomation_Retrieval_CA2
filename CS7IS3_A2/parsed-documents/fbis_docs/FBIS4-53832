FBIS4-53832 "dreas100_c_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-100 Daily Report 22 May 1994 North Korea U.S. Urged To Check ROK Nuclear Arms Development U.S. Urged To Check ROK Nuclear Arms Development SK2205085794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0819 GMT 22 May 94 SK2205085794 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon) strongly urged the U.S. President to abandon the U.S. commitment to providing its nuclear umbrella for South Korea and, at the same time, to take measures to withdraw more than 1,000 pieces of nuclear weapons from South Korea without delay and promptly check the criminal nuclear arms development of the South Korean authorities, the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported. In a protest message to the U.S. President May 17 it charged that the "White House" has been conniving at the nuclear arms development in South Korea which has been stepped up under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. The message noted that spent nuclear fuel can be replaced any moment for the pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) in Wolsong and the multi-purpose research reactor at the Taedok complex in South Korea while they are operating, that the 678,700 kilowatt PHWR in Wolsong has yielded spent nuclear fuel including plutonium enough to make more than 370 nuclear warheads up until now and that the 30,000 kilowatt multi-purpose research reactor in Taedok is one for nuclear development which is producing plutonium more quickly than the PHWR. While taking issue with the North over its 5 megawatt experimental development reactor, the United States has not called into question the Wolsong PHWR and Taedok multi-purpose research reactor which put out plutonium several ten times greater than that, the message said. Calling attention to the fact that South Korea and Japan have maintained close relations of technical cooperation for their own nuclear armament under the U.S. nuclear umbrella, it stressed: Far from checking this dangerous conspiracy and tieup, the United States put up South Korea and Japan as shock brigades in the nuclear racket against the North, thus creating a grave nuclear threat not only on the Korean peninsula but in the rest of Asia.
