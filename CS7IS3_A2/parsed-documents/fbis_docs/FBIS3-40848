The direct involvement of some MLAs (Member of Legislative Assembly) and ministers in the ongoing Kuki-Naga clashes and the government's failure in tackling the deteriorating law and order situation, among other problems, led to the imposition of President's rule in Manipur yesterday, according to two outgoing cabinet ministers. Requesting anonymity, the ex-ministers said that no one in the ministry thought seriously on how to tackle the insurgency that claimed over 450 lives in the last two years in the state. But the outgoing deputy chief minister, Mr Rishang Keishing, said the imposition of President's rule would help the state government deal more effectively with the problems. There would now be no obstacle from any quarter, added Mr Keishing, a senior Congress leader. However, Mr Keishing's view was not shared by the Manipur People's Party (MPP), a coalition partner in the Congress-led ministry. Disapproving the imposition of President's rule, Mr Kumarjit Singh, senior MPP leader and former deputy chairman of the state planning board, said that all problems could have been solved through discussion and political dialogue. He held the popular ministry responsible for not taking steps to initiate a "meeting ground" of all ethnic groups. He said all tribal communities, including the Kukis and the Nagas, could have sorted out their problems and differences at such a forum. President's rule would not solve the problem, he added. Meanwhile, intelligence sources pointed out that the Centre was disappointed at the utter failure of the state government to check the rising insurgency and the worsening of Kuki-Naga clashes in the five hill districts of the state. The internal crisis in the Congress and the MPP, the two major partners in the five-party coalition, also resulted in difference of opinion among the senior cabinet minister, the sources said. The Centre was aware of this, they added. Another factor hastening the Centre's decision was the banned National Socialist Council of Nagaland's warning to the Naga ministers and MLAs to resign by December 31. The Centre, however, did not succumb to the NSCN (National Socialist Council of Nagaland) pressure and imposed President's rule, a senior Congress member said. The Centre was also aware of the case of missing uniforms worth over Rs 67 lakhs belonging to the Manipur Rifles and the involvement of the Manipur Rifles personnel in smuggling activities, the sources added. These cases were likely to be investigated by the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation), they added. The insurgency had intensified recently with the worst-ever ambush on security personnel in June last year in which 24 army personnel were gunned down by Naga insurgents in the Tengnoupal area in Chandel district in Manipur. Official sources said the security forces could not effectively operate in the trouble-torn areas because of "political interference."
