Norway refused to accept EU proposals over fishing and Austria rejected a proposal to relax strict curbs on polluting truck traffic across the Austrian Alps, the officials said. The negotiations were due to resume on Sunday. The Greek president of the EU's Council of Ministers, Theodoros Pangalos, said they faced a make-or-break deadline of Monday midnight. Failure to meet this deadline means that the political target to bring the four candidates into the Union officially next January 1 will probably be missed.
