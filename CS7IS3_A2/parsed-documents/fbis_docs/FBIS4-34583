FBIS4-34583 "drlat120_l_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-120 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 Bolivia `Unsavory' Alliance To Control COB Reported `Unsavory' Alliance To Control COB Reported PY2106235994 Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 11 Jun 94 p P2 PY2106235994 Santa Cruz EL MUNDO Spanish BFN [Excerpt] Tarija, 10 Jun -- Just as everything seemed to indicate that Edgar Martinez, the candidate of the Trade Union Federation of Bolivian Mine Workers, would be the next COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] executive secretary, there has been a turnabout: At the very last minute the miners withdrew their candidate because they realized that he would not get enough votes. Thus Oscar Salas was reelected by landslide. The alliance between the ruling party and the ASD [Democratic Socialist Alternative] was sealed at the lengthy plenary meeting of the 10th COB Congress, which started at 1600 on 9 June and ended at 0815 the next day. The workers call this alliance "unsavory." Before the voting started, Fred Nunez, one of the workers' leaders, claimed "the ruling party had prepared" a list of candidates that they circulated among workers. This "ticket" comprises ASD, MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement], and UCS [Solidarity Civic Union] members. The reading of this ticket did not elicit any comments, and the congress elected the new COB executive board. [passage omitted]
