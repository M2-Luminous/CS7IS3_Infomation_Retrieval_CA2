A very rich businessman, he lives in London and displays great moderation. The PLO's big financier, a liberal, explains that the market economy will be imposed in the occupied territories but he cautiously stressed that a climate of confidence is vital and that the settlement of the political problems is a precondition for any economic development. "To attract investment and channel funds to lasting development projects, we want to establish a market economy in which the private sector and not the public sector will play the main role." In different times, Jawid al-Ghusayn could have held court in the room furnished with cushions where the sultan's council met under the Ottoman occupation, but he does not give the impression of being idle. There is no sign of Palestine in this luxury Mayfair apartment, in the fashionable district of London, with modernist decoration from which no detail is absent, not even the thirties' furniture and the abstract paintings. The president of the Palestinian National Fund, with his sober suit and his club necktie, blends with the City financiers. And when this very rich businessman, a member of a famous family of citrus fruit farmers in the Gaza strip, mentions the 13 September 1993 agreement between Israel and the PLO, there is no trace of sentimentality in what he says: "To establish good cooperation, the psychological environment is crucial. When you choose an associate, this agreement is based on confidence, reciprocity, equality between the parties. How can you build the future if you distrust each other?" If, like any well-born Palestinian, our interlocutor feels he is partly British, it is by his phlegm, the almost infectious calmness, that he shows it: "Let us first solve the political problems and the economy will follow." Businessman Jawid al-Ghusayn? Who is he? We do not even know what the "Who's Who in the Arab World?" nonchalantly "forgotten" on the table, says of him. Why is it there? He is not in it. His history in business is like that of many Palestinian-born entrepreneurs, uprooted by the creation of the Israeli State in 1948 or the rush to the Persian Gulf oil paradise in the early fifties. After studying economics at the American University in Cairo (where he met Yasir 'Arafat), this man, who is completely bilingual in Arabic and English, made his fortune in the construction industry, first in Kuwait, then in Abu Dhabi, and in Qatar. After winning comfortable commissions as intermediaries between the oil monarchies and the Western companies, many Palestinian businessmen gained positions in the public buildings and works sector, import-export, tourism, and agribusiness, always cropping up where nobody dared to venture. There is no sign of photographs of 'Arafat, yellowed engravings of the Dome of the Rock, or ashtrays in PLO colors. Jawid al-Ghusayn, 63 years old, is not playing at being a defender of the Palestinian cause, he simply is one, holding an essential place within Fatah. Our interlocutor, who has been "PLO finance minister" since 1984, is a legitimate member of the executive committee. His department provides for the needs of bodies like the Association of Martyrs' Families, the Liberation Army, diplomatic missions, the payment of the organization's cadres, or financial support for the Intifadah. He is also one of the founder leaders of the Welfare, the most powerful of the Palestinian charity organizations which works on aid projects in the sphere of training, healthcare, the preservation of the heritage in the occupied territories. It is an association set up by the famous "London Club" -- the informal set of rich businessmen of Palestinian origin based in the City. Treasury Grouping entrepreneurs like 'Abd-al-Majid Shuman, president of the Arab Bank Group, Muhsin Kittani and Munib al-Masri, princes of the public buildings and works sector, and many others, this "London club" represents considerable economic influence. Its members, who prefer to work behind the scenes, have a bridgehead in Britain -- the former mandatory power -- and ties of confidence with what is called the English establishment. The private fortune of Palestinians abroad is estimated to be $10 billion. "One of the great assets of the future entity," according to John Milne, Bank of England adviser for the Near East. "The era of socialism and nationalizations is over. Everybody is now privatizing," we were told by the big PLO financier. The organization's war "treasury" is estimated at $5 billion. But the cessation of payments from the Arab countries, angered by the pro- Iraqi position taken by the PLO during the Gulf War, forced Jawid al-Ghusayn to reduce spending. Although he and Abu-al-'Ala', his colleague who is director of the PLO and Fatah Economic Committee, the man at the center of the secret talks with Israel, supervise this nest egg, Yasir 'Arafat is still the man who really has financial power. Jawid al-Ghusayn tried to be reassuring: "'Arafat, an engineer by training, was an entrepreneur in Kuwait before taking the reins of the PLO. He knows what economic liberalism and the free movement of capital mean." However, there is no question of discussing big bucks or corruption. This is what real treasurers are like. "We want to build an efficient but light government machine. The inhabitants of the territories will be responsible for the administration, not expatriate cadres living in Tunis. They must have priority when hiring starts because they know the problems..." The businessman may well belong to the generation educated in the fifties and sixties, the great era of pan-Arabism, the Ba'th movement, and Nasirism, but his sober control of the Palestinian movement has always constantly been exercised in the direction of moderation. As befits a gentleman.
