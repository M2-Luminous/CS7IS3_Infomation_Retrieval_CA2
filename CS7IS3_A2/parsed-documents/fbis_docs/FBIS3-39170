The warning was issued in case Skopje increases its provocations against Athens. Following Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's statement Thursday [10 February] night at the presidential palace regarding the end of dialogue with Skopje, the government spokesman yesterday spoke with equally strong language when he issued a harsh warning to Skopje. The government reminded [Macedonian President Kiro] Gligorov that the recent international recognitions of his state do not diminish for Skopje the importance of normalizing relations with Greece at all. [passage omitted] In this way, the government is attempting to send a message in "two directions:" First, to the government of Skopje not to continue provocative statements or actions due to the "comfort" of the recent recognitions. Second, to the international community to refrain from encouraging Skopje by taking further actions that would actually force the Greek Government to harden its stance toward Skopje. Yesterday the government spokesman repeated that "there is no sense in a dialogue" if Skopje does not show specific and practical signs of satisfying the Greek conditions. However, the government is not willing at this time to indicate what moves and measures it intends to take to pressure Skopje. However, the government's policy in the diplomatic and economic fields is already under review and reform, but with no specific indications as to how it will move, except to say there is a "specific time limit" to its patience. For his part, Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou yesterday insisted on the need to review Greece's policy toward Skopje. Replying to criticism by the opposition regarding the dangers of ending the dialogue, he described the prime minister's statement in this regard as a "rhetorical phrase." [passage omitted]
