In his view, the idea of imposing a tax on polluting emissions of CO2 even if decided by the EC, could not be applied in practice because of strong opposition from third countries. Mr Matutes was obviously referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council, which is strongly opposed to the EC Commission's proposal for an energy/CO2 tax and whose representatives were attending the Athens conference. The Commissioner also praised the United States' plan to cut CO2 emissions, by the year 2000, to their 1990 level, describing it as a good approach. During the opening day of the conference, Michel Grenon (France) of the Mediterranean Energy Observatory, launched an appeal for the international community to support energy saving programmes in Mediterranean cities before their burgeoning development makes rational use of energy schemes even more difficult and costly.
