FBIS4-52025 "dreas088__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-088-A Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Saudi Arabia Criticizes `Limited Investment' Saudi Arabia Criticizes `Limited Investment' OW0505143594 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 29 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 12--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0505143594 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [By Yomei Tsuji] [Text] Khafji (Saudi Arabia), 27 Apr -- On 27 April, a Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] delegation, the first ever to visit Saudi Arabia, completed its visit. In addition to expressing dissatisfaction that Japanese companies are making only limited investment which are directly linked to employment, Saudi Arabia criticized Japan for withdrawing from a planned joint venture to refine Saudi crude oil in Japan, calling for resumption of negotiations on the project. Saudi Arabia is a leading figure in the Middle East, and Japan relies on it for half of its oil. Since Saudi Arabia is important to Japan in terms of securing energy, it seems Japan needs to take strategic steps in dealing with Saudi Arabia during ordinary times to strengthen mutual ties. Unusual Meeting With King Keidanren Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa met with King Fahd, who has absolute power in Saudi Arabia, at 2230 on the evening of 25 April. After waiting several hours after receiving an unexpected call, Hiraiwa was led to a meeting room in al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh. It is unusual for the king to meet an ordinary citizen. The king took up the issue of refining crude oil in Japan as the only concrete subject for discussions at the meeting, saying: "Although the withdrawal might have been an inevitable decision made by specialists, I hope Japan will study it again at an appropriate time." Saudi Arabia, which attaches importance to the subsidiary sectors of petroleum projects, worked with Nippon Oil Co. Ltd., Japan Energy Company, Arabian Oil Co. Ltd., and other Japanese oil companies for two years to study the possibility of refining crude oil in Japan. It was part of Saudi Arabia's Asian strategy. Because of this, Saudi Arabia's irritation is strong. Moreover, since an agreement which gives Arabian Oil Co. Ltd. the right to produce oil in the Khafji oil field in eastern Saudi Arabia will expire in 2000, Hiraiwa asked the king to extend the terms of the agreement, saying: "I hope we will be able to keep the agreement as a symbol of friendship between the two countries." In response, the king gave a blunt answer, saying: "We will study it." We could feel in the king's response the possibility that Saudi Arabia may use the issue of extending the term of the agreement for resumption of negotiations on the oil refinery project. On the other hand, during his meeting with Hiraiwa, Industry and Electricity Minister Abd al-Aziz Abdallah al-Zamil criticized Japan, saying Japan made only five investments in Saudi Arabia before 1985. He then gave Hiraiwa a booklet containing a list of 120 Saudi Arabian joint ventures with foreign companies. The booklet also contains a list of Saudi Arabian companies which are seeking joint venture partners in different areas, including food and chemical projects. At the end of the meeting, Minister Zamil said: "I am sure this booklet will help Japanese companies save about five years of research time." Growing Population and Financial Difficulties Saudi Arabia is seeking joint ventures at home because of its rapidly increasing population and financial difficulty. After the oil crisis of the 1970's, which created huge income for oil-producing countries, Saudi Arabia emphasized the need to improve social capital, and the level of medical services improved significantly. Because of this, the infant mortality rate sharply decreased and the population increased rapidly. About 20 percent of the Saudi population is less than 20 years old; difficulty in finding jobs has become a problem. Unlike before, government-affiliated organizations are no longer employing people. While national revenue continues to decrease due to low oil prices, expenditures--including expenditure for the Gulf war, weapons cost, and subsidies for daily goods--are continuing to grow. Saudi Arabia continues to suffer a deficit. The budget for this fiscal year was cut by about 20 percent from that of the previous year. Nevertheless, apprehensions in Islamic society will grow if the unemployment rate of young people increases. Eventually, it may weaken the foundation of the royal government. Foreign Minister Saud, who is a member of the royal family, asked Hiraiwa to understand Saudi Arabia's difficult position, saying: "Iraq is still a difficult country to deal with. The Khomeyni line continues in Iran. Middle East peace with Israel is not progressing either. I hope Japan will fulfill its political role as well." More Important Than Rice It seems Saudi Arabia is not as attractive as East Asia to those Japanese companies asked to invest in Saudi Arabia. Many Japanese businessmen stress the difficulty of investing in Saudi Arabia, saying: "The Saudi market is small, and we do not feel comfortable with Islamic rules." Hiraiwa states: "The Japanese economy's weakest point is energy. We have to be prepared for a tight oil supply and demand, which will come sooner or later. It is more important than rice." After his recent trip to Saudi Arabia, Hiraiwa said: "I would like to ask Keidanren's member companies and the government to map out measures to promote investment in and provide technological cooperation to Saudi Arabia. We will reexamine the possibility of refining Saudi oil in Japan." Hiraiwa, who will step down as Keidanren chairman in May, stated: "I will not be able to free myself from energy and electricity projects for the rest of my life. I would like to hand over to my successor (Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor Corporation) issues like the projects with Saudi Arabia." He is willing to remain active as one of the "people concerned with resources" in the financial world.
