FBIS3-43757 "drafr010_c_94019" FBIS-AFR-94-010 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 14 January MB1401130194 MB1401130194 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN `Shocking' Black Exam Pass Rate -- Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 13 January in its page 6 editorial comments on the "shocking" 38.3 percent pass rate of black students in the final matriculation examinations. There are the "usual recriminations" with the African National Congress (ANC) blaming the Department of Education and Training for "failing to 'provide the most basic education facilities'." THE CITIZEN agrees that blacks schools generally "are not as good as White schools, nor is Black teaching in the main as good as White teaching." Nevertheless, "when pupils burn down classrooms in Black schools in political protests, or headmasters are assaulted and chased out of schools, when teachers engage in chalkdowns and pupils stay away from school, Black education is bound to suffer." BUSINESS DAY ANC Minerals Policy To Win Popular Support -- "Are the changes to mineral rights ownership proposed as part of the ANC's overall economic policy devised to win popular support rather than to contribute to an effective restructuring of the economy?" asks a page 4 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 14 January. The ANC "still has to express an "unequivocal economic policy." Its debate later this month "must produce a coherent policy if uncertainty over its intentions is not to deter investment." SOWETAN Blacks, Whites Train Together in SADF -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 14 January in a page 8 editorial welcomes the South African Defense Force changeover to volunteer enlistment, "allowing blacks and whites to do basic training together." "While the army previously had more credibility than other security forces, an army that is representative of all the people will have more credibility. It will also be able to use the skills of many more young people." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN ANC Election Lists Show Internal Democracy -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English for 14-20 January in a page 14 editorial comments on the ANC's regional nomination election lists saying they demonstrated "internal democracy and openness in the ANC's handling of its lists. This was a bottom-up process -- the lists were generated by ANC supporters and not by party leaders handing out favours." "No other party has shown such internal democracy and transparency. It augurs well for the ANC's ability to limit future corruption and patronage." ANC, Police At Fault in Katlehong Shootings Incident -- A second editorial on the same page comments on the ANC leaders' visit to Katlehong on 9 January, and the ensuing shootings, saying that although the ANC had "every right to be in Katlehong" they "acted irresponsibly" because they knew of the dangers facing their charges. They should have had a bullet-proof car at the ready, and when the shooting started Ramaphosa and Slovo should have been thrown to the ground, and their bodies covered by those of their bodyguards. "Not informing the SAP [South African Police] of the delegation's movements was irresponsible too. Whatever the ANC's view on the presence of the ISU [Internal Stability Unit] in the townships, the SAP had a role to play in securing the visit and should have been informed of its details. Playing pass the buck may gather a few votes, but it could cost lives." However, the SAP response that it was not informed of the visit "was a typical whine, ignoring the force's responsibilities under the law." BEELD Need for Media Freedom To Report -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 11 January says in a page 10 editorial the Katlehong shooting on 9 January highlighted the fact that "the SAP and the political parties dare not pull in opposite directions where security is involved. They owe it to the country to protect the political process." BEELD does "not accept that the ANC was simply being provocative by visiting Katlehong. It has the right to convey its message, just as the National Party [NP] has the right to preach its message in Soweto. That is the kind of freedom we need to strive for in this country." ANC Education Plans Too Costly -- A second editorial on page 10 of BEELD says: "The ANC is skating on thin ice with its ideas on a new educational system for a new South Africa. The cost implications of its plans seem to be unaffordably high. It is true that its ideas for a new educational system are not entirely new. Many of them even have merit. But to actually consider free and compulsory education for the first 9 years for all, and to want to place all schools back under state control, sounds half-baked. Education is only one of the areas where affirmative action must take place. But the cost of the ANC's education plan will be so enormous that it will swallow up the country's whole budget." Fortunately, this is not a final plan. BEELD believes the ANC is "testing the water." Editorial Urges Parties Too Unite Against ANC -- According to the latest poll, argues an editorial on page 8 of Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 12 January, "a two-thirds majority in the election is well within the ANC's reach, which means the organization will be able to put its stamp more completely on the final constitution," which "would not be in South Africa's best interests. A check is needed on the organization, especially because there are some dangerous aspects in ANC policy which will have to be removed through struggle and negotiation." "According to figures, the NP remains the only broad, countrywide movement which will be able to stand up to the ANC. It seems the NP has reached its low point and has started growing again. So the contest is far from over." BEELD advises "parties with sufficient common ground" to "get together." Crack in Freedom Alliance To Grow -- A second editorial on the same page of BEELD welcomes the Ciskei decision to participate in the Transitional Executive Council. "This crack in the boycott attitude of the Freedom Alliance can only grow. It has been caused by more than simple increasing political realism. Subjects of Brig. Gqozo insisted that Ciskei become part of the legitimate reform process, or they would be left out of new structures like the National Peacekeeping Force. The same internal pressures will in the days ahead be experienced in kwaZulu and Bophuthatswana. The latest survey indicates that Inkatha is losing support in its home ground, Natal-kwaZulu. Hopefully the leaders of not only Inkatha, but other members of the alliance, will realize that they cannot stop the march to democracy. The overwhelming majority of South Africans want to, and are going to, vote with their hands and feet for participation in the new South Africa."
