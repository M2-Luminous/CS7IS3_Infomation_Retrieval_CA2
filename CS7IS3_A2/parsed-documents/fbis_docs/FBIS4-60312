The source stressed that the al-Ahmar gang is now in a difficult military position because it is incapable of threatening any of the air or sea ports of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. He confirmed that the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen are in total control of all the harbors and airports in this Republic and that they can fully guarantee the security and safety of these harbors and airports and provide the necessary services for ships and aircraft which call there. The military source commented on the statement by a responsible source at the Transport Ministry to the effect that the Sanaa government is not responsible for damage or losses that might occur to any foreign company. The military source said that the government led by the al-Ahmar gang is no more than a smuggling and terrorist gang. It cannot ensure the safety of any foreign company just as it is incapable of protecting the security of the country and its citizens. The source concluded by saying there are a number of companies and individuals who have been subjected to looting, plundering, assassination, and kidnapping before the eyes and ears of the security forces of that corrupt authority.
