We had in mind a number of elements, including the political discrediting of the chairman of the CDR by the spokesman of the Presidency; the attack on the Convention, which was considered (also by the Presidency) as an extremely heterogenous political formation; the partisan position, the authoritarian and discriminatory manner in which President Iliescu interprets the political game, his rather circumstantial statements; the real disinterest of the "chosen one of the nation" (or his concern only for the eyes of the world) in finding effective solutions for emerging from the prolonged political crisis. However, this new attack of the ruling party against the Opposition failed lamentably and succeeded only in making bilateral relations even more tense. The Opposition, that is, the CDR plus the Democratic Party [PD], refused to fall into the trap of any kind of separate discussions with the Presidency and, indirectly, in a disguised manner, with the ruling party, thus demonstrating that it is a coherent and orderly force, which is perfectly motivated to achieve a common goal: the formation of a new parliamentary majority which can support a stable and effective government. This "stubbornness," this spirit of a selfish opposition, this change of tactics might create the impression that they have surprised the Presidency and the Party of Social Democracy of Romania [PSDR], which are accustomed to resolving much more rapidly and "once and for all" the problems posed by their adversary (there were enough examples during the past two or three years). All the more so since President Iliescu has felt that he was "obliged" to state that his intention (and that of the institution which he represents) was misunderstood: the goal was only to achieve a political pact -- "or whatever you would call a document which aimed at an agreement on the framework for the civilized development of activity, of life, and of political confrontation, if you wish"). That is, something which could be defined "possibly, as a code of ethics for our political life" and which envisages, for a long period of time, the cooperation of the parties in a "climate which is favorable for all." After the PDSR, at the request of the president, presents a first draft of such a document, things will be clearer. Now, everything is in the stage of good, sincere intentions. On the other hand, after it let it be known that, at present, it has no thought of sharing (democratically appropriated) power, but, in addition, together with all its "lame ducks," that is, the PSM [Socialist Labor Party], the PRM [Greater Romania Party], the PDAR [Romanian Democratic Agrarian Party], and the PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party], it would form a "monolithic family," a sort of "united left" (from the center to the extreme and back), the PDSR announced its availability for a dialogue with the CDR, first of all, on a general level, "based on the differences which are smaller between us and the CDR, such as, for example, in the field of foreign policy. Then we will go toward an area which can mean a political pact, based on certain elements, possibly an agreement on an economic strategy for the next decades. Finally, there might also be a discussion about a pact on governing." (Adrian Nastase said this!) So, if you had any fears, be at peace; we will have many victories, at least for the next few decades! Exactly like it was with the deceased, disguised, and reformed Romanian Communist Party, some people say. Joined together, the two explanations of attitudes, of the Presidency and the PDSR, do nothing but create a breathing space (or stall for time), so the tactical register could be changed. Since, recently, the "Trojan horse" of Cotroceni, that is, PUNR Senator Viorel Salagean, said: the PDSR should form a government with the PUNR and certain parties in the Convention, such as: the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian Democratic Party], the PL '93 [Liberal Party '93], or the PAC [Civic Alliance Party], obviously supported in the Parliament by other parties, including the PD. In addition -- and pay attention to this! -- according to the "certain" information which Mr. Salagean has, the PD is planning a pact with the PDSR "which is not just possible, but will happen very soon." There has been talk since last fall about the involvement of the PNTCD in the government; about the courting of liberals; and even about the "reconciliation of the Siamese twins." So there is nothing completely new in this -- except for the fact that the leaders of the PNTCD have repeatedly declined the "offer" of the PDSR and we do not know why they would change their opinion now and, moreover, why they would compromise themselves by a misalliance with the "provincial party" of the garrulous inimitable one, Gh. Funar, (who, with the PRM party leader, [Corneliu] Vadim Tudor, forms the ultranationalist tandem of Romanian politics). As for the PD, its detachment from the CDR and its rapprochement to the PDSR -- that is, the re-establishment of the 1990 National Salvation Front -- would compromise it once and for all. But, we do not believe that, after so much energy has been spent in redefining itself politically and rebuilding the image which it lost after the rash coexistence in 1990-91, the PD would have forgotten the Fall of 1991 when "someone" put a "knife to its throat" and, for the sake of the "rasol" [boiled meat], would dig its own grave. During the past two years, Petre Roman demonstrated that he learned a lot about politics (first of all, from his own mistakes, and then, from others), that his performance on the Romanian political stage is not over, and that it is not by chance that EURONEWS, in a report at the end of 1993, calls him a "politician of high caliber," along with Ion Ratiu, who, if properly utilized, could change the image of Romania in the world. The conclusion? The recent statement of the PUNR (?!) senator, Viorel Salagean, was only a new attempt to sow discord, suspicion, and dissent, and to dismember the political forces of the Opposition. If this does not succeed, there will certainly be other attempts. More refined and improved. The current Ruling Party will use all possible maneuvers to wear down its adversary, because only in this way can the agony be prolonged. And along with this, our misery, the suffering of an entire nation that is not completely awake.
