The response on the New York Stock Exchange was swift: Industrials on the Dow Jones Index fell close to 100 percentage points in one day. The American economy finally picked up some growth momentum in the third quarter of last year after a languid 32-month spell. As if to show it had lain dormant long enough, the economy burst into activity in a great release of all the frustrated energy pent up over the years. U.S. GDP growth rate in the fourth-quarter hit 5.9 percent. Before Christmas, factory inventories dropped to a new low for the previous 20 years; 83.5 percent of industrial plants were operating; and the average work-time in the manufacturing sector was the highest since World War II. Economists generally agree that when industrial plant use reaches 85 percent, manufacturers will start to feel the pressure of rising prices due to labor and raw material shortages. It was this concern over inflation that prompted the recent raising of short-term interest rates. Despite the fact that the Clinton administration's economic policy of increasing taxes, reducing expenditure, and cutting budget deficits was the main cause of the revival of the American economy, interest rates played a more direct role in the recent strong growth within a relatively short time. The government determination to cut financial deficits reduced government borrowing, releasing funds into capital markets. The rate of return on the 30-year Treasury bonds -- the cornerstone for long-term interest rates -- dropped accordingly, leading to a fall in short-term interest rates such as the mortgage rate, consumption credit rate, and rates for corporate debentures. Interest rate cuts reduced private and corporate debt burdens, encouraged car and house purchases, and promoted rapid growth in investment, bringing to light the whole manufacturing sector. However, private consumption growth in 1993 far exceeded income growth. Behind the wave of consumption were worries about interest rate hikes. As the American economy is still in the grip of the borrowing-consumption pattern, there is always a chance that the interest rate will be raised again. This lends a certain short-term and fleeting character to the current interest rate-powered economic growth. This is not the whole story of the dilemma for American economic growth. As most Western countries are still in recession, demand in the growing American economy has risen, while demand in its overseas markets remains sluggish. This may help ease shortages on raw material markets and inflation pressure, but it may also increase the U.S. trade deficit and sag the momentum of economic growth. Amid general recession among Western countries, economic growth in East Asia and Latin America has injected new vitality into the world economy. Moreover, economic growth in these countries is no longer one based on borrowings. Now they sustain their economic growth more with savings and direct investment and spend no more than they earn. With low labor cost and effective participation in the world economy, an increasingly larger number of technology- and labor-intensive products from Asian countries and regions are becoming not only self-sufficient, but also gaining a position in international markets. Their purchases from Western countries of high value-added capital goods are determined by their balance of trade. In this sense, they appear first as producers, then as consumers on the international market. The year 1993 was a year of intense restructuring for American corporations. To position themselves for competition, firms spent their funds on information equipment which reduced manpower and cut again intermediate-level management staff and labor. The restructuring, therefore, was focusing on lowering product cost instead of increasing employment opportunity. Numerous white-collar workers became unemployed at a time of economic revival, and newly created jobs were mostly odd or part-time jobs. Reductions in high- paying and stable employment greatly restricted consumption power in society, thus weakening the dynamics of American economic development. Owing to these factors, the American economy in 1994 may very likely find itself in a state of low-speed growth, its annual economic growth rate estimated at around 3 percent. In a world economic system which is increasingly integrated, the American economy will have to wait for the revival of the Western economy and economic development of developing countries for effective growth. Meanwhile, more and more countries are entering market competition. Whoever wants to have a lot of room for maneuvering and the luxury to advance and retreat as he wishes must acquire an advantage in high technology or cost cutting. To stay competitive in the international market, American firms will have to be further internationalized, work harder to be more responsive, and cut costs. Returns on the scale of economy are lowering, and medium and small firms can look for long-term development. But Americans should not expect any rise in their income level, which is high enough for now. This is an adjustment process wrought with pain.
