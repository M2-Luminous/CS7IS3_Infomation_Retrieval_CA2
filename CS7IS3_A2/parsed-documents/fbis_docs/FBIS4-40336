They produce 40 percent of the national income, which goes into our country's budget. This was said at the general meeting of the Kazakhstan Academy of Agricultural Science on 14 June. At the meeting, it was said that there are more than 60 soil zones in the Republic that differ from each other in nature and climatic characteristics. This means that each of the zones should be managed differently and use different kinds of cattle breeds and seeds. The meeting also said that the Republic has a developed high-fleeced sheep breeding program and created a new fat-failed breed of sheep that can do well in harsh climatic conditions. It was noted that the Academy of Agricultural Science is suffering from a lack of financing. The gross share of budget allocations for scientific backing of the agro-industrial complex has decreased and comprises 15.5 percent against 18.9 percent last year. Over a period of five months agricultural science has been granted only 34.8 million tenge. The meeting raised some other issues related to financing agricultural science. Attending the meeting were Deputy Prime Minister [Sergey] Kulagin and Sagadiyev, the president of the National Academy of Agricultural Science. Also attending was Marat Ospanov, the deputy chairman of the Supreme Council.
