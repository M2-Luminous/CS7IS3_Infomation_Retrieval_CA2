A wing led by the party's northerners like Jarallah 'Umar and Yahya al-Shami has voiced reservations about this step. This is in addition to Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, chairman of the YSP secretariat." The source said: "Northerners view the announcement of the establishment of a separate republic in the south as a serious matter which should be referred to the party's leading and grassroots committees -- which has not been done, as 'Ali Salim al-Bid took the secession decision single-handedly during his presence in Hadhramaut, his birthplace." The source pointed out that the "YSP, which has always stressed that it is a unionist party, cannot become secessionist now." Dr. Yasin Nu'man refused to speak to any media services, insisting on secluding himself at his home in Aden in protest at al-Bid's step. A number of YSP leaders have asked al-Bid to hold an extraordinary Central Committee meeting to address this serious situation. AL-HAYAH has learned from leading YSP sources opposed to al-Bid's opinion that "the YSP leader is refusing to hold such a meeting." Rashid Muhammad Thabit, member of the YSP Central Committee and one of the members opposed to al-Bid's announcement, has said that "al-Bid violated the party's unity and acted single-handedly with some oppositionist forces which are now divided among themselves."
