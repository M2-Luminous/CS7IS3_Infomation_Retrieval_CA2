This week, the Dutch prime minister saw his bid to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission blocked by a Franco-German steamroller in favour of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of neighbouring Belgium. Once the favourite, Mr Lubbers finds himself scrambling to salvage his candidacy. The Franco-German preference for Mr Dehaene is a clear snub; but Mr Lubbers appeared unruffled yesterday morning as he sipped black coffee in his office in the centre of the Hague. "The choice that has to be made now is not only a choice to be made by Bonn and Paris, ...it is, of course, up to all other countries (of the European Union) [EU]." His appeal to a broader constituency remains his strongest card; but it poses an explicit challenge to the Franco-German axis which has set the direction of the Union for the past 30 years. Unless he or Mr Dehaene withdraws, there could be an unseemly row at the European summit in Corfu on June 24-25, When EU leaders are set to decide in secret on the successor to Mr Delors. For Mr Lubbers, this is a painful prospect. A consensusseeker schooled in the art of coalition-building in Dutch politics, he has spent 12 years brokering compromises inside the EU with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand -- on issues ranging from the mindnumbing detail of the EU budget to German unification and the Maastricht treaty, which he pulled off at the end of the 1991 Dutch presidency. Yet the Lubbers candidacy now transcends personalities. It is about the place of the Netherlands inside the Union, and the dilemma of smaller states struggling to preserve their influence ahead of the prospective entry of four new members from Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway. The Dutch dilemma is poignant because the Netherlands has never won its fair share of Euro-spoils, despite being an EU founder member. Unlike Belgium or Luxembourg, it has failed to secure Euro-institutions such as the European Parliament, the European Commission or the European Court of Justice, which are money-spinners for the local economy. Only last year, the Dutch bid to put the European Monetary Institute in Amsterdam was dashed by Mr Kohl's insistence on locating the forerunner of the European central bank in Frankfurt. The Lubbers candidacy was supposed to redress the balance. Here was a prestigious post which Mr Delors has changed beyond recognition since he first arrived in Brussels almost 10 years ago. Thanks to Mr Delors, the president of the Commission is not just a top-flight bureaucrat, he is the public face of the Union. With his Christian Democrat background, and 12-year membership of the club of EU leaders, Mr Lubbers looked like a shoe-in. So what went wrong? Mr Lubbers concedes he may have alienated the French and the Germans earlier this year by refusing to commit himself to entering the race. He was worried about distracting public attention from last month,s Dutch general election at a time when Mr Elco Brinkman, his hand-picked successor, was struggling to take over his mantle. He had also pledged to Queen Beatrix to serve out his term as prime minister, which precluded a public campaign for the Brussels post of the kind waged by Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator. Sir Leon and Mr Peter Sutherland, former head of Gatt, are long-shot contenders. In retrospect Mr Lubbers's reticence looks like miscalculation. The French seized on Mr Dehaene, a French-speaker on the left of the Christian Democrat party, who had impressed during last year's Belgian presidency of the EU. Mr Kohl, who favoured initially Mr Wilfried Martens, a former Belgian premier, fell into line. Mr Martens did not command the support of his own government, so "Kohl feared that he was empty-handed," said Mr Lubbers, adding mischievously that the rotund Mr Dehaene had the goesting (appetite) for the top job. That may not be the whole story. Mr Lubbers and Mr Kohl have never been close. Nor did the German chancellor appreciate the Dutchman's call for clarity about the German-Polish border during German unification, challenging Mr Kohl's preference for leaving the question open in order to placate the German right ahead of the 1990 general election. So is he too independent-minded for Mr Kohl? The Dutch prime minister paused: "Perhaps." There is no question that Mr Lubbers has his own views on the future of Europe. He is keen on a common European defence evolving under the umbrella of the NATO alliance, and is frustrated with the UK government for dragging its feet. He also supports European monetary union, mainly because the Dutch are certain to be in the vanguard along with the Germans. Yet he is sympathetic to British warnings about the risks of integration moving too far ahead of European public opinion. Even in his own country, he feels that enthusiasm for Europe is diminishing. Hence the need for Europe's leaders to restore a sense of mission. He offered three slogans: 1. Efficiency. Mr Lubbers, who comes from a line of Rotterdam industrialists, wants tighter controls on the ECU70bn annual EU budget and a bigger role for the Court of Auditors, the spending watchdog. "People must have the feeling that resources are well spent." 2. Democracy. He wants more transparency in decision-making. He favours a bigger role for the European Parliament in shaping legislation, more public debates with the Commission, and more involvement by national parliaments in areas of inter-governmental co-operation under the second and third pillars of the Maastricht treaty, such as foreign policy, security and justice matters. 3. Credibility. He is worried about the EU stretching its ambitions. He cautions against a "Big Bang" conference to review Maastricht in 1996 which could introduce more qualified majority voting in an expanded Union. He welcomes the "inevitable" EU membership of the central European countries such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic; but he warns against arousing unrealistic expectations about the timing of entry. Yet Mr Lubbers wants the EU to work. With out criticising the call this week by Mr John Major, UK prime minister, for a multi-speed Europe, he said the principle of opting out should apply only to the second and third pillars. On EMU [European Monetary Union], he conceded that some countries might move faster than others, "but there must be a limited time difference. We should not accept too easily all sorts of exceptions and differences in speeds." On the other hand, Mr Lubbers has little sympathy for French calls for a club of "founder members" led by France, Germany, the Benelux and Italy -- an idea floated again this week by Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's minister for European affairs. "I find this fascinating. Why? Because he suggests that the old Six should give a new example of what to do. But he (Lamassoure) writes the article on the very same day as two of them, France and Germany, come out of the preparations for the next (European) Council not as Six but as Two. Italy and the Netherlands are included in his architecture, but are excluded from consensus-seeking." There is a firmness in tone which suggests that Mr Lubbers is loath to let a Franco-German diktat push him out of the race. So is he ready to take his candidacy "down to the wire" at Corfu? "Yes," came the unequivocal response.
