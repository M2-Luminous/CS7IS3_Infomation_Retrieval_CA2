[Mustafa] I do not believe there are any fundamental differences over the 10-factions issue and the need for them to remain as they are or to be developed. An agreement has been reached on a name for the alliance framework of these forces, namely the "Alliance of Palestinian Forces." But there was a disagreement over the previous name agreed by all parties, namely the "Palestinian Islamic National Alliance," on which the DFLP and the PFLP backtracked, demanding that it should be changed for fear of it becoming an ideological tendency as a result of the word Islamic. [Al-Salih] What I meant were any political disagreements over the alliance's program. [Mustafa] The disagreement over that question revolves around the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and recent Arab summits. The question raised was whether we should accept or reject these resolutions. The position of Hamas and the great majority of the 10 factions was to reject and not to recognize these resolutions, because they endorse the legitimacy of the Zionist presence in Palestine. The resolutions adopted by recent Arab summits endorsed this by accepting international Resolutions 242 and 338. We demanded the application of the resolution adopted by the Arab summit held in Khartoum in 1967. There is a disagreement over the Palestinian national charter and its emphasis on the Arab and Islamic dimension of the Palestinian issue. The point of disagreement is that the DFLP is demanding the adoption of the PLO's phase program (the 10-point program) endorsed by the Palestine National Council in 1974. [Al-Salih] Do you mean that they are demanding that the charter be amended? [Mustafa] They are demanding that part of the phased program be added and UN resolutions endorsed. [Al-Salih] The PFLP and the DFLP also attribute the disagreement to the big share you are demanding in the alliance leadership and your attempt to impose your influence on it. [Mustafa] Several proposals were made when we agreed on calling the alliance the "Palestinian Forces Alliance" in order to form a central leadership for this alliance. For our part, we proposed that the Islamists (Hamas and the Islamic Jihad led by Dr. Fathi al-Shiqaqi) have one-third of the seats -- including independents -- in the leadership, namely 14 members out of 40. That is, four members for us and 10 independent members to be recommended by us. But our proposal was not accepted, especially by the PFLP and the DFLP. And the brothers in the Islamic Jihad requested that Hamas choose five independents and that it choose the other five, but Hamas rejected this offer. As a result, and when we felt that some people wanted to marginalize Hamas' role, I thought that the movement should return to the proposal over which it had bargained with (PLO Chairman) Yasir 'Arafat, namely to demand 40 percent of the seats in the alliance leadership for it, 40 percent for the other factions, and 20 percent for the independents. This is with regard to the central leadership. As for the alliance's executive committee, we proposed a 15-member formation in which each faction has one representative, provided the remaining members are selected by the central leadership. We also proposed that the chairmanship of the leadership be assumed by the factions in turn, provided that the deputy chairman be from among the independents and that an agreement be reached on who should be the secretary of the leadership. We were supposed to hold a meeting to discuss these proposals but we preferred to postpone it until today in order to give the other factions a chance to study them. [Al-Salih] But the other factions -- specifically the DFLP and the PFLP -- accuse you of evasion because of differences among your leadership ranks over your position on Israel and relations with the United States. What is your opinion? [Mustafa] As I said, the meeting was postponed because we wanted to give them an opportunity to study the new proposals so that they will not come as a surprise to them. Because the meeting would be futile if the aim is just to present proposals. Second, because the brothers in the leadership were busy and could not come to Damascus. [Al-Salih] But do you expect the factions to accept the 40-percent proposal, when they, or some of them, rejected or did not accept the 30-percent proposal made by you and the Islamic Jihad? [Mustafa] We are open-minded and willing to engage in dialogue and debate. This is our position in order to obtain our natural rights so that the alliance will go ahead and play its role. [Al-Salih] What will the alliance's position be if tomorrow's meeting fails? [Mustafa] We would continue the dialogue. But in the end we would return to our previous situation, that is 10 factions. [Al-Salih] The PFLP and the DFLP say there are two tendencies inside Hamas: One represented by Musa Abu-Rizq, head of the movement's Political Bureau, and calling for consolidating the alliance with the opposition factions in order to thwart the Palestinian-Israeli agreement; and another represented by Ibrahim Ghawshah, the official spokesman, and banking on dialogue with Israel and improving relations with the United States. What is your opinion? [Mustafa] Actually there are no tendencies in Hamas, but, rather, various views presented to its leading and shura [consultative] committees in order to adopt the right view after studying all possibilities. So the minority complies with the majority's view after being convinced that the latter is right. As for the talk about a disagreement and the existence of two tendencies, it is absolutely groundless. Brothers Ghawshah and Nazzal respect the opinion of brother Musa Abu-Rizq, who in turn respects their composure and views. With regard to the dialogue with Israel, it is rejected right from the grass roots to the leadership. As for the dialogue with the United States, it is not rejected by anyone, so we cannot say that some people are against or for it. [Al-Salih] It is also said that there is a tendency espousing the Iranian position calling for action to topple the Palestinian-Israeli agreement by any means, and another tendency which believes that the agreement is going to collapse anyway so there is no need to embark on any action that is bound to weaken Hamas' position among the masses. [Mustafa] Hamas with all its leaders and grass roots is against the agreement and it is working with all its strength to topple it. But at the same time we are eager not to reach the point of Palestinian infighting. With regard to Iran, we join anyone seeking to confront this scheme and anyone who is working for the sake of Palestine and its liberation. We are hostile toward no one, nor do we impose our views on anyone. Thus the brothers in Iran have requested nothing of that kind from us. We are eager to maintain balanced relations with everyone on the Arab and Islamic scenes, and we refuse to be linked to any quarter. [Al-Salih] Are there behind-the-scene mediation efforts to bring your and 'Arafat's views closer, as reported? [Mustafa] I have no knowledge of such mediations. We are against 'Arafat's method, including the agreement. [Al-Salih] What truth is there in reports that meetings were held between the Israelis and imprisoned Hamas leaders? [Mustafa] No meetings in the real sense were held. All that happened is that brother 'Imad al-Faluji (serving a life sentence), and he is a Hamas leader, was summoned to a dialogue. The Israelis raised with him the question of suspending military action. For his part, 'Imad informed them of his inability to make any decision in this connection. So they offered to release him in return for discussing this issue with Hamas leaders outside. But he rejected this proposal, stressing that these matters do not fall within his powers. In this connection I would like to stress that the statement attributed to Hamas and which implies willingness to cease military attacks in return for [the fulfillment of] some conditions is untrue and designed to cause confusion on the Palestinian scene.
