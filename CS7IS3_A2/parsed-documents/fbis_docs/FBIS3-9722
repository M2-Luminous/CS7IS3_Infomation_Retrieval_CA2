Demonstrations are a traditional tool not only of the unions, he said, adding that "demonstrations belong to democracy and democratic political culture as one of the ways people express themselves." Havel said this was why he would not see the union-organized Old Town Square demonstration last Tuesday [22 March] as problematic. In the event, union members, who came to Prague from all over the Czech Republic in 400 buses, and filled most of the square, protested against the employment bill which they saw as leading to worsening working and social conditions. The bill was passed by parliament last Wednesday [23 March]. "On the other hand, I became aware of still how much our unions have to learn to demonstrate in a cultured way," Havel said, adding that throwing a stone or saying that the Minister (of Employment and Social Affairs Jindrich Vodicka, who was prevented by the crowd from addressing the rally) should not have come, were "not good signs." "This proves we all have to learn political culture," Havel said.
