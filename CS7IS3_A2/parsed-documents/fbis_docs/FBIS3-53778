Shahidi: "The Confines of Diplomatic Activity"] [Text] It is a well-known adage that when one is given permission to enter the village, one goes straight to the fellow in charge! In our age this common proverb can be applied to the great Government of Egypt! Recently, the head of the office in charge of Egypt's interests in Tehran met the Kerman governor general and expressed the hope that Egypt could further expand its relations with the Central Asian countries, by forging relations with Iran. Apart from this remark by Dr. Faraj, which seems to be in jest, more than anything else, certain questions come to mind. However, before answering these questions, it is important to mention that propounding such proposals which have a completely political bias should, in principle, be presented through the proper channels of the Foreign Ministry. How did the head of the office in charge of Egypt's interests in Iran surface in Kerman Province and what possible synchronicity could exist between his political activities and that of the Kerman Province and why was such a proposal tendered to the governor general? If such a proposal had been submitted to the Mazandaran governor general it could be understandable in principle, as Mazandaran Province is contiguous to one of the newly independent Central Asian republics. This could be viewed as a plausible antecedent and would have generated fewer questions. The following points may be noted in the margin of this meeting and suggestions provided: 1. According to diplomatic norms, the head of the office in charge of the interests of other countries should be a citizen of a third country that has been assigned to safeguard that country's interests when relations have been severed. He is supposed to act in the name of that country to preserve these interests and the flag of the third country is flown over the office. The head of this office is also permitted to meet with the host country's officials in the presence of the third country's ambassador. In view of the above, the question arises that within all these legal restrictions, how did the head of the office for Egyptian interests suddenly show up in Kerman Province and manage to meet with the governor general? If on the basis of some agreement, these restrictions have been lifted, is the official in charge of the office of Iran's interests in Cairo enjoying similar freedom for diplomatic, economic, and cultural activity? According to some who have visited the office for Iranian interests in Cairo, its activities are extremely limited and the head of the office is not given permission to meet the higher officials of the Foreign Ministry. He is not even invited to the official receptions that are hosted by that country. All this is in addition to the security problems for the office of Iranian interests in Cairo, which he faces due to the heavily policed situation in the Cairo regime. 2. The topic that comes to the minds of readers of this report is: What is the common factor between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the anti-Islamic Government of Egypt, that the head of its interests office was permitted to meet a governor general of a province far removed from the center? Is this not the same Egypt that has surpassed all the tyrants and pharaohs of history in its suppression of active Islamic movements and its killing of the oppressed Egyptian people? On the other hand, according to existing reports, the Cairo regime is the main base for promonarchical Iranians and the radio station of these elements affiliated with the former regime is located in Cairo and broadcasts programs from there at specific times. In addition, we wish to remind the head of the Egyptian interests office in Iran, for his information, that: First, he is quite well aware of our country's position with regard to his government and in view of the "complete severance of relations" between the two countries, such proposals stem from his political immaturity. Second, the phenomenon of the so-called "Islamic fundamentalism" in the Central Asian countries has not reached a level whereby it has to be suppressed with the help of "foreign intervention" and by utilizing Egypt's "valuable experience" in this regard! Therefore, it would be preferable if the Cairo government is advised to use its experience to surmount the problems of its own domestic situation which have stifled the very breath of its regime. This is because, according to existing information, President Husni Mubarak has been greatly perturbed by the cresting of the Islamic movement in recent months and the assassinations of those criminals whose hands are stained with the blood of the Egyptian nation. If he is looking for a scapegoat for a way out of this predicament, tell him "to look elsewhere." Third, if--in the past few months--the enrapturing whiffs of the zephyr which blows in Tehran have made you so delirious that you are voicing such crude proposals, we declare, for your information and for that of the government of Cairo, that nothing has changed and the former position prevails with the same intensity, especially since in the last few months efforts are being made to place the filthy mantle of Camp David onto the oppressed Palestinian nation and to find a way to prevent the defeat of the ill-omened Gaza- Jericho accord.
