The draft state budget which I will present to the honorable House is the 1994-95 draft state budget in the first year of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan. [passage omitted] We should make more concerted efforts to further lower the inflation rate in 1994 -- below the 1993 inflation rate. We should make wiser and careful decisions concerning our monetary and fiscal endeavors. We should also anticipate difficulties in obtaining easy access to the supplies of certain commodities -- particularly commodities which are important for implementing our development projects. In the effort to further improve our economic efficiency, we need to continue with the deregulation and debureaucratization processes. Several deregulation and debureaucratization measures undertaken should be seriously implemented and secured at the central and district levels. [passage omitted] We still need attractive foreign assistance to further hasten the pace of our national development. The more we acquire attractive foreign assistance, the lesser will be our export and commercial credit obligations. As such, our foreign debt burden will not impose a heavier burden for us. We truly need to upgrade our efficiency in making full use of all existing foreign assistance. We must avoid wasting the attractive foreign assistance by eliminating all unbeneficial and slow development projects. [passage omitted] In my state address on 16 August 1993, I presented the estimates that served as the basis for the formulation of the Second Long-term Development Masterplan and the sixth Five- Year Development Plan as well as the main targets to be achieved. Now I want to present the drafts of the sixth Five-Year Development Plan and the 1994-95 budget to the honorable session. I hope to receive comments from the honorable session and I shall pay serious attention to these comments in my efforts to complete the formulation of the sixth Five-Year Development Plan. The 1993 GBHN [Broad Outline of State Policy] stipulates that the second Long- term Development Masterplan is a process of continuity, intensification, expansion, and renewal of the first Long-term Development Masterplan. In the second Long-term Development Masterplan, the Indonesian people are entering a process of take-off toward the realization of a just, prosperous, and autonomous society based on the Pancasila ideology. The 1993 GBHN on the fundamentals of development has served as a guideline in formulating development plans in the second Long-term Development Masterplan. All development efforts must be directed at consolidating and strengthening our nation's economic independence. To achieve the desired stage of progress and independence, we must make the efforts to achieve reasonably high economic growth during the second Long-term Development Masterplan, or higher than that recorded in the first Long-term Development Masterplan, namely, an average of seven percent annually. Such an economic growth rate must also be supported by a declining population growth rate and be accompanied by structural changes in the job market, which should be more balanced and productive. The population growth rate must be reduced to 0.88 percent annually by the end of the second Long-term Development Masterplan from 1.66 percent annually at the end of the first Long-term Development Masterplan. If we can achieve these two main objectives, per capita income will have increased four-fold by the end of the second Long-term Development Plan, namely, at about U.S. $2,600, based on the prevailing price of goods in the 1989-90 fiscal year. The nominal price will automatically be higher. We must promote education to make it more available to the people, serve development needs, and produce more qualified manpower. An important step in promoting education in the second Long-term Development Masterplan is the introduction of nine years of compulsory basic education. We only have six-year compulsory education now. We must achieve this target in 10 years, or three Five-year Development Plans at the latest. We will not only make education more available, but also upgrade its quality. Our education will also be more focussed and adjusted to the manpower needs in all fields and sectors of development activities. [passage omitted] In the sixth Five-year Development Plan, we will try to achieve an average 6.6-percent growth rate annually. We set this growth rate lower than the average rate of the second Long-term Development Masterplan because of the heavy challenges and the need to strengthen our economy. We have set the growth rate of the agricultural sector at 3.4 percent, manufacturing industry at 9.4 percent, and nonoil and nongas industry at 10.3 percent. The growth rate of other sectors are projected at six percent. At the end of the sixth Five-year Development Plan, the growth rate of industrial and agricultural sectors is projected at about 24.1 and 17.6 percent respectively. The population growth rate will be reduced to about 1.51 percent annually at the end of the sixth Five-year Development Plan from about 1.6 percent at the end of the fifth Five-Year Development Plan. With this level of population growth and economic growth, per capita income will surpass U.S. $1,000, or an increase of about 4.7 percent. [passage omitted] The improvement of our economy will be reflected in our debt situation and we always make efforts to keep it within safe limits. Indonesia's [words indistinct] is projected to decrease from about 57 percent at the end of the fifth Five-Year Development Plan to 45 percent at the end of the sixth Five-Year Development Plan. We will also make efforts to reduce the debt service ratio [three preceding words in English] from 32 percent to 20 percent. Efforts will be made to further reduce the role of foreign aid as a source of funds for the development budget during the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan. In the meantime, efforts will be made to further enhance the role of government savings during this period. The share of government savings in the development budget is expected to increase from some 62 percent at the end of the Fifth 5-Year Development Plan to some 68 percent at the end of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan. In addition, the debt service ratio in the routine expenditure will decrease from some 45 percent to some 33 percent. [passage omitted] Investments totaling some 660 trillion rupiah will be needed during the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan. This will be 78 percent higher than the actual investment during the Fifth 5-Year Development Plan or 176 percent higher than the projected investment for the Fifth 5-Year Development Plan. To achieve this target, the role of the business circles must be further enhanced because more than 73 percent of the investment is expected to come from the people. The source of investment will be domestic savings conmprising the government's and people's as well as foreign funds. Government savings [words indistinct] before the repayment of loans is estimated to reach some 169 trillion rupiah, while people's savings will amount to some 453 trillion rupiah. Foreign funds are estimated to total some 37 trillion rupiah. Government funds to finance development projects during the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan are estimated to amount to 443.5 trillion rupiah made up of 382 trillion rupiah from internal revenue and 61.5 trillion from foreign loans. Meanwhile, routine expenditure is estimated to reach 267.6 trillion and development expenditure 175.9 trillion rupiah. The state budget is estimated to grow by an average of 12.4 percent annually in the next five years. Ladies and gentlemen! Internal revenue is estimated to increase from 59.7 trillion rupiah in the first year of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan to 97.3 trillion rupiah in the last year of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan. Internal revenue will be optimally increased from the nonoil and nongas sector, particularly various taxes. For this end, intensive and extensive campaigns will be launched to exploit taxes, the actual collection of which is lower than their potential. [passage omitted] A total of 11.9 million new jobs are expected to be created through various efforts and on the basis of a projected 6.2 percent annual economic growth. The agricultural sector is expected to absorb some 1.9 million workers, the industrial sector some three million, and other sectors seven million. Thus, the rate of open [terbuka] unemployment will be reduced to 0.8 percent at the end of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan from an estimated 3.2 percent in 1990. [passage omitted] Honorable Speaker, allow me to briefly outline the perspective and direction of the draft budget for the several, major sectors in the upcoming Sixth Five-Year Development Plan. In the plan, about 6.4 trillion rupiah will be allocated to the agriculture and forestry sectors. The irrigation sectors will receive an allocation of 10.4 trillion rupiah, which will cover the cost of the expansion of water resources, including irrigation. During this development plan, the irrigation sector will be an independent sector, taking into account its increasingly important role vis a vis the other nonagricultural sectors such as the industrial, housing, health, and environment sectors. Regarding the infrastructure sector, the transportation sector will receive a large allocation of 33 trillion rupiah. Of this amount, 22 trillion rupiah will be allocated for the construction of road infrastructure. The major road infrastructure will be concentrated outside Java, including the construction of roads in the rural regions. Apart from this, the large amount of 21.3 trillion rupiah has also been allocated toward improving energy resources, including the development of a rural electrical supply. By the end of the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan, it is hoped that 79 percent of the community will be able to enjoy an electricity supply compared with only 49 percent at the end of the Fifth Five- Year Development Plan. The education sector receives one of the highest amounts in the draft budget. In the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan, the education sector will receive an allocation of 20.3 trillion rupiah, which includes the budget for national culture. The health sector will be given greater attention. During the next five years, a budget of 8 trillion rupiah will be allocated to the health and population sectors. Housing and community development sectors will receive an allocation of 5.7 trillion rupiah; this is intended to hasten the pace of construction of houses for low-income groups. An estimate of 3.62 trillion will be allocated for the science and technology sector. This includes expenditures for the aerospace and maritime sectors, which have been merged and which should be given more attention. One of the highest allocations in the budget, standing at 34.2 trillion rupiah or 19.45 percent of the total development budget for the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan, is for the regions and the transmigration sector. Regional development will be intensified toward a more equitable distribution of development and a more concrete, dynamic, harmonious, and responsible regional autonomy. [passage omitted] We have been unable to utilize our economic capacity to its fullest because efficiency and productivity are still below par. As yet, neither a much needed system nor regulations to support our economic institutions has been able to fully function as expected. In addition, even though there are indications that the global economic situation is heading toward reform, a feeling of instability still prevails. Any increase in exports will face heavy obstacles. The emergence of economic blocs was brought about by political issues which have been interlinked with trade and economic cooperation and also by the existence of new, progressive, and competitive nations. These are factors which could affect our efforts toward increasing our exports. We could possibly be faced with stiffer challenges in our efforts to attract the much-desired foreign resources. Apart from this, our future plans will also be influenced by oil prices, which are ever declining even though our dependence on oil has been lessened. But in the next five years the role of oil will have a greater influence on our national income and revenues. All these factors should be seriously taken into account when charting our future plans. With the implementation of the GATT agreement in 1994, it is hoped that global trading conflicts will be further lessened. This will provide greater opportunities for us to increase our exports in international markets. However, we will have to face certain consequences. Undoubtedly, our internal market will then be fully opened. This means that our internal market will face greater competition. In that case, we will have no alternative but to upgrade the competitiveness of our internal production with the aim of further widening our export markets. Honorable members, bearing in mind the global economic situation and based on what we have achieved thus far, we have formulated the 1994-95 draft budget. We plan to set a balanced budget for the first year of the upcoming Sixth Five-Year Development Plan at 69.7 trillion rupiah, which means a 11.9 percent increase over the current budget. The national income from revenues is estimated at 59.7 trillion rupiah and the income from development is estimated at 10 trillion rupiah. This means that the national income is more than 85 percent of the overall income. Routine expenditure is estimated at 42.3 trillion rupiah, while development expenditure will be set at 27.4 trillion rupiah. It can be observed from the total amount that the national expenditure stands at 17.4 trillion rupiah or 10.3 percent more than the state expenditure in the existing budget. Domestic income, which is 59.7 trillion rupiah, is derived from the oil and gas sector, which amounts to 12.8 trillion rupiah, and income from the nonoil and nongas sector is 46.9 trillion rupiah. The income from the nonoil and nongas sector makes up 78.6 percent of the total domestic income. This development is very heartening because the national income is becoming stronger and we are confident of weathering any external turbulence. The income from the gas and oil sector is still needed as one of the major sources of income providing assistance in funding national development. However, with the increasingly important role of revenues, we should not be fully dependent on the income from the oil and gas sector. Following the sharp decline of oil prices in 1986 -- a decline which has continued up to now, except for the Gulf crisis in 1990 -- the crude oil price was at around U.S.$16-17 per barrel; however, at the end of 1988 the crude oil price was only U.S.$11-12 per barrel. Therefore, we should be wary and should not hope for crude oil prices to increase again. Recently, there were signs that the crude oil price would again decline because of weakening demand from the industrialized countries and speculation that Iraqi crude oil would re-enter the world market. The crude oil price has been estimated at U.S.$16 per barrel in the 1994-95 draft budget based on these developments. Therefore, based on these calculations and the production of 1.5 million barrels per day, receipts from the gas and oil sector in the 1994-95 draft budget are expected to amount to 12.8 trillion rupiah. Receipts from the nongas sector amounting to 46.9 trillion rupiah come from the services sector -- 40.1 trillion rupiah; the nontax sector -- 4.3 trillion rupiah; and net oil profits -- 2.3 [figure as heard] trillion rupiah. The receipts from taxes indicate their important and strategic role in development as a source of funds. This can be seen from the high amount received from taxes. The receipts from taxes in the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan were at an annual average rate of 22 percent. The income from taxes for the 1994-95 draft budget is estimated at 69 percent. Among the receipts from various tax sectors, the biggest portion has been estimated to come from income tax, value added tax, and land and building taxes. The three forms of taxes are the current and future major source tax incomes. As I stated earlier, we cannot be fully dependent on the gas and oil sector to provide us with total income. On the other hand, we have determined to be self-dependent in implementing our development. [passage omitted] As I stated earlier, domestic income from the nongas sector also included receipts from net oil profit. These receipts are derived from the excess amount from the domestic sale of fuel based on the price of crude oil at U.S.$16 per barrel. In general, the national income from the gas and oil sector experienced a sharp decline due to the lower crude oil price. Apart from domestic incomes, the estimated receipts from the development are set at 10 trillion rupiah. This figure represents the [word indistinct] from the liquidity of foreign aid, which we received from international organizations and from several countries. The amount is 4.8 percent more than the receipts from development in the existing budget. The relatively low increase indicates the lesser role of foreign aid in funding development. Allow me to further clarify the basic national expenditure, which are made up of routine and development expenditures. Routine expenditure is estimated at 42.3 trillion rupiah, which means an increase of 14.2 percent over current expenditure. Of that amount, nearly half -- that is, 20.1 trillion rupiah [words indistinct]. The current national funds should be utilized for development. Because of this, the pay rise for civil servants and members of the Indonesian Armed Forces cannot yet be implemented. If the country's future situation warrants it, the government will definitely honor its obligation. Regarding the routine expenditure, it is estimated that the subsistence allowance for armed forces personnel will be increased from 1,800 rupiah to 3,000 rupiah per day. Honorable members, with domestic income totalling 50.9 trillion and routine expenditure for administration totalling 42.3 trillion rupiah, then the national savings in the 1994-95 budget are estimated to be 17.4 trillion rupiah. This amount will be used to fund a large portion of the development allocation, which stands at 27.4 trillion rupiah. A balance of 10 trillion rupiah is development expenditure in the form of [words indistinct] project aid. It is then clear that the portion from development expenditure has utilized more national savings. Besides, since the 1991-92 fiscal year, the amount subsidized by national savings has exceeded the subsidized amount from project aid. This means that we are becoming more self-reliant in funding our development. Honorable members, I shall continue to clarify the broad guidelines on development expenditure. The amount for development expenditure is estimated at 27.4 trillion rupiah or an increase of 8.6 percent compared with the current budget. This is not a heavy increase. On the other hand, on entering the Sixth Five-Year Development Master Plan, the government will be given heavier responsibilities by parliament. [passage omitted] These are the priorities which should be given to the allocations for development: 1. To complete and continue all ongoing projects; 2. To fully utilize all the allocations for the implementation of projects; 3. To provide allocations tapped from the development expenditures for operational and management purposes; 4. To fund the development projects within the framework of trying to achieve the development objectives. [passage omitted] All presidential funds will total just over 5.3 trillion rupiah. This will represent a 10-percent increase over the current fiscal year, generally because the scope of presidential programs will be expanded and particularly because a new presidential program for backward villages has been created. I presented to the House the main points of the new presidential program on 16 August. Every village categorized as being backward will be given 20 million rupiah unless it has already been taken care of under the current coordinated territorial development program. The total funds for the backward villages are estimated to amount to 389 billion rupiah. Beginning the first fiscal year of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan, some presidential programs will be simplified by according greater responsibility to regions. This step shows our serious determination to develop regional autonomy more concretely, harmoniously, dynamically, and responsibly. Emphasis will be placed on second-level regions. This also shows our greater confidence in the ability of our development officials in the regions. Presidential funds for villages will be increased. Every village will get additional aid of 500,000 rupiah. Thus, every village will get six million rupiah in aid. Of this amount, one million will be used for family welfare development. The additional aid of 500,000 rupiah will be used primarily for village child and youth development. Thus, presidential funds for villages will total 423 billion rupiah or an increase of 8.5 percent. Presidential programs for second-level regions will also be enhanced. More aid for these programs will be proportionate to their areas. Beginning the next fiscal year, every second-level region will get additional aid on the basis of its area -- 20,000 rupiah for every square kilometer. The additional aid is aimed at helping develop backward areas, which are generally remote due to their vastness and inaccessibility. Additional aid will also be given to second-level regions whose areas are made up of populated islands. This additional aid will be useful particularly for vast regions made up of islands in Eastern Indonesia. Based on these considerations, 2.4 trillion rupiah has been earmarked for presidential programs in second-level regions. This will represent an increase of some 135 percent over the current fiscal year. In the meantime, presidential funds for first-level regions will increase to 1.2 trillion rupiah, an increase of 55 percent over the current funds. There will be a slight increase in aid for first- level regions from 56,000 rupiah to 60,000 for every square kilometer. Additional aid will also be earmarked for monitoring development projects in first-level regions. Thus, sectional and regional coordination will be enhanced in these regions. [passage omitted] The second, third, and fifth biggest sectors in terms of fund allocations pertain to infrastructure. Transport is to receive over 5.2 trillion or 19 percent of the total development budget. Mining and energy is to get 3.5 trillion rupiah, most of which will be used to generate electricity. Almost 1.7 trillion rupiah will be for irrigation as the fifth largest sector. Being the fourth biggest sector, education, national culture, religion, youth, and sports will receive some 3 trillion rupiah. About 97 percent of the amount will be used for education, including extracurricular education and official training programs. The amount has been greatly increased primarily to support a 9-year compulsory basic education program, which will begin in the next fiscal year. Similarly, religious education will also get a much bigger funding as part of the 9-year compulsory basic education program. Only two other sectors will be allocated over 1 trillion rupiah each. Some 1.1 trillion and just over 1 trillion will be allocated to defense and security and health respectively. Health development will continue to get top priority as part of efforts to enhance the quality of human resources. Agriculture, which is currently under the combined sector of agriculture and irrigation, will receive 990 billion rupiah, while housing and settlement will get some 888 billion rupiah. The fact that other sectors will not receive huge funds does not mean that they will receive less priority. They will receive the smaller funds because they have different needs to sectors which will need huge investment. The industrial sector, for example, will receive a relatively small development fund of 450 billion rupiah, although industries will be an important sector during the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan. Essentially, industrial development is undertaken by the business circles, including state enterprises, while the government plays mainly a guiding or supervisory role and creates a healthy climate in which the industries can grow.
