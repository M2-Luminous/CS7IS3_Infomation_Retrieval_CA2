Opposition and Majority Differ on Republic's Fundamental Law"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Zenon Poznyak, leader of the parliamentary opposition Belarus National Front, commenting in an exclusive interview to your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent on the adoption of the Constitution, stated: "This Constitution has been passed only to introduce a presidential system designed for one specific person, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich; and for one political action, presidential elections. Other than this, the Constitution is not going to work in a normal way; neither will the presidential system of government, because it does not provide for balanced relations between local authorities and the Supreme Soviet, between the president and the Supreme Soviet, between the executive and judicial powers. The Constitution has been designed to suit a totalitarian regime and the specific figure of Kebich, who actually has the Supreme Soviet in his hands now. It is designed to give Kebich absolute power in a legitimate way. Should another president come along, he would not be able to do anything in this unbalanced system, and would be drawn into conflict with the Supreme Soviet and local authorities. Members of the parliamentary majority naturally see the adoption of the Constitution quite differently. Nikolay Skorigin, adviser to the prime minister and coordinator of the most influential "Belarus" parliamentary group, referred in an interview for your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent to the above accusations: "This is simply ridiculous. How could the Constitution have been designed over two and a half years for one person? All the more so because no one can be dead sure of who is going to be elected first president of the Republic of Belarus." "From the legal point of view, the passing of the Constitution is a foundation for the state's entire legal base, and from the political point of view, it is a legal guarantee of ensuring stability in the state. We have managed to cross the Rubicon from the old Constitution, which was a brake on creating a rule-of-law state, to the new Constitution without a single drop of blood having been shed. This is a great victory for what seems to be a virtually inefficient parliament." This is the opinion of Dmitriy Bulakhov, chairman of the parliamentary commission on legislation. [passage omitted]
