Advocacy for a new strategic trade policy is surfacing to protect high-tech industry. High-tech industry where research and development play a major role is susceptible to monopolies and is said to hold special significance for the economy of any nation. 2. However, it is neither a case where firms that were first in entering the high-tech industry realize permanent high profits nor a case where the economic impact of such industry is particularly significant. Accordingly, even if success were to be realized in the development of high-tech industry through strategic trade policies, we cannot say that such policies lead to significant advantages for industry as a whole of the nation in question. 3. Rather than a nationalistic approach responsive to strategic trade policies, there is a need to take action in terms of overall growth for the world economy. International cooperation is important in the attainment of such a goal through competitive policies, enhancement of market opening measures, protection of intellectual property rights, and research and development policies. National Interests Are Being Pushed to the Forefront With Active Government Involvement Competition under free trade served as the engine for world economic growth in the postwar period. However, on the one hand, there was frequent trade friction with Europe and the United States and on several occasions controlled trade measures were taken through self-imposed export restrictions. Of special note is that in recent years a new movement has surfaced in such nations as the United States in the form of proposals for "strategic trade policies" under which they demand the establishment of numerical goals under which they seek expanded imports by the target nation. Strategic trade policies place special emphasis on high-tech industry and active involvement of the government in the protection and development of such industries. The economic premise for such policies rests with the belief that the rise and fall of a nation's economy are significantly influenced by the viewpoint that research and development play a major role in high-tech industry. In essence, to begin with, fixed costs in the high-tech industry tend to be large because they require huge outlays in research and development, and the industry is affected by economies of scale in which average production costs are lowered through mass production (advantage of scale). Further, as is often said of the production of such items as semiconductors, sustained production processes lead to increased yields and lower production costs. Because of such perceptions, it is thought that markets are susceptible to being monopolized, that importance should be placed on taking the initiative in producing high-tech items to establish international competitiveness, and that firms taking the lead will realize high profits as monopolistic suppliers. Second, technology created through research and development can be leaked to sources outside the source firm without going through open market transactions in a variety of ways such as interchanges among researchers at academic conferences, departing technicians, and research based on reverse engineering. As a result, rather than limited benefits derived by a single firm initiating any given research, it is felt that much greater benefits are gained by society as a whole through so-called external economic factors. Further, although we now address a feature that departs from the effects derived from technical peculiarities, we can mention the dynamic mechanism whereby we enjoy the economic ripple effect on related industries that use high-tech products as parts or production facilities as well as the development of new products leading to other new products and new technologies in other fields of manufacturing. As an example, enhanced performance and price cuts in semiconductors have led to improved performance and lower prices for computers. The performance of automobiles and domestic appliances has also been improved through the use of numerous electronic parts. Further, progress in financial systems and the introduction of point-of-sale systems in the distribution system were both greatly dependent on developments in the computer field. The question now arises of what advantages can be derived from the protection and development of high-tech industry. Need for Prolonged Subsidies Accompanied by Negative Effects First, in addressing the monopolistic nature of the market, we note that in much of the high-tech industry, such as semiconductors and computers, 10 leading firms monopolize more than 80 percent of international markets. However, firms that took the lead in developing their respective industries do not necessarily maintain their high initial market share permanently. The rise and fall of new market participants occur rapidly, thus creating many markets where competitive forces clash intensively and dispelling any notion that early entry into the market place is the only way to ensure competitiveness. When competition is intense, new market entrants or the threat of new market entrants bars the maintenance of high profits on a long-term basis. Even the sharp drop in prices in the semiconductor market, owing to expanded production and a competitive market environment that calls for a drop in prices and lower production costs, demonstrates that high profits cannot be sustained. In other words, even if high profits are enjoyed in the form of creative profits by firms that succeed in developing new products, they cannot be sustained permanently; and we see the repetition of the cycle wherein efforts are made to create new technologies that provide innovative, creative profits. We can probably label the high-tech industry as one in which dynamic competition takes place in the form of "creative destruction" as coined by Joseph A. Schumpeter. Accordingly, even if a nation succeeds in developing a high-tech industry, nothing guarantees the long-term maintenance of such an advantage. Further, some assert that the appearance of a competitor is inspired by protection and development of industries by other nations. However, maintaining long-term competitiveness in the high-tech industry calls for comparative superiority of production elements such as a good quality labor force, capital facilities, and research and development capabilities. As an example, it is thought that the United States is adept at giving birth to creative new products because of its superiority in product innovation (new product development) and that Asian nations such as Japan are highly competitive in producing universal products because of their superiority in process innovation (improvements in production processes). If such production factors did not exist, development of high-tech industries would require subsidies forever and would negatively affect economic efficiency of nations concerned on a long-term basis. Next, it is said that the social benefits of research and development by high-tech industry are significant, but one questions whether this is the case. If one were to assume that the leakage of new technology leads to the creation of similar technology in an identical industry, contributions made in terms of technical progress (comprehensive productivity growth) will be comparatively significant in terms of research and development investments made in a given industry, in those cases where the social benefits are especially broad. No significant differences can be noted in research and development input and output between Japan and the United States in the areas of electronic, electrical, and precision equipment. This fact would indicate that neither nation necessarily enjoys any major social benefits in the area of research and development for high-tech industries relative to other industries. And, as is evident in the higher utilization of high-tech products in other industries as reflected in charts showing use of such products among various industries, major benefits are being realized by other industries through economic ripple effects emanating from the use of manufactured products. However, such effects can be realized through imported products if low-priced, efficient products can be purchased from among imports. As an example, during the 1980's rapid improvements in financial systems were realized in Europe, which is relatively backwards in terms of its high-tech industry. Further, a look at the magnitude of the macroeconomic influence of high-tech industry shows that the contribution made by the electronic, electrical, and precision equipment sector to economic growth during the 1982-1990 period was an annual rate of 0.71 percent for Japan (with an economic growth rate of 4.69 percent), and 0.14 percent for the United States (with an economic growth rate of 3.31 percent), both relatively modest rates. Contributions in terms of job increases were even smaller because of the highly productive nature of the industry, standing at 0.13 percent for Japan and -0.01 percent for the United States. Government Should Expedite Establishment of Provisions for Private Research Based on the foregoing discussion, one would have to admit that even if strategic trade policies proved successful and a nation's high-tech industry were successfully developed, the economic benefits would not necessarily represent a major economic advantage. Further, strategic trade policies represent nationalistic policy actions which have been repeated since the days of mercantilism which sought to deprive benefits from other nations and to seek benefits for one's own nation. The problem areas associated with controlled trade have already been identified by various sources, but now that mutual relationships in the world economy have deepened, greater importance must be placed on the search for policy actions seeking growth in the overall global economy, i.e., economic efficiency through free competition. In search of such a goal, it will be important for the sake of promoting a competitive market environment in response to the potential for monopolistic abuses 1) for all nations to reinforce their competitive policies while ensuring international coordination, and 2) for all nations to reinforce market opening measures while abandoning protective measures. As an example, a look at the automobile market in the European Union (EU) shows that market concentrations of the respective nations are high because each nation has assumed a nationalistic policy, but such concentrations have diminished owing to expansion of trade and mutual market participation among regional nations accompanying progress made in EU unification. Such growth in market scale enables enhancement of competitiveness while conducting a search for the benefits of scale. Further, it is difficult to predict which technical sector will produce major social benefits as a result of research and development. Globalization of business activities and international affiliations have increased the potential that technology will be leaked overseas. Under such circumstances, it is important for government to assume a role in reinforcing and providing for conditions to alleviate risks in the development of human capital to be used in research and development efforts not restricted to any specialized field as a means to provide for positive research and development activities in the private sector. Further, it is necessary to protect intellectual property rights to promote research and development in the private sector, but unreasonably prolonged protection in this area can result in obstructing growth in the business world. Accordingly, we should assume a balanced approach in coordinating the international protection of intellectual ownership rights. Further, from the standpoint of delegating responsibility for applied research to the private sector for commercial products easily influenced by the profit motive, there is a need to reinforce research and development policies and international coordination among all nations. Finally, in the area of international public interest such as academic research and basic research, governments of all nations should become actively involved for the sake of promoting the world economy and we should also think of the future in terms of an international institution to support efforts in this area.
