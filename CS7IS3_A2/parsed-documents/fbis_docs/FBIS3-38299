The immediate effect of Wednesday's [23 January] decisions, aimed at boosting demand for the lira and curbing the monetary crisis, was seen in the domestic markets with reports on Thursday of a new price hike on aluminium and cement by 8.7 to 9 percent respectively. The state-run paper industry SEKA fell in line and announced a 15.2 percent increase in the price of paper products. The sales of copper, its pricing being a major indicator of a wave of price hikes, was suspended along with the sales of iron and steel. Analysts said the prices of all principle goods, with petroleum at the top of the list, would now be increased. But the Central Bank decisions have mostly affected Turkish businessmen with foreign exchange credits. The banking system, said to have a $5.5 billion deficit, is suspected of having recorded a loss of TL [Turkish lira] 11 trillion overnight whereas the losses of firms with foreign exchange credits was also described as being around "hundreds of trillions of lira." Analysts also expect a 15 percent increase in the price of all imported products in the very near future. The state monopoly TEKEL is said to be reviewing the prices of its import products at the time being. One of the immediate effects of the devaluation, experts say, will be seen in declining investments. [passage omitted]
