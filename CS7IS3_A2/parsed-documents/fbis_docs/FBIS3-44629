Over the past few days, all districts in the municipality have conscientiously implemented the arrangements of the emergency conference of the municipal government and the measures for stabilizing prices. They rapidly stabilized prices in two days, thus winning the support of the masses. The markets have been stable, commodities ample, and supplies good. Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, emphasized: We should intensify inspection and rely on the supervision by the masses to ensure that measures for stabilizing grain, oil, vegetable, egg, and meat prices are conscientiously implemented. Workers of grain departments have worked hard, and some of them receive a low income. We should conduct earnest investigation and study and pool efforts from various fields to change such a situation through reform. Mayor Li Qiyan emphasized that the present inspection proved that the municipality is determined to stabilize prices and to set the people's minds at ease for happy New Year and Spring Festival. Chen Xitong, Ouyang Wenan, Meng Zhiyuan, Meng Xuenong, and Fan Yuanmou conducted inspection in Chongwen and Fengtai Districts. All the grain and oil shops and markets of farm products implemented the regulations on price ceilings, and all people and retailers expressed understanding and support. [passage omitted] On that morning when inspecting environmental sanitation, Chen Xitong did not forget to inspect prices and listen to the masses' opinions. In a market of farm products on the Hepingli Middle Street, an old teacher met with the former mayor and said frankly: "Vegetable prices have dropped today when you are conducting inspection. They will go up right after you leave." Chen Xitong said to her: "Inspections by the municipality and various districts are necessary, but people's supervision is more important. You may report whenever you discover wanton price hikes, calling Mayor Li Qiyan, Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa, or me." An old comrade went forward and said: "What if the telephone line is dead?" Chen Xitong said: "You may write letters." "Can you receive the letters?" Chen Xitong said: "Yes, we can. Please rest assured." When a person said that the noodle price of the Qingniangou no. 1 grain shop was higher than the price ceiling, Chen Xitong immediately ordered Dongcheng District leaders to inspect and handle this matter. Some retailers talked about their views on the price difference between wholesale and retail sale and on fixing prices according to quality. Chen Xitong asked pertinent departments to conscientiously study and handle these issues. [passage omitted]
