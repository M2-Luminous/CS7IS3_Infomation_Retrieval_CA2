The issues that have been submitted for your consideration are of an exceptionally important significance. Without exaggeration, the future of Ukraine as an independent state depends to a large extent on the decision you will adopt today. As you know, on 18 November 1993, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a resolution on the ratification of the START Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol with certain reservations. Among other things, it also contained an instruction to the president of Ukraine and the government to hold appropriate negotiations between interested states and international organizations with the aim of due protection of both Ukraine's security and its material interests, which would open the possibilities of the START I treaty entering into force and would initiate the process of genuine nuclear disarmament in the world. You are aware of the world's reaction to the adopted resolution. After this decision of the Supreme Council, Ukraine stood before the threat of full isolation, and the negative image that our state earned because of this, began to intensify to a level that opened the possibility of imposing more than just economic forms of pressure. In the present economic crisis situation, this has already concealed a threat to the very existence of the Ukrainian state. It is precisely to avoid this danger that, in accordance with my instruction, trilateral negotiations were held with the United States and Russia, with the aim of justly resolving the problems of nuclear weapons, to drag Ukraine away from the interminable conflicts with Russia and the world community, and to concentrate our international efforts on the creation of favorable external conditions for carrying out deep reforms in Ukraine's economy. The statement and appendix signed in Moscow, even though they are not international agreements, define the political obligations of the three presidents within the framework of compromise reached between the three states in resolving the problems of nuclear weapons that Ukraine inherited from the former USSR. The text of the statement and the appendix are proof of the realization of Ukraine's strategic policy in acquiring nonnuclear status that was defined in the declaration on state sovereignty, in Supreme Council statements on Ukraine's nonnuclear status, and parliamentary resolutions on additional measures to guarantee that Ukraine acquires nonnuclear status. None of the resolutions adopted by the Supreme Council has cast doubt on this policy. In particular, the accords achieved in Moscow envisage -- after the START I Treaty comes into force and Ukraine accedes to the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] -- the granting to Ukraine of guarantees for its national security, which include pledges regarding confirmation, concerning Ukraine, of its independence, sovereignty and existing borders, and refraining from threats of force or the use of force or measures of economic pressure. The next thing envisaged is the pledge by the United States of America to grant Ukraine the appropriate funds for the dismantlement of nuclear weapons, with the possibility of increasing the volume of such assistance in the future. The withdrawal of all nuclear warheads from Ukraine to Russia for their dismantlement is envisaged with the concurrent granting of compensation in the form of deliveries of fuel assemblies to Ukraine for its nuclear power engineering requirements. Apart from that, and this is of especial political significance, it was confirmed that Ukraine, the United States, and Russia will cooperate between themselves as equal partners, and that relations between them should be developed on principles of respect for the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of each state. The United States also stated its readiness to render assistance to Ukraine in creating a market economy in Ukraine. Some people say that the text of the statement does not fully correspond to the reservations formulated by the Supreme Council because it supposedly departs from specific figures of limitations regarding elimination of warheads and carriers [nosiyi] fixed in Point 6 of the 17 November resolution. But this same article says that this same point makes it possible to destroy nuclear weapons in excess of the established limitations. That is, the executive power received the authority to agree on the dismantlement of warheads, the process (?of destruction) of which should take place in compliance with procedures, which have not been established by the START I Treaty. That is, the point is that we strove to carry out those maximum possibilities laid down in the Supreme Council resolution, but naturally certain compromises are inevitable in these cases. Thus, the tripartite statement and the appendix to it, and also their implementation, in our opinion, and this is true, meet the demands set forth in the resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 18 November 1993. I emphasize, the principle reservations, principle reservations by the Supreme Council have been carried out by the executive power. This is a reply to our just doubts and the reservations with regard to the resolution by our Supreme Council. In connection with this, I introduced a proposal through a legislative initiative in accordance with Article 103 of the Ukrainian Constitution, on the removal of the reservations contained in the Supreme Council resolutions dated 18 November 1993 regarding Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, and Ukraine's accession to the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It seems that the issue of the need for Ukraine to accede to the NPT that was at the center of attention not only here in Ukraine, but also in the whole international community, should be obvious and understood by everyone who lives in the real world. This corresponds to Ukraine's long-term national interests, including the interests of guaranteeing our national security. It is true that some either consciously or subconsciously are twisting the facts, attempting to prove that Ukraine could become a nuclear state; that because of this its security would supposedly increase and its importance in international relations would grow, and that we could defend our independence, territorial integrity, and the future flourishing of the Ukrainian people with nuclear weapons. I repeat, data about the real state of affairs demonstrate that it is simply impossible to defend this thesis if one knows and listens and take these realities into account. The situation for our military men, leading scientists and nuclear workers, and other experts who are involved with this affair is absolutely clear. I remind you of some irrefutable facts. First, the nuclear button, i.e. the entire command infrastructure necessary for the targeting and launching of missiles is located, as before, in Moscow. Nobody, and this must be taken into account, will allow us to take over this control without unforeseen consequences as some people naively suggest. Such actions could only provoke the emergence of an acute military danger for Ukraine. I repeat, it will not protect Ukraine's security, but will provoke the emergence of a danger. Since nuclear weapons located in Ukraine are not controlled by us, they cannot play the role of a factor restraining a potential aggressor. They cannot. As it is known, strategic missiles that are on combat duty in Ukraine today are a threat only to the United States. And it seems that everyone understands it is not preparing to attack us. But there is also a danger for us through the dangerous condition of the missiles because of the lack of supplies of vital components, first of all from Russia. Beginning from this year, the guarantee period, not only of combat capability, but simply of safe storage of a considerable number of warheads, is being terminated. In 1995 this process will take on a catastrophic nature. Specific calculations and data are proof of this. But the moment that the nuclear warhead guarantee period is exhausted, it becomes a danger for others and a danger for us, i.e. for those on whose territory they are based. Such nuclear warheads must be taken away to be dismantled and reprocessed since, as you know, we do not have the appropriate factories. But the weapons' manufacturers are in Russia. If we do not do this, then there could be a danger of a new tragedy, this is a reality. I think that it is a great responsibility for us all. Through our Defense Ministry, I received an appropriate decision from the chief designers of the nuclear warheads. I would like you to know about this and probably there is now no need to conceal it from the Ukrainian people. Now I will read this in the original. In connection with the fact that the service life of certain warheads expired, we moved them out [of Ukraine] at the end of December to be dismantled. Designers provide us with the following data: [switches to Russian] I inform you about the decision by the chief designers, developers of nuclear warheads, coordinated with the interdepartmental commission of the Ministry of Nuclear Power Engineering and the Ministry of Defense of Russia, on the results of the defect-finding inspection [defektatsiya] of the three combat units whose term of technical servicing expired and which were delivered from Ukraine. During the visual inspection of the combat units, the commission members found corrosive products on the surfaces of the uranium parts that are the source of heightened toxic and radiological danger. Proceeding from the results of the work done by the commission, the chief designers arrived at a conclusion that the violation of the rules of technical servicing of nuclear warheads leads to the emergence of irreversible processes of aging in them, to the changes in physical and chemical properties of dangerously explosive and radioactive materials. The above phenomena increase the danger during the nuclear warheads' dismantling. Further use and storage of these warheads aggravates the processes taking place in them, which may lead to the formation of dangerously explosive mixtures within their hermetic capacities. [back to Ukrainian] Here is such a piece of information. I would like to tell you that my consultations with relevant scientific institutions in Ukraine and the scientists who are involved in this, confirm this assessment and this danger. So, the nuclear weapons inherited by Ukraine from the former USSR not only cannot be used to support Ukraine's security, but are a threat to it. We do not have the appropriate scientific nor the manufacturing infrastructure -- for which tens of billions of dollars are needed -- to independently manufacture new nuclear weapons, nor do we have a place where such weapons could be tested. I hope that the majority of people and people's deputies of Ukraine had the possibility to see and hear the opinions of leading Ukrainian scientists on this issue, which was on Ukrainian television. If we cannot be a true nuclear state and gain something positive from this, then why not accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, along with the other 180 world states? Why should we insist on preserving the situation as it is, whereas at the meetings between the president or other leaders of Ukraine and world leaders, or at the diplomatic talks, or at any other meetings, those with ordinary people and the mass media, they always begin the talk with one and the same thing: People just do not understand why we are insisting on exactly such a stand. Though some people believe that the world's concern about Ukraine's attitude toward nuclear weapons is for the benefit of Ukraine, that this adds to our state's authority. Well, at this point they somehow forget that before the signing of the trilateral statement, Ukraine had increasingly often been placed in one group of states that have an unequivocally negative reputation throughout the world. I felt this personally, and the foreign minister who was taking part, as they say, from the Rome to the Brussels meetings, and who is present here, will have a chance to share his impressions with you. The fact that the problem of nuclear arms stationed in Ukraine remained in suspense had, until recently, been one of the main obstacles in the way toward a full-blooded development of mutually advantageous cooperation with foreign countries. After the Supreme Council had adopted the resolution on the START ratification, they were emphasizing it straightforwardly and unequivocally at all levels, that until Ukraine ratified the Lisbon Protocol in full volume and joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the rendering of effective aid toward building a market economy would be just impossible. Moreover, it was difficult to hope for a normal attitude toward us on the part of many countries of the world. They say that this is the dictate. One can agree with this. We, they say, must show our protest. But to do this we should act in compliance with the obligations that we assumed and not ruin the situation that took shape. Ukraine now is being accused of something very serious: If we do not act in accordance with the position we announced earlier, we are stopping further world disarmament. START II comes under threat, and it is this for which Ukraine is being accused. Although the state of our economy and the possibility of reforming it depends in the first instance on us -- and this is true -- without support from international financial institutions, leading Western states, and not only with money but also with experience, private investments, and the granting of access to their markets, we will not manage. Certainly we would not be able to do without the Russian market. Can we really expect the development of normal, I stress, normal relations with Russia without deciding this painful problem? If someone thinks we can then he is deeply mistaken. In this connection, I would like to say this: It is exactly now that we have almost managed to completely reach an understanding of our problems, the main one of which being the readiness to assist us in the complicated matter of reforming the economy on the part of leading Western countries and international institutions. Our nearest neighbors' attitude to us is also different now. Just now, we have received a statement on behalf of the chairman of the European Union, saying that the trilateral accords, reached in Moscow, open the way for the development of full-scale, fruitful relations and cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union. During his stay in Kiev, U.S. President Bill Clinton assured us that the United States had made use of their ability to influence leading international financial organizations in order to provide the assistance we need. The delegation that held negotiations in Washington last week reports that we have already seen a fundamental change in the attitude toward Ukraine of both the United States and the international community, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. They are ready to provide our state with considerable financial and technological assistance and credit. A mechanism has been initiated to realize this assistance in all-sided economic cooperation. The details of this are known to you, I hope, from the joint statement that has been made public. These, strictly speaking, are some of the first reactions and proposals. I am sure there will be others that will be no less serious. Everything will now depend on us alone and our readiness to make use of this moment and these possibilities, and to unite in performing our most important task today, which task, in my view, is to curb the crisis trends in our economy and carry out serious reforms in the direction of creating a democratic state and a socially-oriented market economy. I would once again like to emphasize this: Today, the future of Ukraine as an independent, influential and -- in the future -- a prosperous European state, does not depend on nuclear weapons. The former USSR had more than enough of them, but however, did not come to its rescue. The future of Ukraine depends on the economic well-being and social stability of our society. If we do overcome the current economic crisis, we will be able to safeguard our independence and inviolability of our borders. Nor will we -- once again with the help from international organizations -- allow anyone to interfere in our internal affairs. I think the time has come -- and a decisive time it is too -- for every one of us present in this hall, to once and for all understand that in order to make a realistic policy, really aimed to protect our vital national interests and those of all ordinary people, one should first of all conscientiously look to reality, weigh up the possibilities, and finally be ready to take serious and responsible decisions. I am (?more than) convinced that it is exactly this decision that Ukraine needs to make today. Thank you for your attention.
