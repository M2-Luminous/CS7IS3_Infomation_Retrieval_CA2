In his opinion, the retargeting of missiles at deserted sea areas, carried out under existing agreements, will not diminish the combat readiness of Russia's nuclear forces. [passage omitted] Gen. Yesin said that all retargeting operations had been completed within agreed deadlines and that they guarantee, as envisaged in the agreements, a reduction of the nuclear danger worldwide. In his words, this act of goodwill and mutual trust does not free the strategic missile forces from the obligation to defend the motherland and to maintain strategic stability on the planet.
