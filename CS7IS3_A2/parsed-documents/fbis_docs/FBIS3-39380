In yesterday evening's interview with TVI, the head of government gave his assurance that there are no cases of corruption being kept under wraps. He avoided speaking about the Totta [Bank]. [passage omitted] Throughout the interview, conducted by journalists Artur Albarran of TVI, Jaime Antunes of the SEMANARIO ECONOMICO, and Luis Delgado of DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, there were many questions which went unanswered, since Cavaco Silva frequently asserted that he or his party had formed no opinion on certain matters. One of the matters left unclarified was that of Cavaco Silva's possible candidacy for the presidency of the republic. The PSD [Social Democratic Party] leader confined himself to repeating that he intends to fulfill his "pledge to the Portuguese people until 1995" -- the year of the legislative elections -- and will decide only afterward "what to do, including returning to academic life." With respect to the current holder of the post, Cavaco maintained that he maintains "completely normal relations" with Mario Soares, despite the political disagreements in several areas, and emphasized the view upheld at the last PSD National Council meeting, that his party should help the current president to complete his term "with dignity." The revision of the Constitution was also raised by the three journalists, with Cavaco Silva citing the section on the electoral laws as one which, in his opinion, needs improvements. "There should be improvements to the Constitution aimed at a better link between the electorate and the elected," he asserted, and to this end he suggested the formation of smaller constituencies. He also maintained that the electoral laws -- for the Assembly of the Republic and for the local authorities -- should "facilitate the formation of majorities." In the legislative elections, "it should be possible for a party to achieve a majority with 39 percent or 40 percent of the votes." He said that "greater effectiveness in municipal administration" is necessary, and advocated the candidacy of independents and groups of citizens. He did not forget the extension to emigrants of the vote for the presidency of the republic -- a PSD "banner" over the past few years. Asked about the revision of the president's powers, he confined himself to repeating: "My party has not defined a stance on that matter." Cavaco also advocated keeping the figure of the minister of the republic -- "I believe that he has made an important contribution to national cohesion and to championing the autonomous regions' interests in the government" -- a statement which must not have pleased his party colleagues in the Azores and Madeira. The economic balance sheet for 1993 took up part of the interview, with Cavaco asserting that economic growth improved in the second half of the year, but acknowledging that "investment remained very depressed." With respect to the devaluation of the escudo, he said that those who advocate it "are advocating unemployment" -- an implicit criticism of [Socialist Party Secretary General] Antonio Guterres. He recalled that "interest rates fell by 5 percent" last year, and added: "I am convinced that they will fall further. The essential thing is to maintain our course." "My major concern is unemployment. It is my major priority," he stated, before asserting: "I was tremendously disappointed not to have achieved social consensus," but he reaffirmed that that this was owing to political reasons. The prime minister said little about the Totta case, claiming that it is a private enterprise, that the government confined itself to enacting the privatization law, and that it now rests with the courts to establish whether it is being observed. At the end of the interview, there was still time for Cavaco to state that in Bosnia "some punitive actions are justified in view of the atrocities."
