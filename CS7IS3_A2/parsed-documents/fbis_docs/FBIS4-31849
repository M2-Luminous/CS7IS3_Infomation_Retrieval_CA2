The association president Nebojsa Tomovic said the census will be just another step towards federalization of Macedonia and meeting the demands of Albanians at the cost of the Serbian population in Macedonia, whose real number is minimized. The association announced an inner census only for the Serbian minority, in order to come up with exact figures of Serbs living in Macedonia.
