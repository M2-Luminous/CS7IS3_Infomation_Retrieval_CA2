A radical change in the panorama of Brazilian telecommunications has begun almost without being noticed. Since last month, two optical-fiber cables installed along the 450-km Dutra Highway have been carrying telephone calls between Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Each cable is as thick as the neck of a beer bottle. In it are the optical fibers--thin glass wires with the diameter of a strand of hair. The new system was designed to carry 124,000 telephone conversations simultaneously, thus quadrupling the capacity for connections between the two cities. Fifteen years behind the developed countries, Brazil has entered the era of long-distance data, sound, and image transmission using the optical system, which is 100 times faster than copper cables and has a useful life twice that of a satellite. "If Brazil had waited a little longer to invest in fiber optics, it would have found it difficult to talk to the rest of the world by the turn of the century," says Eng. Walter de Andrade Carvalho, a respected consultant in Sao Paulo. Fiber optics is a system for transmitting information by means of light signals that began to spread around the world in the late 1970's. Three undersea cable systems are going to link Japan with the West Coast of the United States, and three more will connect the East Coast of the United States with Europe. U.S. President Bill Clinton recently announced the adoption of a plan--called the fiber optics superhighway--to link the chief cities of the United States. Brazil is leagues behind, but the reason for the nation's backwardness in this area is easy to understand. For many years, optical fibers were included in the package of over 100 items whose importation was banned by Brazilian law, and domestic manufacturers were protected by the market reserve established for information technology. For years, Brazilian government-owned telecommunications companies could buy only fibers produced at the ABC Xtal factory in Campinas. Not even Italian-owned Pirelli, which had started producing fibers in Brazil before the market reserve was established, was allowed to bid for government contracts. "We manufactured the fibers here and had to sell them in countries such as Uruguay and Bolivia. Fortunately, that time has passed," says Eng. Ludgero Patarro, director of Pirelli's telecommunications division. Working in partnership with Japan's NEC, which developed the project, Pirelli produced the cables linking Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Optical-fiber triangle: Until last month's inauguration, most of the optical-fiber lines existing in Brazil were urban. They linked stations owned by Embratel, Brazil's government-owned telecommunications company, and located within the same city. There was also a medium-distance line between Sao Paulo and Campinas that had been installed by Telesp, the Sao Paulo telephone company, a few years before. That picture is changing quickly. Next year an optical-fiber triangle linking Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte will be in operation. To complete the two missing sides of the triangle--the links between Belo Horizonte and the two other cities--over 1,000 km of cable will be installed. That stage of the project will cost about $100 million. Last week Embratel began examining competitive bids for the installation of two other lines. The first will link the town of Sao Mateus in Espirito Santo with Porto Seguro in Bahia. The other will link Natal and Fortaleza. Those two sections constitute the land component of a much more ambitious plan. They will be interconnected by a system of undersea cables. Scheduled for completion by the end of 1995 is the Brazilian portion of a project that will link South America with the rest of the world through fiber optics. The entire domestic network is expected to cost $1.4 billion. The only advantage Brazil gains by getting a late start with fiber optics is that it will pay less for its lines. Technology has evolved in recent years, and the fibers are better and less expensive today than they were a decade ago. Ten years ago, it cost exactly $1 to produce one meter of optical fiber. Now the developed countries can produce one meter of fiber for $0.07. It costs Brazilian manufacturers such as ABC Xtal, Pirelli, and Abracel slightly more than that: from $0.10 to $0.11 per meter. At present, any foreign company can participate in competitive bidding in Brazil. The cost of installing a optical-fiber line is relatively low compared to that of a conventional telephone line. Ipanema and Copacabana: A few years ago, the National Highway Department (DNER) installed a system of conduits along the Dutra Highway. Those conduits carried the copper cables for the DNER's internal communications system between Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. To install the optical-fiber line, the only thing necessary was to draw the new cables through those conduits and set up eight automatic relay stations along the way. The relay stations amplify the signals and make it possible for someone in Ipanema to hear the voice of a friend in Sao Paulo more clearly than he would hear a call from Copacabana, an adjoining neighborhood. In future links, the government-owned firm will lay cables one meter deep alongside federal highways and railroads. It will not be necessary to spend money to expropriate land or to build complex civil engineering structures. "Optical fibers do not replace all communication methods, but they are unbeatable in the things that they can do better," says Eng. Gilberto Viana, head of Embratel's Land Communications Department. Satellites are still irreplaceable when it comes to communicating with remote areas such as the Amazon Region. The cost of installing and maintaining an optical-fiber cable through the jungle would be very high in relation to the benefits provided by such a system. Most long-distance telephone connections and all international connections in Brazil are handled by the satellite communication system. When the entire system is in place, 75 percent of the traffic will be carried by the fiber optics system. Business opportunities: The Brazilian subsidiary of the U.S. telecommunications company AT&T estimates that on the day when the system is completely installed, Brazil will be able to double the number of telephone lines with a quality of service superior to that existing now. The country currently has about 12 million lines, and only seven out of every 12 Brazilians have a telephone. That is one of the lowest averages in South America. Besides helping to improve that score, fiber optics will help open up the possibilities for new technologies such as interactive television and multimedia services, which are already being introduced in American homes by means of fibers. "Thanks to fiber optics, telephone lines are no longer limited exclusively to telephone calls; instead, they are starting to be used to transmit a number of different signals," says Adley Alves Pereira of Brazilian AT&T. "They are becoming a two-way channel through which the user can interact with the person sending him the signals." The same optical-fiber line can carry telephone calls, TV pictures, and alarm systems simultaneously. The system also carries messages exchanged between computers located kilometers apart. The installation of those services alone should generate business opportunities estimated to be worth over $1.5 billion annually in the field of connections and new systems. In the United States, all those services are within reach of most of the population. Out of every group of 100 Americans, 60 receive cable TV signals in their homes by way of optical fibers. In Brazil, most of the existing cable TV services use their own networks linked by copper cables. Linking the big cities is the first step in bringing the convenience already enjoyed by Americans closer to Brazilians. After that, it will be necessary to adapt the urban networks to the new system. The amount of money required is tremendous, and it is unlikely that the government-owned system will be able to finance the whole undertaking alone. A number of alternative solutions are being considered, but implementing them will require changes in the Constitution. "The speed at which the country is incorporated into this system will have to be much faster than it is now. Embratel and the telecommunications companies owned by the states cannot afford to improve service at the pace required by Brazil," says Eng. Raul Del Fiol, a telecommunications expert at Promon Engineering. Embratel wanted to invest a total of $4.6 billion this year, but the government ordered a 25-percent cut in the company's budget. "If the law did not prohibit it, private enterprise would have covered the difference and also invested a lot more money in the country," says Del Fiol.
