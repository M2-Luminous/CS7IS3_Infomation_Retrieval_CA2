AL-THAWRAH daily for today editorialised that amidst the sea of the Hebron Mosque martyrs, the whole world stands face to face before the U.S. law unsheathing its sword at the earth nations necks and their rights and dignity. And here is the U.N. Security Council, despite the Palestinians Friday carnage and others shot dead by Zionist soldiers in punishment for expressing their grief on the murdering of their brothers, is still holding unofficial consultations and waiting for formulae that would renew confidence in Israel's government and its ability to tackle the situation "in justice and wisdom". One would wonder, the daily editorial maintains, had this crime been perpetrated by a party other than the Zionist entity, were he to hear similar to this U.S. diplomacy characterised by calmness, or witness speedy international resolutions and military concentrations, let alone pressures and land, air and sea political and economic sanctions.
