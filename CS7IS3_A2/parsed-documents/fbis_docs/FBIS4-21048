In Chapare, thousands of peasant families cultivate coca leaves for meager earnings because the price paid for their product cannot make them rich. The attractive profits remain in the hands of Bolivian, Colombian, and U.S. drug traffickers, especially U.S. traffickers, who distribute the product among consumers. According to official announcements, there are still 1,900 hectares of coca farms to be eradicated--of the 4,500 the previous government had promised to eradicate by 31 March--and it is obvious that in the week before the deadline's expiration it will be impossible to fulfill the promise. Unless there is an intention to provoke a serious confrontation much stronger and more tragic than the ones that already have occurred in the region. This is the most serious and sensitive problem the nation is now confronting. If the Chapare boiler goes off now, the other conflicts underlying Bolivian society will immediately worsen, provoking violence and instability. To avoid this, it is necessary to make all efforts and to be extremely prudent and patriotic. If violence prevails in Chapare, there will be no capitalization, participation, educational reform, or the other proposals. There will be no more democracy, economic growth, and inflation control. The country and all its social sectors would lose their course, and our homeland would become the appropriate stage for the situation that is desired by imperialists and by those who advocate military action: a low-intensity war, rapid deployment tactics, the use of new conventional weapons, and clean, smart bombs. Whoever thinks we are exaggerating should review the course of world events to convince himself. Peaceful and prosperous societies have suddenly been taken over by violence and, obviously, by foreign troops. Peace is for society what freedom is for men: It is not appreciated until it is lost, but while we enjoy it, we do not realize that we are making use of an essential value. President Sanchez de Lozada's timely appeal to the U.S. Government, before Vice President Gore, awakened a clumsy reaction by Mr. Richard Bowers, which Bolivians have unanimously repudiated. He did not use the language of an ambassador, or even of a junior diplomat. It is hoped that his superiors in the State Department will reprimand him because our Foreign Ministry has never dared do it, because of our longstanding weakness. The appropriate thing to do is to outline our position directly to Washington, where Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas might go in search of justice. This is what Chayanta chief Tomas Catari did 200 years ago when he made a long pilgrimage on foot to Buenos Aires to complain to the viceroy about the abuses of Governor Joaquin Alos.
