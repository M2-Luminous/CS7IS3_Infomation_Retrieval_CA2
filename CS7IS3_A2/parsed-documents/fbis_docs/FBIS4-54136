But North Korea, branded as the major security risk in the region because of its alleged nuclear weapons program, did not send a delegation to the annual gathering for the second year in a row. China, Pyongyang's close ally, canceled its participation at short notice, citing the date of the conference as inconvenient. While the organizer, the U.N. Center on Disarmament Affairs, was eager to stress that China's absence "has no political meaning," the prevailing opinion at the conference is that the cancellation is due to the controversy over the nuclear issue. Welcoming the 62 participants, Yoneo Hirata, parliamentary vice foreign minister, pledged that Japan will not aim at becoming a military power. "We reconfirm our basic policy not to turn into a military power, but to develop an active policy of contributing to disarmament," Hirata said. He called on North Korea to dispel suspicion that it plans to build nuclear weapons by fully accepting international inspections of its nuclear facilities. Speaking at the first plenary session on "disarmament through regional dialogue," Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono proposed that all nuclear powers discuss nuclear disarmament at a special conference in Hiroshima next year. Kono urged the atomic powers to show their devotion to nuclear disarmament by concluding a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests by August next year, which marks the 50th anniversary of both the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only cities in the world to have sustained a nuclear attack, and the establishment of the United Nations. Discussions at the conference are expected to focus on the promotion of security in the Asia-Pacific region and on the extension of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which comes up for renewal in 1995. In the past, the 1968 international treaty, which aims at curbing the spread of nuclear weapons and fissionable material to nonnuclear countries, has been extended for five-year periods. The nuclear powers, first of all the United States, have proposed to extend the NPT indefinitely, an approach opposed by many nonnuclear states on the grounds that such a move would perpetuate the nuclear "club" of Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S. After the end of the official part of the conference Friday, the participants, including New Zealand's minister for disarmament and arms control, Douglas Graham, and Russia's Ednan Agayev, director of analysis forecasting at the Foreign Ministry, are scheduled to meet with A-bomb survivors at a public symposium. Earlier in the day, the disarmament experts visited the Peace Memorial Museum and prayed at the memorial cenotaph for victims of the atomic bombing in Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park. Similar meetings have been held every year in Japan since Kyoto hosted the first session in 1989. This year's conference is the sixth of its kind.
