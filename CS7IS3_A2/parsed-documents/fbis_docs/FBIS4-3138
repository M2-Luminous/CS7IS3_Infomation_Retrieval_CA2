On the evening of 10 April and the afternoon of 11 April, as demanded by Yasushi Akashi, UN special envoy to former Yugoslavia, U.S. fighter planes carried out air strikes against Serbian military positions around Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina. These were the first NATO air strikes against Serbian ground military targets since the outbreak of the war in Bosnia- Herzegovina two years ago, and they were important NATO military operations. Gorazde was one of the six Muslim "protection zones" declared by the UN Security Council last year. The UN peace-keeping force maintains that it has the right to protect these zones so that "they will not come under armed attack by any side." This time NATO carried out air strikes against Serbian positions on these grounds. After the air strikes, the Bosnian Serbs accused the UN peacekeeping force of "opposing the Serbs," announced the suspension of all their contacts with the UN peacekeepers, and canceled their prescheduled meeting with the U.S. special envoys. People fear that this NATO move will affect the UN peacekeeping force's neutral position in the Bosnian war and produce an unfavorable impact on the UN role in mediating the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. Russian President Yeltsin has criticized the United States, saying that it had no right to unilaterally decide on the air strikes and that this should have been submitted to the Security Council for discussion. U.S. President Clinton has said that U.S. planes would carry out air strikes again if necessary. The dissensions between the United States and Russia on the Bosnia- Herzegovina issue have worsened further. People have noted that, over the last two months, due to Russian mediation, NATO delayed the plan on bombing Sarajevo, and the Serbs opened the Tuzla airport. So Russia's right to speak on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue had grown markedly stronger. Evidently, NATO's current air strikes possibly have more political than military significance. These air strikes seemed to send out a dual signal: One is that "bombardment" will be used to bring about talks and force the Serbs to make concessions on the territorial issue; the other suggests to Russia that the United States and NATO are keeping the initiative in the Bosnian situation. After the outbreak of the Sarajevo crisis in February, a new trend appeared in the peace talks on the Bosnian issue and some hope for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina glimmered in people's minds. In this situation, NATO's current "bombardment" is unlikely to bring about peace; instead, they will possibly affect the peace process. In addition, various foreign powers are coming onto the stage from behind the scenes on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. On the one hand, this will help encourage the conflicting parties to participate in the peace talks; on the other, as their dissensions and contradictions become apparent, Bosnia-Herzegovina's peace process may become more complicated.
