FBIS4-6071 "dreas074__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-074-A Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Air Accord Avoids Territorial Issue With ROK Air Accord Avoids Territorial Issue With ROK OW1304140594 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 13 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1304140594 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] A government source disclosed on 12 April that, in connection with concluding the "Prevention of Accidental Incidents Treaty" with the ROK, the Japanese Government plans to make no reference to the airspace around Takeshima in the treaty. In response to suspected nuclear arms development in the DPRK (North Korea), both governments hope to reach an agreement on the treaty under which either nation will be required to give advance notice of flight plans by its military aircraft. Currently, there exists a territorial dispute between the two nations over Takeshima. Japan and the ROK plan to conclude the treaty to prevent accidents that could occur between Japanese and ROK aircraft on missions in Tsushima airspace, where Japanese and ROK air defense identification zones (ADIZ) overlap. However, there remains a problem as to how the two nations plan to deal with Takeshima, over which there is a territorial dispute. So far, Japan has not dared to send off its military aircraft on missions around this island as it arouse the territorial issue. Thus, the area has been treated in the same manner as the northern territories, being set aside as a sort of gray zone in connection with defense-related matters. In the process of concluding the agreement, the Japanese Government has decided to follow its past tradition, planning not to mention Takeshima in the treaty for the time being and to only ask for prior notification of planned flights over the Tsushima Straits, where both nation's military aircraft frequently fly over.
