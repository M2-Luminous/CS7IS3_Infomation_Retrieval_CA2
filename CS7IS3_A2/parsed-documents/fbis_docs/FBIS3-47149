Quoting an official working with the Japanese delegation to the talks, the paper said that if the meeting were actually resumed, the time would most likely be some time in February shortly before or after the third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level talks expected to take place next month. The report said North Korea expressed the willingness to return to the talks during the visit to Pyongyang by Hajime Fukata, a Dietman and organization director of the Japan Socialist Party, late last year. Fukata had talks with Hwang Chang-yop, North Korean Workers' (Communist) Party international affairs director, during his stay in Pyongyang. The normalization talks were last held in November 1992 in Beijing when the meeting broke up after Japan demanded a probe to determine whether a woman named "Yi Un-hoe" who allegedly taught Japanese language to terrorist Kim Hyon-hui was a Japanese woman.
