FBIS4-51559 "dreas084_a_94026" FBIS-EAS-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Chief Cabinet Secretary on Hata Cabinet's Tasks Chief Cabinet Secretary on Hata Cabinet's Tasks OW0105213194 OW0105213194 BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in Japanese at 2258 GMT on 30 April, during its "News 2001" program, broadcasts a live 26-minute panel discussion with newly-appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai. The discussion is moderated by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Tomomi Seki; political commentator Kenichi Takemura and Keio University Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi also participate. Kuroiwa first asks how Kumagai views the received opinion that the Hata cabinet will be short-lived. Kumagai says people tend to express sympathy, rather than congratulations, to him for assuming the post of the chief government spokesman, when they believe that current political conditions are the worst ever. However, he says: "I am resolved to work to extract politics from worst-case scenarios." When asked what the top priority task for the new government is, Kumagai mentions political reform and stresses the importance of continuing reform efforts. He says: "I believe completing political reform is the most important task for Prime Minister Hata." He adds: "Finally, administrative and economic reforms have also started. Reform is not merely a word on everybody's lips, but is something to be achieved for Japan to continue to exist." Next, Kuroiwa asks for Kumagai's comments on people's criticism that the new cabinet lineup was decided on only by Hata, Kumagai, and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa. Kumagai denies the allegation, saying that Prime Minister Hata heard the opinions of many other people before forming the new cabinet. He then says it was inevitable for Hata to give many cabinet posts to Shinseito and Komeito [Clean Government Party] since the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the largest among the ruling parties, has left the ruling coalition. Next, they discuss the issue of summoning to the Diet former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's secretaries as witnesses to investigate the scandal involving Hosokawa's receipt of a loan from a private company. Kumagai says he thinks Hosokawa has already assumed political responsibility for the stalled Diet business caused by prolonged arguments over his loan, noting: "It is not a matter for the Hata cabinet to decide how the issue should be handled." But he predicts that Hosokawa's former secretaries may be summoned to the Diet. They turn to the issue of worsening trade ties with the United States. Takemura says if the new government can ease trade friction between the two countries over the next two months, it will be a great achievement. Also, while showing the results of his survey of Diet members on an indirect tax hike, Professor Kobayashi says it is very important for Japan to decide whether to implement the tax hike and bring the decision to a Japan-U.S. summit meeting to be held immediately before the Naples summit in July. The survey shows that 48 percent of Diet members questioned support the tax hike, while 25.4 percent oppose it. After hearing this, Kumagai notes that the coalition platform agreed upon by the ruling parties and the SDPJ includes a plan to implement the tax hike, saying: "In the process of working out specific measures to implement the hike, we will tenaciously work to persuade the SDPJ to return to the coalition to carry out the policy platform with us." Turning to the DPRK nuclear issue, Kuroiwa notes it is highly possible that if the United Nations Security Council [UNSC] fails to adopt a resolution, Washington will independently decide on economic sanctions against North Korea and ask Japan and South Korea to participate as well. Kuroiwa then asks Kumagai how Japan will respond to the U.S. call. Kumagai first expresses the hope that the worst-case scenario be avoided in dealing with the DPRK nuclear issue. He then stresses that since negotiations between North Korea and the international community to resolve the issue are in progress, he would like to refrain from commenting on this issue. He says: "Because I am a government official, I cannot comment on this at present. Also, I cannot comment because we are now closely watching how Pyongyang will respond [to the UNSC statement calling on the DPRK to accept full inspections], which is due in early May." Asked about the flagging economy, Kumagai says: "Frankly speaking, I think it will take some time before we feel that the economy is picking up, since the after-effects of the bursting of the bubble economy still exist. But I believe the economy has passed through its worst stage." Concerning a possible alliance with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], Kumagai says: "It may be possible for the coalition to establish a grand union with the LDP if both sides can agree on policies." But he stresses the importance of forming an alliance with the SDPJ first, saying: "We have to think about the SDPJ first. Because of our mistake, the party had to leave the coalition. So, we will keep our door open to them." Noting that the enactment of bills on new constituency boundaries for the House of Representatives is necessary to hold the next general election under the new electoral system, which is a combination of single seat constituencies and proportional representation, Kobayashi asks Kumagai when he think these bills will be enacted. Kumagai says: "It may be difficult to have them passed before the end of May. At any rate, the coalition platform says that the bills should be enacted before the end of the current Diet session." In the end, Kumagai says that while emphasizing cooperation, the Hata cabinet will continue to uphold the torch of reform.
