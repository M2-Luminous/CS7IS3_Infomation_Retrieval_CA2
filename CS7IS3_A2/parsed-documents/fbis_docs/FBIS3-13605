In an article today, the paper adds: The world community has realized that the malicious colonialist tactics are part of an endless game, and that the only thing that can stop this game is the determination of peoples who choose their own way to ensure their own survival -- not just their physical survival, but the survival that epitomizes loftiness, dignity, and continued defiance. The paper notes Iraq's declared position on the need to halt the farces being led by the U.S. Administration to exterminate peoples, saying that international organizations must halt their evil approach, shoulder their responsibilities humanely, and refrain from submission. These organizations, the paper adds, must honor the actual texts that grant peoples the right to live in peace and dignity, and safeguard their sovereignty. These texts also stipulate that peoples' investments and rights must be guaranteed so that their future generations may survive and lead a free and decent life. The paper adds: Given these ethical and reasonable tenets agreed on by world peoples and enshrined in international laws and rules of conduct, the UN Security Council [UNSC] and the United Nations do not have any excuse for the perpetuation of the embargo against Iraq, particularly since Iraq has underscored its commitment to these laws. The UNSC does not have any excuse for bending and yielding before the U.S. whip. AL-QADISIYAH goes on to say: The unfair embargo resolution, the epitome of falsehood and deception that flouts man's dignity, is no longer acceptable to conscientious people. The paper concludes by saying that the statements made by His Excellency President Saddam Husayn regarding the pursuit of a new approach to ensure our own salvation as we deem fit reflect the only option we have left. This option is the option of faith that will lead to victory, the paper maintains.
