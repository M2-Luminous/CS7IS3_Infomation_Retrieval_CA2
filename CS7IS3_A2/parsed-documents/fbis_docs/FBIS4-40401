The mention of Vladimir Kvasov, the government chief of staff, in direct connection with the problem of corruption is one of the sensational statements Yeltsin made during his recent press conference. There have been many rumors, being increasingly confirmed, about the influence Kvasov has gained in the power structures. Correspondingly, his now inevitable fall could reshape the pattern of connections between members of the staff and affect the moods of those holding a number of high positions. True, it is not clear if all this may lead to official or closed proceedings, as it is not clear from the statement what Kvasov is guilty of: making incompetent decisions that gave a free hand to corrupt officials, or deliberately conniving with them. It is also tempting to explain the president's statement in terms of the desire to keep Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin "under control." However, the presidential initiative was clearly agreed with the premier: A conflict between Chernomyrdin and Kvasov who was trying to play his own cards and to gradually take the staff from under the premier's influence had long been brewing. Besides, Yeltsin vigorously denied rumors of Chernomyrdin's probable resignation, stating: "I'm not going to surrender Chernomyrdin." Still questions remain. First, the president used the same phrase about Gaydar well-nigh on the eve of the latter's quitting as premier. Second, it is not clear who Chernomyrdin should have been "surrendered" to. Unlike Gaydar, whose head was demanded on all sides, Viktor Stepanovich's position is firm, so the natural question is who is out to "get" him?
