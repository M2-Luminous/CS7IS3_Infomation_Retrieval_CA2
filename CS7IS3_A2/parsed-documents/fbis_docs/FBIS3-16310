Ritums Rozenbergs, Latvian Radio Moscow correspondent and the LABRIT newspaper, will tell us more. [Rozenbergs] This morning, the Latvian and Russian delegations considered texts of the agreement. The delegations agreed that additional consultations were needed on certain issues. As a result of the meeting held this morning, both the Russian and Latvian sides hope that the social security issue for Russian military pensioners will be tackled. However, findings of banks' experts are needed in order to reach this agreement. So then, it is necessary to clarify the mechanism of the payment of pensions. On the issue of the Skrunda military base the delegations decided at the morning meeting that the text of the agreement would be acceptable for both sides. The Russian delegation has not yet given final consent in connection with the fact that a rent payment of 400 million dollars a year, demanded by the Latvian side, is under question. The Latvian side expresses the wish that several agreements favorable to Latvia could be reached. Ritums Rozenbergs, special Moscow correspondent of the LABRIT newspaper, specially for Latvian radio.
