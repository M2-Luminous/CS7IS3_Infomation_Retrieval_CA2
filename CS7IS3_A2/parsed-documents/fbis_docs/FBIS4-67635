This was in contrast to April, 1992, when more than 1,600 patients were in two-year queues for hospital treatment, she said. Her claim was challenged by Labour who said official figures showed there were 412 people listed as waiting more than two years -- a claim later confirmed by the Department of Health. Mrs Bottomley said that nearly 75 per cent of patients were seen within three months and 98 per cent within a year. Even better progress was being made in some parts of the country such as Merseyside where no patients waited for more than a year. She was welcoming the second Citizen's Charter report which compares NHS performance in the three months up to Dec 31 with performance in the three months up to March 31, 1993. It shows cuts in waiting times for urgent cases in accident and emergency units. Patients assessed immediately on arrival rose from 74 per cent to 83 per cent. The first NHS tables will be published in the summer highlighting how each hospital and ambulance service performed.
