(JAL) to operate a charter flight Thursday [17 March] from Sendai, northern Japan, to Hawaii after Washington delayed permission to JAL for regular flights on the route, the Transport Ministry said. Washington decided to postpone permission for JAL's weekly flights from Sendai to Honolulu, prompting protest from the Japanese airline which had planned to launch the new route on Thursday afternoon. JAL immediately asked the United States to allow it to operate a charter flight to Hawaii to carry 275 passengers who already have booked the seats on the scheduled flight. JAL will use an airplane of its subsidiary Japan Air Charter for the flight to Hawaii. Ministry officials said Wednesday that the United States has not given an explanation for the postponement of approval for the regular flights, but said it is probably a response to Japan's refusal to expand "beyond rights" for U.S. airlines flying to Japan that allow them to extend their routes to third countries.
