This unbelievable passivity includes business, in which Ukrainian interests are by-and-large limited to narrow consumerism. "Go with the flow", "don't rock the boat," "don't look for trouble" and "don't think too much" are aphorisms that fit such people. This general apathy is the reason that other nationalities are beginning to dominate all new businesses and commercial enterprises. This fact of life sharply differentiates Ukraine from other countries and a fact of life that Ukrainian politicians have to live with. In practical terms this means that a small well-organized and determined group can take over Ukraine if it is dynamic enough. There is no need to bother with moral support from the Ukrainian masses. The latter will follow once they feel they are being adequately governed. The formation of a society always depends on a strong center of power, be it an individual or an organization, that has demonstrated a will to rule and organize. What are the main political groups in Ukraine today? We hear mostly about democrats, nationalists or communists. What do they want? (Unfortunately, little is said about liberals and Russian chauvinists.) There is much confusion about what they want and, in fact, about differences among them. This is largely due to misuse of terminology and a deliberate attempt by some politicians to obfuscate things rather than speak openly about their views. Nevertheless, we shall attempt to clarify matters. Every political group has an ideology that represents a value system and gives the group its name. Democrats value the concept of democracy as the greatest good, i.e., a state of tolerance of various viewpoints. Communists value the concept of the commune as the greatest good, i.e., communality, equality, and sharing. Nationalists value the concept of the nation, i.e., preservation and protection of the national and cultural existence of a people. Are these values contradictory and require a confrontation? Even if between the democrats and communists there is some degree of dissonance because of democratic tolerance and communist mandatory sharing of property, there should be no disagreement between communists and nationalists since their main values are not contradictory. Yet nationalists and communists are perceived as diametrically opposed forces. Why should communists struggle with nationalists? After all, the most important thing to the communists is a communist society and to the nationalists a national Ukrainian state. The latter concentrate on statehood and the former on social order. The nationalists are unconcerned about the social order and the communists about Ukrainian statehood, In short, there is no rational basis for a conflict between the nationalists and communists and they could cooperate in founding a communist Ukrainian state. Even the democrats could participate in this venture without too much trouble since a national state does not preclude democracy. In addition, the philosophy of tolerance allows the democrats to reach an understanding with the communists. In theory, all three groups could accommodate each other to some extent in Ukraine. But reality is something else, and we see an uncompromising confrontation between communists on the one hand and the democrats and nationalists on the other. But the struggle in Ukraine is not for democracy or communism or an analogous philosophy, but for the very notion of statehood for the Ukrainian nation. In addition to democratic principles, the democrats advocate national statehood which to them is just as important as democracy and for that reason they have been called national-democrats. The communists propose--more-or-less openly--liquidation of Ukrainian independence and resuscitation of the Russian-communist empire known as the USSR. In this they are in agreement with the Russian chauvinists who long for a Russian empire regardless of its social order. The key question is whether communism or the Russian empire is the real preference of the communists in Ukraine. If communism is their primary goal then liberals, advocates of individual freedom and private property, should be their primary adversary. But that is not the case. The communists have targeted nationalists and national-democrats--not liberals or garden-variety democrats--as their primary enemies, i.e., advocates of the Ukrainian national statehood. Accordingly, since their primary goal is the liquidation of Ukrainian statehood and renewal of the Russian empire, they are better identified as Russian communists/chauvinists rather than as simply communists. It is imperative that we have a clear understanding of the political goals of every movement in order to understand the social processes occurring in Ukraine. Any confusion as to the orientation of the key players can have catastrophic consequences. Every citizen of Ukraine should understand that the struggle in Ukraine is not about democracy, communism, capitalism, etc., but for the very existence of Ukraine and the Ukrainian nation. The political forces in Ukraine are divided into only two groups: for and against national statehood. The first category encompasses nationalists, national-democrats and other political movements (including Marxists) who support Ukrainian national independence. The second category is made up of communists or, more accurately, communists/chauvinists or simply Russian chauvinists and others who want to destroy Ukrainian independence. Since the very existence of Ukrainian statehood is at stake we must take care not to be distracted by secondary issues such as democracy, communism, market economy, etc., at the risk of losing our independence. The people have to be educated to defend the Ukrainian state against its enemies and not dissipate their energies struggling against communism or for democracy, capitalism or even Christian ideals. Ukrainian independence must be the primary goal for which we struggle. Other considerations are important but take a back seat when Ukrainian existence is at risk.
