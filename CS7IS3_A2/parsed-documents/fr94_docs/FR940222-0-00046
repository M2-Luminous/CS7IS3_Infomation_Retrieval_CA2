FR940222-0-00046 FR940222-0-00015 Background and Purpose The Coraopolis Highway Bridge at mile 9.6 on the Ohio River back channel between Coraopolis, Pennsylvania and Neville Island, Pennsylvania is no longer an active highway bridge and must be removed. The bridge consists of several small spans that are located over land and two 300 foot main spans that cross over the waterway and meet atop a stone pier at the center of the channel. As part of the overall bridge removal operation, each main span will be demolished with seven simultaneously detonated explosive charges. The first main span demolition will occur at approximately 9:00 a.m. on February 14, 1994 for Span # 3 on the left descending bank (Coraopolis side) of the back channel. Since this explosive demolition will pose obvious hazards to vessels in the area, vessel traffic will be prohibited from entering the Ohio River back channel from mile 9.3 to mile 9.9 during the day of the demolition. The second main span demolition for Span # 4 on the right descending bank (Neville Island side) of the back channel is scheduled for approximately 9 a.m. on February 28, 1994. Steel members and debris from the demolition of Span # 4 will fall into the sailing line of the channel, creating an unsafe condition for vessels attempting to transit. The contractor will immediately commence clearing operations in the channel, but it will require 4 days to restore the navigability of this section of the Ohio River back channel. Accordingly, no vessel traffic will be permitted in the safety zone extending from Ohio River back channel mile 9.3 to mile 9.9 during this second demolition and subsequent channel clearing operations from 8 a.m. on February 28, 1994 to 4 p.m. on March 4, 1994. For the remaining period that this safety zone is in effect, vessel traffic will be permitted to proceed without restriction with vessels transmitting the bridge site along the sailing line of the channel. In the event of unanticipated delays involving the demolitions discussed above, the Captain of the Port Pittsburgh will notify the marine community of schedule changes affecting the duration of vessel traffic restrictions within the safety zone via marine Safety Information Radio Broadcasts on VHF Marine Band Radio, Channel 22 (157.1 MHz) and via on site broadcast advisors on Channel 13 (156.650 MHz). Regulatory Evaluation This rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979), it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information requirements. A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal due to the relatively short duration of vessel traffic restrictions, the relatively small size of the area regulated, and the infrequency of commercial vessel transits along this section of Ohio River back channel. Federalism Assessment Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation as an action required to protect public safety.
