A statement from the director of Army public relations says the level of participation and the manner in which the weeklong exercise was conducted showed that it was a preparation by France to eventually intervene on the side of Cameroon should the Bakassi dispute escalate. The statement said about 544 officers including four colonels, two lieutenant colonels, and three majors left France with a lot of sophisticated armament and weapon systems for the exercise, and that some of the weapons were left in Benin Republic at the end, parts of which could be diverted to Cameroon for possible use against Nigeria. The Army says that military observers from neighboring countries including Nigeria, who were invited to witness the exercise, were not given any chance to see the arms and equipment used but were encouraged in tourism and ceremonial matters. The statement points out what it called the clandestine and questionable role of France in the Nigeria-Cameroon problem as against Nigeria's genuine efforts toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
