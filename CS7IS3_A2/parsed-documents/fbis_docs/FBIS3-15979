Trade unions want the government and the parliament to ensure the payment of wages detained in state-operated enterprises. The payments should be performed by May 1, the appeal said. Unionists also suggest that the minimum monthly wages should be fixed at 58 lats to comply with the actual subsistence minimum. The crisis minimum should be 33 lats per month. Deputies, however, said it was impossible to increase the minimum wages in the near future because the motion would require revision of the entire state budget. Saeima is also unable to guarantee the payment of the detained wages by the required date. The issue of wages is closely linked to the bankruptcy and liquidation of state sector businesses, said committee member Anna Seile. Saeima has passed two legislations ruling that payroll payments are priority obligations when an enterprise is liquidated.
