Foreign Aerospace Firms Provide One-Third of the Orders for the Largest Aviation Scientific Research Institute"] [Text] The TsAGI (Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute) in Zhukovskiy in the Moscow region and its Moscow affiliate in the former USSR carried out virtually all the theoretical work and static tests of aviation technology. The institute has an entirely modern and the world's largest ensemble of wind tunnels (more than 60) for the wind tunnel testing of aircraft and their models. Now, when orders from the principal client, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, have ceased, the volume of these tests has been reduced by a factor of three. Research related to the Buran spaceship, for which TsAGI had constructed unique test stands such as even NASA does not have, has been stopped in its tracks. Nevertheless, today the institute is supplied with resources adequate for carrying out research, development, testing and engineering work at the very highest technical level (40% of the TsAGI orders are received from the Russian space and defense industry, the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy and the Russian Space Agency, 27-30% of the work is funded by agreements with aviation design bureaus and the rest is earned by filling orders from foreign aerospace companies). Among the foreign partners the first place is occupied by the Boeing Corporation, with which the institute has been cooperating since 1991. Major orders have been placed by French, but also by German, Indian, Japanese, South Korean and British companies (research on the An-226 "Mriya-Hotol" aerospace transport system has already been carried out in collaboration with British Aerospace for more than 2.5 years). Cooperation with Chinese enterprises is developing in three directions: testing of models of civilian aircraft, modernization of the aerodynamic base of the Chinese People's Republic, reoutfitting of plants producing helicopters. In the words of German Zagaynov, TsAGI director, there is an extremely high probability that some foreign producers of passenger aircraft will turn to the institute for carrying out tests and certifications of those planes which may be in demand in the Russian market. The TsAGI also is developing industrial equipment for agriculture, fuel and energy complex branches, medicine and metallurgy. Solar cells for the heating of cottages enjoy a great demand. The institute has served as an organizer for establishing the "Regional Scientific-Industrial Association of the Southeast Moscow Region," which is concerned with the conversion of defense technologies. It is proposed that it will include aerospace enterprises located at Zhukovskiy, Ramenskoye, Lyubertsy, Lytkarino, Reutovo and Balashikha. Telephone: TsAGI: (095) 556-42-05
