The resolution is illegal, says Mr. Guzman, who recognizes only the authority of the head of the executive for the convening of a national conference: [Begin recording, in Creole] Only the executive power, jointly with parliament, has the right to convene a national conference. I therefore declare that all they have done and all the resolutions they have adopted are null and void. That is why we in the PRH call for mobilization of the entire Haitian people of the nine geographic departments to denounce these people who know very well that they are only aggravating the situation. The essential solution to the crisis resides in the agreement signed on Governors Island between President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and General Raoul Cedras. [end recording]
