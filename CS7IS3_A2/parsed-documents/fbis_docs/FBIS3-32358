Although Gen. Corado deplored the murder of Salvadoran bodyguard Crecensio Diaz, he said that in his opinion the U.S. Embassy acted in accordance with the Vienna Convention articles that regulate diplomatic relations. Nevertheless, Corado added, diplomatic immunity does not mean that embassy officials cannot be punished according to the laws of their own countries when they commit a crime. [Begin Corado recording] The Salvadoran Government has the right to remain vigilant in this case and demand from the U.S. Government, which represents U.S. interests, that Maj. Lopez be judged according to U.S. laws in an impartial trial. [end recording] According to Corado, if Maj. Lopez left the country in a U.S. aircraft, it could not be intercepted, because the personnel and the infrastructure, including ground vehicles and air vessels of foreign missions, are also protected by diplomatic immunity. [Begin Corado recording] Extraterritoriality exists in embassies, aircraft, or any other type of vehicle owned by the embassy. Therefore, whenever a foreign citizen or diplomatic official is aboard an embassy aircraft, car, or any type of vehicle, it is as if he were in his own country. [end recording] On another subject, regarding the fact that many Central American countries are reorganizing their armies, Corado said that the Salvadoran Armed Forces are not opposed to changes as adjustments consonant with the current situation in the country can be made.
