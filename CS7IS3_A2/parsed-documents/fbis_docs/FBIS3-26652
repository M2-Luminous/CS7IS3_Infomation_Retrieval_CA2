On the surface, this was because the channel violated the satellite television transmission management rules. In fact, this was because the sports programs broadcast by the Central Television Station met with a challenge. The sports channel of Beijing Cable Television was originally designed to relay the sports events broadcast by the United States' ESPN, and the channel broadcast programs from noon to 0300 next morning every day. Although the Central Television Station has also broadcast overseas sports events for a long time, it mainly broadcasts recorded and edited programs, so its effects were not as attractive as the live broadcasting via satellite by the cable television channel. The sports-loving audience was attracted to the cable television channel, and this threatened the programs broadcast by the Central Television Station. So it exerted pressure on Beijing Television through the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television of the State Council. It is learned that because the Central Television Station is directly subordinate to the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television of the State Council, while Beijing Television is subordinate to the Beijing Municipal Government, the lower-level local institution cannot match the power of the upper-level central institution. In such circumstances, the sports channel of Beijing Television which relays live broadcasts of overseas sports events was suspended on the grounds that the relay was not approved and thus violated the satellite television programs management rules. Last August, Chinese mainland authorities promulgated the rules on managing satellite transmitted television programs, which prohibit people and institutions from installing satellite television antennas to receive foreign satellite programs without the approval of the authorities concerned. Those who violate this rule may be fined 5,000 yuan. A few days before the suspension of Beijing Cable Television's sports channel, the screen continuously printed the State Council's order on suspending the broadcasting of the channel. Because the suspension was an abrupt action, the cable television station did not give any explanation.
