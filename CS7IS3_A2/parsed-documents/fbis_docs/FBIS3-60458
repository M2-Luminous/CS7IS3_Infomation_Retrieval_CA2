[passage omitted] The Khomeyni Hospital in Tabriz, which is affiliated with the Tabriz University, was reportedly bought for 650 million tumans and privatized by several bazaar merchants. The public sector is operating only a small part of the hospital at a very low cost. It is said that there are no specialists or doctors in this public sector, which is being run by interns, and that when a patient in the private ward complains about costs, he is sent to the public ward, where prices are low. [passage omitted] Recently, the sale of kidneys in Iran and in the provinces has increased. In relation with this, children are sometimes kidnapped and their kidneys removed and sold. In some cases, children have been killed and in others, a child is kidnapped for a week and released after one of his kidneys has been removed. This has resulted in great insecurity for children, particularly in Tehran, where parents must take their children to and from school.
