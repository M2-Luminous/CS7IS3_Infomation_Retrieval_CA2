Expressing his private opinion in a speech over Russian television on Saturday, he said that, since Ukraine did not join the CIS Treaty on Collective Security, it should be given one-eleventh part of the fleet. The rest of the fleet should be used to protect the CIS interests in the Black Sea area. Shaposhnikov also suggested that if any CIS country is unable to finance its part of the fleet, it can hand it over under the control of any other CIS country and receive for it a compensation in the form of oil, coal and other minerals.
