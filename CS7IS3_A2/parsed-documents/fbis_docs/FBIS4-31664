The approval of new FNM statutes was necessary because the amendment to the law on large-scale privatization from the beginning of this year substantially changes the FNM's legal status. At the same time, the deputies approved an amendment to the law on bankruptcy and settlement, under which the FNM's property is excluded from the law's jurisdiction. In a secret ballot, the deputies then elected the ninth and last member of the FNM Presidium. It is Emil Hubinak, who had been nominated by the Democratic Union. Blazej Krasnovsky, candidate of the Christian Democratic Movement, was elected chairman of the FNM Supervisory Board, and Gregor Danisovic (candidate of the Party of the Democratic Left) and Jan Lukacik (candidate of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) were elected out of 11 candidates as members of the FNM Supervisory Board.
