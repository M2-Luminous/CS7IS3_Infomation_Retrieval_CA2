The political decision has been made; it remains to be seen what means will be used. Marines, the BMI [Mixed Independent Brigade], and a warship are the greatest probabilities. The Portuguese Armed Forces could soon integrate with some existing European forces within the Western European Union (WEU). At least this is the political intent of the Ministry of Defense and should be communicated shortly to our partners in that alliance. The indication of the specific units which Portugal intends to make available will be reserved for a later phase. For now, three types of means are being considered: the marines, a warship (essentially a frigate), and the Mixed Independent Brigade (BMI). The marines would join the Anglo-Dutch amphibious brigade; the ship would be assigned to the nonpermanent air-sea force in the Mediterranean; and the BMI would join the land unit which Italy made available for the above-mentioned air-sea force. According to the same studies, the Air Force is the only branch that is not included in the Defense Ministry's international plans. We Are Present Although our Armed Forces have not yet acquired the financial and operational capacity to join with these three European forces, the Portuguese Government wants to immediately establish a political position within the WEU. At this time, Portugal is one of the few countries, such as Luxembourg, which are not participating or have not yet manifested a political will to participate in these new international forces. Given this situation, Portugal has practically no influence on the destinies of the WEU. Hence the strategy of the Defense Ministry is to state that it wishes to be present. The means by which it will do so will be discussed later. Incidentally, many other countries have followed the same strategy: First state a position and then negotiate calmly. According to a source in the Defense Ministry, "when one compares the political statements of the various European governments with what happens in practice, one is always surprised." There is the case, for example, of Spain, which announced some months ago, with pomp and circumstance, that it would send a brigade to the Eurocorps, but in practice has only made a battalion available. Explanation Meanwhile, it might be asked if Portugal is interested in the establishment of a real European defense identity, since this is what is being created with the appearance of the aforementioned multinational forces. To better understand this question, let us see how this said European defense identity was actually born. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the consequent reunification of Germany, the weight of the new country in Europe became a source of concern for numerous commentators and also, privately, for many politicians. Would Germany now go its own way? This was the question everyone was asking. Naturally, for historical reasons, the country most troubled by the new strategic situation was France. In a strategy of "flight to the front," Francois Mitterrand sought to find a way to bind Germany to its former allies. Within this strategy, the idea emerged to turn the Franco-German brigade into a real army corps of 35,000 to 40,000 men, "a large unit with a European vocation, which would aid in giving the European Union its own military capacity" and which would be open to other West European countries. And this came to pass at the La Rochelle summit, on 21 and 22 May 1992, which brought together Francois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl. The creation of this embryo of the future European army did not sit at all well with some partners in the Atlantic Alliance: the United States, England, and the Netherlands, all Atlantic countries. To these countries, said army corps constituted a threat to the preservation of trans-Atlantic ties, considering that France, the godfather of the idea, had always argued that, in matters of defense, Europe should be truly independent of the United States. Between Nato and the WEU Under pressure from their partners, which included discussions between Washington and Bonn, France and Germany felt an obligation to offer an explanation. In their understanding, the Eurocorps was simply a way for Europe to publicly manifest its willingness to make a greater contribution to the security and defense of the Old Continent -- which the United States had long advocated. However, the political explanation was not sufficient to put the Atlantic countries at ease. In December of the same year, during a NATO summit, the countries of the Eurocorps announced that the joint army would be under the operational tutelage of the Saceur [Supreme Allied Commander Europe] (NATO's European ground command) in the event of a crisis. This was sufficient to clear the air. But the danger of the growing hegemony of the continental countries in matters of European defense was not yet completely allayed. Hence England and the Netherlands decided to place their amphibious brigade in the military structure of the WEU, in an attempt to downgrade the importance of the Eurocorps, which until then was the only adequately organized force. From that moment on, other multinational forces began to be integrated within the WEU. This is the case of the multinational division formed by Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, and the air-sea force, comprising naval and air components from France, Italy, and Spain. Portugal on Sidelines In all this, Portugal remained on the sidelines. In the first phase of the process, the position of Cavaco Silva's government was understandable. As an Atlantic country, Portugal should make every effort to see that, in matters of European defense, the transatlantic ties would not be broken. And, obviously, the isolated existence of the Eurocorps in the military structure of the WEU was contributing to bring that about. But when other military entities with a strong Atlantic component began to appear within the WEU, it became necessary for Portugal to take a position, particularly considering that, at the last NATO summit meeting, the United States itself had encouraged the Europeans to create those forces. Accordingly, Portugal has made a political decision: Our Armed Forces will join some of the already existing European forces. By what means, it remains to be seen. And this is where the problems start to arise. Let us begin with the marines. As O INDEPENDENTE learned, the Portuguese military have already had contacts with their British counterparts regarding the possible integration of our marines in the Anglo-Dutch amphibious brigade. Although there had been preliminary discussions, it soon appeared that the British were not too enthusiastic about the Portuguese offer. The reason is simple. Portugal has only men to offer. Our marines do not have landing craft, much less launching platforms, which means that the "fuzos" [marines] would have to hitch a ride with the British. There is also a problem with regard to the naval craft for the Mediterranean air-sea force. According to our sources, the Navy does not have the financial capacity to maintain two frigates in operation in international fleets. It is noted that Portugal already makes a frigate available to the Stanavforlant [Standing Naval Force Atlantic] fleet. The same can be said with regard to the BMI. Considering the Army budget in recent years, it is almost unbelievable that this branch has the financial capacity to permit its brigade to take part in exercises in Italy. In other words, there are "small details" which could make it difficult to carry out the Defense Ministry politics -- for example, to seek to turn the Armed Forces into an instrument of the foreign policy of the state -- with the means which the government makes available to the military. Not to say that the emperor has no clothes.
