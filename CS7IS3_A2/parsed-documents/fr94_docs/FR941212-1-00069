FR941212-1-00069 FR941212-1-00016 The above primary constituent elements are interrelated in the life history of the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl. These relationships were major considerations in selection of proposed critical habitat. In addition to the above primary constituent elements, several other selection criteria were used to determine areas necessary for the survival and recovery of the pygmy-owl. These were: (1) Areas where pygmy-owls were historically recorded as occurring; (2) areas adjacent to or near those where pygmy-owls were historically recorded as occurring that provide or provided the same constituent elements; and (3) areas pygmy-owls are currently known to occur. Not all areas likely to have been occupied historically, or likely to be occupied now, have been proposed for designation as critical habitat. The critical habitat areas proposed are those that the Service believes are necessary for the survival and recovery of the pygmy-owl and in need of special management or protection. For example, in Sonoran Desertscrub habitat of upland areas in southern Arizona, the pygmy-owl apparently has always been uncommon to rare and unpredictable in occurrence. The Service believes this desert habitat has always been of peripheral or marginal importance to pygmy-owls in Arizona, and that the habitats necessary for the survival and recovery of the pygmy-owl are those along major riverbottoms, where the species was historically common. Therefore, sections of major rivers have been proposed as critical habitat, but Sonoran Desert habitats, in general, have not. However, pygmy-owls will still receive protection under Sections 7 and 9 of the Act, regardless of whether they occur in critical habitat. Designation of critical habitat is not prudent when the species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the degree of such threat, or when designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to the species [50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)]. Because the Service is currently working cooperatively with private landowners in Texas to reach agreements with them concerning maintenance of important habitat, the Service has determined that designation of critical habitat in Texas is unnecessary and would not be beneficial to the pygmy-owl. Furthermore, a probable outcome of such a designation in Texas would be an increase in disturbance to pygmy-owls by bird watchers. An increase in bird watchers trespassing on private land is a concern expressed by private landowners, and such events could damage a currently harmonious working relationship with the Service and researchers. Section 4(b)(8) requires, for any proposed or final regulation that designates critical habitat, a brief description and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may be affected by such designation. Such activities may include: (1) Removing, thinning or destroying vegetation. Activities that remove, thin, or destroy vegetation, by mechanical (woodcutting or bulldozing), chemical (herbicides or burning), or biological (grazing) means; (2) Water diversion or impoundment, groundwater pumping, or any other activity that may significantly alter the quantity or quality of surface or subsurface water flow; (3) Overstocking or other mismanagement of livestock; and (4) Development of recreational facilities and off-road vehicle operation. Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to consider economic and other impacts of designating a particular area as critical habitat. The Service will consider the critical habitat designation in light of all additional relevant information obtained before making a decision on whether to issue a final rule. Special Rule The Service recognizes that the major portion of the population in Texas exists because present land management by private landowners is generally compatible with the well-being of the owl. The Service intends to work with landowners in developing management plans and agreements with the objective of recovery and eventual delisting of the Texas population. The Service is also proposing a special rule under section 4(d) of the Act that offers additional management flexibility for this species. The special rule would remove the prohibition against incidental taking of this species in any area subject to a conservation agreement between the Service and the landowner when the taking is caused by routine ranching activities and does not involve any destruction of nest trees. In order for a conservation agreement to be accepted by the Service, it would have to describe the activities to be undertaken in the area that may affect the species; estimate the amount extent, and type of incidental taking likely to result from these activities; and prescribe adequate mitigation measures.
