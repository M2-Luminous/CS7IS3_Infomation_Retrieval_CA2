Reporters were turned away from the talks at a hotel in the north Mogadishu enclave of General Aidid's enemy self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed. The secretary of the meeting, Mohamed Hassan, declined to give details on progress at the talks, bringing together members of Aidid's Habr Gedir sub-clan and Ali Mahdi's Abgal under the chairmanship of a prominent Islamic leader, the Imam of Hirab, without UN involvement. He said the participants, traditional clan leaders and elders rather than warlords such as Aidid and Ali Mahdi, would issue a statement when the meeting concluded "in a couple of days." Ahmed Darman, a member of the central committee of Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction, confirmed that Habr Gedir representatives were attending. "The talks have been going on over the past month in order to create an atmosphere of understanding among the sub-clans," Darman told reporters at the SNA office in Aidid's south Mogadishu stronghold. "Both groups are well represented on the basis of the sub-clans, not political organisations," he said. Fighting between Ali Mahdi's Abgal forces and Aidid's Habr Gedir militia reduced much of central Mogadishu to rubble before the first U.S. troops landed in December 1992 to end a famine that killed an estimated 300,000 people. Darman, a former Somali ambassador to the United States and China, expressed optimism about the outcome of the talks. "I don't think there will again be war in Mogadishu between the Abgal and the Habr Gedir," he said. Ali Mahdi, however, has repeatedly warned that civil war will engulf Somalia after U.S. troops leave in March. He has urged the UN to keep peacekeepers here despite Aidid's insistence that they must go. Aidid, Ali Mahdi, and 13 other factional leaders agreed at UN- brokered talks in March to form a transitional national council to govern Somalia for two years until elections. But the process was halted by Aidid's conflict with the United Nations, which cost the lives of more than 70 peacekeepers before the world body dropped efforts to arrest the warlord in October. Further UN-sponsored peace talks sponsored in Addis Ababa last month collapsed without agreement. African and Western diplomats have since voiced mounting pessimism about the likelihood of a negotiated settlement. Darman said the current clan meeting signalled a new initiative, together with talks he said were going on in Nairobi between Aidid and representatives of a group of 12 factions that oppose him, led by Ali Mahdi. Darman said eight senior SNA officials with Aidid in Nairobi had been negotiating for two or three days with eight delegates from the group of 12 led by Abdullahi Yusuf, leader of a faction that controls northeast Somalia. Sources close to Ali Mahdi said he was in daily contact by telephone with General Abdullahi, whose Somali Salvation Democratic Alliance belongs to the group of 12. But Ali Mahdi himself was not immediately available to confirm that talks were being held. Darman said an agreement on Somalia's political future had nearly been reached in Nairobi, but the 12 had backed out at the last moment. The head of the UN Operation in Somalia, Jonathan Howe, seemed unaware of the clan talks in Mogadishu, but stressed that "there's a lot of dialogue going on." "It's a Somali process," he said Wednesday in remarks seen as a shift by the UN towards playing a less directive role in brokering the restoration of civilian authority in Somalia, without a government since the 1991 overthrow of former ruler Mohamed Siad Barre.
