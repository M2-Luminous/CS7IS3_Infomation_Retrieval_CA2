How will the oak, the beech, and the spruce deal with it? A French team has attempted a simulation. In the heart of the Auvergne hills at Saint-Maurice-es-Allier, 10 or so trees are already living in the air of the year 2050, closely monitored by the INRA's [National Agronomic Research Institute] forestry research center from Nancy. Jean-Pierre Garrec's team has started a rather unusual experiment here: growing trees in a CO2- rich atmosphere. The young trees -- oak, beech, and spruce -- have been placed in a chamber with an open top into which scientists inject a gas mixture containing 700 ppm (parts per million) of CO2, twice as much as in the air we breathe today. That is the proportion of carbon dioxide predicted for the middle of the next century. The calculation is simple since the graph plotting the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere is widely known and easy to extrapolate. As for the open-topped chamber technique, this has hardly any effect on the natural environment, which is why it was preferred to simple greenhouses. Saint-Maurice-es-Allier has the advantage of being a former thermal spa, supplied by the Sainte-Marguerite spring. Researchers therefore have a free and inexhaustible source of carbon dioxide. The excess gas extracted from the mineral water is all the more interesting because it does not have the same isotopic composition as the CO2 in the atmosphere, allowing scientists to examine how it is metabolized by the plants that absorb it. This experimental station was opened two years ago. It plays host to researchers from several European laboratories and parts of the IGBP (International Geosphere Biosphere Program). It receives subsidies from the EC and the French ministries concerned (environment, research, and agriculture). Jean-Pierre Darec explains: ``Until now, the impact of atmospheric changes on trees was only studied over short periods. Now we can hope to carry out this work over six years or more.'' That is a short time compared with the life of a tree, but the researchers, who have already obtained some interesting results, hope to be able to draw some exclusive conclusions. The Nancy team specializes in analyzing the parts of the plant that come into contact with the atmosphere, i.e. the bark, the skin of the leaves, and the protective wax that covers them. Samples taken at Saint-Maurice are analyzed at Nancy where Didier Le Thiec and Martin Dixon try to assess the changes to the outer tissue of the trees. The first thing they noticed is that there were a lot fewer stomata -- a type of leaf pore involved in regulating gas absorption -- on the trees living in the atmosphere of 2050. It appears that the plant reacts to the excess CO2 by reducing its number of stomata, while absorbing more carbon dioxide than in today's atmosphere. In fact, this phenomenon is already documented. In certain regions of Italy, natural emissions of CO2 through the soil produce a similar effect on wild plants. However, the air in these regions changes constantly, affected by the wind, for example. In Saint-Maurice, on the other hand, the parameters are kept constant and allow much more reliable measurements to be taken. Other teams have been examining the herbaria of our forefathers. The leaves conserved in herbaria dating from the end of the 18th century contain many more stomata than leaves of today. Analysis of the air bubbles trapped in the polar ice caps tells us that at that time, the CO2 content was just 280 ppm. How far can this phenomenon go without disrupting plant metabolism? Is it reversible? These are questions for which the Nancy team hopes to find the answers. The experiment is also aimed at determining whether the changes to the atmosphere can influence the penetration of phytosanitary products and the sensitivity of plants to insect or fungal attack. While, for the time being, the tests are limited to CO2, a similar line of research is underway to measure the effects on trees of increases in the tropospheric ozone levels (the ozone at an altitude of between 0 and 15 km). ``When we have the initial results, we will inject the Saint-Maurice chambers with the amount of ozone predicted for 2050,'' announced Jean-Pierre Garrec. ``We are not afraid of discovering catastrophic effects with the CO2, but with the combination of gases it is quite another thing.'' Preliminary results are already raising serious questions. The researchers were naturally expecting the plants to grow better in a CO2-rich atmosphere, since this gas is essential to the production of biomass through photosynthesis. This is effectively what is occurring in the INRA's experimental chambers, except that the growth rate differs surprisingly from one species to the next. Oak, in particular, grows much faster than spruce. ``This difference led us to question forestry balances,'' said Jean-Pierre Garrec. It is possible that the increase in CO2 could favor certain species to the detriment of others and so upset the diversity of species in our forests. However, this is a hypothesis that remains to be verified. The data supplied by the INRA station is still very fragmented and too new to enable us to draw any long-term conclusions. In the meantime, the Nancy experiments have also attracted the interest of nurserymen, and in particular those that supply towns, since municipalities often ask for fully-grown trees, notably to avoid vandalism. Studies into the growth of trees in a CO2-rich atmosphere could offer them an attractive alternative: moving from the sapling to the young tree in a record time.
