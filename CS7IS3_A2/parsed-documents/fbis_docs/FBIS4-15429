Diplomats Believe Boris Yeltsin Was Given the Wrong Document To Sign"] [Text] Aleksandr Rannikh, Russian ambassador to Latvia, was summoned to the Baltic state's Foreign Ministry, where he was handed a protest concerning military bases on the territory of CIS countries and Latvia mentioned in an edict of the Russian president. The Latvian Government, after an emergency discussion of the Russian document, stated that the Russian president's directive is "in sharp conflict with the draft agreements on the withdrawal of the army from Latvian territory initialed by the two countries' delegations in Moscow 15 March this year." The Latvian Cabinet of Ministers suggested that the mention of a Russian military base in Latvia, which was not agreed with Riga, could be seen as indicating that Russia is reluctant to sign the agreed documents. The Latvian Government stated that it "did not agree, does not agree, and will never agree to the creation of a Russian Federation military base or to the testing of new Russian arms and equipment on the territory of the Latvian Republic, and rejects the possibility of talks on these questions." As is known, the only military facility for which an exception was made at the Russian-Latvian talks is the radar tracking station in the settlement of Skrunde. Latvia made a concession and granted permission for it to remain for several years after the withdrawal of the army, until a similar facility can be built in Russia. But in the agreement the Skrunde station was not referred to as a military base. The Latvian delegation repeatedly came out against that. The Latvian national radicals are doing everything possible to retard the signing of the treaty with Russia, including the agreement on Skrunde. The mention of a Russian "military base" in Latvia in the presidential document prompted a nervous and aggrieved reaction in Latvia's top echelon. Riga demanded explanations in connection with the Russian president's directive.
