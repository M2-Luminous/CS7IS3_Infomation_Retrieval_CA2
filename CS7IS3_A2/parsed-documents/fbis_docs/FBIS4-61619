In his words, "the West has the aim to collapse our army and to make Russia's peoples fight each other." "They have destroyed us as a military and political rival and have turned the country into a flee market," Zhirinovskiy said. At the same time he underlined: "Everybody who encroaches upon Russia's interests must know that in 3-4 years Russian army will stand on the land of its adversaries." "If I were Stalin, I would have ordered to our divisions to inflict a preventive strike against Germany on June 20 and would have destroyed the German army," said Zhirinovskiy and noted the following: "We do not want any war but currently adversaries pose threat to Russia from each side." "If the enemy stands near our borders and the war is unavoidable it is necessary to inflict the first strike," declared Zhirinovskiy. In his words, one should prevent Russian-American exercises on the Totsk test range because "50 years ago analogical exercises of the Soviet and German forces finished with the forty first year." Zhirinovskiy promised that when the LDPR is at power it will bring order in this nation and will put an end to crime. He spoke in favor of creation "of special courts over bandits: there is no need to organize long trials--punishment, including shooting on the spot, should await the criminals." According to Zhirinovskiy, "the present authorities have made the greatest part of our population poor and miserable." In his opinion, "the president should dismiss Ministers Pavel Grachev, Viktor Yerin, Aleksandr Shokhin, Anatoliy Chubays, Sergey Shakhray, and Andrey Kozyrev, but it will be best of all if the whole ruling political team resigns." Zhirinovskiy believes that this autumn the situation in Russia will sharply worsen, many factories will be stopped and political crisis will seize the country. "The authorities will be forced to hold early elections and under this situation we must do everything so that the president, the government, and the parliament will become ours," Zhirinovskiy said. At the same time he complained about lack of objectivity on the part of mass media and declared that "correspondents are agents to whom the CIA pays for their lie about Zhirinovskiy." About 700 people were listening Zhirinovskiy's speech at the meeting held near the metrostation Sokolniki.
