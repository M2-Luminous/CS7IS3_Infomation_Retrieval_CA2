"I am sorry to hear this news. I am very deeply sorry. I really don't approve of people who rejoice when a political opponent gets into such a situation." Silvio Berlusconi was talking during a long interview on GR-1 radio. "I prefer to think positively," the Forza Italia leader said, "if there has to be political competition, let it be honest competition, in which everyone confronts each other on the basis of party programs. I say this very sincerely, I do not like to see these things happen." Berlusconi after expressing the wish that the election campaign "become unpoisoned," dwelt on the subject of the judiciary. "I'd like to think that one does not find in the judiciary the strong politicization which many believe to be there, and there are no judges and magistrates who act in the service not only of the law, but in the service of an ideology or even a political faction." "I believe that judges and magistrates," Berlusconi added, "should feel that it is part of their function to be above parties. If a judge becomes politically biased, I believe that he is no longer a judge. My wish is that they are conscious of the responsibility of their function, and that all of them, in the north, in the south, even if they have sympathies to the right, the left or the center, realize that this is what is important."
