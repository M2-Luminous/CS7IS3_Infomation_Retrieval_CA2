Over the last four years, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] has successfully followed this tactic of maneuvering, avoiding every hazard in its way. Those hazards included the attacks of the nationalists, the Constitutional Court doubts, the suspicion of the parliamentary forces, and the mass media's critical attitude. Throughout that period, the DPS succeeded in fulfilling, to a large extent, its election promises without directly committing itself to the executive power. The situation in the DPS now is far from rosy. Its commitment within the framework of the governmental mandate did not bring anything positive to its voters and evoked the inevitable struggle in the leadership, where mutual accusations of cooperating with the State Security and participating in the "revival process" were exchanged. The meeting between Zhan Videnov and Filip Dimitrov created a sense of insecurity in the DPS on anything related to raising the electoral threshold, something that could leave the party outside the parliament. Finally, the DPS also dissociated itself from President Zhelev. Otherwise, it would not have been so concerned with the creation of the notorious Military Office at the Presidency, and Ahmed Dogan would not have missed the opportunity to participate in the festive dinner in honor of Ms. Albright. The DPS' isolation is increasing, and it could hardly be called a "Splendid Isolation."
