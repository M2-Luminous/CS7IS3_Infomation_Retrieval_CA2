On the agenda were talks on the repatriation of hijackers, illegal immigrants, and the settlement of fishery disputes in the Taiwan Strait. However, bickering was the common point throughout the negotiation, according to local media reports. Sun Yafu, the chief negotiator for the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], accused Taipei of swallowing promises made during the previous round of talks in February. He said SEF Secretary General Chao Jen-ho had verbally agreed that hijackers would not be legally viewed as criminal suspects when they were repatriated. However, SEF Deputy Secretary and Taipei's chief negotiator H.Y. Hsu [Hsu Hui-yu] said that ARATS was confused over what Chao had said and that Taipei would recognize only promises written in black and white. Hsu claimed that the mainland delegation had been insincere throughout the talks.
