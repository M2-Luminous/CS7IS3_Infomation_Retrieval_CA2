This leader said: Over the past two years, China has made certain achievements in implementing the strategy of market diversification in the field of international economic relations and trade. On the whole, however, our trade is still confined to a small number of developed countries and regions. While preserving and developing existing markets, we must strive to open up new markets to ensure a bigger market area and leeway while spreading out risk for China's opening up and the development of its international economic relations and trade. It is necessary to continue the effort to improve the product mix. Eight years ago, we proposed accomplishing two changes in the product mix, specifically, the move from the dominance of primary products to that of manufactured products and the change from primary processing of manufactured products to deep processing of manufactured products. The first change has been realized, but there is still a long way to go to reach the second. We must make energetic efforts to develop export-oriented machinery, electrical products, and packaging plants that are highly competitive on the international market, are processed on a deep level, have high added value, and demonstrate good export potential. The State Council has decided to establish an import and export credit bank, through which the state will give special support to the export of those items in terms of credit funds. It is also possible to consider using methods such as offshore financing to support the export of capital goods. It is necessary to carry forward the principle of emphasizing quality. This year, efforts shall continue to be concentrated on punishing the manufacturers and sellers of sham and shoddy commodities. The quality factor should be viewed as reflecting our national reputation and the quality of the people and as connected to the image of our socialist system and reform and opening up. All departments related to scientific research and development, production, foreign trade, customs, and commodity inspection shall cooperate fully with each other, shall make substantial efforts to strengthen quality control and supervision, and shall strive to make marked improvements in the quality of export commodities this year.
