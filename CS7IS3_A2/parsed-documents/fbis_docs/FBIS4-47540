Danilova, S.A. Yazynin, S.N. Yeremenko, R.G. Vasilov, Scientific Production Association of Biotechnology, Moscow; UDC 616.097] [Abstract] The popularity of immunoassay methods for medicinal monitoring of digoxin and reports about the presence of the so-called digoxin-like immunoreactive factor in the serum of some patients who receive no digoxin due to the cross-reactions with endogenic steroids as well as the desire to obtain monoclonal antibodies to digoxin prompted an attempt to produce antibodies to digoxin suitable for this drug's immunoassay study. To this end, digoxin was attached through the digitoxose terminal radical to the bovine serum albumin and hemocyanin; the conjugates and their properties are described. BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally and subcutaneously by 0.2 ml of emulsion. The hybridomata producing MCAs were produced by fusing spleen cells of BALB/c mice immunized by the conjugate with X-63 Ag 8.568 myeloma cells, and three hybrid clones were selected by indirect solid-phase enzyme immunoassay analysis method (ELISA). The antibodies were obtained from the mice's ascitic tumors, purified, and analyzed. The procedure for determining the antibodies' specificity and affinity is outlined. The findings confirm that monoclonal antibodies to the digoxin drug with a high affinity and specificity and with a binding constant ranging from 10[.sup]9[/] to 9.2[.sup].[/]10[.sup]9[/] M[.sup]-1[/] were produced.
