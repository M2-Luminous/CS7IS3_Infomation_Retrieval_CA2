He held out promises of an immediate peace in the Balkans, Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh as soon as his party came to office. Zhirinovskiy, who is confident about LDP's chances of power, outlined plans of sending Russian crack units, now withdrawn from Germany, to ex-Yugoslavia. "Trainloads of troops will head for Belgrade instead of eastwards, there will be calm and quiet in the Balkans where the Russian Army will remain forever", he promised. On Moscow's rescheduling of Russia's entry of the Partnership for Peace plan, the LDP leader accused the foreign ministry and President Yeltsin of procrastination saying "their decisions come only after thousands of people have died". He is also confident that Moscow will cancel planned exercises with US troops in the Urals scheduled for July. The forthcoming event is of public concern and our people should not have any cause for anxiety, he said.
