Observers pin great hopes on this meeting, which they expect will produce positive results that would push forward the peace process. Such a meeting should be held and the United States should throw its full weight behind continuation of the peace process, especially after the Israeli rulers have displayed intentions which show they are not interested in a genuine peace, but in wasting time, avoiding the resolutions of international legitimacy, and avoiding compliance with the letters on the basis of which the Madrid conference was launched. Given this situation, Syria has understood the facts and knows for certain that Israel is maneuvering and seeking separate deals with this or that Arab party. Israel has also continued to exercise the ugliest forms of suppression, terrorism, and murder. Israel has continued to confiscate Arab lands and build new settlements without any regard for the peace process or the talks that are being held in more than one capital and with total disregard for the resolutions of international legitimacy and human rights charters. Thus, the Syrian position came clear and firm. In a nutshell, it is that there can be no peace without an Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories; that there can be no peace but the just comprehensive peace that would restore the Palestinian Arab people's national legitimate rights; that there can be no peace without regaining the Arab lands in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine; and that any attempt by the Israeli rulers to avoid these principles and facts will be rejected. Therefore, the peoples of the region who yearn for the just and comprehensive peace are pinning hopes on the Presidents al-Asad-Clinton meeting. This is because peace cannot be achieved without Syria and the region will not see peace or stability unless all the Arab parties are involved in the current peace process and on the basis of UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and the land-for-peace formula. Finally, the Presidents al-Asad-Clinton meeting confirms the important position of Damascus in the region and its principal role, which cannot be ignored or avoided, neither in peace nor in war.
