Yesterday [18 May], at a press conference in Brussels, he denied the triumphant reports released on a virtually daily basis by the Turkish Government. Not a day goes by without the official Turkish press agency ANATOLIA reporting the deaths of dozens of PKK guerrillas. The day before yesterday [17 May], General Dogan Guces, the commander of the Turkish Army, told the Turkish newspaper HURRIYET that "the PKK was eradicated." "We have recently suffered some severe blows," Yilmaz admitted, "but on the other hand, the PKK guerrillas have never had such a flood of young Kurds streaming to join their ranks and fight the Turkish state." "However," Yilmaz went on immediately, "the Turkish Government of Prime Minister Ciller is peddling false victories. As time goes on, the Turkish Army is daring less and less to engage in direct confrontation with the guerrillas, and is consequently switching to wholesale psychological warfare, in which the Turkish press is playing a key role in spreading triumphant reports that are manufactured out of thin air. Not we, but Turkish Prime Minister Ciller will surrender before the summer is out," Yilmaz predicted. In a detestable war like the one currently raging in Turkish Kurdistan, where no prying is tolerated, and where many journalists have lost their lives, it remains difficult to verify the correctness of any reports. However, yesterday [18 May] it was Yilmaz's turn to be absolutely sure: "In the last four months, the Kurdish guerrillas have suffered 882 losses; 152 PKK fighters have been wounded, and eight taken prisoner." Yet Yilmaz contrasts these figures with the losses suffered by the Turks: "2,155 soldiers and 33 officers have died during the same period, as have 15 leading watchmen (members of the Turkish militia in Kurdistan); moreover, 482 village watchmen were taken without a struggle. A total of 884 village watchmen has gone over to the guerrillas." Yilmaz requested that special attention be paid to the scorched earth policy currently being implemented by the Turkish Army in Kurdistan. "In recent weeks, 30,000 Kurds have fled to northern Iraq as a result," Yilmaz said. "And there, they land right in the middle of the fight raging between Iraqi Kurdish parties under the guerrilla leaders Barzani and Talabani, which have already been shelling each other for weeks," he went on. According to Yilmaz, "Barzani and Saddam Husayn have joined forces to suppress the Kurdish people. Turkey has been given the role of clearing Iraq's name of all guilt. Ankara and Baghdad are working together closely again in their common fight against the Kurdish people," Yilmaz said. Yesterday [18 May], the Kurdish leader reiterated in no uncertain terms that the Kurdish guerrillas will continue their attacks on the Turkish economy and hence also on tourism in Turkey. "We advise foreigners not to come to Turkey. Tourism is something one does in the pursuit of pleasure, but surely there can be no pleasure in visiting a country where one people is killing off another."
