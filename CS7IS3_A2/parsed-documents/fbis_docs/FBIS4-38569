However, very important developments -- enabling Ukraine not only "to expose" itself to the world but to occupy a prominent place in the international community -- are often left unnoticed by Ukrainian society. Recently, an event of international importance took place in Marrakech, Morocco: Representatives of more than 140 states of the world -- GATT members -- along with representatives of such international organizations as the United Nations, the World Bank and the IMF, signed an agreement stipulating the establishment of the World Organization of Trade. In addition, they signed over 20 economic pacts. Ukraine also participated in this meeting, as a state which is going to become a GATT member. Ukrainian representative to GATT Serhiy Osyka, deputy minister of external economic relations, who was a member of the Ukrainian Government delegation, kindly agreed to fill the information vacuum regarding this event. [Osyka] What happened in Marrakech, is, in fact, the legalization of a new global legal order in trade, tariffs, customs, investment, and other sectors of international economic relations, which was achieved by GATT members after almost 50 years of its existence. The World Organization of Trade is, as I can put it, the United Nations Economic Organization. Marrakech-94 enjoys similar international significance as San-Francisco and Bretton Woods-44 when the United Nations and the World Bank were established. [Skanya] How closely is Ukraine "linked" with this organization? [Osyka] You know that participants in the GATT session discussed and supported a Ukrainian application regarding its membership within the GATT on 17 December 1993. Currently, a memorandum -- regarding the foreign economic status of Ukraine -- which is a key element in the process of joining the GATT, is in the works. Its first version has already been drafted. In general, this memorandum is not simply a document. It addresses a series of urgent measures that must be implemented. It includes an analysis of the genuine competitiveness of the Ukrainian industrial and agricultural sectors; the bringing of the Ukrainian standards into conformity with international norms to simplify international trade and restore fair costs of the Ukrainian goods; the drafting of the normative-legal and administrative-organizational basis for the national export control; and the bringing of the Ukrainian legislation into conformity with the norms and principles of GATT, including the adjustment of trade, customs, tarifsf, investment, taxation, finance, banking, and other procedures with international standards. [Skanya] When can Ukraine actually become a full member of the GATT and the World Trade Organization? What can this give us? [Osyka] As a rule, everything depends on the work of our legislators; we should do this as quickly as possible. The point is that 125 states -- accounting for more than 90 percent of the global trading volume -- are members of the signed agreements and conventions. Meanwhile, 21 states -- including Russia and Belarus -- are waiting to join GATT and the World Trade Organization. At the same time, only a small number of states stay on the sidelines of GATT and the World Trade Organization. The longer we are outsiders, the more difficult it will be for us to build normal economic relations with the world. As a rule, cooperation can be developed through direct agreements between the states, but this process is so complicated and time-consuming that it cannot satisfy us. I can cite an example: Over the years of its independence, Ukraine managed to obtain a most-favored-nation trade status with only three dozen states. When it becomes a member of GATT and the World Trade Organization, this issue could be resolved simultaneously with all GATT members. Moreover, according to experts' estimates, we expect that Russia will receive a most-favored-nation trade status by the end of this year. If we do not manage to join the World Trade Organization together with Russia, our economic relations will be build on a basis that could be unfavorable to us. On the contrary, membership in this organization will lift a great number of problems in Russian-Ukrainian tariffs, trade, customs, investment, and other relations, what will enable us to establish a free trade zone and customs unions. All these processes will be based on general standards that have been tested internationally. Again, we should not have to reinvent the wheel. In addition, this will enable us to establish a mechanism for economic integration with the key trading partners in the West -- the member-states of the former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Poland, Hungary, Czekhia, Slovakia....) -- which became GATT members in the 1970's. [Skanya] In a word, is the process of joining GATT and the World Trade Organization a key step in our economic policy? [Osyka] Yes, and not only from an economic viewpoint. The political importance of this step is obvious. The international community meets us halfway and intends to help us. In addition, the United States is ready to provide us with the technical documentation which we should submit to join GATT and the World Trade Organization. This documentation includes not only consultations and advice by U.S. experts, but also financial substantiation for bringing the Ukrainian legislation in agreement with the GATT principles and norms and the establishment of a national system of export control. We are already working on this project.
