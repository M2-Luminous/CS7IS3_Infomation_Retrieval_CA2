FBIS3-6681 "dreas054_m_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-054 Document Type:Daily Report 20 Mar 1994 Thailand Reportage, Commentary on Bombing Continue Police: Thais Assisted `Terrorists' BK2003142094 Bangkok THE SUNDAY NATION in English 20 Mar 94 pp A1, A2 BK2003142094 Bangkok THE SUNDAY NATION Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] The foreign terrorists who assembled the truck-bomb discovered on Thursday probably had Thai allies, Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut said yesterday. His admission coincided with a police announcement that a warrant will be issued tomorrow for the arrest of a suspected international terrorist, and that other warrants may follow. Police said at least four people collaborated in assembling the truckbomb. It was likely Thais were involved since it was difficult for foreigners to buy all the components locally. "I have learned that some Thais joined the gang. The crackdown must be made at their grassroots," Chavalit said. Citing a police report, the minister said one of the suspected foreign terrorists is believed to be still hiding in Bangkok. Police are trying to locate the others. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Pol Lt Gen Chaisit Kanchanakit said police will on Monday issue a warrant for the arrest of a suspected international terrorist whose identity was already known. Chaisit said he met Israeli embassy officials yesterday morning and they agreed to send anti-terrorism experts to support the police hunt for the masterminds. Police discovered by sheer luck on Thursday a tonne of high explosive in a water tank on the back of a six-wheel truck earlier abandoned at the busy Ploenchit-Chitlom intersection on March 11 when the driver fled after hitting a taxi motorcycle. The chance accident averted what could have been the most disastrous terrorist attack in Thailand. Police said the truck driver appeared to be on a suicide-mission to the Israeli embassy, which is less than one kilometre away. The truck-bomb was composed of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, C-4 cxplosive and diesel oil with a detonating switch on the vehicle's dashboard. The formula is similar to "witches brew", the deadly mixture used to bomb the New York World Trade Centre last year and police are investigating a possible link between the two incidents. A corpse also found in the tank was positively identified as the Thai driver who delivered the rented truck to the terrorists. Police on Friday found 25 sacks of ammonium nitrate-based fertilizer and an empty water tank in an abandoned house in Bangkok's Bung Kum District. The landlord said she had rented the house to a group of Arab men. Police yesterday produced a sketch of a second suspect in the sabotage attempt. An artist's sketch of the first suspect, drawn from details given by the owner of the motorcycle hit by the truck, had already been sent to all police stations. Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Pol Maj Gen, Thawi Thippharat yesterday said the two suspects are from the Middle East, but he would not specify their nationality. Chawalit yesterday said some foreign embassies have assigned officials to help the police investigation. Commissioner Chaisit, meanwhile, said police are waiting for more information from the Israeli embassy to determine whether additional arrest warrants should also be issued. He said police had lifted fingerprints from the Bung Kum house and they should be useful in identifying the terrorists and their organization. The commissioner said he did not know whether any of the culprits were still in the country. If the perpetrators were found to be hiding overseas, investigators could seek cooperation from local police through Interpol to arrest and extradite them to Bangkok for legal prosecution, he said. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said on his retum from Vietnam yesterday that he expected a detailed report on the case tomorrow. He defended the government intelligence units against criticism that the planned terrorist attack almost succeeded because they lacked efficiency, saying they have been consistent with their monitoring of possible terrorist activity in Thailand. "We should be fair to them. Some kinds of work are not easy," he said. Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, a former secretary-general of the National Security Council, said he acknowledged that terrorist groups had tried to use Thailand as a base to launch their attacks. He said the current efficiency level of Thai intelligence units is good, but it is impossible for them to know everything.
