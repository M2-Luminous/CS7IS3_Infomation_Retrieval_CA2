It has been worked out the ministries dealing with unification. A similar plan prepared by the Ministry of National Defense is called "00 Plan." The "Peace Plan" spells out the government measures to cope with a drastic political change or an emergency situation in North Korea. It provides a scenario covering all possible contingencies, such as the sudden death of Kim Il-song, the outbreak of war, a military coup, food riots, mass exodus of North Koreans, a change in the system patterned after the Chinese style policy of opening up to the outside world. [passage omitted] Because the plan was amended and supplemented for nearly 30 years, its volume is staggering. An official said, "It takes 2 days to skim through it." [passage omitted] The "measures to cope with radical change in North Korea" prepared by all the ministries concerned pass as "Peace Plans." But the one prepared by the Defense Ministry carries a different name. Those prepared by the Defense Ministry are divided into two. The first one, "the War Plan," already existed. After the civilian government was installed, the Defense Ministry worked out the second. The Defense Ministry plan combining these two measures is code-named "00 Plan." The scenario in the "Peace Plan" begins with changes in North Korea. There are three types of contingencies in North Korea foreseen by our government. They are: "the provocation of war," "the fall from within," and "a voluntary reform of the regime." Of these contingencies, the possibility of North Korea invading the South is the one our government constantly keeps in mind. North Korea is constantly sending signals through various channels indicating that it will not hesitate to go to war. However, in our government's view, "that possibility is very slim." In terms of combat capability, including troop strength, the number of combat divisions, equipment, and training, North Korea is slightly ahead of South Korea. In terms of "combat strength index" used to measure fighting capability in war (combat strength equivalent to one armored division is rated as one ED), North Korea leads South Korea by a slight margin. However, according to military experts, under these circumstances it would be difficult for any commander with the power of reasonable judgment to think of launching an all-out war. Still, the possibility exists, although a slight one, just in case a special situation of political and economic confusion should develop in the South, undermining our government's ability to command war efforts, or in case North Korea should fall into self- abandonment. Experts on unification share a similar view. According to them, several scenarios anticipating war have this common feature: "After succeeding to power, Kim Chong- il touches off war in an attempt to find a way out of internal difficulties, but he is defeated." According to these scenarios, with just one day for us to detect the telltale signs of a surprise attack, North Korean troops advance 60 to 70 kilometers in three weeks to occupy Seoul, but they are forced to retreat in the face of ROK and American counterattacks. Most experts say that as time goes by, the possibility of war will diminish. Our intelligence authorities think that Kim Chong-il is not yet in complete control of the North Korean military. Proof of it is his constant expression of thanks to the troops in frontier areas. Recently, Kim appointed his trusted lieutenants as aides-de- camp to division commanders in the frontier areas north of Pyongyang, such as Wonsan, Chongjin, Kanggye, and Sinuiju. Reportedly, these aides, each carrying a pistol and a lunch box called "kwakbap" on the waist, accompany their division commanders for 24 hours. The Chinese government has already received information that North Korean division commanders are strongly complaining about their "kwakbap" aides-de-camp. It is our government's assessment that the possibility of war is slim at this time when Kim Chong-il is not in full control of the military and when it is difficult to look forward to Chinese and Russian support. The second contingency, namely, a North Korean internal collapse, is subdivided into "invasion of the North by the South," "the collapse of the regime under a popular uprising," and "an anti-Kim Il-song coup." But there is no possibility whatsoever of the South invading the North. Experts are generally negative about the possibility of "the collapse of the regime under a popular uprising." They give these reasons: North Korea is an almost completely closed society; the people have been brainwashed through a man-remaking campaign; and the regime has maintained strict social controls. Said Ko Yong-han, former North Korean Foreign Ministry official who defected to the South: "As long as the regime can supply only rice and red pepper to people, it will be able to hold on to power for the next several decades." Thus he ruled out a popular uprising. Our government is also skeptical about it. However, recently the situation has changed rapidly. The number escaping into Russia or China is sharply increasing. Some point out that this phenomenon resembles what happened at the beginning of the fall of the East European bloc. Concerned ROK officials even maintain that "recent escapees should be regarded as refugees, not defectors." Some observers predict that "if North Korea fails to tide over the spring famine season, riots may break out because of the food shortage." It is nothing new that North Korea is distributing for human consumption the corn or soybeans it imported from China as animal feed. Our government recently confirmed this through field reports. North Korean officials who contact our officials or businessmen abroad openly request food aid from the South. Judging from all this, there is quite strong speculation that the food shortage has reached its worst; it may touch off a popular riot. That is why quite a few experts predict the possibility of the regime's collapse under a riot. The third possibility, an "anti-Kim Il-song coup," is thought to be high. Our government speculates that a palace coup by loyal followers, is a greater possibility than a military coup. In this connection, it is worthy of note that recently, there are some ominous signs of change in the situation surrounding Kim Chong-il. [passage omitted] The scenario of the palace coup is roughly as follows: "The moment Kim Chong-il takes power, Kim Il-song's younger brother Kim Yong-chu, Kim Chong-il's stepbrother Kim Pyong-il, and Kim Pyong-il's mother Kim Song-ae stage a coup with military support and build a collective leadership hand in hand with Young Turks in the party and economic bureaucrats." This possibility is high, but the question is whether or not the new regime created would be friendly to us. Speculation by experts on unification is that "even if a coup is successful, they won't present the new North Korean regime to the ROK as a gift." However, our government has drawn up a plan to help North Korea should the new forces that replaced Kim Il-song ask for an economic aid. What worries our government most about a palace coup is a civil war in North Korea in case the coup should fail, and the resulting confusion under the reign of anarchy. It is estimated that in that event millions of North Koreans would escape to flee the civil war. Internal government data estimate the number of North Korean refugees at 5 million. It is expected that refugees would exit through these areas: the armistice line, the east and west coastlines, and the Chinese and Russian borders. According to foreign press dispatches, the Japanese government has drawn up a plan to block North Korean refugees on the high seas before they can enter Japan by boat. If refugees cross the armistice line, how would our government handle them? Would it take them in? If North Korean troops massacre fleeing North Koreans, would our government sit back and do nothing? These are the agonizing questions. In this regard, the government has drawn up special measures to cope with specific types of contingencies. These are the core of the "Peace Plan." The plan is said to have been drawn up on the basis of humanitarianism. This is to say it calls for the admittance of refugees if there are refugees. The third contingency, "voluntary reform," has nothing to do with convulsive changes in North Korea. But voluntary reform is the common wish shared by our government and experts on unification because it is the best alternative that can minimize sacrifices attendant to the process of unification. Its shortcoming, however, is that it will take a long time to reach the goal of unification. This point is touched on in the "Peace Plan." Currently, the North Korean economy is believed to be on the verge of ruin. North Korea will have to change course by necessity, not by Kim Il-song's choice. The anticipated change of the system will be a Chinese-style reform: establishing special economic zones [SEZ's] in isolated areas and reviving the economy, with pollution from capitalism shut out. If North Korea shifts to this course, the timing for the transition would be Kim Il-song's birthday (15 April) or shortly before. Experts speculate that North Korea has completed preparations for reform. But it is trying hard to exact economic assistance from the United States and Japan beforehand. According to experts, it is out of this calculation that North Korea is engaged in protracted negotiations with the Clinton Administration over the head of the ROK Government. North Korea is said to have organized a special team to coddle the United States. The government speculates that the team includes Hwang Chang-yop, who visited the SEZ's in China this past January, and Kim Yong-sun, former secretary in charge of South Korean affairs. According to a government official concerned, of the two Hwang is the front man and Kim has real power. The speculation that there will be a major change in North Korea has been sparked by reports about this team. On the possibility of war, a senior official familiar with the details of the "Peace Plan" said: "It is a difficult question to which nobody has a ready answer, but in my personal opinion, the chances are minimal." He argued: "The stronger our stand not to hesitate to go to war, the slimmer the chances of the North invading the South." He speculated: "In the future the North-South relationship will gradually change as North Korea reforms on its own."
