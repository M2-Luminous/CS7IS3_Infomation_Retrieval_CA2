FR940404-1-00014 FR940404-1-00003 FARM CREDIT ADMINISTRATION 12 CFR Chapter VI RIN 3052&hyph;AB53 Statement of Regulatory Burden AGENCY: Farm Credit Administration. ACTION: Final notice of intent. SUMMARY: The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) requested comments regarding the appropriateness of the requirements it imposes on the Farm Credit System. The action was taken to improve the regulatory environment in which the Farm Credit System operates by targeting areas for more focused study and by revising rules where comments present strong evidence that an FCA requirement is unjustified. This notice announces that the comment period has closed for the Statement on Regulatory Burden. In addition, the notice describes the FCA's plans for addressing the comments received. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Eric Howard, Policy Analyst, Office of Examination, Farm Credit Administration, McLean, VA 22102&hyph;5090, (703) 883&hyph;4498, TDD 883&hyph;4444. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 10, 1993, the FCA Board approved a notice of intent for a Statement on Regulatory Burden seeking public comment on the appropriateness of the requirements imposed on the Farm Credit System. Comments were sought on the requirements that duplicate other Governmental requirements, are not effective, or impose a burden that is greater than the benefit derived. The document appeared in the Federal Register (58 FR 34003) on June 23, 1993, for a 90-day comment period. The comment period was originally scheduled to end on September 21, 1993. However, several comments were received subsequent to that date and will also be considered. The FCA received 28 comments (12 comments from 11 associations or groups of associations; 11 comments from 6 Farm Credit Banks; 3 comments from 3 work groups established by the Farm Credit System President's Planning Committee; 1 comment from a Bank of Cooperatives; and 1 comment letter from The Farm Credit Council on behalf of its membership). The FCA is pleased to note that the comments received address a wide variety of issues and contained a number of useful ideas. A majority of the comments involve regulatory projects that the FCA Board previously identified in the Unified Agenda of Regulations published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 57276). These ongoing projects are Standards of Conduct, Eligibility and Scope of Financing, Collateral Evaluation, Borrower Rights, Capitalization, and Financially Related Services, and Disposition of Records; Federal Records. The FCA work groups already organized to review these issues will consider the comments received within the scope of these existing regulatory projects. An analysis and appropriate response to these comments will be included as part of the regulatory action published in the Federal Register . The remaining issues resulting from the Statement on Regulatory Burden that were not included in the Unified Agenda of Regulations include the following: Organization; Loan Policies and Operations; Bank for Cooperatives Financing International Trade; Funding; Disclosure; Accounting and Reporting; Examination Issues; and Miscellaneous Issues such as releasing information. Additional work groups have been established to analyze the comments and make recommendations to the FCA Board regarding action on the suggestions. The public will be notified of the FCA Board's decisions in an appropriate manner. Dated March 29, 1994. Curtis M. Anderson, Secretary, Farm Credit Administration Board.
