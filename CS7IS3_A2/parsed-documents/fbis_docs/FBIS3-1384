Armscor was responding to a Sunday newspaper report which said nuclear scientists in a salary dispute with Armscor had threatened to reveal as yet undisclosed information about South Africa's past cooperation with Israel. The report said the 16 scientists charged that they had been promised two years' employment with local armament manufacturer Denel, but were retrenched with only two months' notice. Reacting to these allegations, Armscor said the 16 former employees only had limited know-how of nuclear devices. Armscor reaffirmed there was no international cooperation on the development and manufacture of South Africa's nuclear devices. The statement said Armscor also endorsed the principles of the international non-proliferations bodies on not disclosing information which could lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
