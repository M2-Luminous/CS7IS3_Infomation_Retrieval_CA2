(OANA-MONTSAME) -- The State Great Hural members from the Mongolian National Democratic Party (MNDP) and the Mongolian Social Democratic Party (MSDP) will not participate in the parliament work any more on behalf of their parties. A decision on this has been adopted by the coalitional council of the MNDP and the MSDP. According some leaders of these parties in opposition, this means only refusal of the party representative in the parliament. An issue about recalling the parliamentarians members of these parties from the membership in the State Great Hural remains open. The coalitional council, as it is said in its statement, has come to such a decision "apropos of the continuing crisis caused by disproportionate reflection in the parliament-supreme legislative organ of the real placing of political forces in the society, violation of the basic provisions of the Constitution, the basic principles of the parliament, state system".
