According to the letter, singling out the success of Vientiane's fiscal and monetary reform plan (begun in 1986), which has achieved single digit inflation, a much reduced trade deficit, and control over foreign debt payments, the donors urged the Lao government to press on with the pace of economic change and aim for rapid development. The Lao government, which was represented by Khamphoui Keoboualapha, deputy prime minister, announced that it would increase the rate of public investment to 14 per cent of GDP by 2000 in a bid to radically overhaul the country's poor infrastructure and prepare the economy for full-blooded regional integration. As part of the Public Investment Programme (PIP) - which is to be backed by donors to the tune of up to U.S. dollars 1.4 billion - the Lao government will irrigate more than 50,000 hectares of unused land, plant 100,000 hectares of forest, and build 1,500 km of road. In addition, a full-scale hydro-electric project is to go ahead which is planned to earn substantial foreign revenues through power export to Thailand and Vietnam, among other neighbours. Donors agreed that the recent opening of the Mittaphap (Friendship) Bridge linking Laos to Thailand across the Mekong River along the growing tide of foreign investment pledges had all but guaranteed continuation of the country's healthy growth rates (7.5 per cent since 1989) for the next few years. Among the congratulations for the boldness of the Lao reform programme, however, donors warned the Lao government that it should not base its plans on growth for the sake of growth but should work for a higher calibre of development. It was also noted that least developed countries found it easier to achieve high growth rates than more sophisticated economies and that Laos had a particularly long way to go before its population could taste the fruits of a modern economy. In his address to the donors, Deputy Prime Minister Khamphoui recognized that his country still suffered from poor social conditions: `national income (less than U.S. 300) is still very low. Agricultural production is still dependent on the mercy of nature. Ethnic groups in the mountainous areas live on practising slash-and-burn cultivation -- a practice that destroys forest areas of hundreds of thousands of hectares a year,' he said. Along with a scheme to protect the environment, the government would invest significant donor-back sums to improve the country's education and health soctors, he said. Resources would also be channelled into a comprehensive training programme to modernize the workforce. And the government would strengthen its opium-eradication programme aiming to wipe out production of the drug by the year 2000. The thrust, however, of the six-year reform and restructuring programme would be to develop Laos' market economy and diversify the country's rapidly growing export base. The Lao government and donors agreed that the country should build on its success in attracting foreign investment (U.S. dollars 126 million in 1993 and over U.S. dollars 500 million in pledges) by updating the country's commercial law system and rationalizing its tariff structure. If the PIP fulfilled its ambitious targets-- a plausible objective according to the experts at the meeting. Laos would be well on its way towards joining the prestigious club of newly industrialized countries in Asia by the end of the six-year programme. The Lao government and donors will meet again in two years to evaluate the trajectory of the reforms. Tuesday's round-table conference was co-chaired by the deputy prime minister and by UNDP's acting director for Asia and the Pacific, Ms. Elena Martinez. Participants included Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the UK, the U.S.A., the Asian Development Bank, the European Commission, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the OECD, the IMF, World Bank, FAO [UN Food and Agriculture Organization], UNCTAD [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development], UNDCP [expansion unknown], UNFPA [United Nations Fund for Population Activities], UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP [World Food Program], WHO, and the Swiss Red Cross.
