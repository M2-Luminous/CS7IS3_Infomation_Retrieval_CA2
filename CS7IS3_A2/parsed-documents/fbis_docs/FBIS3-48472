"There is a possibility that Japan's provision of aid to China will run counter to the principle of the Official Development Assistance [ODA]." We often hear such doubtful voices every time the issue of Japan's fourth yen-dominated loans to China comes to the surface. The total amount of Japan's financial contributions to China through yen-dominated loans has reached over Y1.39 trillion in the 15 years from fiscal 1979 to fiscal 1993. Of this, Japan, in its third yen loan to China, which began in fiscal 1990, is scheduled to extend approximately Y810 billion in six years. As of fiscal 1993, a little over Y528 billion has already been extended to China in total. In preparation for the fourth yen loan program, which will begin in fiscal year 1996, Japan hopes to decide on the total amount of loans by the fall of this year. Although Japan is facing a serious financial situation, we have no objection to Japan's continuous provision of loans if the amount and purposes of the loans are reasonable. However, there is a possibility that future yen loans will not meet the changing needs of the times. We hope that this issue will be discussed at various places and levels so that the government will be able to win the people's understanding of and support for its financial aid. First, the government is required to give the people a satisfactory explanation concerning the total amount of financial contributions. For example, Japan's financial aid to East Asian nations is increasing. It seems that Japan's aid to Vietnam and the Philippines, in particular, will further increase in the future. Given such a situation, it may not be as easy for the government to increase its aid to China as in the past. Foreign Minister Hata, who visited China last week, in a series of talks with Chinese leaders agreed in principle to set a three-year period for the fourth yen loans instead of the usual five- to six-year period. Although the reason given for setting up a three-year period is that such a period will enable Japan to respond flexibly to situational changes, what lies behind this plan is the government's concern that "if the established loan period is six years, the total loan amount would reach over one trillion yen. Therefore, provisions for such a huge amount may invite the people's criticism." But in providing loans, the government needs to promote thorough discussion. From now on, before extending loans, the government has to be careful in choosing projects, particularly in coastal provinces, which now enjoy rapid economic growth. It is stipulated in the ODA plan that yen loans should be provided to areas or regions where annual per capita income is less than $2,695, and grant aid should be extended to areas or regions where annual per capita income is less than $1,305. The average income of the Chinese people is still low. But in some areas of the coastal provinces, the average annual income may exceed the financial conditions noted above for yen loans. However, it is hoped that financial aid to poverty-stricken inland areas will increase. It is also suggested that Japan will drastically increase its grand aid aimed at promoting agricultural development. Moreover, we believe that Japan's aid aimed at helping China promote the market economy will also be effective. Meanwhile, the Japanese Government should watch over China's increase in its military expenditures, development of missiles and other weapons of mass destruction, and exports and imports of arms. In talks with General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Foreign Minister Hata succeeded in having Jiang Zemin comment that "(China's increase in military expenditures) is only for purposes of defense, not expansion." In the future, Japan should urge China to come up with concrete measures -- including advance notice of military exercises and disclosure of information on military arrangements -- so that China's military affairs will be more transparent.
