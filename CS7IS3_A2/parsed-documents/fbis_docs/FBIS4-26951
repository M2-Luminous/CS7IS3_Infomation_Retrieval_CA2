The leaders of the CPPCC, known as the leading think-tank in China, agreed that the question of agriculture was essential to the success of China's modernization drive. Addressing a meeting of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee, they outlined a number of deep-rooted problems in China's farming sector and the rural economy. These included a slow rise in farmers' incomes, the widening of earnings between urban and rural residents and between coastal areas and land-locked interior areas, and indications of possible shortages of major farm products, such as grain, cotton, cooking oil and sugar. Yang Rudai, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, said that the slow increase in farmers' incomes was due primarily to the ever-rising financial burdens of farmers and excessive rises in farming-related goods, including fertilizers, fuel and pesticides. He said: "Without rural growth and the prosperity of farmers, it would be impossible for China to expand its economy. Without rural stability, it would be impossible for China to enjoy stability. "For this reason, each reform measure we plan to take must not be at the expense of the interests of more than 800 million farmers," he told the meeting. Qian Zhengying, another vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, stressed the importance of reinforcing agriculture as the foundation of the country's economy, in line with the needs of modernization and a market economy. She proposed that in drawing up economic development plans, the government should set appropriate growth rates both for industrial and agricultural production. Agriculture should account for seven or eight percent of the government's investments in fixed assets, she said, adding that funding for agricultural research should rise to one percent of agricultural production value. To this end, the government should earmark an extra 10 billion yuan a year for agricultural infrastructure and research, and farm- related industries. Wang Yuzhao, a Standing Committee member of the CPPCC National Committee, said that by purely relying on accumulation by farmers, it would be impossible for China to achieve sustained agricultural growth and modernize agriculture. Therefore, the government should institute a system in support of all links of agriculture, such as production, construction, techniques and circulation, he noted. He proposed that the government introduce a system to protect prices of farm and sideline products by setting the minimum and maximum prices. "I think we should gradually introduce a system under which prices of grain, cotton and other major farm and sideline products will be formed in a rational manner," he said. The government should also establish farm price risk-related funds and a grain reserve system, he added.
