Thai Government sources said the new deadline was discussed at a joint meeting of representatives of the Interior and the Foreign ministries, the National Security Council, the Army the Customs and Forestry departments and the Immigration Police. The Foreign Ministry told the meeting that Cambodian Finance Minister Sam Rangsi had informed them that Phnom Penh had extended the deadline from December 31 to March 31. The Interior Ministry asked the Foreign Ministry to confirm the new deadline to enable it to extend the opening of temporary border passes to allow importation of the wood. The meeting agreed it would help Thailand if agencies involved were able to negotiate with Phnom Penh to extend new logging concessions to Thai businessmen after the deadline. Thailand now needs 9.4 million cubic metres of wood annually. It has been importing three million cubic metres each year. [passage omitted]
