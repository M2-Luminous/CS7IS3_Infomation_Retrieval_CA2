In its fourth report on nuclear plant safety and spent fuel management, tabled in Parliament today by its chairman Mr Jaswant Singh, the committee said that despite the imposition of technology control regimes in force, India holds the status of a developed country in the field of nuclear science and technology. Besides, India's willingness to share its experience with others bears testimony to the transparency programmes, even as India often keeps reminding members of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that promotion of peaceful applications of atomic energy is its primary goal. The committee finds that India enjoys international reputation as a `developed' country in the field of nuclear science and technology. Safety standards in Indian nuclear reactors follow global standards and their safety is constantly monitored by the atomic energy regulatory board (AERB) which observes current international regulatory norms, it said. Stating that India continues to be playing a prominent role among the nuclear community inspite of not signing NPT, the committee said units of the department of atomic energy (DAE) hold dynamic links with some of the leading professional international organisations dealing with peaceful applications of nuclear energy. The committee said India has been a member of the board of governors of the IAEA since its inception and was one of the ten members considered `most advanced' in the technology of atomic energy in the world and therefore got nominated to the board every year along with other countries such as the United States, UK, France, Russia, China, Japan, Germany, Canada, Brazil and Argentina. Referring to the country's nuclear power programme, the committee said that the entire process of nuclear power plant design, construction, commissioning and operation is covered by a systematic quality assurance programme to provide assurances about meeting of all safety requirements. It said India's long-term nuclear power programmes is a three-stage one and the first stage is based on pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRS) using indigenously available natural uranium as fuel. It said indigenous natural uranium fuel resources would sustain a nuclear power programme of 10,000 MWE in the first stage. The second stage of the programme is based on fast breeder reactors (FRRS) using plutonium as fuel reprocessed from the spent fuel of the first stage. In this stage, with blanket material of depleted uranium, more plutonium would be bred to set up additional FRBS. Also at a later part of the second stage thorium as blanket material would breed U-233 from thorium, the committee said. In the third stage, the programme is based on U-233 thorium-based reactor systems by which U-233 could be bred to set up a number of reactors. The committee said that the first stage programme is not an end in itself but a route to the second stage programme of FBRS and is ultimately aimed at utilising the thorium resources. It said India has moderate reserves of uranium whereas thorium reserves are vast. Under the circumstances and if a long-term view of energy resources is taken, it is imporant to push through PHWR programmes at a fast pace. The committee has also found that for funding of nuclear power, there are no avenues for resources from overseas financial institutions, unlike in the conventional power sector.
