The job of running the "club" of 24 industrialised nations falls vacant in September when Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the present secretary-general, completes his second five-year term of office. Mr Paye, a former French diplomat, is again a candidate for the job, as is Mr Donald Johnston, a Canadian Liberal politician. British Government officials said yesterday that Lord Lawson was ideally qualified, pointing out that he was a strong supporter of international economic co-operation when chancellor.
