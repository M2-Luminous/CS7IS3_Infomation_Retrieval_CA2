Al-Tibi asserted that the meeting between 'Arafat and Foreign Minister Peres was conditional on Israel's -- and especially on Prime Minister Rabin's -- readiness to permit a rapid completion of the negotiations. Speaking before the Jewish-Arab center in Yafo, Ahmad al-Tibi criticized the police force's intention to use dogs against Palestinians. Al-Tibi added that the PLO leadership was very interested in Minister Hayim Ramon's political future, because he had played a positive role in achieving the agreement between the PLO and Israel. Ahmad al-Tibi's remarks were reported by our correspondent Qa'is al-Qudra.
