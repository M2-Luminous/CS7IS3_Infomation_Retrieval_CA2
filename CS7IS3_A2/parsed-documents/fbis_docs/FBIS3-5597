The United States has reintroduced its so-called Super 301 policy where it can double tariffs on some commodities in a bid to get Japan to open its markets. Speaking in Perth, Mr. Keating urged the two parties to allow the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, APEC, to resolve the dispute. The prime minister says Canberra is concerned that America's action will harm Australia's relationship with Japan.

Now, we think that is going to lead to a lot of bilateral trade tensions and that is why, I think, that we see the body which I was involved in last year in establishing at the head of government level -- this is the APEC, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation -- this trade argument between the United States and Japan is a sitter for resolution within the APEC framework.
