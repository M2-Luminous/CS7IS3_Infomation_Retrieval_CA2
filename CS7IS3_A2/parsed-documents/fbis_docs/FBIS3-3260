The region, with a population of 110 million, consists of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning Provinces and the eastern part of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. Two main river -- the Songhua River and the Liaohe River -- flow across the region, and there are three border rivers: the Heilong, Yalu and Tumen Rivers. Including 1.43 billion yuan of central government funding, the region pooled more than four billion yuan (459.77 million U.S. dollars) between 1990 and 1993 to build 73 reservoirs and a number of other urban flood-prevention projects and farmland water conservancy projects. Newly-built water projects are able to supply 159 billion cubic meters of water every year for industrial, agricultural and urban use. In addition, the region obtained some 400 million U.S. dollars' worth of foreign loans during the past few years for seven of its large-scale water projects. Local government sources said that previously water projects were paid for solely by the government, which resulted in inefficiency in urban flood prevention and shortage of water resources. The provincial governments now all encourage enterprises and individuals to engage in undertakings related to water conservancy projects, which are bound to get profitable returns, according to government sources.
