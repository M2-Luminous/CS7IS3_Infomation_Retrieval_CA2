"The blast in Germiston will seem like a Sunday school picnic compared with what's to come," he told BEELD. "We will keep going until we get our `volkstaat' [Afrikaner homeland]." BBB leader Prof Johan Schabort said on Monday night he knew nothing about the claim. However, just as the African National Congress could not control its supporters so the BBB did not know all its people, he said.
