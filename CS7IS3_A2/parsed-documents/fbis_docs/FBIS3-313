What is your reaction to that? [Buthelezi] Well I don't know. Mr. de Klerk has always been saying there is no time for this, there is no time for that, there's this deadline and that deadline, and really it's something that depresses me immensely, Mr. du Preez, because I think that the main thing is to find a solution. What is the use of meeting deadlines, as happened in Angola, and still have mayhem like that in the country. I think that it's important for us to find solutions, rather than to gallop regardless of whether we find a solution or not. [Du Preez] Now I suspect then what Mr. Moosa said about the election date being cast in stone, that you will also not be very happy with that statement? [Buthelezi] Well I'm not happy with it because it's based -- in fact from the very beginning, you know Mr. du Preez, without rehashing, you know, arguments that have taken place at the multiparty talks, you know, in Kempton Park -- from the very beginning, the very idea of fixing a date before there was a constitution was wrong. But we provisionally accepted the date on the proviso that certain things should come first. But those things which should have come first did not even come first, and that is why our teams or delegations had to walk out of Kempton Park. [Du Preez] I put it to the other two gentlemen earlier -- I think viewers and voters will imagine now that this is the next deadlock: that the Freedom Alliance parties will come in and say we have not had enough time -- the ANC [African National Congress] and government saying it's virtually cast in stone. Do you have sympathy with the position that there could be violence -- it would be a massive disappointment to a large majority of the people -- if we had to move the date from the 27th of April? [Buthelezi] Well I think that is propaganda that is being built by both the government, Mr. de Klerk, and also by the leaders of the ANC that, you know, people are itching to have the 27th, they are itching for that regardless of the result, regardless of whether there is an all inclusive solution. I mean that is their attitude all along, and it's propaganda, of course, which has become a hype, sort of deliberately created, you know, in their public relations work. [passage omitted]
