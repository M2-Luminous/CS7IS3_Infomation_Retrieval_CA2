For too long, the international community has failed to act against the blatant aggression by Serbia on the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the atrocious violation and abuse of human rights of the Bosnian people, he said at a state banquet in honour of visiting Albanian President Dr. Sali Berisha at Istana Negara (the palace) here. He said there was no excuse, whatsoever, not to act against the Serbs to end the violence and suffering of an entire nation and people and to restore peace and stability in that region. His majesty said although Malaysia and Albania were far from each other geographically, Malaysians were well aware that the ugly conflict and ethnic cleansing occurring in Bosnia-Herzegovina cast a long and dark shadow over Albania and the entire Balkan region. We understand and share your anxiety and concern on a possible spillover of the war into Albania, threatening your peace and stability. Indeed the tense situation in Kosovo is also of grave concern, he said. Berisha, in his speech, praised Malaysians for their generous political, technical, and economic assistance to Albania and added that Malaysia was among the first countries to offer help after Albania decided to adopt an open policy. He said Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's visit to Albania last year opened a new and important page in the relations between the two countries and in strengthening the friendship between their peoples. The friendly relations and cooperation with Malaysia were of special importance to Albanians, he said. Indeed, our two peoples and countries, though located far apart geographically, are always closer with their feelings and hearts. This, first of all, because of the historical spiritual links and of the common values they share, he said. Berisha said both countries with a Muslim majority were characterised by the religious pluralism and at the same time by the religious harmony. Berisha also praised Malaysia for its great concern about the situation in the Balkans as well as its efforts through political activity and participation in the peacekeeping forces in the region in order to provide a solution for the crisis.
