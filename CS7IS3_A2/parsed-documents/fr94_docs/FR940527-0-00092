The rule was issued December 23, 1993 by Departmental Letter 93&hyph;010. Chapter Ten of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182) requires the three parties to the agreement, (the United States, Canada, and Mexico) to eliminate ``buy national'' restrictions on nondefense-related purchases by the federal governments. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) was amended, effective January 1, 1994, but implementation of NAFTA also required revision of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to integrate Buy American Act and Balance of Payment Program waivers necessitated by NAFTA with similar existing Department of Defense waivers for countries with memoranda of understanding or other international agreements. Item XIX_Angolan Petroleum DFARS sections 225.702(2), 225.703, 225.704, and 252.225&hyph;7011 are deleted to remove the restriction on acquisition of petroleum products originating in Angola.

This action ended the DoD prohibition on purchasing of petroleum products originating in Angola.

These items are subject to the same restrictions as a result of section 9009 of Public law 101&hyph;165 and similar restrictions in subsequent Defense Appropriations Acts.
