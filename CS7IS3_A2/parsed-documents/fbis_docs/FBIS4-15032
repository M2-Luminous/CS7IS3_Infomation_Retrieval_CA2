He Is in No Hurry The main event of the past week did not happen -- Pavel Grachev did not sign the latest order for the discharge to the reserve and the new military draft. It was noted at the Defense Ministry Collegium session that it was only thanks to the fact that the "fall '93" draft had been extended through spring 1994 that it had finally been possible to achieve an 80-percent level of manpower acquisition for the Army. It is not being ruled out that in the future the trivial division of the year into spring, summer, fall, and winter may be marked by an order from the military department. That is nothing surprising if we are allowing ourselves to arbitrarily wind the hands of the clock on the Spasskaya Tower backward and forward. The explanation of the draft situation given to us at the Defense Ministry was that an edict had not yet been issued by the commander in chief. But the secretariat of the commander in chief -- who recently returned from Sochi -- replied that all the documents are being prepared as before by the military department.
