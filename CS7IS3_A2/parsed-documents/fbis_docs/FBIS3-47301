[Han] The top leaders of the two countries have consolidated their friendship through the two rounds of ROK-U.S. summit talks last year. The United States assesses the ROK quite positively because of its political and economic reform and opening-up policy, and relations between the two countries are now smoother than ever. Both the ROK and the United States have had difficulty because of the nuclear issue, but they have maintained firm mutual cooperation on the issue. In conclusion, I do not think we will have any problem in relations with the United States in the new year. [Chin] How will ROK-U.S. relations develop in the new year? [Han] Because the United States is likely to strengthen its economic diplomacy with China and Japan in the new year, we need to do our best to prevent this from exerting negative influence upon our country. In its trade with the United States, Japan keeps the balance of $50 billion in the black a year. Due to its continued economic slump, however, Japan cannot easily find an effective way to avoid its trade imbalance. Accordingly, economic diplomacy between the United States and Japan will undergo vicissitudes this year. When the United States agreed to extend the term of the most-favored-nation treatment for China last year, it added a provision that China improve its human rights situation. This is likely to become the point at issue in relations between the two countries this year. The United States seems to be determining that there has been no considerable improvement in human rights in China. Accordingly, I think, the United States and China will go into a dispute over the extension of the term of the most-favored-nation treatment for China this year. Among the three Northeast Asian countries, the ROK is the only country that maintains a trade balance with the United States. Therefore, the ROK will have no economic friction [kyongje machal] with the United States. As it is possible, however, that the U.S. approach toward China and Japan will affect us any way, we have to prevent its negative affect. [Chin] What do you think are our prospects for trade with the United States this year? [Han] The ROK registered negative growth in its exports to the United States in 1991 and 1992. Owing to the rehabilitation of the U.S. economy to a certain degree, the growth of ROK exports to the United States for 1993 was up 1 percent from 1992. As the U.S. economy is expected to progress more favorably this year, I will make efforts to increase our trade with it. Particularly, it is important to induce the ultramodern U.S. industries to advance into China and Japan with the ROK as a stepping-stone. [Chin] What is our diplomatic policy toward the United States for the future? [Han] The ROK diplomacy with the United States was somewhat subordinate to the Japan-oriented diplomacy of the United States in the past. The ROK should now abandon its position as a subordinate variable of U.S.-Japanese diplomatic relations and establish its independent relationship with the United States. The ROK has already become a country that the United States needs politically, militarily, and economically. By strengthening this position, the ROK is now developing independent relations with the United States. Thus, the ROK should discard its government-oriented diplomacy and develop a ranging diplomacy involving the parliament and academic, press, and business circles.
