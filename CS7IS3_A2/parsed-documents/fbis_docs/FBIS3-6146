FBIS3-6146 "dreas050_j_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-050 Document Type:Daily Report 12 Feb 1994 Indonesia * Computerization in Stock Market Reported 94SE0078A Jakarta TEMPO in Indonesian 12 Feb 94 p 92 94SE0078A Jakarta TEMPO Language: Indonesian Article Type:CSO [Excerpts] The Jakarta Stock Exchange is entering the modern era. Since the end of January, a big change has been attempted in the exchange's trading system. Indonesian Stock Clearing and Deposit Inc (KDEI) has been in official operation helping brokers to expedite day-to-day trading. The KDEI will handle all the details relating to the completion of transactions. In that way, less of a burden will be placed on the brokers. All they have to do is trade; they no longer have to dun the buyer for payment. On the other hand, the buyer will not have to chase after the seller to transfer the stocks. KDEI will take care of all those matters. Four days after a transaction takes place, the selling broker can ask KDEI for payment, and all the buyer has to do is take possession of the stocks. At first this so-called settlement process will only be applied to five stocks--Indah Kiat, Barito Pacific, Tjiwi Chemicals, Pan Brothers and Dharmala. These five stocks have dominated the market for the past three months. "They account for 30 percent of all transactions," said Cyril Nurhadi, managing director of KDEI. Next June KDEI hopes to handle all transactions on the Jakarta Stock Exchange. KDEI will use computers to handle these settlements, which can be very complex. Computers will not only execute the settlements but will also handle the bidding process. [passage omitted] As a pilot project, Hasan Zein Mahmud, managing director of the Jakarta Stock Exchange (BEJ), has been using a computer to implement the bidding on 72 stocks which are not traded very much and which are also known as "sleeper stocks". For this trial, BEJ employees wrote a simple program themselves," said Hasan. This is meant to be a way of getting ourselves used to the computer. This simple program will be replaced by a sophisticated program which will merge the BEJ and KDEI computer networks. Everything, from the trade to the settlement, will be handled by electronic signals running through thousands of slender cables. The BEJ has appointed Berca Inc to computerize the system. Berca Inc, which is owned by the businessman Murdaya Poo, submitted the winning low bid of $3.45 million. "This is cheap because it includes all the computer hardware," Hasan explained. It is said that the next lowest bid was three times higher than Berca Inc's. However, this doesn't mean that everything is perfect. As was mentioned above, the BEJ wants the computers to be in operation by June 1994. Transactions, now valued at more than 100 billion rupiahs per day, cannot only be done by hand. Problems might arise because the BEJ will not be in its present building, located at the corner of Merdeka Selatan Street and where the computers have been installed, for much longer. It has been reported that the lease on the building will not be renewed and that the BEJ will have to move into a new building on Sudirman Street, Jakarta, which is now being readied for the future site of the exchange. Of course it is not very efficient to install the computers and all their cables and networks and then three months later to dismantle them because the BEJ has to move. It has been estimated that at least 200 million rupiahs will be wasted. [passage omitted] Another problem is that the computers will be put through a three-month testing period in the old building. An expert in capital markets thinks that computers must be tested for at least one year while transactions are being executed. "This is necessary in order to test the various scenarios which might arise on the market. Otherwise, if the system goes down and the market comes to a halt, the reputation of the Jakarta Stock Exchange can suffer," he said. Besides that, "Stock transactions on the primary market must be part of the computer's agenda," said J. A. Sereh, a broker who used to be the managing director of Danareksa Inc. [passage omitted]
