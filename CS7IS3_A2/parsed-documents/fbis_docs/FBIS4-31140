In a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic expressed his government's "deep anxiety and indignation" over what he called the Serbs' "systematic policy of ethnic cleansing" against the Croats and Moslems. Granic said the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) had "not taken adequate measures" to stop the abuse which had led to a "tragic exodus" of non-Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina. In all, Croatia is sheltering some 300,000 refugees from the conflict, with up to 250,000 others having additionally fled Serb-held Croatian regions. A UN commission has concluded in an official report that the ethnic cleansing programme against the Moslems was a premeditated scheme. While all parties were responsible for acts of sexual abuse, most of the victims were Moslems, and most of the perpetrators were Bosnian Serbs, according to the report. In Zagreb, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees had expressed concern Thursday about the Serb pursuit of ethnic cleansing, which meant victims had no other choice than to flee. Bosnian Premier Haris Silajdzic meanwhile said in Paris he was concerned at the continuing lack of a peace accord with the Serbs, who, he said, would not hesitate to extend the conflict. After meeting French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, Silajdzic pointed out his government had said at talks last week in France it was ready to compromise on territorial issues. At the talks in Talloires, in the French Alps, an international contact group proposed to award 51 percent of Bosnian territory to the new Moslem-Croat federation, which is demanding 58 percent, and 49 to the Serbs, who control 70 percent. But federation sources said the Moslems and Croats were prepared to negotiate. Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic meanwhile arrived in Geneva reiterating he would not take part in ceasefire negotiations as long as the Serbs did not give an assurance they would evacuate their troops from around the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. Ganic said he would attend political discussions with the international contact group on Saturday but would only go to military talks if UN envoy Yasushi Akashi could verify the Serbs had left the area. But the United Nations warned in Geneva Friday it would cancel the peace talks if Bosnian Serb forces did not fully withdraw from around Gorazde by Saturday morning. Talks on a truce should have begun in Geneva Thursday, but Bosnian Moslems refused to attend so long as Bosnian Serbs continued to occupy the UN-declared exclusion zone around Gorazde from which they had promised to pull out. "As of 18:00 tonight there still remained about 20 to 25 armed Serbs, mainly civilians it seems" inside the three-kilometer (two- mile) exclusion zone," said Michael Williams, spokesman for UN envoy Yasushi Akashi.
