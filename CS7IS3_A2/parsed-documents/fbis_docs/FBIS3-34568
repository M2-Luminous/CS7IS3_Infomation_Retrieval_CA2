No doubt, the ministry's economic activity is scientific and enlightened, taking into consideration all factors affecting the stability of the market. The ministry's operations room is also doing an excellent job. However, those in charge of the food price list have failed so far to examine market conditions and the movements and stability of prices before rushing in an unstudied manner to fix the new food prices. This has led to grave results, such as destabilizing the market and causing anxiety to the citizen who has to shoulder new prices which are beyond his means. This is in addition to their effect on hiking the dollar exchange rate. I do not want to go into detail on the Trade Ministry's numerous measures and guidelines to explain their serious economic effects on what I have just mentioned. I will simply discuss one item, ghee, to prove the erroneous method used by the Trade Ministry in fixing the prices of ghee and other items in the food price list. More than one month ago, the Trade Ministry fixed the price of one kg of ghee at 82 dinars; or 1,225 dinars per one can weighing 15 kg. The dollar exchange rate at the time ranged from 130-135 dinars. Yet, the world price of ghee was $9 per can, including freight charges to Baghdad. In some cases, the price went up to $10 for the good quality ghee. In the meantime, the local market continued to be stable as far as the dollar exchange rate was concerned. Suddenly, the Trade Ministry issued an amended price list for motives and reasons which we do not know. It fixed the sale price of one kg of ghee at 98 dinars; or 100 dinars to the consumer. Thus the price of one can of ghee weighing 15 kg became 1,480 dinars and the merchant sold this can to the consumer for 1,520 dinars; an increase of 255 dinars over the price of ghee on the previous list. What has happened to justify this increase? Has there been an increase in world prices -- to our knowledge the world price has stabilized at $9 per per can -- or was the Ministry trying to absorb the currency surplus, and this also is not correct? The Trade Ministry pays the merchants 28-35 million dinars daily [in subsidy]. The effects of the Trade Ministry's list are clear to everyone from the big jump in the dollar exchange rate. The dollar exchange rate jumped from 135 to 180 dinars after the new list. The merchants fought one another to get dollars at any price in order to quickly benefit from the large profit embedded in the Trade Ministry's new list. This has resulted in a tangible increase in food prices, thereby affecting the citizen's purchasing power and adding more burdens that are beyond his means. Whose interest is being served by this price list; and under what consideration has this list been produced? The price spiral must be borne by the Trade Ministry and its devastating food price list, since this list includes basic items in the ration card, such as sugar, rice, ghee, oil, flour, and tea. The new price list lacked objectivity by not viewing current conditions within their wider perspective and considering the numerous burdens on the citizen. The price list has come bare of any deep sense of responsibility toward the citizen. In fact, it is a time bomb threatening the market. The market has been disturbed and the dollar exchange rate market is active again. The Trade Ministry has contributed to the new spiral of the dollar exchange rate. All this has taken place thanks to the Trade Ministry's food price list.
