To this end, samples were taken at 1 km intervals during a study of the compact Ph. australis proliferation area on the Danube, Dnepr, Dnestr, and Don rivers and at 5 km interval in the Kuban region. The findings were extrapolated, the heavy metal concentration was quantified, and charts were plotted using an SM-4 computer. The heavy metal (Pb, Mo, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Mn) distribution in various river estuaries near the northern coast of the Black sea is plotted, and the total Ph. australis area and primary production in the estuaries and gross heavy metal accumulation in estuarine Ph. australis are summarized. It is noted that the ever-growing exposure of the river basin ecosystem to man-caused factors increases the urgency of such studies in the future.
