As was reported, on 9 January, the U.S. imperialists conducted electronic jamming by flying electronic intercept planes in the skies above Suwon, Hoengsong, Chunchon, Paju, and Pochon and conducted an aerial electronic war exercise against the North with a huge number of combat planes mobilized from overseas bases and air corps belonging to the U.S. occupation Air Force based in South Korea. Since the beginning of the new year, South Korean puppets have conducted joint aerial war exercises against the North with the U.S. imperialists, and on ground, have conducted night attack operation exercises aimed at breaking through the Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. On 6 and 7 January, they drew hundreds of armed rascals in an area near the MDL and the DMZ and fired hundreds of shots from large-caliber machine guns and automatic rifles, thus agitating us extremely. They then mobilized squadrons of the puppet army's combat planes to support ground-attack units and squadrons of armed helicopters flying at very low altitudes to conduct missile-firing convergence exercises aimed at striking targets in the area along the coast of the northern half of the Republic and frantically engaged in war exercises. All this is a deliberate and planned game of playing with fire [puljangnan] aimed at driving the situation to the brink of war by aggravating tensions on the Korean peninsula. It is a very alarming move. As has already been reported, the puppet defense minister said on 3 January that the Army, Navy, and Air Force should maintain a strong combat posture this year, too. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also made bellicose remarks that the military should adopt a posture ready to cope with someone's war threat, to assume prompt counteraction, and the like. Meanwhile, in a so-called New Year's press conference, traitor Kim Yong-sam noisily talked about modernization of the puppet army and establishment of a security posture. Judging from the recent series of warmongers' bellicose outbursts and war exercises from South Korea, we can clearly predict that the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique will dash even harder this year, into a war provocation against the North. A year remains before our people face the 50th anniversary of national division by outside forces. This sorrowful reality urgently demands that our people unite firmly as one by overcoming differences of ideology and systems to launch ourselves onto the road of reunification and patriotism. In response to this urgent demand of the times and the national aspiration, all fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and overseas are vigorously advancing toward unity and reunification, not confrontation and division. The situation around us is also developing in a favorable way for fatherland reunification as a breakthrough for resolving the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula has been found through DPRK-U.S. contacts. At this time, the South Korean puppets are aggravating tensions by conducting war exercises against the North in an obsolete way. Again this clearly shows that they pursue South-North confrontation without any interest in peace or reunification. This also intolerably challenges the national aspiration for peace and reunification. The South Korean puppets conduct war exercises against the North like fools rushing in where angels fear to tread. Their maneuvers are nothing more than thoughtless and foolish acts. If they dare to provoke us, we will sternly punish the provokers. The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique will gain nothing by driving the tensions on the Korean peninsula into a state of acute confrontation. The only thing it can gain is its ruin. The South Korean puppets should look straight at the situation and had better not run wild recklessly.
