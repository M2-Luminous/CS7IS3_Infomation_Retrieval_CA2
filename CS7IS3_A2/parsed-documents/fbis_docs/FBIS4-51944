FBIS4-51944 "dreas087__a94019" FBIS-EAS-94-087-A Daily Report 3 May 1994 ANNEX Japan SDPJ, Sakigake Discuss General Elections SDPJ, Sakigake Discuss General Elections OW0305112694 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 3 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0305112694 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Amid growing attention to the possible dissolution of the House of Representatives and a general election following passage of the 1994 fiscal budget bill, Wataru Kubo, general secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and Masayoshi Takemura, the leader of Sakigake [Harbinger], held respective news conferences on 2 May. In separate news conferences, the two indicated their stand that the next House of Representatives general elections should not adhere to the new electoral system--an electoral system combining single-seat and proportional representation constituencies. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is eager to submit to the Diet a bill for electoral districts as soon as possible, and hopes to hold general elections under the new electoral system. But if the SDPJ and Sakigake, which advocated elections under the new electoral system when they were members of Hosokawa's coalition government, should support a dissolution of the Diet and elections under the current electoral system, the move towards holding a general election under the current multiple constituency system will gain further momentum because there is a similar move within the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Speaking at the news conference in Kagoshima, SDPJ General Secretary Kubo said: "We passed political reform bills, so we have a responsibility to carry out political reform. Holding an election under the current electoral system is imprudent." However, he added: "If public opinion requires it, or if parliamentary democracy is damaged, then it may be necessary to dissolve the parliament and hold general elections under the current multiple-seat constituency system." In this way, he indicated there is a possibility the lower house will be dissolved and general elections will be held under the current electoral system depending on the situation. Kubo then expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that a study is underway by the Hata cabinet seeking ways to recognize the right to collective defense and to establish emergency defense legislation. He added that the government's actions dealing with security issues, former Prime Minister Hosokawa's 100 million yen loan, and tax reform are the key to the future political situation. He pointed out that a general election may be held if one of the above issues creates a controversy and instigates a political crisis. Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura held his news conference at the Shiga Prefectural Office in Otsu, indicating his prospects for a general election. He stated: "I hope the redistricting plan will be drafted at an early date, and that the next election will be held under the new electoral system." He added: "I will not stick to the new electoral system if the situation requires an election under the current electoral system to ensure the stabilization of politics." Underlying this remark is his view that if a no-confidence motion is submitted against the cabinet by the LDP following passage of the 1994 budget bill, then the dissolution of the Diet and general elections under the current electoral system are unavoidable. On 15 April, when it decided to leave the coalition yet support the cabinet from outside, Sakigake announced "it will make efforts to swiftly pass the bills submitted by the Hosokawa cabinet, including the political reform bills." Before the 2 May news conference, Takemura said "there is a strong possibility the lower house will be dissolved within this year" and general elections will be held under the new electoral system.
