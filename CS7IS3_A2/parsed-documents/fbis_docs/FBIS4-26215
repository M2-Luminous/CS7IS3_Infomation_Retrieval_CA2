"Chinese people are most directly harmed by copyright piracy. The country not only respects foreign copyright owners but also regards anti-piracy as a helpful activity for our own economic, cultural and scientific development," said Shen Rengan, vice-director of the State Copyright Bureau. He said that copyright piracy has blocked the development of China's publications, film, and computer industries. "Copyright protection in China is not an interim measure," he said, adding that the opening policy has quickened the pace of bringing China's copyright protection in line with foreign norms. He noted that overseas people should come to realize this attitude and provide more active cooperation with the Chinese Government, including providing some techniques for copyright protection such as identifying and affirming foreign copyright owners. Meanwhile, those overseas people whose copyrights have been violated in China should inform the Chinese side in time, so as to provide clues for China to find the violators. According to Shen, currently all copyright pirates in China are illegal. Some culprits have contacts with or are even directly manipulated by overseas people. He also said that Chinese people have shouldered more responsibilities in protecting overseas copyrights. However, Chinese works have been repeatedly pirated in other countries and regions -- a headache which has not been solved. These works include books, video tapes, films and paintings. In recent years, cases of piracy of Chinese computer software have been found, for example, piracy of a Chinese-language input system and a Chinese-language desktop publishing system. Shen noted that a joint action of cracking down on pirated recording tapes is still going on nationwide and has won great success, with several illegal production lines being destroyed. A similar action on pirated books is planned, and in the future, copyright violators will be sentenced to jail terms instead of being fined.
