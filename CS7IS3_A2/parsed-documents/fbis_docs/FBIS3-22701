Honorable Shija made the call while opening a week's seminar for mass media institutions on AIDS at Kibaha today. In his speech, which was read on his behalf by the director of the Department of Information, Ndugu Bwire Musarika, the minister said that recent figures indicated that Tanzania had many more AIDS patients than other East African countries. He said that according to the figures cases of AIDS had increased rapidly in the country during the last three years. He added that the alarming spread of AIDS in the country called for new strategies in combating the disease, including use of the mass media. Hon. Shija said abject poverty, over-population in towns, and frequent family squabbles had greatly contributed to the spread of AIDS in many African countries. He called on journalists to be composed while filing reports on AIDS without being alarmist but to file reports which contained a message on ways of controlling the spread of the disease.
