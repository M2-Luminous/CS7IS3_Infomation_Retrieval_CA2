This was the first time the PWC held subcommittee meetings in Hong Kong since the PWC was founded in July last year; and it was also the first time that PWC members from interior China visited Hong Kong. People in Hong Kong universally welcomed the meetings and the visit because they fully reflected the sincerity which PWC members demonstrated in establishing widespread contacts with the Hong Kong people, in listening to their heartfelt wishes, and in strengthening ties with them; and also because they also reflected PWC members' open-mindedness, democratic and pragmatic workstyle, and earnestness. During the short eight-day period, the PWC's administrative and economic subcommittees respectively held their seventh meetings -- each of which lasted two days -- to examine the work in the past six months; and they reached common understanding on certain issues, including the principles for forming the first legislative council in the HKSAR, and coordination between Hong Kong and interior China on capital construction projects. These were the major successes that members of the two subcommittees achieved during their stay in Hong Kong. The convening of the PWC meetings in Hong Kong has enormous and far-reaching significance and influence because, on the one hand, it enabled members from interior China to examine Hong Kong's social, political, and economic life themselves so that they could understand Hong Kong more specifically and more directly, and so that PWC operations will occur more in line with the true state of affairs in Hong Kong. On the other hand, it helped the vast number of Hong Kong people acquire a deeper understanding of PWC operations, and it also strengthened the ties and communications between the PWC and Hong Kong people, thus providing a concrete guarantee for successful PWC operations and for a smooth transition in Hong Kong. Aside from the tightly scheduled meetings, PWC members from interior China also took advantage of the precious opportunity to meet with members of 30 grass-roots organizations and political groups in Hong Kong to hear their views and suggestions on Hong Kong and PWC affairs during the transitional period; to inspect Hong Kong's consolidated exchange, citizens' public housing village, and container wharf; and to discuss important transition matters with National People's Congress deputies, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as Hong Kong and district affairs advisors who were in Hong Kong. Speaking at luncheons hosted by five chambers of commerce, including the Hong Kong China Chamber of Commerce, Lu Ping, PWC vice chairman and secretary general, profoundly and specifically elaborated on the origin and contents of the "one country, two systems" policy as well as China's general and specific policies for Hong Kong. The widespread contacts which the PWC members from interior China established with Hong Kong's grass roots, their many contacts with mass organizations, the many subject matters they discussed, and the depth of the discussions all show the sincerity of PWC members from interior China toward establishing a genuine dialogue with the vast number of Hong Kong people, the importance they attached to Hong Kong people's heartfelt wishes, and their open-mindedness and democratic work style. All this has strengthened the understanding and mutual trust between the PWC and Hong Kong people and built the foundation for more effective PWC operations in the future. Affairs closely related to Hong Kong people's vital interests have always been the PWC's focus of attention since its founding. The PWC Economic Subcommittee has also set up research panels to study several issues of concern by people in Hong Kong. During their stay in Hong Kong, PWC members from interior China also extensively listened to the views and suggestions of people of all strata and various groups about "high land prices, high rents, and high housing prices" as well as retirees' security and stabilization of civil servants' ranks -- issues which all people in Hong Kong have been following with great interest. This shows that the PWC attaches great importance to the interests of people in Hong Kong and that it holds itself responsible to the people in Hong Kong. The PWC's main task is to work to facilitate preparations for the HKSAR so that the policies of "one country, two systems" and the "administration of Hong Kong by people in Hong Kong" can be implemented, Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-range prosperity and stability can be ensured, and people in Hong Kong can live and work in contentment after 1997 and can work together to create an even more prosperous Hong Kong. The extensive contacts and communications between the PWC members from interior China and people in Hong Kong show that PWC operations require the active involvement of Hong Kong's people, that people in Hong Kong are glad to be involved, and that communications, understanding, and cooperation between the PWC and people in Hong Kong are entirely possible. People are pleased to note that when people of all strata in Hong Kong contacted the PWC, they could act with candor, say all they wanted to say, and could present their many enlightening and constructive views and proposals. Some even came forward with detailed, comprehensive, thoroughly investigated, and earnestly researched proposals on certain issues. All this has fully demonstrated the Hong Kong people's sense of responsibility as masters of Hong Kong -- a sense exemplified by their readiness to cooperate closely with the PWC as well as their patriotism and love for Hong Kong. Their views and proposals, which are important for the PWC to take into account in its future operations, constitute one of the biggest rewards PWC members from interior China acquired during their stay in Hong Kong. People of all walks of life in Hong Kong followed closely the visit which PWC members from interior China paid in Hong Kong, and all media in Hong Kong reported the members' activities and the meetings' progress. Many scholars, experts, and celebrities expressed their views and suggestions on PWC operations and Hong Kong's future in newspaper and magazine articles. The PWC has become a thread connecting the vast number of people in Hong Kong. It has rallied more and more people in Hong Kong to work hard together to achieve the historical tasks of achieving "one country, two systems" and the "administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people," ensuring Hong Kong's smooth transition, and maintaining its prosperity and stability. "One country, two systems" is a great, broadminded, and creative concept, and the materialization of this great concept as well as the actual work involved also require the same broadmindedness and the spirit that we can achieve anything if we are united. While the PWC members from interior China have now left Hong Kong for Beijing, we hope that the ties and communications between the PWC and people in Hong Kong will continue to strengthen. The many grass-roots organizations and celebrities in Hong Kong who are willing to work hard for Hong Kong's future have already built a strong and unimpeded avenue of communications between the PWC and people in Hong Kong. It has been the aspiration of countrymen in Hong Kong for several generations over the past 150 years or so to completely remove the humiliation of colonial rule, return to the embrace of the motherland, and enjoy again the dignity and pride of a great nation. Today, history has bequeathed on us the great task of accomplishing this historical mission. Our motherland, which is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong, will provide the strong support for accomplishing this mission. Hong Kong's brilliant tomorrow has already been outlined in the blueprint of "one country, two systems." While working hard for Hong Kong's future, the PWC members and the vast number of people in Hong Kong are also working on the project of building a broad way leading to a bright future with Hong Kong's return to the motherland. We are fully convinced that, with the involvement and support of the vast number of people in Hong Kong, all preliminary work facilitating the preparations for the HKSAR will be accomplished on time, and the "Pearl of the Orient" under the five-star red flag will shine with even greater brilliance!
