FBIS4-35389 "drnes105_n_94004" FBIS-NES-94-105 Daily Report 31 May 1994 LEBANON NNA Correspondent on `Impending' Israeli Withdrawal NNA Correspondent on `Impending' Israeli Withdrawal NC3105061594 Beirut Radio Lebanon in Arabic 0430 GMT 31 May 94 NC3105061594 Beirut Radio Lebanon Arabic BFN [Text] According to reports from the areas of Hasbayya and Jazzin, the Israeli occupation forces have started to disseminate information on an impending withdrawal from these two areas, which could be done suddenly sometime within the next two months. The NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY [NNA] correspondent in al-Nabatiyah has reported that the information coincides with the completion of the road that the occupation forces recently dug between Jisr al-Khardali and Tallat Khazin in the Jazzin area and the creation of an iron gate in Tallat Khazin. The correspondent added that this Israeli step may indicate that a new crossing point will be set up there in lieu of the Kafr Huna-Batir crossing. Other information indicates that the Kafr Tibnit crossing will be removed and that crossing will be restricted to Tallat Khazin after the withdrawal from Jazzin, the correspondent said. The NNA correspondent pointed out that the construction of the new crossing point coincides with the Israelis' evacuation from their last position on Tallat al-Ahmadiyah in Hasbayya, which overlooks Western al-Biqa', and the handing over of all their positions to the agent militia 20 days ago. The correspondent cited sources in the area as saying that should this withdrawal be carried out, the town of Jazzin and nearby villages--including 'Aramta, al-'Ayshiyah, al-Qatranah, and al-Surayri--will return to the legitimate authority's control and that the Sidon-Mashgharah road will be reopened via Jazzin.
