You, in a certain way, also became a very important personality, not only because you are the first woman to compete in the [presidential] elections, but because you are perhaps very close to becoming the first woman president of the Republic. Dona Mireya, as a woman, how do you feel? What can you tell us? [Moscoso] I feel very happy to see that the Panamanian people have given me support, affection. I have been walking for three months and wherever have I walked people have welcomed me with plenty of affection. They came out to receive me at their doorstep only to shake hands. Some wanted me only to touch their children and allow them to shake hands; others wanted me to bless them. I have received during these walks so much satisfaction from thousands of people. As a woman, this has been a challenge for me, but I am very happy with this challenge. [Condassin] If you come to power, what would your first action be? [Moscoso] If tonight or tomorrow I am declared president, the first thing I would do would be to call on all Panamanians, all parties, to join forces. My government will be of national unity. We want the Panamanian people, after 21 years, to be like a family; that we forget the past, the fights; and that this be a government of national reconciliation. [Condassin] Well, Mrs. Mireya, we want to ask you just one more question because we imagine you are very tired. We want to know, did Dr. Arnulfo Arias ever give you any sort of advice on perhaps how to rule the country? [Moscoso] [chuckles] Dr. Arias gave me plenty of advice. The truth is that he was a marvelous man; he was my best teacher. Today we have remembered him very much. I believe that wherever Dr. Arias is he must feel very proud of what I have done for his party and what I am doing for the people. This is work that he was not allowed to complete and I know I will complete for him. [Condassin] Did you, while you were his wife, ever imagine that you could be president of the Republic of Panama? [Moscoso] Never. He was this country's leader; he was president five times, elected by the people's will. I was only his companion; I was his wife, but I never thought I would attain this position. I am in this position because God has placed me on this path, but I never imagined. [Condassin] Dear viewers, Arnulfist Party members have a very positive attitude. Even though results are still not official, these results greatly favor this party, according to the Arnulfists.
