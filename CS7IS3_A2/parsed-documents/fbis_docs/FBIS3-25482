Birns] [Text] Johannesburg Feb 19 SAPA--Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he won't take part in the April election even if his demands are met by the government and the African National Congress [ANC], as he won't have enough time to campaign for votes. Independent Radio 702 on Saturday reported Mr Buthelezi was speaking at Jan Smuts airport near Johannesburg on Friday [18 February] evening after meeting Swedish foreign minister Margaretha af Ugglas. "It's not really fair (that) if our concerns are met now, they don't consider giving us space to campaign and to electioneer," he said. He reiterated that government/ANC concessions on interim constitution amendments designed to bring the Freedom Alliance into the election were "nothing new", saying they were "vague and embarassing". Mr Buthelezi said the aim of his meeting with Minister af Ugglas had been to push for international mediation to break the constitutional deadlock. The Swedish foreign minister said South African role-players needed to solve the situation among themselves, but that international involvement should be considered if it could help the process towards breaking the deadlock. ANC leader Nelson Mandela was reported on Friday as having ruled out any postponement of the April election.
