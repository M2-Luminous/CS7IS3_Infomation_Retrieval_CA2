FBIS4-23667 "drafr114_e_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-114 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Government Official on Delayed Peace Process Government Official on Delayed Peace Process AB1406111094 London BBC World Service in English 0600 GMT 13 Jun 94 AB1406111094 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Network Africa" program] [Text] In Liberia, the peace process appears to be almost at a complete standstill. Disarmament of the warring factions has come to a halt and the clashes have continued. All this makes the elections planned for September look very doubtful, and there is great dissatisfaction about the slow progress among the international groups involved in the country. In fact, the United States is threatening to stop all aid and assistance to the country by the end of the month unless there is a major step forward in disarmament. The ultimatum was delivered to the Liberian National Transitional Government, the LNTG. In Monrovia, Charley Brooks spoke to the speaker of the LNTG, Morris Dukuly, and asked him for his reaction to the U.S. threat: [Begin recording] [Dukuly] One has to realize that frustration has been seen in many quarters. I personally am not surprised at the United States, or the United Nations, or ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] and ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] who express frustration. Even those of us who are involved in the process cannot help but be frustrated. [Brooks] What people are looking for now is that what is the LNTG doing, I mean, really to speed up the process? [Dukuly] You know, it is unfair for anyone to blame the LNTG. The LNTG is the picture of the parties to Cotonou. LNTG was expected to succeed where IGNU [Interim Government of National Unity] failed because LNTG was seen as a government of inclusion, the reunified government, with all of the parties represented and, therefore, cooperating. Are the parties cooperating? I would plainly say not to the degree that we would like to see them cooperate. What can the LNTG do about that? I would say not very much. The LNTG does not have the military force to whip a party into line if a party refuses to cooperate. [Brooks] Mr. Speaker, do you think with the slow pace of the peace process, do you think the holding of the elections is possible in September? [Dukuly] You report for BBC Network; you see the realities. Do the realities here point to the possibility of elections in September? You need to create a secure, arms-free environment in order to resettle displaced people before you even talk of elections but I don't think that the realities on the ground point to that.
