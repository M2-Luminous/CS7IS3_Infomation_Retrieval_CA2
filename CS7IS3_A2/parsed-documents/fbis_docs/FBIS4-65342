Mr Reynolds, who last week relayed to London a list of questions from the IRA's political arm, briefed United States President Bill Clinton on developments before returning from his short trip to America today. After arriving at Dublin airport he said all sides in the Northern Ireland conflict should now take the opportunity to end the obstruction towards peace caused by the long-running clarification dispute. He repeated his opposition to any renegotiation of the five-month-old peace document he and John Major signed but said if there were genuine issues of clarification it was for the British Government to deal with the matter. There was now an opportunity for everyone to put the issue of clarification behind them and he said he believed the requests were "answerable" by Britain. Downing Street said later the Government would consult with Dublin on the terms of its response to Sinn Fein's document of questions but a spokesman insisted the Government's views on not clarifying the declaration had not changed -- and there would be no negotiations on it. "What the people of Northern Ireland want from Sinn Fein and the IRA is an immediate and permanent end to violence, not months of procrastination while violence continues," the spokesman said. But Mr Reynolds, who had two meetings with President Clinton in Indianapolis on Saturday, said it was important to get back on the road to talks and bring an end to violence. Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams today demanded "honest, unambiguous and forthright" answers to the questions and said Sinn Fein had taken a number of initiatives to remove the clarification obstacle. He said the British Government "needs to adopt an equally positive attitude", adding: "Mr Major must move to close the gap of distrust between us. Therefore London should respond positively and in an unambiguous way to the questions we have transmitted to them through the Dublin Government. "Our specific questions should be answered in a direct and comprehensive manner. It is vital that London's response is honest and forthright." But Ulster Unionists today warned the Government not to negotiate in public with the IRA. The party's security spokesman Ken Maginnis said that would be a "dangerous road to go down" and that the IRA was not ready to give up violence. "The IRA...is clearly not prepared to cease violence at this particular time, so any exercise is both futile and an indication to the IRA that the Government is weakening," he added. [passage omitted] Mr Reynolds later told BBC's One O'Clock News: "There will be no negotiation of the Downing Street declaration. We have said that time and time again. "But if there are genuine areas of clarification that are required then let the British Government deal with that matter."
