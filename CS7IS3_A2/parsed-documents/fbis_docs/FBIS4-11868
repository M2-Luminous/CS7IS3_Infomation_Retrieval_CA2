In a statement to the Jordanian news agency commenting on the remarks made by Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for cabinet affairs and information minister, on the recent agreement reached in Cairo, 'Abd-al-Rahim said the Jordanian Government's call for Palestinian national unity and its support for the PLO, which is on the threshold of a new phase, emanate from a genuine pan-Arab position and show sound political foresight. He added that the PLO is very eager to coordinate with Jordan now and in the future in view of the common interests and the one future for both fraternal peoples. He said: Jordan, under His Majesty King Husayn and his wise government, is maintaining a pan-Arab position. We believe this position should be championed because it supports the Palestinian people's struggle to establish an independent entity on their national soil, he added.
