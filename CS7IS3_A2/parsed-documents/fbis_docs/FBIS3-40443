Last week, the European Space Agency [ESA] disseminated the first photo of Earth taken by the new European geostationary satellite Meteosat 6 launched by Ariane on 19 November (see AIR & COSMOS no. 1449). Meteosat 6 was first placed in geosynchronous transfer orbit, and 37 hours later boosted into geostationary orbit at an altitude of 36,000 km. Injected at 19�W, it drifted slowly eastward, passing at 10�W on 17 December. There, it underwent a speed adjustment, enabling it to attain its final position by the end of January, at 0� longitude, where it will be placed in operational service, and transferred to the European space meteorological organization Eumetsat, as of the beginning of February 1994. But as of 29 November, Meteosat 6 took its first photo in the visible spectrum. It will not begin imaging in the infrared spectrum until the multispectral radiometer built by Matra Marconi Space has cooled. Matra Marconi Space is Aerospatiale's principal cooperating group. Aerospatiale is the prime contractor for the building of the seven Meteosat satellites. Meteosat 6 will shortly replace Meteosat 4, which will then be repositioned over North America, to serve as a cyclone early-warning satellite beginning with the 1994 season. In this function, it will replace Meteosat 3, which is running out of fuel and will have to be replaced within a few months. Meteosat 3 has been on loan to the United States since 1991. The last of the series, Meteosat 7, is to be launched by Ariane around the end of 1995. At that time, the ESA will also transfer property and operational responsibility of all Meteosats to the Eumetsat organization, which will then operate the new MSG [Second-Generation Meteosat] satellites. In this connection, Eumetsat's board of directors has settled on the choice of launcher for the future satellites and "approved the signing of a contract awarding to Arianespace the launching of all three MSG satellites." Charles Bigot, chief executive officer of Arianespace, confirmed to us the signing of this contract, effective 25 November, covering the launching of the three approximately 1.5 ton weather satellites beginning in 1998. But, he says, the agreement also covers the launching of the European polar weather satellites Metop, by Ariane, after the year 2000.
