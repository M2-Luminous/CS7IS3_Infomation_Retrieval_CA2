That was the centerpiece of Dr. Zhelev's visit to London which began yesterday. Recalling that in the years of the communist regime, Bulgaria's foreign policy was entirely subordinated to the former Soviet Union, the Bulgarian head of state stressed Bulgaria's foreign policy orientation in the last four years. "For the first time in quite some years, Bulgaria has had a chance to implement an independent foreign policy on the basis of its national interests and the European values, consistent with the principles and standards of international law," Dr. Zhelev said. He listed the achievements which Bulgaria owes to this new policy: membership of the Council of Europe, the Europe agreement with the EU [European Union], the free-trade pact with EFTA, joining the Partnership for Peace initiative and the almost completed negotiations on accession to GATT. Dr. Zhelev also noted another area of Bulgaria's European policy: The vigorous promotion of bilateral contacts with the key European states. He cited the bilateral treaties signed with Germany, France, Italy and Spain and the joint declaration on the principles of cooperation with the United Kingdom. Bulgaria's Balkan policy also has European dimensions, President Zhelev stressed. He recalled that in the last three years Bulgaria has signed bilateral treaties with all Balkan countries with the exception of ex-Yugoslavia's successor states. The president singled out Bulgaria's position on the Yugocrisis as a most eloquent proof of Bulgaria's modern foreign policy: Restraint and military noninvolvement in the open or dormant conflicts within the former Yugoslavia. Dr. Zhelev stressed that Bulgaria is applying the Yugosanctions in good faith despite the enormous losses it sustains. "Bulgaria's policy towards Russia and the other former Soviet Republics is just as European in its spirit," the Bulgarian head of state observed. He recalled that in the last few years Bulgaria has signed bilateral treaties with Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Moldova based on equality and mutual benefit. Earlier in the day Dr. Zhelev addressed the Confederation of British Industry. Discussing the difficulties which Bulgaria is experiencing in its transition from command to market economy, he emphasized that Bulgaria now needs foreign investment, modern infrastructure and access to Western markets. Citing Bulgaria's liberal investment regulations and the efficient system of guarantees of the rights and interests of foreign investors, Dr. Zhelev said that for all that Bulgaria is still seen as a high risk country by foreign businessmen. Despite this, however, 55 British companies already operate in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian president said, expressing confidence that the inflow of capital will increase substantially this year and in the coming years. Dr. Zhelev thanked Britain for its assistance in the negotiations on Bulgaria's association to the European Union. Most of the negotiations were held at the time when Britain held the EC presidency, he recalled. Later in the day today, the Bulgarian president opened an exhibition of Bulgarian artist Atanas Kunchev in London and visited the Liberal Club. Tomorrow [30 March] Dr. Zhelev is scheduled to confer with British Prime Minister John Major and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
