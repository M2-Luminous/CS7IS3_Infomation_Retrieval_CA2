The purpose of the documents is to strengthen and broaden bilateral contacts between Mexico and Russia on a new legal-treaty basis. The initialling, that is the coordination of a common concept of the two documents, enables the state institutions of Russia and Mexico to launch practical preparations for exchanges of performing groups, museum exhibitions and delegations of partner cities, Yuriy Korchagin, representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, who attended the commission's session, told ITAR-TASS. The programme for specific bilateral measures in these areas of cooperation also provides for financial and technical assistance in the establishment of direct contacts between higher learning establishments, cultural, sports and other organisations of Mexico and Russia. Nikolay Bespalov, charge d'affaires ad interim of the Russian Federation to this Latin American country, is of the opinion that Mexico shows greate interest in the development of mutually beneficial cooperation with Russia in culture, education and sports, cooperation which has somewhat slowed down since the break-up of the Soviet Union. The lack of a new legal basis for the stimulation of such contacts led to a paradoxical situation. At a time when many prominent Russian groups and performers began to frequent Mexico for guest tours on a commercial basis, Russia was not actually represented in recent years at big international art festivals here, such as, for example, the world-famed Servantino, Bespalov said.
