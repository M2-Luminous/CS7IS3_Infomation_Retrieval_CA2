The British report referring to relations between Britain and China before and after 1997 was issued by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons on April 13. The report indicated that in total disregard of the interests of Hong Kong residents, Britain insists on taking the path of confrontation with China, the jurists noted. They said that the attacks launched by the report on the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region serves to expose the ill intentions of Britain. Every article of the Basic Law reflects the fundamental interests of the Hong Kong people, they said. However, the report went so far as to attack Article 18 and Article 158 of the Basic Law as a "serious potential threat" to the autonomy of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. That attack is "untolerable and without any reason," the jurists said. Article 18 of the Basic Law states that in the event of the Standing Committee of National People's Congress (NPC) deciding to declare a state of war or, by reason of turmoil within the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region which endangers national unity or security and is beyond the control of the government of the region, deciding that the region is in a state of emergency, the central people's government may issue an order applying the relevant national laws in the region. The jurists agreed that such a turmoil not only endangers national unity and security, but also seriously damages Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, as well as the safety of Hong Kong people's lives and property. In the event of such a turmoil, China's central government must act promptly and the NPC Standing Committee must declare a state of emergency in Hong Kong, the jurists said. Only by doing so will it be possible to put a swift end to the turmoil in order to maintain China's unity and security, and to ensure Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and Hong Kong people's lives and property, they pointed out. The jurists explained that as regards other types of turmoil or riots, such as riots resulting from serious natural disasters, economic crisis or other social problems, as long as they do not endanger China's unity or security and are not so grave as to be beyond the control of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), the Hong Kong SAR Government will handle them independently. Anyone with common sense can conclude that the attack by the British report on Article 18 of the Basic Law is "totally groundless," the jurists said. Article 158 of the Basic Law states that the power of interpretation of the Basic Law shall be vested with the NPC Standing Committee. Jurist Wang Shuwen, who is also an NPC Standing Committee member, said that the Basic Law was formulated by the NPC Standing Committee, so its interpretation involves China's sovereignty. That article also states that the courts of the Hong Kong SAR may also interpret other provisions of the Basic Law in adjudication cases. It also stipulates that the NPC Standing Committee shall consult its committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR before giving an interpretation of this law. Half of the committee's 12 members are from Hong Kong. Article 158 of the Basic Law makes sure that in adjudication cases, courts of the Hong Kong SAR enjoy a high degree of autonomy in interpreting all provisions of the Basic Law. In attacking the two articles of the Basic Law, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons had ulterior motives, Wang said. The articles 18 and 158 serve as a "reliable guarantee" for a high degree of autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR, Wang added.
