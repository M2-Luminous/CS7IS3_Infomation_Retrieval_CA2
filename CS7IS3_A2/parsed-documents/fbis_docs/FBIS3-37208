"We shall not allow this to happen," he stressed. The president said the Russian side would participate actively in negotiations on the Bosnian problem in order to put an end to the war in former Yugoslavia through negotiations. Yeltsin told journalists after the signing of the joint Russo- British statement on the reciprocal non-targeting of strategic missiles, that the Bosnian problem was discussed in detail during his negotiations with the British prime minister. Our stands are identical on the main point -- it is necessary to hand over to the united nations forces the heavy guns, deployed around Sarajevo. "This measure," the president said, "will allow us to stop the shelling of that city." "Moreover," Yeltsin stated, "both sides have confirmed during the negotiations that the Bosnian problem should be resolved primarily by peaceful means, through negotiations. This will allow us to put an end to the war in former Yugoslavia." Yeltsin recalled that the Bosnian problem was now being discussed in the U.N. Security Council. "This body must issue a mandate to the Blue Helmets to accept the guns removed from positions around Sarajevo. This is most important," he stated. The president believes the positions of the hostile parties in Bosnia could be bombed only if the Blue Helmets were attacked and called for help. "if somebody attacks the U.N. forces, he must be punished," he stressed. Touching on bilateral relations, Boris Yeltsin noted that the dynamics of their development since his visit to London was borne out by the joint statement on the reciprocal non-targeting of strategic nuclear missiles, signed here today, which is the first document of this kind in the world. The joint statement, signed by Boris Yeltsin and John Major today, says that they would issue orders not to target at each other the strategic nuclear missiles under their command. This will be done not later than May 30, 1994.
