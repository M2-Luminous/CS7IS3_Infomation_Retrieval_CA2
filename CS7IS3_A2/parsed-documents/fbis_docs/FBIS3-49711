FBIS3-49711 "dreeu010__a94032" FBIS-EEU-94-010-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 January 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Minority's Statistics on Ethnic Makeup Contested AU1301174594 Prague CTK in English 0945 GMT 13 Jan 93 AU1301174594 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava, Jan 13 (CTK) -- In 1991 a total of 1,334,434 people lived on the territory of southern Slovakia, excepting Bratislava, Kosice, and the Nitra district, with 771,196 Slovaks (57.9 percent) and 517,936 ethnic Hungarians (38.8 percent), the daily REPUBLIKA writes today. Statistics "experts" from the ranks of participants in the January 8 Komarno meeting maintain that according to the 1991 census, 824,946 people, including 507,073 Hungarians, live in the ethnically mixed southern Slovak region spreading from Bratislava to south Zemplin, with Slovaks and other ethnic minorities (Romanies and Czechs) comprising the rest. These data are not correct, says the daily, organ of the state-owned Slovak News Agency (TA SR). Other data concerning an ethnic Hungarian area south of Nitra, where ethnic Hungarians allegedly are in the majority in 18 villages of the district, are false, the daily asserts. According to the 1991 census, Hungarians make up a majority only in 10 villages of the district. Ethnic Hungarians make up the majority in southern Slovakia only in the Dunajska Streda and Komarno districts. In other districts, Slovaks make up the majority and they have therefore the decisive right to speak on the question of the future territorial administrative arrangement of this region, REPUBLIKA writes. Slovaks living on territories with mixed population are considerably harmed by the election law drafted on the principle of majority participation. This is witnessed, for example, by the situation in the Nove Zamky district where there are only 8 Slovaks in the 45-member local representation, although Slovaks make up 70 percent of this district's population. The reason for such a situation is a very simple. Almost all ethnic Hungarians voted for actually one party -- Egyutteles (Coexistence) while Slovaks voted for representatives of different parties which led to the diffusion of their votes. They thus failed to further the majority of their deputies in local representations even in towns and villages where Slovaks make up the majority, the daily writes.
