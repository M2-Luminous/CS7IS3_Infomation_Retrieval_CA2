The "research department" should make economies in defense technology, space projects, and nuclear research. That is what emerges from the draft "1994 Government Program" in the fields of education, research, and culture, for which Peter Glotz, the education and research policy spokesman of the SPD, is responsible as the member of the SPD commission for these fields. According to the document, the SPD wants to make education, research, and culture policy a "big issue" in the election campaign debate. In order to make education and research policy more effective, the SPD -- like the CDU -- is proposing the establishment of an "innovation and technology council." The appointment of a "education council as a forum for exchanging ideas" is also being considered. The document calls for a "generation contract for education and youth" in order to "realize the right to the best possible education for the new generation." However, how that is to be understood remains unclear. The SPD flatly rejects a reduction in training subsidies. Ultimately, the SPD wants to make the transition from vocational training to a college education easier, the Law on Training Subsidies an effective instrument for an active labor market policy, and overcome resistance to "the good idea of training during vacations." The SPD is a firm advocate of "effective reforms" of the college sector, such as increasing the room for maneuver of individual colleges by, for example, introducing overall budgets. The program states literally that "private colleges could complement our college system in a positive way." The document states that "we must differentiate between what is first-rate, average, and bad in our society and in education and science all the more so." Glotz says: "Even the most stringent economies cannot lead to the neglect of what is first rate." The details of the draft state: - The SPD believes that more consideration must be given to education in the distribution of public funds than has been the case hitherto. There should be a "reasonable" increase in expenditure on education and science as a share of the gross national expenditure. - The SPD is in favor of companies and administrative agencies developing professional career structures that also afford opportunities for specialists without a college education to advance their careers. - Priority should be given to the expansion of technical colleges. There should be better career opportunities in public service for graduates. - In the opinion of the SPD, there should be an "above average" increase in funds for research as of 1995. - The SPD documents state explicitly that technological progress in information technology, the development of new materials, genetic engineering, and the whole range of chemical, biological, and physics-based technologies is the basis for prosperity and economic competitiveness. Research policy should not be "too narrow"; it should identify new technologies that have a "marked structural effect" early in conjunction with the scientific and business communities and accord special priority to such projects. The SPD describes the "marketplace" as providing an "important impetus" for technological progress.
