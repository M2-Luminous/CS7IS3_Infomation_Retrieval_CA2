Colonel Dragan Vuksic, deputy head of the Department for Cooperation with International Organizations, commented on NATO's ultimatum and decision to carry out air strikes. Dragoljub Stankic reports: [Stankic] NATO's decision is not a surprise and is in line with the decisions made by that organization at its sessions of 2 and 9 February. This was stated by Colonel Dragan Vuksic. In his view, the decision is controversial in both the language in which it was written and the content itself. However, the most important thing is that if the decision were to be carried out in the way envisaged, all peace efforts would be annulled and we would enter a new dangerous stage with unforeseeable consequences, Colonel Vuksic stressed. [Begin Vuksic recording] NATO's decision, if it is indeed that, represents a precedent in international relations and is virtually making NATO equal or superior to the world organization. As far as we know, on the basis of the agreements, consultations, and mandates given to NATO hitherto, this organization does not have the right to make decisions on air strikes, preventive air strikes, and on punishing, carrying out reprisals against the warring sides, unless it was given a clear task by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] as to what side is violating what has been agreed, and how it is doing it, how it is not implementing what has been agreed on. This was not done in this case, and NATO, with its decision, is threatening to disturb the system of relations, the current system of relations in the world organization, and to abuse, use the world organization in order to implement or carry out acts that would mean not only the end of peace operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also the escalation of the war conflict on the territory of that former Yugoslav republic, the Balkans, and perhaps further afield. [end recording] [Stankic] Colonel Vuksic stressed that he did not know what the real aim of the decision was, but that it represented a dangerous precedent, and that he hoped that such a decision would not be carried out after all. In reply to correspondents' question whether the Yugoslav Army would respond if air strikes did take place, Colonel Vuksic said: [Begin Vuksic recording] The Yugoslav Army has its tasks and it must follow the situation and react to the events in the surrounding. I would like to remind you of the principled stand of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that we will not obstruct in any way peace activities of the United Nations and other members of the international community involved in the settlement of the Yugoslav crisis. Such an act would certainly not constitute a peace effort, and, as I said, it would contradict everything that has been done and achieved so far. The behavior of the Yugoslav Army, of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and other international and other interested parties would primarily depend on the behavior by the side that would take such an action.
