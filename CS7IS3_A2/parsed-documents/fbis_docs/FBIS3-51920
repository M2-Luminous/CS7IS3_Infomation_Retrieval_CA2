I believe we must first properly define why the people are asking for this, so that everyone can understand. Many people still do not understand the situation with the wealthy. [Rodriguez] I believe it is offensive that there are those in our society who live well above the means of the people, in what amounts to sneering at the people, particularly humble workers. They do this contemptuously. They live off crime, have made it their lifestyle. They can therefore buy even the volition of weak people who are willing to sell out for money. [Roque] Following your thought, we can define two types of wealthy people. There is a difference between the wealthy you have just mentioned and the other kind, no less wealthy -- pardon the redundancy -- who have earned their money through hard work. [Rodriguez] Yes, I believe we must stress the difference. We recently spoke about this matter on this program. We asked ourselves if there were honest wealthy people, and became entangled in irrelevant issues. It is important to explain this. We use the term maceta to define anyone who has a little money. We need to clarify that not everyone who has money has attained it dishonestly or illegally. There are people who may have inherited money from relatives. Some, through work, have attained certain levels of wealth, particularly as a result of certain policies -- some say erroneous economic policies. I truly believe that some people have taken advantage of specific situations. In this regard, I wish to mention the highly deserved money of farmers. Not all farmers engage in the black market. I believe this is quite clear. I know of farmers who plant tobacco, particularly in Pinar del Rio where the prices are much higher due to the quality of the leaf, and farmers in Havana who plant crops such as garlic. In both cases, I have seen that without needing to engage in the black market, they make a good profit selling their crops. This is deserved in view of their immense efforts. [Roque] Now that we have clarified this, we are ready to discuss the people's call for eradicating the wealthy. I would like it to be clearly understood the type of wealth we are going to speak about. [Rodriguez] I believe we need to reflect the calls from certain workers assemblies to confiscate the money of those who have attained it illegally, specifically referring to those people we mentioned. I believe that there are inequalities in today's society that we need to accept even though they are unfair. These inequalities are created by such factors as the fact that there are people entitled to receive help from relatives abroad. There are other inequalities created by the fact that certain people have access to hard currency income, such as tourism workers who receive tips in foreign currencies. This currency helps them, to a certain degree, satisfy some essential needs. [Roque] There are other inequalities that have taken place for years, such as the case of these wealthy people. I believe this should be the focus of today's program. [Rodriguez] At the beginning, I mentioned criminals specifically. I believe that the word wealthy is not the appropriate term. We are talking about criminals, those who have illegally amassed money and who today anger our workers, those of us who earn an honest living. There is a general call within these assemblies. Everyone is wondering: How? How are we going to confiscate the money of the wealthy? [Roque] How do you determine who they are? [Rodriguez] How are we going to determine whether someone's money was amassed legally or illegally? I have been thinking about these issues and have discussed them with numerous comrades. In every neighborhood, we know who is who. I believe the most trustworthy information on the activities of any citizen comes from his neighbors. As a matter of fact, we have the Unified Vigilance and Protection System [SUVP]. The Committees for the Defense of the Revolution are one of the most important components of the SUVP. They can contribute much of this information. We also have the recourse of police investigations. There is also the option of bringing that citizen to court to prove that his wealth was amassed illegally. I believe that these are the plausible means of not only confiscating the money... [changes thought] We are also going to discuss how these people live today. We could confiscate money and goods, which would be the legal means of appropriating the highly arrogant lifestyles of these people. [Roque] Undoubtedly, the implementation of this measure is extremely difficult. You just explained that it will not be easy to establish this differentiation. [Rodriguez] There is also a margin of error. Errors might be made. There are people who might make it look like everything was amassed legally. Only an in-depth investigation might indicate otherwise. Inversely, there are those one might suspect of being involved in criminal activities, but who can prove that everything is legal. [Roque] What we can be sure of is that the investigation will always be fair and that the margin of error will not produce injustice. Errors might occur, but they will be in terms of the impunity of some people. [Rodriguez] Of course, at least for a while. I do not believe that impunity in this type of action can last long; at the beginning perhaps, in a first offensive. But this type of offensive needs to be permanent in nature. It cannot be like those campaigns in the past, when a large number of people were arrested, practically guilty, but since there was no evidence, many were freed, or were able to demonstrate where their money came from. I also think that... [changes thought] Later on we will talk about goods. It is being said that since there are already rumors, and that since the people are demanding eradication of the wealthy, this social ballast is infecting certain neighborhoods. They have, of course, reacted; they know who they are. They know who the people are talking about. They are trying to find a escape. I wish to use this nationwide program to tell them that escape is going to be very difficult once the people's watchful eyes enter the picture. [Roque] Many believe that since we are talking so openly on the radio, and the wealthy know that measures against them are going to be taken, this gives them a chance to seek solutions to their problem. However, you mentioned that the people are aware of all of this. Since the people are the ones calling for the eradication of the wealthy, are asking the authorities to please eliminate this social scum, the people need to support the authorities -- police and courts -- in order to eradicate them. We must have witnesses. In order to sentence someone in court, we need witnesses. [Rodriguez] Undoubtedly, these people are preparing. The people are surely aware of this, and need to be on alert so they can provide the required information. It is obvious that these people will try to get rid of their Cuban money, probably in large amounts, by converting it into goods. It is known that many of them have done this on other occasions when they felt threatened by a change in the currency. Now, there is much talk about a change of currency. I do not know if this will happen or not. However, there is much talk about it. I am convinced that they have tried to mend their finances -- to put it in economists' technical terms. There are also those who have changed their Cuban currency into foreign currencies to protect themselves from a change. [Roque] It is being said that foreign currency exchange rates have increased recently in the black market precisely because of this. [Rodriguez] That is not all. I remember that it used to be said --- before the unions implemented the new system -- that in order to get a table in a restaurant you need to generously bribe the maitre'd. Who can afford a 200, 300, 400, 500-peso bribe to get a table but those who have made that money easily? No one who works for his money can afford to do this. These people corrupt anyone they come in contact with. They corrupt their families, and even their neighbors. [Roque] We need to remain alert. [Rodriguez] Yes. I believe we need to be very alert, need to keep our eyes wide open. The Cuban people should be on the lookout for this type of criminal who nowadays hurts us the most. I believe that all criminals hurt us. However, the wealthy do the most material and moral damage.
