[Meshkov] That is some warm-up! Frankly speaking, I have had no time to think about it. [Troyan] How would you comment on the results of the Ukrainian Supreme Council elections? [Meshkov] Outright fascists in legislative seats are too dangerous for anybody. This is an extremely unfavorable situation for the Crimea. [Troyan] Why did you appeal to the Crimeans not to vote for Ukrainian Supreme Council deputies and to take ballots home instead? [Meshkov] This was an attempt to protect ourselves from the extreme forms of nationalism. [Troyan] How would you assess the preliminary results of the Crimean legislative elections? [Meshkov] The results denied the claims that at the presidential elections our electors, the citizens of the Republic of Crimea, voted against the former administration rather than for a concrete candidate and a concrete program. It has turned out that they voted for the "Russia" bloc. [Troyan] Do you think that this stance is a kind of reproach, a challenge for the Ukrainian leadership, an overt orientation toward Russia, or something else? [Meshkov] This was normal human reaction to the demonstration of extreme nationalist trends tolerated by the current Ukrainian leadership. Thus, the leadership has in a way become a promoter of nationalist policies. This was an attempt to abandon unwise economic and social policies. Besides, the Crimean people are part of the Russian nation. [Troyan] How would you evaluate the results of the Crimean poll? I interpret these results in the following way: Crimeans have embarked on the road to unconditional autonomy. Am I not right? [Meshkov] Crimeans cast their votes for having the right to be the masters of their own fates, to independently build normal and logical economic relations, and to determine the optimal variants of these relations. Over the last two years, economic here reform has been artificially blocked. Unwise tax and customs policies, as well as many other stupid things have been forced on us, although they are absolutely unacceptable for the Crimea. All these measures have been dictated by the ambitions of people with nationalist views. [Troyan] Are you not expecting similar "forcing" on the side of Russia? [Meshkov] I am not. We are speaking about maximizing the ability to pursue independent economic policies in cooperation with both Russia and Ukraine. This is not a drive toward separation, once characteristic of Ukraine in its relations with Russia. On the contrary, this is a desire to unify economies and enter the common economic space with Russia and republics like Kazakhstan, which are ready for such unification. The Crimean citizens are ready for this too, and this was confirmed by recent events. Our people are not driven by purely economic considerations. They also need a new kind of, let me put it this way, labor motivation. When unacceptable barriers are removed between Russia and Crimea, when there are no more customs houses and checkpoints favored only by inefficient officials, everybody will gain from this. [Troyan] If I properly understand what you mean, the Crimea aims to float between Scylla and Charybdis of Russian and Ukrainian problems to achieve a breakthrough in economic reform. [Meshkov] We have potential to carry out reform rapidly. We are not burdened with the gigantic mass of unresolved problems resting on Ukraine's shoulders. Neither do we have problems like those Russia has, given its vast territory and colossal economic structure. [Troyan] Do you believe that the Crimea might become a kind of experimental project, a future model for the expeditious introduction of reform in both Russia and Ukraine? [Meshkov] We do not aim to become a model, the so-called "five-year plan heroes," although we would have nothing against becoming "production leaders." I believe that we will have enough wisdom to choose the most optimal economic scheme, all the more so since we are not limited by any ideological or nationalist restrictions. The influence of the Communist Party in the Crimea, unlike Ukraine and Russia, is virtually minimal. [Troyan] In other words, you believe that Crimeans are standing on the ground of sound pragmatism. [Meshkov] Yes. I would say that Crimean mentality is rather individualistic due to the kind of life that we live. The Crimea has been a melting pot of various civilizations and cultures -- this has always been accepted without antagonism or hindrance. In other words, here we are dealing with a higher degree of self-respect, and thus respect toward other people. [Troyan] Does this mean that your favorite book is Vasiliy Aksenov's "Island Crimea"? [Meshkov, laughing] It is one of my favorites. [Troyan] If this is no secret, what prompted your choice of Mr. Saburov for deputy prime minister? Was that age-long friendship or political sympathy? [Meshkov] It is still too early to talk about this. There are a lot of arguments in favor of Saburov's candidacy.... [Troyan] How long have you known him? [Meshkov, disregarding the question] ....and I accepted these arguments. [passage omitted] [Troyan] Who will form your new Cabinet of Ministers? Will Saburov be granted powers for this? [Meshkov] Of course he will. Saburov and I shared responsibility for the future of economic reform in the Crimea, and now we are going to share responsibility for the forming of the government. [Troyan] In an interview conducted on 27 March, Leonid Kravchuk said: "The Crimea will remain in Ukraine regardless of a further scenario, given that both the Crimea receives drinking water and supplies for sowing from Ukraine." How would you comment on that? [Meshkov] President Kravchuk probably meant something else, but this phrase could be understood as follows: If the Crimea remains in Ukraine, it will have both drinking water and seeds for sowing; if it chooses to live without Ukraine, Ukraine will not supply either water or seeds. I do not like the ambiguity of this statement, because in this case the problem can be posed differently: If Ukraine's attitude toward the Crimea is normal, Ukraine will receive both gas from Turkmenistan and electric power from Russia. The very Dnieper water then, so to say, will be supplied by Russia. I would not like to talk this way; I do not want to accept this unfriendly tone. There would be no unfriendly attitude if we spoke about our share in Ukraine's national wealth. This [Ukraine's] stance is yet more proof that the Crimea is alien to Ukraine. [Troyan] According to President Kravchuk, Ukraine is ready to delegate vast economic powers to the Crimea. Here is another quote from Leonid Kravchuk's interview: "Rumors about the introduction of any other currency are absurd. However, we should remove political issues from the Crimean agenda." [Meshkov] We would be more than happy to remove political issues from the agenda, provided that nobody meddles in our economy. We have no other intentions. [Troyan] Are you going to create a free economic zone? [Meshkov] We are going to create a normal economy and planning to provide it with appropriate legal acts. Our only request is: Do not interrupt us; do not force on us those laws that were adopted to satisfy somebody's whims and have nothing in common with economic principles. If we are permitted we will take care of the Crimean economy without anybody's help. If somebody attempts to exert pressure and reap political dividends from letting us overstep some foolish law; if somebody attempts to use the formal discrepancy between our and Ukrainian normative acts for political pressure, in this case we will react by means of political methods. Political pressure will be neutralized by political resistance. [Troyan] Speaking about political pressure you only mean one side, namely Kiev. Does this mean that you totally dismiss similar actions on the side of Moscow? [Meshkov] I do not expect such actions from the Russian side. It would be blasphemy if somebody told us that we would receive gasoline and lumber only as long as we stay with Russia. [Troyan] Thus, your relations with Russia are developing in a more favorable manner? [Meshkov] No. But the Russian leader will never utter words similar to President Kravchuk's. [Troyan] The press has reported your interest in Mr. Yavlinskiy. What prompted it? [Meshkov] In light of my professional skills (economic issues were treated very seriously at Moscow State University and I have acquired a taste for economy), I believe that I can rather impartially evaluate Mr. Yavlinskiy's propensities and the correctness and logic of his suggestions. That is the source of my deep respect for this talented economist. [Troyan] Does this mean that Yavlinskiy will take part in drafting the economic model of Crimean reform? [Meshkov] I would be extremely grateful to Mr. Yavlinskiy for any kind of assistance. By the way, I want to point out that East European economists are ready to render us similar aid. According to preliminary reports Lady Thatcher is also ready to do so, although she has not confirmed this yet. [Troyan] Are you really determined to ensure simultaneous circulation of both rubles and karbovantsi? There are also rumors about dollars and German marks. [Meshkov] We will be happy to accept yen, guldens, and pounds too. [Troyan] What do your economic advisers say about this? What do they predict? [Meshkov] They predict an inflow of capital. [Troyan] Do Crimeans believe that there will be a stream of foreign investments? [Meshkov] No. There is no euphoria or anticipation of streams of investments. We are ready to provide possibilities to earn money in the Crimea on the basis of mutual advantage and sober calculation. Our citizens will grant assistance. I do not mean exploitation of people. I want to underline that we are devoid of all kinds of ideological dogmas. Participation in developing the Crimean economy is profitable.[passage omitted] [Troyan] Do you guarantee that there will be no corruption in your executive bodies? [Meshkov] I do! [Troyan] How are going to fight this evil phenomenon? As far as I know, humankind has not invented an efficient medicine to cure this disease. [Meshkov] There is medicine, and a very strong one. It will be applied. [passage omitted] [Troyan] Why do you tend to avoid speaking about Mr. Zhirinovskiy? [Meshkov] First of all, because he is my university mate; there exists an unwritten Moscow University brotherhood of a special kind. Secondly, this is undoubtedly a talented person. A certain newspaper reported that I admire Mr. Zhirinovskiy. There is no admiration; however, I developed respect for his political talent regardless of anybody's views. [passage omitted]
