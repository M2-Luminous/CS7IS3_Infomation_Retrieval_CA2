And the British car maker plans to set up a series of multi- million dollar dealerships and service centres in cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. The new company, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of China, will invest in parts plants and training centres, said Ian Skeggs, of Inchape Motors International in Hong Kong. However, a source close to Rolls Royce said it had ruled out manufacturing cars in China because local workers were not as skilled as those in Britain. Demand for the expensive cars in China has been on the rise, prompting the import deal with Inchape, executives said. Michael Donovan, a Rolls Royce managing director, signed the deal with Skeggs yesterday on the Great Wall. "This new venture provides us with a great opportunity to show our confidence in the future, our commitment to Asia in general and China in particular," Donovan said. "It's an indication of the dynamic approach our new re-vitalized company is making to ensure that our future is as glorious as our past." Rolls Royce's has sold 50 cars on the mainland in the past 18 months. Donovan said rising demand has given him confidence in the market. Sales in 1992 hit 10 cars, in 1993, 30 units. And in the first quarter of this year, 11 sedans were sold. The cars cost 1.5 million Yuan ($172,000) each on average, not including the 150 percent tariff they face which boosts the total price tag to about 3.75 million yuan ($430,000). The government early this year cancelled preferential policies, which allowed foreign-funded ventures to buy duty-free imported cars. Donovan said that the tax change will not hamper business because of Rolls' long-term commitment to the country. He denied rumours that Rolls Royce is opening markets in China because business is plummeting in Britain and across the world. After experiencing extreme difficulties in 1991 and 1992, business began to turn around last year, he said. And the first quarter of this year continued the gradual upturn wit 10 percent growth over the same period last year, Donovan said.
