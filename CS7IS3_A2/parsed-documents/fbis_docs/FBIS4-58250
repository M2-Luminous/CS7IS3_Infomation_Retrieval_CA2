Two days ago, the Public Works Department announced that it will invest 2.5 million shekels in building a new road between Ramat Magshimim and Nator. Yesterday, Transportation Minister Yisra'el Qeysar announced that he is allocating 750,000 shekels to solve transportation problems on the Golan. He made the promise in a meeting with the heads of the Golan Regional Council. The current sum is earmarked for works within the Jewish settlements, but Minister Qeysar promised that the government will also invest in improving existing roads and building new ones for the Druze on the Golan. There are currently 18,000 Druze and 12,000 Jewish residents on the Golan. [passage omitted]
