German Deputy Foreign Minister (Helmut Scheffer) will go to Skopje on Monday [28 February] as mediator. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd is expected in Athens tomorrow. Furthermore, the issue of Skopje is expected to be discussed in Brussels at the EU Council of General Affairs. At the same time, EU Commissioner for Foreign Affairs Hans van den Broek had a telephone conversation with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and told him that [FYROM President] Kiro Gligorov's regime considers the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed by Greece as a necessary precondition for the beginning of the process of solving the dispute with Athens. In the meantime, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's answering letter to EU Commission President Jacques Delors and the note with Greece's legal arguments to the European Commission on the issue were presented yesterday in Brussels. Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos stressed that the Greek prime minister's answer to Delors is purely political in character. Regarding the legal issues raised by Delors, the prime minister called attention to the note sent to Brussels by the Greek Government. Venizelos stressed that Greece is the first to wish for the lifting of the measures as quickly as possible, but for this to happen Skopje must give the three practical signs of goodwill that have been set demanded by the Greek side. Prime Minister Papandreou will brief President Konstandinos Karamanlis in the next few days regarding developments on the Skopje issue.
