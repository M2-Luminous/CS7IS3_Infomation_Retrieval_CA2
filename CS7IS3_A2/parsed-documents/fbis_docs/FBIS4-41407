Glazyev's Report Under Discussion at the Economic-Mathematical Studies Center"] [Text] Yet another discussion of the report "Main Guidelines of State Economic Policy," which was drawn up by a group of authors under Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma Committee on Economic Policy, was held yesterday at the Economic-Mathematical Studies Center. The discussion was attended by scientists from the Russian Academy of Sciences, State Duma deputies, officials from various Russian ministries, and also businessmen. Sergey Glazyev's report was devoted to problems concerning reform of the Russian economy and also proposals aimed at improving it. Mr. Glazyev repeated his proposals that the state fine-tune the "mechanism of market self-organization" by regulating markets, supporting enterprises engaged in nonprofitmaking activity, and transferring the management rights over commercial state institutions to a special State Property Fund. The report submitted for discussion also contained proposals aimed at adjusting the pension system, combating inflation, and reversing the slump in production by giving greater subsidies to state-owned enterprises. Speakers from among the report's co- authors suggested, in particular, that the system of tax collection be changed so as to collect half of government revenues by levying charges on the use of natural resources and environmental taxes. In a conversation with your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, Mr. Glazyev also touched on the president's recent economic edicts. In his view, these are steps in the right direction, but some of the edicts are still crude. In his words, laws to be enacted by the Federal Assembly will "set the edicts right." In addition, Boris Yeltsin's edicts were largely based on the 50 bills that were passed to the president by the State Duma last winter "for consultations," the State Duma committee chairman said. Shortly the parliament is scheduled to discuss the first presidential economic packages, draft federal laws, and amendments to existing laws. In particular, they will consider the problems of foreign investment, the customs code, and foreign economic activity. State Duma Deputy Irina Khakamada, member of the "12 December" faction, commented on the discussion of the "guidelines" as follows: "I like in Mr. Glazyev's program the pension proposal whereby people will be paid state pensions that will be set in accordance with a subsistence level, and extra money will be allocated from private pension funds. I cannot imagine, however, how, given the proposed subsidies, state enterprises could compete with each other; moreover, where is the guarantee that another government would be better equipped to tackle the problems the current one cannot solve?"
