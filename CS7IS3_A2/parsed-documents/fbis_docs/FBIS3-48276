There have been reports that protectionism has been emerging in the United States where the U.S. Government and some members of Congress have been exploring ways to revive the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. In reaction, the Keidanren has concluded that as a Japanese economic organization, it needs to work to block those U.S. moves toward protectionism and to call for the promotion of free trade. The Keidanren intends to set up a task force comprised of officials from major industries and enter specific consultations with economic organizations in the United States and European nations. A plan under study by the Keidanren is that the Keidanren, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) in the United States, and the Union des Industries de la Communaute Europeenne (UNICE) [Industrial Union of the European Community] will issue a joint statement this spring at the earliest. With the Uruguay Round accords set to go into effect in mid-1995, there is a fear that European nations and the United Stats would take measures to slap sanctions against their trade partners based on bilateralism in the intervening time. The Keidanren, therefore, intends to call on the U.S. and European governments to rule out protectionism and adhere to the spirit of the accords.
