At the Lusaka talks between the government and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] delegations, the mediator is searching for alternative solutions. This morning, Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola, received in his hotel room in Lusaka the leaders of the two delegations. The meeting lasted some three hours, though nothing has been disclosed about the issues discussed. It is believed the mediator was informed by the negotiators about the meetings they held recently with their respective leaders in Luanda and Huambo. Reliable source believe this morning's meeting adopted the strategy for the resumption of talks interrupted on 20 May. It is also believed that the issues to be dealt with by the government and UNITA negotiators over the next few hours have been outlined. Meanwhile, we have learned that the government and UNITA delegations this morning held separate meetings to adopt a stand on issues relating to national reconciliation, namely UNITA's participation in the running of the country, the status and security of Jonas Savimbi, and the security of senior UNITA officials. The first steps have been slow, with the government and UNITA negotiators carefully choosing their moves. The process could become clearer as of now, but many things may happen in these unpredictable talks.
