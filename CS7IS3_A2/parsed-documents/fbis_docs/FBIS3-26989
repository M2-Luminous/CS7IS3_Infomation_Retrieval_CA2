The Communist Party General-Secretary, Jiang Zemin, and another member of the politburo are likely to visit Israel in the first half of the year. China's ministers of power industry, water resources and construction are also prospective visitors, according to Israeli diplomatic sources. Israel's Minister of Trade and Industry and the Minister of Finance will visit China during the same period. None of the visits will be officially announced until later this month when the Israeli Ministry of Transport releases its report on the death of the Shenyang mayor, Wu Disheng, in a helicopter crash last November. High-level contacts between Beijing and Jerusalem were unofficially suspended after Wu's death. The helicopter crashed after a mysterious explosion shortly after take-off. The Ministry of Transport report is likely to attribute the crash to a "grave technical fault", the source said. Diplomats on both sides say there is no suspicion of sabotage, although Shenyang took the precaution of hiring a lawyer to watch its interests as the investigation proceeded. Beijing signalled its desire to put the matter to rest last month when it appointed the former vice-mayor of Shenyang, Zhang Rongmao, as acting mayor. "We had a good thing going until the accident," one Israeli diplomat said. "We're trying to rebuild the relationship in good taste, but it will only be appropriate after the report is released." Details about the visit by Wu and other Shenyang officials remain unclear, but sources in Shenyang said Zhang Li, the head of the city's economic development zone, who was also killed in the crash, was there to discuss an "Israel technology centre" planned for the zone. Shenyang is home to one of the People's Liberation Army's largest firms, Shanyou Industrial Company, which already has joint technology projects with South Korea and countries in the former USSR. An Israeli diplomat said: "Our ideal project is to bring Israeli technology to China. Shenyang was a good example of where this could have happened." Burgeoning military links between Beijing and Tel Aviv in such fields as fighter aircraft, air-to-air missiles, tanks and airborne radar were revealed by the United States Central Intelligence Agency last October. "Building on a long history of close defence industrial relations ... China and Israel appear to be moving towards formalising and broadening their military technical cooperation," the CIA said. It pointed to recently signed technology exchange deals covering electronics and space as evidence of the growing trend to formalise the relationship. The CIA feared this could lead to a transfer of Western technology to China in violation of Western bilateral pacts with Israel. The Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, who was in Beijing when the CIA report was made public, said the estimate that sales might amount to "several billions of dollars" was grossly exaggerated. In 1992, he said, the figure was about HK$470m [Hong Kong dollars].
