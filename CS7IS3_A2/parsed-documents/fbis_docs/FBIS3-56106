[Kozlov] What do you think of the Duma's first day? [Yavlinskiy] After 3-4 October there was no alternative but to go to the polls, even with all their faults, of which we were aware from the outset. I think that this Duma will do its job if it acts basically as a constitutional body. It must create items of fundamental importance for Russia, such as the electoral law and the civil code; it must prepare Russia to elect a real parliament, the president, and local governments. [Kozlov] But, as of today, is it capable of getting on top of this job? We have already seen how the first few hours went by in a state of tumult... [Yavlinskiy] The Duma today represents a normal parliament in a country riddled with conflict. If you paid a visit to the parliament in, say, South Korea or Taiwan, you would come away with the conviction that, in comparison, today's session went off perfectly smoothly. If this Duma will keep people from shooting at one another, it will have achieved its goal. [Kozlov] Is serious conflict likely to emerge between the deputies and the president? [Yavlinskiy] It is to be hoped that this can be avoided. The Constitution is drafted to confer full powers on the president, so the Duma hardly ever debates issues that impinge on the president's functions. At the same time, however, the president is responsible for what happens in the country. [Kozlov] How long might this Duma be expected to last? [Yavlinskiy] It was elected for a fairly short term, two years. I do not know if it will last the full course, but in any case I do not want to make pessimistic forecasts. If you think that dissolution would be followed by a better Duma, I have grave doubts on the subject. Moreover, we have had extremely tranquil parliaments, a prime example of peace and quiet being the Soviet Parliament, where even votes against the regime were cast in a predetermined scenario. [Kozlov] What would you like your role in the Duma to be? [Yavlinskiy] I want the Duma to perform tasks that I regard as extremely important. Actually, many things in the situation that we are in invite objections and doubts, and these could be handled in one of two ways. A number of inquiries could be opened into a multitude of events and issues, or the situation could be accepted as it is, bearing in mind that, however you look at it, over the next two years Russia must prepare for free democratic elections of both the president and a new, authentic, parliament.
