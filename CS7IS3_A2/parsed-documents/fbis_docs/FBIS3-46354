During the January-October period of 1993, cross-Taiwan Strait trade totaled US$12.52 billion, the official said, adding that Taiwan's foreign trade totaled US$135 billion during the period. However, statistics released by Hong Kong customs showed trade with Mainland China via Hong Kong totaled only US$7.16 billion, up 20.05 percent over the same period of last year. Exports to the mainland via Hong Kong grew 24.1 percent over 1992 tallies to reach US$6.26 billion during the period. While imports from Mainland China through the British colony totaled US$900 million, down 2.13 percent. However, if statistical differences between Hong Kong and BOFT figures are taken into account, Taiwan's exports to Mainland China reached US$11.62 billion during the period, accounting for 16.41 percent of total exports.
