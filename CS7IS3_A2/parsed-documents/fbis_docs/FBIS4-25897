Estimation and Calculation of a Rational Scale for China's 1994 Investment in Fixed Assets Investment in fixed assets is a major aspect of the use of national income. During a certain economic development period, in order to guarantee the sustained and steady development of the national economy, investment in fixed assets should be kept within a certain scale, namely within a rational scale. 1. The lower limit of the rational scale. There are mainly two factors deciding the minimum scale of fixed assets investment. First is the investment used to compensate for the depreciation of fixed assets to maintain the scale of simple reproduction. According to State Statistics Bureau data, and taking into consideration the effect of prices on the replenishment of fixed assets, we estimate the 1994 fixed assets investment needed to compensate for depreciation to be approximately 290 billion yuan. The second factor is the capital input to be put in place in 1994 so that projects which began construction during the past few years can be successfully completed and put into production. This is estimated at approximately 790 billion yuan. The sum of the two, 1.08 trillion yuan, is the rational lower limit of 1994 fixed assets investment volume. 2. The upper limit of the rational scale. The principle for deciding the maximum rational scale is to not cause too much pressure on the national economy and people's living standards. The upper limit to the investment scale is resources which come from national production and income. Because of the large scale increase in China's fixed assets investment during the past two years, the productive fixed assets which can be inputted for use in 1994 has increased 14.3 percent over 1993. Theoretically, one might infer that if all these fixed assets could be used efficiently, the 1994 GDP would increase by 14.3 percent. However, due to various reasons, the GDP increase will be slightly lower. According to our estimates, if efficiency is high, it is possible to reach 13 percent, as in 1993. Since 1981, the average growth of China's GDP has been 9.5 percent and the average investment growth, according to comparable prices, has been 14.7 percent, or 1.55-times the former. If one extrapolates according to this ratio, the investment growth in 1994 could reach 20 percent, that is, the investment increase in terms of physical quantity could reach 1.42 trillion yuan. According to forecasts, the 1994 investment price index will be around 10 percent. That being the case, the currency investment volume, according to the current year's prices, will reach 1.56 trillion yuan. This, then, is the rational upper limit of the 1994 investment scale. 3. The appropriate scale for 1994. According to the above analysis, it can be seen that China's 1994 fixed assets investment scale should be controlled between 1.08 and 1.56 trillion yuan to guarantee the smooth development of the economy and avoid major problems. However, this does not mean that every point within the rational range is suitable for the economic development of China at the current stage. From an optimizing perspective, within this rational range there should be an optimal point. The closer we are to this point, the closer we are to an investment scale most suitable to China's economic development. This optimal point has to be decided according to the concrete situation in China's current development. Seen from the growing trend of fixed assets investment during recent years, because of improvement and rectification, in 1989 and 1990 the investment growth was actually negative and the 1988 level was only regained in 1991. The rapid growth in 1992 still showed certain features of a recovery. People did not feel any economic tension until close to the end of the year because of the substantial accumulation of both material and manpower resources during the previous few years of low-speed growth. The continued growth in 1993, on the other hand, belonged to real high-speed growth, especially since, after the high-speed growth of 1992, material resource accumulation had become low and almost everything relied on the current year's production and imports. This led to rapid price raises for capital goods and triggered price raises in some consumer goods, causing a rather tight situation in the whole national economy. The year 1994 came after the rapid growth of 1992 and 1993. The 1993 investment growth, in particular, made China's investment rate (fixed assets investment of the whole society/GNP) reach as high as 37.8 percent in 1994. This is the highest investment rate since China's reform and opening to the outside world began (see Table 1) and is also very rare abroad. Only Japan, during its high-speed growth of the 1970's, exceeded this rate for one year (1973) (see Table 2).

In terms of economic power it is comparable to Japan in the early 1960's. According to China's situation, and taking foreign experience as a reference, the investment rate is most suitable between 33 and 35 percent. After the high-speed growth of fixed assets investment during 1992 and 1993, China's national economy was already over-stretched, and it was necessary to slightly relax it in 1994. At the same time, taking into consideration the fact that China's economy is still of the investment-propelled type, without a certain amount of investment growth, stagflation will occur and affect the continuous steady development of the entire economy. Therefore, the 1994 investment rate must not drop too much from 1993. After making some calculations, we believe that the most suitable investment rate for 1994 would be if we took the mean of 1992 and 1993, namely, to be controlled at around 35 percent. Based on national economic development plans, China's 1994 GNP at the current year's prices will reach 3.76 trillion yuan. According to a 35 percent investment rate, the scale of fixed assets investment should be controlled at around 1.316 trillion yuan, which is close to the middle point (1.32 trillion yuan) of the above defined rational range, with an increase of 10 percent over last year. II. Forecast of Investment Scale Which May Actually Be Reached in 1994 In 1994, the scale which China's fixed assets investment may actually reach will be mainly determined by three factors: One is the objective need, two is the resource supply capability, and three is the state macroeconomic regulation and control. In terms of objective need, after Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speeches on his southern trip were published, local governments made grand economic development plans during the later half of 1992 or the first half of 1993. Among these, quite a few provinces and municipalities set the goal of catching up with or surpassing the "four small dragons." In order to realize these plans, increased construction projects and investment were unavoidable. The year 1994 is the second or third year for the provinces to implement their plans; it is a stage of ascendancy. Because the central government has delegated quite a bit of the investment power, the local investment based on self-raised funds has became difficult to control. In many places, all the funds raised last year and the year before have been used in construction, thereupon getting into a position of no turning back. Last year the state said that the investment scale was too large and the economy was overheated. However, not a single region considered its own investment scale to be too large or its own economy to be overheated. Therefore, it has been very difficult to ask the local governments to slow down investment. The central government, too, has a need to expand investment. First, given that all localities are launching large projects, it is necessary to expand investment in basic industries to guarantee the coordinated development of the future economy so that the supply capacity of "bottlenecks" can be expanded. Second, in order to guarantee the coordinated development of the whole society while the economy is developing, investment needs to be increased simultaneously in national defense, science and technology, culture, education, health, and sports, as well as environmental protection and other public welfare establishments. Third, in order to reduce regional gaps, investment needs to be increased in poverty-stricken areas. Fourth, investment needs to be made in the reform of the old industrial bases, the construction of commodity grain production bases, the treatment of large rivers, and so on according to national development plans. In terms of the power to supply resources, it has been forecast that China's industrial growth for 1994 will still be above 15 percent. In recent years, China has entered a stage whereby growth in heavy industry has exceeded growth in light industry. The heavy industry, to a large extent, relies on investment and construction to realize its output value. Especially since the demand for investment growth in the past two years has caused a large scale investment increase in some industries producing materials for investment, such as metallurgy, construction materials, and so on, a growth in production capacity for these industries in 1994 can support a rather large increase in investment. Therefore, seen from the demand and ability to supply resources, we are still equipped with the conditions for high-speed growth in fixed assets investment in 1994. If not controlled, there will be no problem in achieving a 15 percent growth in physical quantity. And if we consider the 10 percent investment price coefficient, then the increase in the volume of currency will exceed 26.5 percent, reaching 1.5 trillion yuan or even higher. Although this scale is within the rational range defined above, it exceeds the most suitable figure by nearly 200 billion yuan and will raise the investment rate to 39.9 percent. This will certainly put pressure on the national economy. In order to reduce pressure on the national economy caused by the investment growth, the state, beginning in early 1994, has taken a series of soft-landing regulation and control measures. For instance, the state leaders have repeatedly talked about the danger of over-investment at National People's Congress meetings and on other occasions; the central authorities have issued circulars to control the scale of investment, demanding the tightening of the examination and approval of projects, the screening of development zones, the control of loan scale, the prohibition of chaotic fundraising, etc. Seen from the fact that, in the first quarter of this year the investment material market is basically balanced as to supply and demand and that prices are stable, and seen from other information relevant to investment growth, the abovementioned measures have achieved some results. If this trend develops, then it is possible to control the total amount of 1994 fixed assets investment at around 1.4 trillion yuan and lower the price index of investment material to under 7 percent. III. Analysis of the 1994 Investment Structure and Efficiency Because the market mechanism's guidance over investment has gradually become stronger, and the governments at various levels have gained a better understanding of the importance of infrastructure, such as transportation and post and telecommunications, the percentage of investment in tertiary industries in 1992 and 1993 grew continuously, especially in transportation and post and telecommunications. This is both suitable to the adjustment of the industrial orientation in China and beneficial to alleviating "bottleneck" industries. One can say that the investment structure is changing in a rational direction. Seen from the current situation, this change will be maintained during 1994. Because the state will raise the prices of some energy products systematically during 1994, the percentage drop in investment in the energy industry during the past two years will be alleviated or stopped. However, some problems will still occur in the investment structure during 1994. First, the investment decisionmakers in some regions lack a holistic concept. They choose where to invest with only local and current markets in mind, so that they over-invest in some industries the products of which are currently in great demand and which yield huge profits--for instance the real estate industry--while investing little or not at all in industries whose products currently do not seem be in great demand or which are more difficult to build, such as high-tech products or industries in which China is still comparatively backward and which produce upgraded mechanical equipment and special raw materials. Second, some places have begun too many new infrastructure projects which, due to insufficient financial ability, may lead to delays in completion or cause them to lie idle after construction. For example, almost all coastal cities are now launching port projects. The occurrence of these situations is hard to avoid. The establishment of a socialist market economic system and the intensive competition of many products in the market in recent years have already caused the majority of investment decisionmakers to begin to pay attention to the efficiency of investment. Seen from the actual situation of the past two years, efficiency still remains an important problem to be resolved energetically in China's investment field. Currently, there are still many investment decisionmakers who lack scientific decisionmaking concepts. In order to launch projects quickly, they neglect feasibility analyses, which are vital to guaranteeing the efficiency of construction projects, or only perfunctorily put up a show for others to see. Such careless decisionmaking cannot guarantee the efficiency of investment. Scale, structure, and efficiency are the three major problems in the field of investment. Of the three, efficiency plays a decisive role. If an investment has good efficiency, the larger its scale, the larger its contribution to future economic development. This should be encouraged. To pay attention to efficiency, it is necessary to conduct good feasibility analyses when deciding on a project and to forecast future markets, the supply of productive resources, and the efficiency of production. If one makes decisions only after one is convinced that satisfactory results can be obtained, then one will not blindly launch projects and expand the investment scale but will reduce industrial imbalances and propel the investment structure towards a rational industrial structure. Therefore, to pay attention to investment efficiency is the key to solving all three problems in the field of investment at the same time. To sum up, we believe that in 1994, apart from adopting methods such as tightening control on the tap of capital to avoid excessive inflation of the investment scale, we should raise the level of project decisionmaking and add investment efficiency as one of the major goals of macroeconomic regulation and control. By implementing the investment restructuring plan raised in the "Decision by the CPC Central Committee Concerning Several Issues in the Socialist Market Economic System," we should "gradually establish risk responsibility for corporate investment and bank credit and loans." We should form, as fast as possible, a system unifying responsibility, authority, and benefits, which will restrict the actions of investors. We should further perfect supporting institutions, such as the publication of information, consultancy, examination and approval of feasibility reports, etc., and thus create conditions for scientific decisionmaking on projects.
