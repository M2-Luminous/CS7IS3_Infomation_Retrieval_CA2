FR940414-2-00004 FR940414-2-00002 The practice of placing bait (food or scent to attract wildlife) is a hunting activity subject to State laws and regulations. The baiting of bears is particularly controversial. While the total number of States allowing bear baiting has declined, State fish and wildlife agencies permit the baiting of black bear as a hunting activity in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin,and Wyoming. The Forest Service intends to work diligently through its ongoing cooperative efforts to encourage the States to evaluate their regulation of the practice of baiting bears. In the meantime, the agency is issuing proposed policy regarding the use of bait on National Forest System lands. In the past, some national forests have regulated the placement of bear baits by requiring hunters and commercial guides to obtain special use authorizations in order to prevent conflicts with other users or other problems associated with the location and removal of bait. Additionally, some Forest Service Regions have issued orders under 36 CFR part 261 to control litter, as well as to close certain areas to bear baiting where the practice would create unacceptable adverse effects on other resources or forest users. Special use authorizations for bear baiting had been issued on a number of national forests in Wyoming. Typically, those special use authorizations included conditions with which the holder had to comply to minimize adverse effects created by placement of bear bait. In early 1992, the Forest Service's role in the regulation of bear baiting on the national forests in Wyoming became an issue. In March 1992, the Regional Foresters for the Rocky Mountain and Intermountain Regions issued a joint closure order prohibiting bear baiting in the national forests in Wyoming, unless the baiting activity was conducted in compliance with the requirements of the order pertaining to the placement and disposal of baits. Like the conditions that previously had been included in special use authorizations, the requirements of the order were intended to minimize adverse effects on forest resources and users. The Fund for Animals and the Friends of the Bow brought suit to challenge the Forest Service's closure order and to challenge what Plaintiffs considered a shift in established policy, that is, no longer requiring special use authorizations for bear bait placement and using closure orders instead ( The Fund for Animals v. Robertson (D.D.C. Civ. No.92&hyph;1694&hyph;TPJ)). These groups perceived this shift in method as a diminution in the level of Forest Service regulation and wildlife protection. The parties settled the case upon the Forest Service's decision to rescind the closure order and, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, to analyze the effects of eliminating the practice of issuing special use authorizations for the placement of bear bait on National Forest System lands in Wyoming. The Regions then prepared an Environmental Assessment to disclose effects of the proposed action and alternatives to that proposal. Upon completion of the Environmental Assessment and issuance of a Decision Notice by the Rocky Mountain and Intermountain Regional Foresters in April 1993, there were new challenges to the agency's position. Subsequently, the Deputy Chief for the National Forest System decided that national direction was needed to end the conflict and controversy. Accordingly, the Decision Notice was rescinded, and bear baiting in national forests in Wyoming was prohibited pending issuance of national direction. An interim policy was issued by the Forest Service, on March 4, 1994, and published in the Federal Register on March 14, 1994. On March 28, 1994, a lawsuit was filed by the fund for Animals and others, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging, in part, the absence of a public comment period prior to issuance of the interim policy. In a stipulation to stay proceedings in the suit, the agency agreed to withdraw the interim policy and republish it as proposed with a 60-day public comment period prior to issuance of a final policy. As a result, effective March 30, 1994, the Forest Service policy on bear baiting reverted to that which was in effect prior to the interim policy of March 14. Proposed Policy The Forest Service special use authorization regulations at 36 CFR 251.50 exempt noncommercial use and occupancy, including ``hunting,'' from the special use authorization requirement. Since hunting methods subject to State regulation are included within the term ``hunting,'' the proposed policy makes explicit that, where State regulations permit baiting, the Forest Service would prohibit the practice of issuing a special use authorization for the practice of baiting connected with hunting on National Forest System lands. However, outfitter and guide activities still require special use authorization and, as a condition of that authorization, outfitters and guides must comply with applicable State laws and regulations as well as any applicable Forest Service closure orders.
