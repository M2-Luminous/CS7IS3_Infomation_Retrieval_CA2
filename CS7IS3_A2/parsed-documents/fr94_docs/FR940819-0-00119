FR940819-0-00119 FR940819-0-00020 For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Department of Transportation amends Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, part 40, as follows: PART 40_PROCEDURES FOR TRANSPORTATION WORKPLACE DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING PROGRAMS 1. The authority citation for 49 CFR Part 40 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 102,301,322; 49 U.S.C. app. 1301nt., app. 1434nt., app. 2717, app. 1618a. §40.3 [Amended] 2. In §40.3, the definition of the term ``EBT'' is amended by changing the period at the end of the definition to a comma and by adding the following: ``and identified on the CPL as conforming with the model specifications available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Office of Alcohol and State Programs.'' 3. Section 40.23(a) is revised to read as follows: §40.23 Preparation for testing. * * * * * (a) Use of the drug testing custody and control form prescribed under this Part. This form is found in Appendix A to this part. Employers and other participants in the DOT drug testing program may not modify or revise this form, except that the drug testing custody and control form may include such additional information as may be required for billing or other legitimate purposes necessary to the collection, provided that personal identifying information on the donor (other than the social security number or other employee ID number) may not be provided to the laboratory. Donor medical information may appear only on the copy provided to the donor. * * * * * 4. §40.25(c) is revised to read as follows: §40.25 Specimen collection procedures. * * * * * (c) Chain of Custody. The chain of custody block of the drug testing custody and control form shall be properly executed by authorized collection site personnel upon receipt of specimens. Handling and transportation of urine specimens from one authorized individual or place to another shall always be accomplished through chain of custody procedures. Since specimens and documentation are sealed in shipping containers that would indicate any tampering during transit to the laboratory and couriers, express carriers, and postal service personnel do not have access to the chain of custody forms, there is no requirement that such personnel document chain of custody for the shipping container during transit. Nor is there a requirement that there be a chain of custody entry when a specimen which is sealed in such a shipping container is put into or taken out of secure storage at the collection site prior to pickup by such personnel. This means that the chain of custody is not broken, and a test shall not be canceled, because couriers, express carriers, postal service personnel, or similar persons involved solely with the transportation of a specimen to a laboratory, have not documented their participation in the chain of custody documentation or because the chain of custody does not contain entries related to putting the specimen into or removing it from secure temporary storage at the collection site. Every effort shall be made to minimize the number of persons handling specimens. 5. In §40.25(e)(2)(i), the words ``32 ○&hyph;38 ○ C/90 ○&hyph;100 ○ F'' are substituted for the words ``32.5 ○&hyph;37.7 ○ C/90.5 ○&hyph;99.8 ○ F''. 6. §40.25(f)(10)(ii)(B) and (C) are revised to read as follows: §40.25 Specimen collection procedures. * * * * * (f) *␣*␣* (10) *␣*␣* (ii) *␣*␣* (B)( 1 ) If a collection container is used, the collection site person, in the presence of the donor, pours the urine into two specimen bottles. Thirty (30) ml shall be poured into one specimen bottle, to be used as the primary specimen. At least 15 ml shall be poured into the other bottle, to be used as the split specimen. ( 2 ) If a single specimen bottle is used as a collection container, the collection site person, in the presence of the donor, shall pour 15 ml of urine from the specimen bottle into a second specimen bottle (to be used as the split specimen) and retain the remainder (at least 30 ml) in the collection bottle (to be used as the primary specimen). (C) Nothing in this section precludes the use of a collection method or system that does not involve the physical pouring of urine from one container or bottle to another by the collection site person, provided that the method or system results in the subdivision of the specimen into a primary (30 ml) and a split (at least 15 ml) specimen that can be transmitted to the laboratory and tested in accordance with the requirements of this Subpart. * * * * * 7. In §40.25(f)(13), the words ``32 ○&hyph;38 ○ C/90 ○&hyph;100 ○ F'' are substituted for the words ``32.5 ○&hyph;37.7 ○ C/90.5 ○&hyph;99.8 ○ F''.
