The Sixth Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, which opened today, will deliberate the draft decision to authorize the people's congress and its Standing Committee in Xiamen to formulate laws and regulations, and the Xiamen People's Government to issue decrees for the special economic zone. The NPC Law Committee said that Xiamen, one of the earliest special economic zones in China, has been authorized by the State Council to implement some free port policies and appointed to be a pilot SEZ for urban economic structural reform. With China opening wider to the outside world, especially with more contacts across the Taiwan Straits, Xiamen has become an important "window" in developing economic and trade ties with Taiwan and foreign countries. The draft decision will be submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth NPC, which falls on March 10, for further deliberation. The NPC Law Committee said that the draft decision was initiated by more than 60 NPC deputies from Fujian Province.
