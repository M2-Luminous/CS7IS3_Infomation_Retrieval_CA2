It's a matter of removing obstacles on the way for the signing of a military-technical protocol and a larger political agreement, said Kazimirov in an interview to Interfax in Baku. He believes that each side of the conflict has its own proposals for the Russian settlement plan and now it is necessary to draw closer the positions. Kazimirov said that Baku urges for the earliest withdrawal of the Armenian forces from the Azeri territories they occupied. For its part, the Armenian side insists on the beginning of the negotiations on the status of Nagorno Karabakh. Kazimirov is expected to return to Baku from Yerevan. The three-stage plan for the settlement of the Karabakh conflict envisages the establishment of a lasting ceasefire, the withdrawal of the troops from the occupied territories, the exchange of POWs, hostages, the remains of the killed, the resumption of operation of transport and energy communications, the return of the refugees and political talks on the future legal status of Nagorno Karabakh.
