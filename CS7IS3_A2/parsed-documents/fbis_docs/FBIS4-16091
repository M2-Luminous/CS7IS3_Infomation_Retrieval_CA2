The decision stipulates that bank notes issued by the Central Bank of Russia will no longer be accepted for any form of payment anywhere in the Republic from 15 April onward. However, commercial organizations and enterprises, as well as private individuals, will be allowed to sell goods and services for freely convertible currency. Exchange rates between the sum coupon, the national currency, and foreign currencies will be fixed in regular auctions at the Uzbek currency exchange, bearing in mind the need to maintain parity between prices on the domestic and foreign markets. In order to establish a gold and hard currency reserve in the country, all enterprises, irrespective of their form of ownership, will now be obliged to sell the Central Bank 30 percent of their hard currency earnings. From 1 May, all Uzbekistan's settlements with CIS countries will be transacted solely through clearing or in freely convertible currency.
