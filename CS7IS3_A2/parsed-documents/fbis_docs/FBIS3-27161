It was also necessary to maintain other UN protected areas -- referring to Mostar and Tuzla, the Russian minister, who arrived here today for a two-day visit, told a news conference after meeting with his Hungarian counterpart Geza Jeszenszky. He added, however, that the final aim of the Russian government was the normalization of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Moscow expected to achieve it with cooperation from the United States, the European Union and Germany. Geza said the restoration of peace in Sarajevo was not only in the interests of Hungary and Russia, but also in the interests of the whole region and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). There existed opportunities to extend the scope of the cease-fire, which would finally result in a political settlement of the conflict in the region, he noted. Kozyrev is due to hold talks with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz and Prime Minister Peter Boros to discuss bilateral relations and the NATO threat of air strikes against Bosinan Serb positions around Sarajevo. A NATO ultimatum for Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo or face air strikes expired at 00:00 GMT Monday [21 February] but the NATO did not take immediate action.
