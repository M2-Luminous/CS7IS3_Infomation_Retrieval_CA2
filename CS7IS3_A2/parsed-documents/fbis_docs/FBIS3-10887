General Reynaldo Andino Flores, defense and public security minister, said the Honduran Armed Forces will make their share of sacrifices by accepting their budget cut. The budget earmarked for defense in 1994 totals over 250 million lempiras (a little over $30 million), as approved by the Congress. Independent sources, however, indicated that in reality the defense budget is more than 600 million lempiras (over $70 million), since the military budget is increased through internal transfer mechanisms. On Monday, President Reina announced a 10-percent reduction in the general budget of the central government and autonomous institutions. The entire public budget, including the central government and autonomous institutions, totals approximately 12 billion lempiras ($1.5 billion), meaning 1.2 billion lempiras ($150 million) will be cut from the budget.
