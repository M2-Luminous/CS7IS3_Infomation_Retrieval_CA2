The rate of ex-convicts who commit crimes after their release is less than 8 per cent, one of the lowest in the world, said Wang Mingdi, director of the ministry's reform-through-labour bureau. He attributed this success to China's system of reforming offenders through labour and reeducation. "We are always trying our best to reform them into productive citizens," he said. In recent years, the government has paroled or reduced terms for 22 per cent of inmates for good behaviour. China has 1.25 million prisoners, including 334 from abroad. Felons that receive terms over 10 years or those unable to perform manual labour are kept in prisons. The rest are sent to labour camps. Wang said prisoners are provided with meals and accommodation that cost the government a monthly 60 yuan ($6.90) per person. For foreigners kept in Chinese jails, the government spends twice as much, according to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Prison. Those who work receive between 30 yuan ($3.45) and 60 yuan ($6.9) a month. "I am content with life here, and the food is sufficient," said Cheng Ying, a 21-year-old woman inmate at the Shanghai Women's Prison. "All I want now is to better behave myself, and get out of prison at an earlier date," added Cheng, who was serving a two-year term for housing prostitution activities. Better Behaviour All inmates in China are required to work in prison factories or attend labour reform camps. "Going for work is conducive to preparing them for once they walk out of here," said Wang. Prisoners usually work six to eight hours a day except on weekends and public holidays. And they are also required to attend study sessions for two to three hours a day, Wang said. This includes political and legal education, elementary schooling and recreational activities. Libraries, reading rooms, karaoke bars and video rooms have also been set up for prisoners. Each year 150,000 inmates receive high school diplomas and 100,000 get technical certification from labour organizations. Special groups have even been established to encourage inmates to play musical instruments, sing and paint. Inmates from abroad also enjoy such treatment, Wang said.
