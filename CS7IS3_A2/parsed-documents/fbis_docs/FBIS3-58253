The prime minister found it hard to conceal a certain irritation at his news conference, preferring to stress the "excellent" relations and the "convergence of views" between these "two friendly countries." Admittedly, his office had been careful to adopt a low profile before his departure for Riyadh and not to make any reference to a framework accord, speaking instead of a new "reorientation" of bilateral relations. But during the flight to Saudi Arabia, Gerard Longuet [foreign trade minister], Francois Leotard [defense minister], and Alain Juppe [foreign affairs minister] displayed what proved to be excessive optimism less than 24 hours later. Apart from the important diplomatic aspect of the visit, the only commercial benefit to come out of the prime minister's trip will have been the confirmation "in principle" by the Saudis to uphold the three maintenance contracts as planned: the ROH [expansion unknown] program for frigates purchased in 1980, a contract concerning pyrotechnics, and a contract relating to the Shahine self-propelled missile sold by Thomson in 1984. "An agreement in principle," stressed the prime minister's office, worth approximately 9 billion French francs [Fr]. It now remains to finalize the details. The Matignon [prime minister's office] pointed out that the timetable of work and financial terms of the contract remained to be settled. A joint committee of experts will be charged with this task. By contrast, no precise agreements have been reached regarding the Sawari-2 program (purchase of three new antiaircraft frigates, for some Fr20 billion). Nothing either about the Airbus which Paris wants to sell to Riyadh to renew -- at least in part -- its civil air fleet. "The Airbus is on the list of matters of common interest," was the prime minister's sober comment. Nothing yet either on the other potential major civil contracts, such as the RAMS mobile telephony project (Thomson-CSF), or the installation of 1 million telephone lines which Alcatel is hoping for. As to the petroleum deal, it appears that these are the negotiations which are proceeding the most slowly. Nevertheless, Paris sees the confirmation of this week's visit to France by Muhammad Bin-Fahd -- the king's son and governor of the Western province with its rich oil resources -- as a positive sign. But how are we to explain what appears to be a semifailure on the part of French trade diplomacy? Gerard Longuet believes that "the Saudis do not want to go any further" for the time being to concentrate on intergovernmental relations, while the Matignon points out that a factor which could explain this "slowdown" could quite simply be the economic problems which Saudi Arabia is now also facing. It is true that it announced last week a 20-percent cut in expenditure for 1994. Also, on the eve of Edouard Balladur's arrival in Riyadh, it asked three of its U.S. arms suppliers to extend payment terms.
