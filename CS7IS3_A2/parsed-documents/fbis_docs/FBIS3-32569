The chief justice indicated efforts are being made to improve implementation of the law. If necessary, changes will be made, even if it means removing judges who do not adhere to the letter of the law. Let us listen to Rivera. [Begin recording] [Rivera] We would have to analyze the whole document to see to what they are referring when they make those statements. [Sauceda] Why isn't an analysis of the real situation of Honduran justice made in that document? [Rivera] We are coping with the real situation of justice with the seriousness the case warrants, regardless of what the document says. The current government's goal is to implement the moral revolution announced by President Carlos Roberto Reina. As I said, regardless of what the government may say, we are prepared to improve justice so that it is a true justice meted out by just, honest, and competent judges. [Sauceda] Are you saying you will fire all judges involved in corruption? [Rivera] Of course. If it is confirmed they are corrupt, they will be arraigned in criminal court. [Sauceda] This report claims that the law does not apply to the rich with political power but only to those without money or influence. [Rivera] I must clarify that this report does not say that. It refers to the previous Supreme Court. When this report came out, we had not yet been elected to the Court. [Sauceda] But you intend to clean the dirty face of justice? [Rivera] As I said before, that is our intention. [Sauceda] Will you answer the State Department document? Is it worth it or are they lying? [Rivera] As I said before, this report does not refer to the Court over which I preside over but a previous Court. [Sauceda] But what are you doing? [Rivera] We are trying to change and improve the whole system. When the report said civilian justice is weak, we do not know whether it refers to civilian justice or justice administered by civilian authorities. In this case, there is the criminal justice, which is the one that interests the State Department most. [Sauceda] Will you reply to this document? [Rivera] I cannot give you an answer at this point. We are going to study it first and if necessary we will reply. [Sauceda] Why does the United States, not those responsible for Hondruan justice, prepare this kind of report? [Rivera] [Words indistinct] used to preparing that kind of report and investigate. [Sauceda] What do you think of U.S. interference in Honduran affairs? [Rivera] No, they cannot intervene... [pauses] That is a report they issue to all the people. [Sauceda] Is it possible to change the bad image [words indistinct] Honduran people? [Rivera] That is the intention all fellow justices have. [Sauceda] How will this be done? [Rivera] By choosing the most capable and honest judges who are ready to implement the law. [Sauceda] Do we have honest judges here? [Rivera] Of course, yes. There must be honest people here. [Sauceda] Will you respect the judiciary? [Rivera] We will respect it in the measure that judges fulfill their duties. [Sauceda] Did all justices close their lawyer's offices? [Rivera] I suppose so. My office has been closed since last June. [Sauceda] The population is expectant over the offers made during the campaign by the politicians who are now in office. What do you say? Is law going to be applied now? [Rivera] Of course. That is our intention. Otherwise, we would have not accepted this post. [end recording]
