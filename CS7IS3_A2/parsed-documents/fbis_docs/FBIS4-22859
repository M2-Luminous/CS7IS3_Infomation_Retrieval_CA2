Chernyshov] [Text]The telephone situation in the homeland is not in need of commentary. More than 60,000 towns that have a population of up to 50 inhabitants do not have telephone service. The Russian Communications Ministry is attempting to find acceptable options to escape this communications deadlock. In the beginning of December in Yoshkar-Ola, Russian telecommunications workers met with specialists from the Agriculture Ministry to discuss telephone communications problems in the rural areas of Russia. For the former Communications Ministry of the Soviet Union, state and collective farms were always the main focus of attention. The money that was sent was centralized in these locations, and it was primarily here that systems of internal industrial communications were created. To a certain degree, this helped to provide telephone service to other public facilities in the countryside, such as hospitals, clubs and the post office. Approximately 200,000 new telephone numbers were introduced each year. This number is small, but it has now dropped to 75,000- 80,000 overall. The Soviet Union Communications Ministry was essentially a gigantic monopoly. The communications industry is one of the largest and most profitable throughout the world. Its yearly volume of products and services is 260 million dollars. Despite the fact that the Communications Ministry brought large revenues to the state, it was treated like a step-daughter. ``Now, so-called analogue communications equipment predominates here,'' Deputy Minister Aleksandr Krupnov attests. These obsolete systems require large industrial rooms and are not reliable or cost-effective. Only 2% of Russian communications equipment meets world standards to one degree or another. The Russian Communications Ministry now feels that its main function should not be financing, but regulating relations between all organizations involved in this field. The main missions involve issuing certificates and licenses to those commercial organizations which want to work in the communications business. ``Today, about 700 enterprises have already received an operating license,'' Aleksandr Krupnov notes. For now they do not have a very large percentage of the work. Special hopes are placed on foreign capital in the communications industry. It is thought that foreign firms, and far from minor ones at that, will be expressing significant interest in Russia. Adding to what the deputy minister said, the development of communications equipment was heavily dependent on foreign deliveries, as it turned out in the former U.S.S.R. For example, we received more than 65% of automatic telephone stations and 30% of cable from overseas. Among foreign partners, there were many enterprises from the Comecon countries. Today, preference is given to such leaders as Alcatel, Bell, and Siemens, if the latter propose profitable contracts, of course. The second strategic line of the Russian Communications Ministry is to have the local municipal administrations agree to all tariffs for communications services. The cost of the services should reimburse operating expenses for the communications systems, pay for credits, and ensure funds accumulate for developing communications networks. This means that no funds will be used from the federal budget for these purposes. On the surface, this approach seems rational, but in practice it is difficult to implement. In the middle of 1993, the Moscow City Telephone Network established fairly unusual tariffs. For state organizations 80 rubles for each line per month was established. For a private telephone, a little more than 100 rubles was charged, and for all others 1,500 rubles. It is not the numbers themselves that are important here since they change constantly, but their ratios. According to Mr. Krupnov, there is a certain logic at play here. For state locations, the lowest prices are established because there is no point in pumping money in the budget from one pocket to another. Those who have telephones in their homes should receive social protection, and commercial organizations should pay ``whole hog,'' and even more than that, because any prices for them are still just a drop in the bucket. At one time the Moscow City Telephone Network installed 140,000-150,000 new home and other telephone numbers per year. Today that number is 40,000-50,000. Many districts of the capitol suffer from total ``telephone silence,'' to say nothing of the suburbs, where the population density is incidentally no less than that of Moscow itself. There is much talk about creating a system of fiber-optic communications rings along the capitol boulevards, the Garden Ring road, the circle road and even throughout the Golden Ring. This network will ostensibly provide for more widespread telephone service in the capitol and the region. ``It is not worth becoming too carried away,'' Mr. Krupnov warns. ``Even though fiber-optic cables have enormous capacity compared to traditional cables, in and of themselves they cannot resolve the problem.'' Installing such lines will make it possible to forget about communications for the next 10-15 years, but all the rest must also be available, in addition to the communications channels. For example, virtually all the telephone numbers in Moscow have been selected. Therefore, new automatic telephone stations must be constructed, and other necessary equipment purchased. Unfortunately, we are in no condition to do this ourselves. The technical level of even our major communications equipment manufacturers does not meet modern standards. The defense industries which are now converting to the manufacture of civilian products also do not instill hope. Economic reasons remain the stumbling block. Of course, the Communications Ministry feels that it is possible to develop the most modern concept for providing telephone service for both highly populated and sparsely habitable regions of Russia. Foreign investors must be drawn in. In fact this is what is being done. However, without state support it is unlikely that communications will get on its feet.
