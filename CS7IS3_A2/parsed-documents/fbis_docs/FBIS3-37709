This document was signed by the representative of Nagorno-Karabakh, Bako Saakyan as well. The meeting was mediated by Russian Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev. TURAN's Moscow's correspondent was told by the Russian Defense Minister that this document could be called "a protocol on intentions". It means that "the parties expressed their wish to cease hostilities, withdraw troops and withdraw from all occupied territories". Until now, an agreement defining the specifics has not been adopted yet. Presently, military experts are working on a draft of these agreements. The same source says that preliminary results of the work will be officially announced by the end of February and a cease-fire will be declared officially on March 1. At the same time, a reliable employee from the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs told TURAN's reporter that "it is too early speak about that, since it is doubtful that both parties will agree to and implement the adopted obligations. The Armenian party has violated all earlier concluded agreements and occupies Azerbaijani territory", said the employee of the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It should be mentioned that the Russian peace initiative which special envoy of the Russian President, Vladimir Kazimirov, put forward in January for all intents and purposes coincides with the terms mentioned in the protocol of the Defense Ministers. Geydar Aliyev opposes Moscow's initiative. The strict position of Pavel Grachev and his demands that the parties accept the terms of the truce, suggest that he is likely to force Baku [to] accept Moscow's conditions. These facts are confirmed by the fighting in the Kelbadzharskiy region of Azerbaijan. According to sources in the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry, special Russian troops took part in recent fighting against Azerbaijan. There are Russian troop divisions located in Armenia. The latest Armenian success in the Kelbadzharskiy region would have been impossible without the participation of Russian troops, say military observers of the Azerbaijan Defense Ministry. Russia once more applies the infamous carrot and stick to achieve its political aims. Pavel Grachev wants to pursue this policy having already succeeded diplomatically in Georgia.
