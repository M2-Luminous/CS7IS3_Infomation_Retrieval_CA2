The program combines an interview with Churkin with biographical facts and pictures of Churkin at work. In the introductory extract, Churkin says of the threatened air strikes on Bosnia: "If it had happened, if air strikes had been carried out, that would have been regarded inside Russia as a national humiliation, and I thought this was simply inadmissible." Churkin is asked by the interviewer to describe his most unpleasant impressions from his latest visit to Sarajevo. He replies: "My most unpleasant impression was linked with the mass media. Generally I associate myself with the most fervent supporters of freedom of speech and a free press. But what I saw there forced me to think a little more deeply about the responsibility of journalists as well. This is because on 20 February, on Sunday, about 300 journalists arrived, all the world's leading TV companies and others besides. Most of the journalists who arrived were war specialists, and they had come to film a war, to film air strikes. On the Sunday, when I gave a news conference with Izetbegovic, when we addressed the media after our meeting, the situation was extremely tense. The press was demanding air strikes. And I must say that that frightened me a little, not theoretically but simply practically, because there were still some unclear points, and it was impossible to completely rule out the worst at that time. The fact that their mood was broadcast on TV screens to the whole world could in one way or another have influenced the most serious political decisions. "I tried as best I could at the news conference in Sarajevo to defuse the passions, and we do not really know for sure how successful I was, but the next day the mood of the journalists had changed a great deal. Not because of me of course, but because the television journalists in particular had had to spend the whole night on the roof waiting for air strikes, even though it was already clear to everyone by about 2100 the previous evening that everything was all right and that there would be no air strikes. "So you see, there are complex and ambiguous aspects in your profession as well." Churkin admits that during his talks with the Serbs, the situation seemed "almost hopeless." "However, it must also be said that I was holding a great trump-card -- the letter from the president containing both a request to the Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons from Sarajevo and our pledge to then send our troops to the Sarajevo region. If I had not succeeded, holding such a trump-card, in having such a brilliant proposal accepted by the other party at the talks, that would of course have been a colossal blow for me as a professional. So it was indeed a fairly tense moment." Churkin says he did regard the operation as a personal success, but adds emphatically that it was "a huge success for the Foreign Ministry, in which the collective working on this situation performed outstandingly well." He praises in particular the contribution made by Deputy Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. "Everyone joined in and managed, in an extreme situation and in a short period of time, to carry out a complex diplomatic operation." Asked how he explains his rapid rise to the post of deputy foreign minister at the age of 42, Churkin says he has always studied hard and he has always said what he thinks. He describes himself as "democratically oriented," but adds that he has never felt the need to participate in political movements. Asked about his special strengths and weaknesses as a diplomat, he says he is able to communicate with the most diverse people, but that he regrets not having learned French well. The program ends with more general questions about Churkin's likes and dislikes and words of praise for Churkin from the correspondent.
