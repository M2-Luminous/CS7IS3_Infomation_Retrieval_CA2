As far as timing goes, today's meeting takes on great importance, happening as it does when eyes full of hope and expectation are focused on the Mideast peace process and on ways to overcome obstacles to the process. The meeting is also significant from the political and historical perspective because Syrian-U.S. relations have always been sensitive. The relationship has been unique and fluctuating but it has never been tense to the point of estrangement and never improved to the point of reconciliation and harmony. Hence, the importance of the summit meeting, especially as it takes place at a time when a comprehensive peace and nations' prosperity are a broad international desire, not just limited regional demands. The U.S.-Syrian summit is truly a summit for Mideast peace. Its timing means the world is reiterating its commitment to establish a comprehensive and just peace in this strategic part of the world. It also means a renewal of international insistence on removing obstacles and solving problems that obstruct genuine progress toward peace. Proceeding from this concept, the U.S. and Syrian sides agreed to hold the summit. The United States under President Bill Clinton today raises the slogan of a just peace as a course for a new world order in which Washington plays a primary, effective role in handling international politics. When the situation requires advancing the Mideast peace effort and convincing Israel of the importance of a comprehensive and just peace based on UN resolutions and the principle of land for peace, that is, a complete withdrawal in exchange for a full peace, the U.S. role becomes important and necessary for our Arab nations to achieve the goals of regaining their land and rights without compromising their pan-Arab causes and just demands. Look at the political and media uproar created a few days ago--in Israel or the United States--by circles opposed to improved Syrian- U.S. relations. By casting doubt about the Syrian stance on peace to spoil the summit's atmosphere and mar the political climate in which the Clinton-al-Asad talks are held, these circles showed that they recognize the importance of the Syrian role in the Mideast peace process. With its political weight and military might, Syria is one of the key influential states in the region playing a primary role in the peace process that cannot be ignored. If Damascus has explained clearly its firm stance based on a comprehensive peace and on the need to achieve it based on the UN resolutions and the principle of land for peace and on the consideration that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles is a first step that should be followed by similar steps on other tracks to achieve a comprehensive peace, these hostile circles' doubts about the Syrian stance become meaningless and the accusations fail to achieve their aims. The U.S.-Syrian summit is a positive step in favor of peace. The agreement to coordinate views and define the principles of a peaceful settlement between Syria and Israel, which basically relies on Israel's complete withdrawal from the Golan in exchange for Syria normalizing its ties with Israel within the framework of a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, is indeed a positive push toward achieving a comprehensive and just peace. It is also a positive effort accredited to the U.S. President to save the peace process from the labyrinth of Israeli deception and their playing for time to avoid the obligations and responsibilities of peace.
