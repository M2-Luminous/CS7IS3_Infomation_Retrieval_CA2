FBIS4-51886 "dreas086_c_94040" FBIS-EAS-94-086 Daily Report 15 Jan 1994 North Korea * Garment Research Center Improves Technology * Garment Research Center Improves Technology 942C0090A Pyongyang NODONG SINMUN in Korean 15 Jan 94 p 4 942C0090A Pyongyang NODONG SINMUN Korean CSO [Excerpts] At the Light Industry Committee's Garment Research Center A little while ago, we visited a garment research center which has set out to realize the policy of putting light industry first. We were filled with joy that there, upholding the Great Leader's New Year's Address, new garment research results are being produced which will give great joy to our people, who are pressing forward the overall advance of Socialism. [passage omitted] The Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il pointed out the following. "The garment-research enterprise will have to be done well for the specialization of clothing production, for ceaselessly developing processing technology, and for setting up a clothing system well suited for the Socialist mode of living and the figures of the Korean people." Our first stop was the Materials Research Office. Office director Comrade Pyong Kwang-chol set out very thin copper leaf [tongbakpan]. We found out that it was the material for a mold to make a cylindrical metallic screen [kumsok wontong chaebon], the heart of the adhesive lining machine [chopchak simji kigye]. Lining forms the skeleton of clothing. Early on, our scientists and chemical-factory workers were successful in taking materials plentiful in or country and making them high grade using chemical methods. Thus, the garment industry has made easy use of clothes lining made from weaving lining material, pasting it to any fabric with an adhesive developed our way. The research center did not stop at this. Last year it newly developed an efficient adhesive lining machine capable of meeting the nationwide demand for lining with just one machine. Completing its design, the research center turned it over to a weaving-machine factory. Even so, the office decided to make and guarantee the cylindrical metallic screen itself. This was because among lining machines, the cylindrical metallic screen, which holds the adhesive and sprays it on fabric, is a part very difficult to manufacture. During the first week of the new year, the Materials Research Office brought about collective reform, creating the mold material for the screen. Displaying their revolutionary spirit of self-reliant innovation, the members of this office, including researcher Comrade Yi Sang-chun, devoted themselves to manufacturing a screen mold with this material. We too became confident that if the cylindrical metallic screen was completed by the end of March, as they resolved, an adhesive lining machine would easily be born in time for the holidays of April. We entered the room where the automated clothing-design research collective works. Office director Comrade Sim Pang-hyang introduced us to a young researcher absorbed in assembling electronic elements in the middle of the room, which had large and small pieces of modern electronic equipment installed around the room like folding screens. It was computer expert Comrade Nam Sung-il, winner of the Beacon Award for New Technological Innovation. Adopting the computer to tailoring technology in our own way, he developed a new type of automated body-measuring apparatus, technologically more modern and also suited to the figures of Koreans. Put on display in the Three Revolutions Exhibition Hall, it is getting people's attention. When a person enters and stands in the automated body-measuring apparatus, the form of his or her body is automatically measured by a television camera. While this is happening, an appropriate clothing pattern is drawn by a computer. All the cutter has to do is take this and cut the fabric. However, unsatisfied with this and determined to follow the Great Leader's New Year's Address, the clothing-design research collective began a research project of a higher stage for the most precise automated design of clothing form, using a three-dimensional design method, in accordance with people's preferences and demands. Within the research collective beat devoted hearts of loyalty, working to gloriously realize the lofty purpose of the Great Leader and the Dear Leader, who with tremendous love and care concern themselves with clothing the people in smart, good-looking clothes. Researchers Comrade Yi Kyong-sun and Comrade Yang Il-sun in particular worked hard to guarantee the scientific character of materials analysis, adopting new analytical methods from the analysis of body-measurement data on Koreans accumulated over a long period. They thus created a breakthrough capable of advancing to the middle of January completion of the enormous task of data analysis. Immediately upon completion of data analysis, the research collective will make clothing patterns appropriate for male figures by the February holidays, and clothing patterns appropriate for female figures by the April holidays. They set up bold objectives for the time after that, to be of service to residents by making various other types of clothing patterns. We drew a picture of the level of clothing-manufacturing service to be provided to our people when this objective is realized. Next, we stopped by the Process Research Office. Office director Comrade Sim Chun-chan laid open a thick data book entitled, Clothing Manufacturing Time Handbook [Oskagongsi Pyollam]. The numbers filling every page, even at first glance, seemed to speak of the hard research and thinking devoted by the scientists of this place. Precisely stipulating manufacturing time by clothing product type and clothing part was presented as an important requirement for further raising production efficiency and product quality, by guaranteeing balance between production processes in garment factories. In order to solve this problem, office members, including researcher Comrade Chong Kun-myong and testing technician Comrade Kim Chae-ok, for several years went to garment factories in Pyongyang, Kanggye, and Hamhung, passing around machine tools directly. Taking scientific measurements of the manufacturing time of the numerous types of clothing and clothing parts, they put together a data book. This became a precious reference work for garment-factory workers. In keeping with the great leader's New Year's Address, the researchers united their strength and wisdom to enable workers to easily and widely make use of this data book. This was the creation of programs capable of determining clothing-manufacturing time by product type using computers. [passage omitted] Going around visiting the Computer Research Office and various other units, we were able to gain the certainty that, with the interest and backing of the Light Industry Committee, the scientists of this place will realize the policy of putting light industry first and will greatly contribute with scientific knowledge and technology to improving the dress of our people.
