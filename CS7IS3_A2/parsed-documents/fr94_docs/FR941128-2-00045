ACTION: Notice of Application. SUMMARY: Citizens Utilities Company (Citizens) has requested authorization to export electric energy to Canada. DATES: Comments, protests, or requests to intervene must be submitted on or before January 27, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments, protests, or requests to intervene should be addressed as follows: Office of Coal & Electricity (FE&hyph;52), Office of Fuels Programs, Fossil Energy, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellen Russell (Program Office) 202&hyph;586&hyph;9624 or Michael T. Skinker (Program Attorney) 202&hyph;586&hyph;6667. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Exports of electricity from the United States to a foreign country are regulated and require authorization under section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. On October 12, 1994, Citizens filed an application with the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) of the Department of Energy (DOE) for authorization to export electric energy to Canada pursuant to section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. Citizens has requested authority to export up to 50,000 megawatt-hours (MWH) per year of electric energy to Hydro-Quebec at a maximum rate of transmission of 50 megawatts (MW). Citizens proposes to use the existing 120,000-volt transmission facilities at Derby Line, Vermont, to affect the export. The construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of these facilities were authorized by Presidential Permit PP&hyph;66, issued by the DOE on June 21, 1979. Citizens and Hydro-Quebec have had an interconnection agreement since January 25, 1988, which among other things, provides for mutual assistance during emergencies. On March 31, 1993, in Order DOE/FE EA&hyph;66, and again on May 28, 1993, in Order DOE/FE EA&hyph;66&hyph;A, FE granted Citizens temporary authority to export to Hydro-Quebec in order to supply electric service to Canadian customers during a maintenance outage of Hydro-Quebec's Stanstead substation. Citizens now seeks permanent authority to export to Hydro-Quebec under circumstances similar to those authorized in Orders EA&hyph;66 and EA&hyph;66&hyph;A or because of emergency conditions. Procedural Matters Any person desiring to be heard or to protest this application should file a petition to intervene or protest at the address provided above in accordance with §§385.211 or 385.214 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211, 385.214). Any such petitions and protests should be filed with the DOE on or before the date listed above. Additional copies of such petitions to intervene or protests also should be filed directly with: Craig A. Marks, Senior Counsel, Citizens Utilities Company, 1233 West Bank Expressway, Harvey, La. 70059, (504) 367&hyph;7000, ext. 235; Kimberly M. Kiener, Director Regulatory Affairs, Electric, Citizens Utilities Company, 4255 Stockton Hill Road, Kingman, Az. 86401, (602) 692&hyph;2787; and James P. Avery, Vice President, Energy, Citizens Utilities Company 1233 West Bank Expressway, Harvey, La. 70059, (504) 367&hyph;7000, ext. 210. Pursuant to 18 CFR 385.211, protests and comments will be considered by the DOE in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a petition to intervene under 18 CFR 385.214. Section 385.214 requires that a petition to intervene must state, to the extent known, the position taken by the petitioner and the petitioner's interest in sufficient factual detail to demonstrate either that the petitioner has a right to participate because it is a State Commission; that it has or represents an interest which may be directly affected by the outcome of the proceeding, including any interest as a consumer, customer, competitor, or a security holder of a party to the proceeding; or that the petitioner's participation is in the public interest. A final decision will be made on this application after a determination is made by the DOE that the proposed action will not impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or will not impede or tend to impede the coordination in the public interest of facilities in accordance with section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. Before an export authorization may be issued, the environmental impacts of the proposed DOE action (i.e., granting the export authorization, with any conditions and limitations, or denying it) must be evaluated pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Copies of this application will be made available, upon request, for public inspection and copying at the address provided above. Issued in Washington, DC, on November 18, 1994. Anthony J. Como, Director, Office of Coal & Electricity, Office of Fuels Programs, Office of Fossil Energy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29196 Filed 11&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
