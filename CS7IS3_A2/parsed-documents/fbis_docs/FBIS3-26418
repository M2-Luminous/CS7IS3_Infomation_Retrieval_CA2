This has given people the wrong impression, as if only he wants to develop "democracy" in Hong Kong. He even asked: "What is wrong with expanding democracy?" and "Why is China opposed to it?" In fact, he feigns ignorance. As everyone knows, over the past 150 years the British Empire has not allowed Hong Kong people to enjoy democracy. Why is it so interested in "democracy" now? There must be more to this than meets the eye. I. From Margaret Thatcher's Original Concept to Chris Patten's "Constitutional Reform Proposal" As far back as the early 1980's, the then British Prime Minister Mrs. Thatcher had a concept, which was: "We should develop Hong Kong's democratic structure. Our objective is to allow Hong Kong to become independent or practice self-rule within a short period of time.... This makes it necessary to set up in Hong Kong a government with more distinctive Chinese characteristics in which Britain will increasingly become subordinate. We also should possibly consider a referendum as an acceptable system there" (see Margaret Thatcher's memoirs "The Downing Street Years"). This passage clearly shows that Britain has long wanted to turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity to continue the British rule there in a disguised form after 1997. However, given the firm stand of the Chinese Government and people that all sovereignty over Hong Kong must be recovered in 1997, she had to retreat and eventually agree to sign the "Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong" and other relevant agreements. The joint declaration explicitly stipulates: "The Chinese Government has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect from 1 July 1997." "The Government of the United Kingdom declares that it will restore Hong Kong to the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997." At the joint declaration signing ceremony, Mrs. Thatcher also solemnly announced: "I pledge that the British Government will do its best to make the agreement a success." The signing and ratification of the "Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong" has delivered the whole territory of Hong Kong from British colonial rule and set it down permanently as China's territory in terms of law. After the Hong Kong Basic Law was promulgated, the British Foreign Office issued a statement of confirmation, calling it an "important milestone." Subsequently, on many occasions, the British side has also pledged to cause Hong Kong's constitutional development to converge with the Basic Law. However, with the approach of 1997 and unwilling to withdraw from the historical stage, the British Government has suddenly made a U-turn in its stand toward the question of Hong Kong and, through the new Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, dished out the "three violations" "constitutional reform proposal." The "three violations" refers to violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the relevant agreements and understandings reached between China and Britain, and the principle agreed upon by both parties of the convergence of Hong Kong's political system and the Basic Law. It should be pointed out that before Chris Patten took up his post as Hong Kong governor in July 1992, a "Mission to Hong Kong By the International Jurists Commission" headed by William Goodhart of Britain, engaged in extensive activities in Hong Kong in June 1991. After returning to Britain, the delegation wrote a 100,000-word report entitled "Countdown to 1997--Report of a Mission to Hong Kong" (hereinafter the "Report"). Reviewing the British Hong Kong policy from politics, law, and other aspects, the "Report" launched an all-out attack on the Basic Law and, in conclusion, put forward 45 "conclusions and suggestions." Whoever leafs through the "Report," especially its "conclusions and suggestions," can see that Britain has never given up the aforesaid original concept of Mrs. Thatcher. That is the fundamental reason why the Chinese and British Governments have failed to reach any agreement despite 17 rounds of talks, held between 22 April and 27 November 1993, on the question of the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong. II. "Countdown to 1997" Provides a "Reform Prototype" for Patten's "Constitutional Reform" To better understand the contents and objectives of Patten's "constitutional reform proposal," it is necessary to examine it in tandem with the "Report." First of all, the "Report" reviews the greatest error in the British Hong Kong policy, holding that "before holding talks on and before signing the joint declaration," the British Government should have held a `referendum' in Hong Kong, and that it also "gave open, customary, indolent, and tacit consent" to the Basic Law (see "Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 5 and p 115 of the original report). On this count, the authors say with great sympathy: "Given the current situation, it is no longer practical to exercise the right to self-determination effectively." ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 7). What, then, is to be done? The authors suggest that, first, we "should replace the 18 appointed Legislative Councillors whose terms of office end at the end of 1993 with directly elected councillors from 18 geographical constituencies" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 15) and "implement an overall geographical constituency electoral system in the 1995 Legislative Council [Legco] elections" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 13). In so doing, the authors have completely abolished the functions of functional constituencies and the Election Committee in the 1994 and 1995 elections as agreed by both parties, deliberately violated the provision of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] that the SAR's first Legco should be composed proportionately of councillors elected by functional groups, those elected through the Election Committee, and those directly elected in geographical constituencies, and violated the commitment repeatedly made by Britain that the Hong Kong constitutional development should converge with the Basic Law. This is absolutely identical with what Patten is doing now. What is particularly interesting is that the "Report" authors had long expected that in doing so there would probably be no "through train." But the "Report" categorically states: "The benefit of the `through train' to Hong Kong is not the most important one and should not be taken as a reason for giving up comprehensive democratic elections in 1995" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 16). You may well see how harmonious they are with each other. Readers are likely to ask: Since there is no `through train,' what is the point of the British Hong Kong authorities insisting on such an election as suggested in the "Report"? In fact, there is great significance. Mrs. Thatcher has laid bare the secret with her aforesaid remarks. In truth, they want to make Britain "subordinate" in the remaining 2 to 3 years and produce a Legco fully elected by Hong Kong compatriots to pursue a series of "reforms" in opposition to the Basic Law and thus create chaos and undermine Hong Kong's prosperity, stability, and peaceful transition. In doing so they can fish in troubled waters and even stage a comeback someday. We can have a complete understanding of this point if we look at the series of "suggestions" listed in the "Report." First, the "Report" directs the spearhead of its attack at the relationship between the central people's government and the future Hong Kong SAR. It is opposed to the provision in the Basic Law that the chief executive is to be appointed by the central people's government, calling for a "chief executive directly elected by the masses" or "making a choice between a directly elected chief executive and a directly elected government" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 17); says that "the chief executive should be responsible to the SAR legislature" rather than "responsible to the PRC" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 18); and calls for "restricting the provision that the courts of Hong Kong shall have no jurisdiction over acts of state such as defense and foreign affairs" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 19) as laid down in Article 19 of the Basic Law. It also negates the role of the Basic Law as the future SAR's constitution, claiming that the power of interpretation of whether the clauses of the Basic Law are applicable to the SAR and whether Hong Kong laws contravene the Basic Law "should be shifted from the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee to the Hong Kong courts" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 20). They have made a clean breast of their intentions in those few points. We should like to ask: If the chief executive is neither appointed by, nor responsible to, the central people's government but is only responsible to the Hong Kong legislature; if the right of adjudication and the right of interpretation of such things as whether the laws formulated by the Hong Kong legislature contravene the Basic Law and whether the clauses of the Basic Law are applicable to the SAR are not vested in the NPC Standing Committee but in Hong Kong courts, will not Hong Kong turn into a political entity completely independent of the central people's government? What is there in common with Hong Kong as an SAR of the PRC? Will not the provision in the "Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong" that the "PRC has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect from 1 July 1997" come to naught? Although Chris Patten still dares not make such suggestions, he has spread the news that "before and after 1997 administrative work should be responsible to the legislature." What a phrase "before and after 1997" is! This is by no means a slip of the tongue. If the Hong Kong executive organ is responsible only to the Hong Kong legislature after 1997, will this not coincide with the aforesaid suggestion in the "Report"? III. Let's See What Actions Chris Patten Will Take in the Next 2 to 3 Years? In addition to making "suggestions" about the 1994 and 1995 elections and the relationship between the future chief executive and legislature and the central people's government, which are totally out of keeping with the Basic Law, the "Report" also sets a keynote for the "reforms" Patten should accomplish in the next 2 to 3 years. People know that even though Hong Kong compatriots have acquired "British Dependent Territories Citizens" [BDTC] status in the past, it is very difficult for them to secure British nationality and the right of abode in Britain. Contrary to previous practice, the "Report" authors now suggest that as regards all BDTCs in Hong Kong: "No matter what practical difficulties it has, Britain has in principle the obligation to let them enjoy the right of abode in Britain proper or an acceptable third country" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 9). Why do they make such a suggestion? Because it was stipulated in the "British Memorandum on the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration" that all persons who are BDTCs before 30 June 1997 "will cease to be BDTCs with effect from 1 July 1997" "without conferring the right of abode in the United Kingdom." It is also stipulated in the Chinese Memorandum that "under the Nationality Law of the PRC, all Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, whether they are holders of `BDTC' Passports' or not, are Chinese nationals." Obviously, the "Report" authors hold that such a practice will considerably reduce Britain's influence in Hong Kong after 1997. Originally, China and Britain had reached initial agreement on the nationality and right of abode of BDTCs and this has been overthrown by the "Report" authors. The "Report" suggests: "The Hong Kong BDTCs of non-Chinese origin who have no right of abode outside Hong Kong should be immediately granted British nationality and right of abode in Britain" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 10); the Hong Kong BDTCs of Chinese origin, including those who applied for naturalized BDTC after the signing of the joint declaration on 19 December 1984, should be given right of abode ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 11); and that the deadline for going through such a procedure may be extended to six years after the transition of Hong Kong sovereignty in 1997 and can be further extended if necessary ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 12). Very obviously, in making such suggestions, the "Report" authors want to rope in large numbers of Hong Kong people, encouraging them to have a free hand in acting according to Britain's will before and after 1997. If they should finally find it really impossible to muddle along they need not worry as they have a place of retreat in Britain. In addition, the "Report" also takes "human rights" as an important weapon against the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong by the PRC. The "Report" especially stresses the importance of the British Parliament formulating the "Regulations for Implementing the Bill of Rights" and placing them above the Basic Law. It claims that they should not be rescinded or restricted even after 1997 ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 34) and that, if all or some of the current statutes contravene the regulations, they should be rescinded or amended ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 33). Obviously, the "Report" authors seem to forget that the British Hong Kong Government's rule over Hong Kong will expire on 30 June 1997 and that the legal basis for maintaining their power after that date will disappear. By that time, "the system, policies, and laws practiced after the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR will be based on the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR" (Resolution from the Third Session of the Seventh NPC); "the law previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation, and customary law shall be maintained, except for any that contravene this law and subject to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong SAR" (Article 8 of the Basic Law). We should like to ask, is there any reason to place the regulations formulated by the British Parliament above the Basic Law and extend their validity beyond 1997 without subjecting them to examination? The "Report" authors also suggest that, before 1997, it is necessary to "spare no effort in implementing" the regulations ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 35); "set up a powerful Human Rights Commission" in Hong Kong ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 37); and that "Britain should accept the jurisdiction of the `Optional Protocol on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights' on behalf of Hong Kong" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 42). It even suggests that "the International Jurists Commission or the International Federation of Human Rights Organizations should speedily set up an independent body to supervise progress in Hong Kong's human rights situation" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 41) and so on. Obviously, using "human rights" to interfere in another country's internal affairs is a special weapon of hegemonists in recent years and the "Report" authors do not forget to use it either. Hong Kong compatriots should rest assured that, in line with the Basic Law, all Hong Kong compatriots will enjoy much fuller human and civil rights than they have done during the rule by the British Empire. Naturally, if a small number of people who, with ulterior motives, take advantage of human rights to engage in sabotage activities in a vain attempt to pull Hong Kong onto the path of independence and separation, this will be impermissible under the Basic Law and will not be tolerated by the future Hong Kong SAR. As everybody knows, as far back as 1982 when starting talks with Britain on the future of Hong Kong, the Chinese Government explicitly stated: After resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong, China will pursue the principles and policies of "one country, two systems, `Hong Kong people running Hong Kong,' and "a high degree of self-autonomy." After 1997, Hong Kong will practice immeasurably better democracy than that under British rule. Over the past 100 years and more, the governor has always arrogated all authority to himself and there has been absolutely no democracy to speak of in Hong Kong. As stated above, the "Report," which is entitled "Countdown," helps people, to a certain extent, understand Britain's current and future policies toward Hong Kong, as well as Patten's "constitutional reform proposal." People will wait and see how Patten acts next. IV. Concluding Remarks Hong Kong bears witness to the history of colonial aggression in which the Western colonialists were the first to open China's gate and the last to leave China. The fact that the Chinese nation has suffered humiliation and oppression at the hands of Western powers over the past 150 years has something to do with this. The day to thoroughly cleanse all remnants of colonialism in China will finally arrive soon. At this historical juncture, as the elite of Hong Kong society, Legco members who assume heavy historical responsibility, should first stand out and boycott Patten's "constitutional reform proposal" so that all his plans will come to naught. Only in this way can they have a clear conscience toward their forefathers and future generations. All Hong Kong compatriots loving the motherland should fight in unity and make persistent efforts to boycott all "separate elections" Chris Patten may launch. Let Patten and his like "count down" because their countdown can only result in "zero," while before us is a more thriving and prosperous Hong Kong and a more thriving and prosperous great motherland. With hands and hearts linked together, let us usher in the arrival of the great historical date of 1 July 1997!
