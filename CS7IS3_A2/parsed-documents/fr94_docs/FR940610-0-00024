SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of December 14, 1993 (58 FR 65514), FDA published an interim rule on human tissue intended for transplantation. This interim rule requires certain infectious disease testing, donor screening, and recordkeeping to help prevent the transmission of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and hepatitis through human tissue used in transplantation. The regulations set forth in the interim rule became effective upon publication. Interested persons were given until March 14, 1994, to comment on the interim rule. The objective of this public workshop is to discuss practical concerns expressed in received public comments relating to the implementation of the interim rule. The following topics will be discussed: 1. Experience with the interim rule; 2. Management of testing relative to hemodilution; 3. Experience with test kit performance on cadaveric blood samples; and 4. Management of current inventories in regard to testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Discussion of these topics will be considered by FDA in the development of any future rulemaking. FDA is reopening the comment period to the interim rule so that interested persons may submit comments on the workshop. Persons who wish to provide additional materials for consideration should file these materials with the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Interested persons may, on or before August 20, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above), written comments regarding this document. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: June 6, 1994. Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy.
