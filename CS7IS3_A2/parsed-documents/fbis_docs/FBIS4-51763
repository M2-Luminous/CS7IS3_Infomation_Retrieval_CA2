Cornered by a scheme of its own making (the Stalinist state's refusal to allow outside inspection of its nuclear facilities), North Korea is obviously trying to muddy the issue and eliminate Seoul as a player in the nuclear row. Taking advantage of Washington's efforts to maintain the global nuclear non-proliferation regime at any cost, Pyongyang is trying to force the United States to pull its troops from South Korea by linking the withdrawal with the nuclear question. North Korea's attempts, which are not very difficult to fathom, are of course unacceptable to Seoul. Washington firmly rejected Pyongyang's overture after North Korea, in a Foreign Ministry statement issued on April 28, proposed negotiations between the two on concluding a peace treaty. Pyongyang followed up by serving notice that it would withdraw from the Military Armistice Commission (MAC). Prior to this, North Korea had refused to attend MAC meetings since March 1991 when South Korean Major General Hwang Won-tak was appointed chief delegate of the United Nations forces. The North said it would not recognize Hwang since the South was not a signatory to the Armistice Agreement. In short, Pyongyang wants to replace the Armistice Agreement signed in 1953 between North Korea and China on one side and the United Nations on the other with a U.S.-North Korean peace treaty. This is not the first time that North Korea has advanced the idea of signing a peace pact with the United States. Pyongyang made that overture to the United States persistently before signing the basic accord on reconciliation, non-aggression and exchanges with South Korea in 1992. Outwardly, North Korea said a peace treaty was needed to restore peace to the peninsula. South and North Korea are technically still at war some 40 years after the conflict ended. But Seoul refused to accept the North Korean proposal at face value because its real intention was to force Washington to withdraw its troops deployed in the South. South and North Korea argued about problems related to the need for a peace treaty until they signed the 1992 inter-Korean basic accord. In the five-item supplementary agreement to the inter-Korean accord on reconciliation, the two sides agreed to faithfully implement the accord and the declaration for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in order to transform the state of war into that of a lasting peace. It follows, therefore, that if North Korea wants to raise the problem of a peace treaty, it has to honor the inter-Korean accord as well as the denuclearization declaration, the Seoul government says. The supplementary agreement also spells out that South and North Korea will work out appropriate measures to change the state of war into peace and that the two sides will honor the Armistice Agreement until a firm peace is established. Consequently, Seoul maintains that the recent attempt by North Korea to conclude a peace treaty with the United States obviously violates the inter-Korean basic accord. South Korean ministries concerned with unification are said to be coordinating their views on "a rather drastic" North Korean attempt to sign a peace treaty with the United States, one-sidedly ignoring the inter-Korean agreements. So far, the Seoul government has viewed the North Korean move as undeserving of comment. But it was reported that Seoul was still unable to adopt countermeasures to an apparent North Korean violation of the armistice treaty. "The government is currently analyzing North Korea's real intention," said one senior official. "We plan to approach the problem cautiously, taking into consideration all aspects of inter- Korean relations including the nuclear question." In other words, the Seoul government will firmly oppose the North Korean move to conclude a peace treaty with the United States while trying to find a solution to North Korea's violation of the Armistice Agreement through dialogue.
