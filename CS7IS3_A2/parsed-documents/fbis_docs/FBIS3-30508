The memorandum points out that the NATO summit brought closer the prospects of Slovakia's full incorporation into a developed Europe, including the economic, political, and security aspects thereof. The summit has offered further possibilities of involvement in setting up new models of cooperation within Europe by supporting the development of the European security and defense (?identity). The Slovak Republic is aware that the development of security mechanisms is a process. These mechanisms will guarantee stability on the continent. This has been reflected in the proposals and programs put forward by the Brussels summit. The Slovak Republic will continue to pursue its initiatives aimed at obtaining full NATO membership, as well as the security guarantees that are needed for successful completion of the economic transformation and the strengthening of democracy, says the Slovak Government's memorandum about [Slovakia] joining the Partnership for Peace program.
