JICST has 11,000 users (number of passwords issued) and NACSIS has 5,600 users (number of passwords issued). As a result of interconnecting the two networks, a giant science and technology information network will be realized. Although there are small problems of system design and user fees at present, the two centers have ``almost worked out the technical problems such as use of gateways (connectivity).'' JICST is providing online information services to the private sector and universities with 22 of their own databases including a ``Science and Technology Reference File'' and a ``Science and Technology Research Information File'' as well as files formed by external organizations, in which 27 million items of data have been collected. This will be the largest commercial science and technology database in Japan. On the other hand, ``NACSIS - IR (Information Retrieval)'' provides data with 36 million items to universities, national joint organizations, and specialized schools with 35 kinds of database ranging from the natural sciences to the humanities and sociology, including several types of databases such as ``Overview of Science Research Results By Supplementary Fund,'' ``Academic Thesis and Dissertation Retrieval,'' and ``Academic Papers Presented.'' It is a closed circuit system in which use is limited to the academic institutions permitted by the Ministry of Education. JOIS was established to meet the need for making joint university and national level research available to the private sector. From now on, the range of databases that both organizations will provide will be discussed, but by establishing a one year trial period, any problems that might occur can be studied. Also since NACSIS is collecting fees from researchers at universities, the costs will decline. The approval of an academic discount for users of NACSIS-IR will be discussed with JICST. Although a new password is needed if a user wants to access both systems, both organizations will take applications enabling users to access both by issuing all passwords at one time.
