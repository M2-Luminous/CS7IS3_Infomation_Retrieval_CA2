The conference made recommendations today, stressing the need to continue making efforts to cut the economic and social costs incurred by the growing local consumption of oil. It recommended the expansion of utilizing natural gas to increase the portion of exported oil and its byproducts. The conference that opened last Saturday called for upgrading exploration operations to increase Arab oil and natural gas reserves and thus meet the expected growth in world demand for oil and benefit from new technologies that have proved feasible in the field of exploration, drilling, and production. Organized by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, OAPEC, the Arab League, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the Arab Organization for Industrial Development, the conference called for enhancing opportunities for exchanging natural gas among Arab states. It also called for launching a feasibility study on setting up a natural gas network to link production sites with consuming areas and thus achieve the optimal exploitation of that source. The conference praised Arab efforts to use new and renewable energies and emphasized the need for paying more attention to the development of Arab capabilities in that field. Held under the chairmanship of Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi al-Banbi and with the participation of Arab energy and oil ministers, the conference called for going ahead with electricity grid projects in both the Arab Mashreq and Maghreb. The conference discussed 23 working papers on the oil industry, electricity linkage, and the expansion in using new and renewable energies. It called for expanding the exchange of oil products among Arab states to diversify consuming markets and for encouraging the private sector to set up companies to market and distribute oil products in Arab markets. The energy conference underlined the need to develop petrochemical industries in Arab states and to expand the manufacture of basic material needed for horizontal integration to cope with the demand in Arab markets, increase exports to world markets, and coordinate among Arab producers in production and marketing. The Fifth Arab Energy Conference emphasized the need for Arab and international capital to provide the necessary investments to carry out the needed projects in the various fields of energy. It called on Arab and international banks and financial institutions to pay more attention to the preparation of feasibility studies for energy-related projects. It also called for providing the necessary investments to develop the oil sector and for protecting investment-related decisions against fluctuations in oil prices. The conference stressed the need for Arab countries to preserve the environment and take its protection into consideration in launching development projects. It also urged Arab countries to sensitize the public about protecting the environment and curbing pollution. The conference expressed concern regarding the negative effects the proposed oil tax might have on oil. It viewed this suggested tax as an act of discrimination against oil, maintaining that the actual goal consuming countries seek to achieve by imposing this tax is to increase their revenues at the expense of the oil-producing developing countries. It also expressed its fears that this tax might have a negative effect on the world economy in general and oil-producing and exporting countries' economies in particular. The energy conference called for subsidizing Arab scientific research centers to study and follow up on the problem of the changing climate to ensure that the allegations made against petroleum lack scientific proof and that oil is not the main reason behind the increase of the carbon dioxide. It urged research centers to publicize scientific facts, information, and findings of studies into the problem of changing climates. The conferees urged Arab and developing states to coordinate their stance at international gatherings to explain the negative impacts development programs in these countries might suffer if discriminative measures are taken against petroleum when discussing ways to curb the discharge of pollutant gas into the atmosphere. It stressed the need for developing a data base on sources of energy and the demand for it in the various economic sectors to use in studies and research. It urged the organizations concerned to supply the Arab Center for Energy Studies with the necessary information and data for its studies. In its recommendations, the energy conference called for enhancing cooperation among OPEC and non-OPEC states and between them and consuming countries to provide a suitable climate to establish market stability and avoid price fluctuation. The conference welcomed the invitation Syrian Oil Minister Nadir al-Nabulsi made to hold the sixth energy conference in Damascus in 1998. Speaking on behalf of the organizing bodies, OAPEC Secretary General Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Turki expressed appreciation for Egypt, its people, president, and government for hosting the conference. He thanked President Mubarak for helping the conference and Dr. Hamdi al-Banbi for the efforts he made to assist the organizing bodies in arranging it.
