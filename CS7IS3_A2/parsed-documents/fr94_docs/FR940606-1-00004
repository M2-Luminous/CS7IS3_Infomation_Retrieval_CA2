FR940606-1-00004 FR940606-1-00002 The FAA estimates that 128 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $42,240, or $330 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Aerospatiale: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;43&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model ATR42&hyph;200 and -300 series airplanes equipped with hinge pins installed at the nose landing gear (NLG) that are manufactured by Nardi, have part number D56867, and have serial numbers beginning with the letter ``N''; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent collapse of the NLG due to cracking of the hinge pins, accomplish the following: (a) Prior to the accumulation of 10,000 total landings or within 1,000 landings after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, perform a dye penetrant inspection to detect cracking in the hinge pins on the NLG in accordance with Avions de Transport Regional Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;32&hyph;0064, dated January 17, 1994. (1) If no cracking is found, prior to further flight, reinstall that hinge pin in accordance with the service bulletin. (2) If cracking is found, prior to further flight, install a new hinge pin or a pin that has been previously inspected and found to be crack-free, in accordance with the service bulletin. (b) As of the effective date of this AD, no hinge pin manufactured by Nardi having part number D56867 and any serial number beginning with the letter ``N,'' shall be installed on the NLG of any airplane, unless that pin has been previously inspected and has been found to be crack-free, in accordance with Avions de Transport Regional Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;32&hyph;0064, dated January 17, 1994. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on May 31, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
