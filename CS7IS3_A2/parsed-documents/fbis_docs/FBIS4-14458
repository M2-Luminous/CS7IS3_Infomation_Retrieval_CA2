This was held within the framework of the "Weapons Industry Day" organized by the Russian Federation State Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry. Representatives of 70 enterprises and institutions in Russia's military-industrial complex discussed problems of the survival of the defense industry in the prevailing conditions. It was noted at the conference that, whereas in 1990 25 percent of the capacities of the military-industrial complex produced civilian output, in 1993 only 25 percent of the capacities of the defense complex were involved in the production of military output. Oleg Borisov, general director of the "Promeksport" association, noted that the volume of Russian weapons exports has fallen considerably at the same time: Whereas in 1988 it totaled $12 billion, in 1993 the figure was one-sixth of this. In their speeches, the participants also spoke of the fact that the funding of scientific projects in the military-industrial complex has fallen by a factor of 10-15 compared with 1989. According to the weapons developers, this will lead to a situation where no one will take Russia seriously on the weapons market in a few years' time. The participants in the conference demanded that the government take fundamental measures to support the military-industrial complex.
