Parliament has finally decided to turn the "hare" [Belarusian currency unit] into a lion, in other words to designate the Belorusian ruble as the only means of payment on the Republic's territory until the actual unification of the monetary systems. But Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich upset the applecart the day before by initialing a draft decree establishing new status for the settlement notes [raschetnyy bilet] of the National Bank of Belorusia. Journalists were asked to leave the Supreme Soviet hall before the latest decisive speech by the head of the government. Nevertheless, IZVESTIYA has acquired a transcript of Vyacheslav Kebich's speech. The prime minister started by saying that he had accused Kovalin, deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, and Kazmin, Russian deputy minister of finance, of attempting to wreck the unification. According to Kebich, they have made amendments to the documents which had been coordinated by experts and distorted their meaning. As a result, fundamental differences have appeared in the sides' positions on the following questions: the rate of exchange of Belorusian cash rubles for Russian rubles, the equalization of the price of deliveries of output between subjects of economic activity, the unification of the budgets, and the status of the National Bank of Belorusia. According to the head of the Belorusian Government, the first two differences can be resolved easily, but the political aspects (that is specifically how the proposals on the single budget and the abolition of the National Bank of Belorusia are viewed) are unacceptable to the Republic. Despite this, Kebich stated with characteristic optimism that the monetary union would be signed in the near future, by 1 April to be precise. It is interesting that the Russian parliament provides the main hopes for the Belorusian supporters of the unification. The prime minister, who spoke very warmly about it, literally stated the following: "Sittings of all factions of the State Duma are being held now, at this very moment, about immediately signing this treaty." And he went on to say: "The unification must be signed and a president elected, otherwise the people will simply not understand what we are doing." The reference to popular opinion sounds fairly amusing from the lips of the prime minister, since nowadays it is no secret to anyone that he has a personal interest in this game. Kebich is calculating that the first positive results of the unification will enable him to occupy the presidential post. And if he is not making a show of this in public, then he expressed himself fairly definitely at the closed sitting. While the prime minister was persuading Belorusian parliamentarians that the monetary systems should be unified, the Russians were being persuaded by a delegation of the procommunist People's Movement of Belorusia. The actual fact of its trip to Moscow cannot fail to cause surprise: On what grounds is a sociopolitical organization conducting talks with the supreme legislative organ of another country? Inasmuch as no one has officially authorized the Belorusian Communists to carry out this action, it is logical to assume that the trip took place thanks to close ties at party level. The results of this visit, as well as the arrival of Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Federation Council Finance Committee, and the unequivocal support he expressed for the agreement on the unification of the monetary systems has strengthened the Belorusian Government, which had been on the point of becoming dispirited. Meanwhile, another view of the problem exists outside of the government. Leonid Kozik, chairman of the Belorusian Supreme Soviet Commission for Economic Reform, told journalists that the unification process will be drawn out over a fairly long period of time. National Bank Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich expressed himself even more definitely, calling on the population to "stop waiting," because "this business would just fizzle out." Nevertheless, the Belorusian Government has the chance to sign the agreement; but at what price? The answer to this question was provided in the agreement on the amalgamation of "Beltransgaz," the state enterprise for the transportation and deliveries of gas, with Russia's "Gazprom" Joint-Stock Association, which was submitted to the Supreme Soviet for ratification. Under the agreement, the value of the property of the Belorusian enterprise has been estimated at 1,000,217,000 rubles (that is approximately how much it now costs to build one multiapartment housing block). According to independent experts' estimates, "Beltransgaz" is worth at least $5 billion. Thus, one of the political groupings intends to pay for its prosperity with a state asset. Not only that, the government press is already very actively discussing the idea of giving up sovereignty. One way or another, it is already clear that the stories about the unification of the monetary systems, like the ones about the friendly union of fraternal peoples which will give rise to a land of milk and honey, are not well founded. The reality is that it is each man for himself today, and if the unification does nevertheless take place, there is no point in expecting gifts from Russia. And the question of whether an entrance fee proves its worth remains a big one.
