It was the prime minister who, when he took office at the end of March 1993, decided to make the law, together with the defense white paper, one of his government's priorities. Moreover, he did it even though certain members of his majority were suggesting he should wait until the next presidential election in 1995. It was Edouard Balladur who determine the main policy directions to be taken by this law. Above all, it was he who made three important decisions: the financial decision to increase investment spending in the defense sector by 0.5 percent per year (and by 1.5 percent as of 1998, if the economic situation permits), despite the law limiting public spending; the advance decision not to tie the hands of the next president where nuclear defense is concerned; and the decision for a "mixed" army which retains the principle of conscription while increasing the size of the professional forces. Role of Deterrent Since he bears the ultimate responsibility, Edouard Balladur insisted on being the first to speak in yesterday afternoon's debate in the National Assembly. He told the deputies that above and beyond the budgetary aspects of this Programming Law for 1995-2000 were the "major stakes" and an "ambition": "the role and place of France in the world." The prime minister explained: "It is the government's duty to give our defense policy the priority it deserves. As General de Gaulle stated on 14 June 1952, `the defense of France is the state's main reason for being.'" Mr. Balladur stressed: "Who can forget that today, for the first time in 50 years, French soldiers are active in fighting in Europe itself? The world has lost its traditional points of reference since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and we have entered a period of uncertainty." As a result, it was necessary "to put a stop to a situation that is unprecedented in the Fifth Republic" where, for the last three years, France has not had a multiyear defense plan. "We have now marked a decisive turning point." It was therefore necessary to increase the military equipment budget without, however, "abandoning budget austerity." With regard to deterrence, the prime minister reiterated: "The government will take all the measures necessary for our deterrent to preserve its key role in our defense strategy. The Military Programming Law will provide the state with the means of maintaining the credibility of our nuclear arsenal in the future. Our nuclear forces will be maintained at the level necessary to ensure the protection of our vital interests. A major, unprecedented effort will be made in the area of simulation and prototypes to prepare for the decisions that will have to be made in the coming years concerning the specifications of future weapons. Remember that France is not under any international constraints. I can assure you that this freedom of choice will be preserved." He left no room for doubt, even though he did not explicitly mention the issue of nuclear testing. On this issue, Francois Leotard later said: "Investment credits have been earmarked so that a resumption of nuclear testing can resume as soon as the order is given." Will this double government statement calm people like Jacques Baumel, who wanted to amend the law to allow a resumption of nuclear testing? These people would like to respond to the president of the Republic, who not only is resolved not to restart nuclear testing right up to the end of his term, but who also "does not envision" such a decision being made by his successors. They would doubtless also like to see a more acrimonious period of cohabitation. Everyone, it seems, in the government and in the majority, has adopted Francois Leotard's point of view that the issue is not whether tests will recommence, but when. In his speech, Edouard Balladur also insisted on what is, through the white paper and the programming law, "a major development in our defense policy, namely, our European commitment." Our defense force, guaranteeing the independence and sovereignty of our country, "is also at the disposal of Europe." The law will give France "the means of playing a full role in the emergence of a European defense policy, while remaining wholly aware that this will only be a gradual process and will not become a reality until our partners combine their forces with ours." The role of France in European security is another issue, quite separate from the debate on the programming law. Yesterday morning, opening a seminar organized by Senator Pierre-Christian Taittinger, a former minister, on "The Atlantic Alliance and European Security," Francois Leotard called for a change in the Alliance's military organization, to enable "the major commands have a disproportionate influence on planning and decisionmaking." The defense minister argued that the grouping of multinational armed forces was "a significant step," adding that Europe should "be seen as an independent political and military force." Nonetheless, it has been a struggle to get the famous Common Foreign and Security Policy off the ground. To inject a bit of dynamism, Pierre Lellouche, (RPR [Rally for the Republic]) deputy for the Val-d'Oise department), speaking on behalf of the National Assembly's European Community delegation, yesterday also made two proposals: the setting up of a European Security Council (open just to those states that want to contribute to the defense of the European Union) and the creation of a European rapid intervention force of 120,000 men from the five main European partner states. The European defense system would then be based on a structure of "variable geometry."
