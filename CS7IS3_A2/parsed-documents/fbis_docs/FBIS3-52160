Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that a Finance Ministry team will depart for Paris tomorrow. It is possible that the heads of the delegations, Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and the PLO's Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], will arrive in Paris toward the end of the week. At the opening of today's cabinet meeting Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin spoke with great firmness against the way in which the Palestinians are conducting the negotiations. The prime minister said he is willing to resume the Taba talks only on the basis of the understandings reached in Cairo. Mr. Rabin said that Israel is in no hurry, and that the Palestinians should start sweating now. According to Rabin, over the last few days it has transpired that we cannot count on oral understandings with the PLO leaders, and henceforth he will demand that all the understandings reached with them be written down. Earlier today Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres held an hour-long private meeting. The prime minister also held consultations with various security services elements, and this afternoon these consultations will continue.
