The well-known political forces fall on the common ideological cliche of "capitalism or socialism" in order to characterize the opposition of these alternatives. However, this merely makes the essence of the issue mythical because actually this is about the opposition of two kinds of "capitalism": one--with free competition, which defends the right of man to private economic activities and ensures free competition among various forms of ownership and organization of production, and the other, which we are directly familiar with, is state-monopoly capitalism, which bans (or extremely constrains) private economic activities by the people, destroys free competition, and protects the monopoly of the machinery of state on the command management of the entire economy. Capital forms the economic foundation of both these systems. However, in the former case it is mostly private capital, and in the latter case solely state capital. For almost 60 years (since the end of the 1920's) we have lived under the absolute dominance of state property and its administrators. In the last few years (since the late 1980's), a small proportion of capital, approximately 8 percent, has become private. At present, when state capital remains dominant but the process of privatization is advancing somehow, albeit at a snail's pace, Ukraine is confronted with the decisive choice of who to elect to the new parliament: those who will stop the development of private enterprise or, on the contrary, those who will support its development. At present, not only the fate of Ukrainian independence but also the welfare of a majority of Ukraine's citizens hinge on the correct resolution of this issue. For this reason the attitude of voters toward the development of private enterprise in Ukraine and, accordingly, toward private property is particularly interesting. What is the opinion of urban voters? Only 11 percent of those surveyed believe that private enterprise should not be developed, 14 percent refrained from giving a firm answer, and an impressive majority--75 percent--believe that private enterprise should be developed. More than one-half of the latter come out in favor of developing private enterprise as rapidly as possible. These data indicate that despite the catastrophic condition of the economy and the efforts of certain forces to pass off the appearance of the private enterprise sector as the main reason for the economic crisis and impoverishment of the people, a majority of people do not believe this (75 percent of urban voters amounts to more than one-half of all voters). In the last two years the proportion of urban residents who do believe it has increased only slightly. According to data in surveys by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology together with the research department of the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) in December 1991 and November 1992, at the time respectively 6 and 10 percent of those polled among the urban population (answering the same questions as this time) came out against the development of private enterprise. On both occasions, 83 percent came out in favor of developing private enterprise--only 8 percent more than at present. It is also important to note that opponents of the development of private enterprise are almost 1.5 times less numerous among those who intend to turn out for the elections and those who are not sure than among those who do not intend to turn out. On the other hand, supporters of the development of private enterprise account for 69 percent of those who do not intend to vote and 72 percent among those who are not sure, whereas among the voters who intend to vote the proportion of supporters of private enterprise comes to 79 percent. Of these, 42 percent came out in favor of developing private enterprise as fast as possible, and 37 percent believe that private enterprise should be developed slowly and gradually. Among the urban population as a whole, men (79 percent) came out in favor of developing private enterprise more often then women (71 percent). This support falls with age (from 86 percent among young people to 59 percent among those over 60) and grows with the educational level. Among those with less than a secondary education, 57 percent of urban residents have a positive attitude toward private enterprise, among those with a complete secondary education--77 percent, and among those with a higher education--87 percent. The proportion of such voters is notably greater among students (95 percent), managers (89 percent), servicemen (88 percent), and specialists (86 percent) than among clerical employees (79 percent) and workers (76 percent), and especially retirees (58 percent). Among unskilled workers, 64 percent came out in favor of private enterprise, whereas among skilled workers the figure was 82 percent. Overall support for the development of private enterprise is actually the same among Ukrainians and Russians (73-74 percent). However, "gradualists," if you will, the supporters of the slow and gradual implementation of this development, are somewhat more numerous among Ukrainians--37 percent compared to 32 percent among Russians. Among the latter, "radicals," supporters of the fastest possible development of private enterprise, are somewhat more numerous: 41 percent against 37 percent among Ukrainians. The difference between the urban populations of the Western and Eastern Regions is even greater in this regard. The proportion of "gradualists" among voters in the West (45 percent) is considerably greater than in the East (25 percent), and the proportion of "radicals" in the East (41 percent) is somewhat greater than in the West (35 percent). However, in general it might make sense for candidates for Supreme Council deputy to factor in the fact that even in the east of Ukraine an impressive majority, two-thirds of those surveyed, come out in favor of the development of private enterprise. This is to say nothing about the south and the center, where more than three-quarters of urban voters come out in favor of it, and in particular the west, where this proportion reaches four-fifths.
