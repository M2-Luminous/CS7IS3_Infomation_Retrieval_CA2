The wrath against Madga and the lack of scruples it reveals are evidence of the counterrevolution's control over Miami media; a control that gives it considerable power to manipulate public opinion in that city. Based on a few minutes during which Magda Montiel fraternized with Fidel, a caricature has been created to portray her as a meek, pliant person who simply came to Havana to participate in a scheme carefully crafted by the revolution. Nothing could be further from the truth. On the contrary, it was the seemingly fragile Magda Montiel who raised the most delicate and sensitive issue during the conference when she asked about the death penalty by firing squad -- a penalty meted out by the courts for extreme crimes. This penalty took on political connotations after the victory of the revolution, when it was imposed on those who had committed war crimes and torture at the service of the Fulgencio Batista dictatorship. If any of her detractors had held the conversation Montiel held with Fidel Castro, that person would be considered a hero in Miami. It seems that what bothers them the most is not what Magda did but what they are unable to do. Montiel did not receive an answer to her question because her issue was not on the agenda and because of a desire to avoid controversial issues that could detract from the event's main objective. Nevertheless, when Castro met her at the reception, with his natural honesty, he brought up the issue. Fidel Castro: "You are Magda? I heard you speaking this morning, but you did not receive an answer. No one gave you an explanation about the firing squads. You do not know that story well." Magda Montiel: "No, but someday you are going to have to tell it to me." Fidel Castro: "I will tell it to you now." Magda Montiel: "I want to tell you something, Fidel. Thank you for what you have done for my people. For me, you have been a great teacher." Magda uttered words that inquisitors to the right of Torquemada consider blasphemous: She thanked Fidel for "what you have done for my people," an expression that in the context of the occasion could be considered a simple courtesy -- void of any commitment -- while addressing someone who is not only a head of state but a historically renowned figure. Magda did not take sides nor did she express an opinion. Not even Cuba's most rabid enemies deny Fidel's role in the advances made by the Cuban people, nor is calling him a teacher unusual. What is curious about this situation is that the substance of the conversation between Fidel and Magda is being minimized while the unimportant details are being blown out of proportion. Although it was done cautiously and respectfully, to have brought up the issue of the firing squads during the conference does not make Magda Montiel any more agreeable to me, nor does it move me to praise her. If I had a choice, I would have preferred that she not bring up the topic, but the fact of the matter is she did. In my opinion, what we are really dealing with is an attack on an entire generation of Cuban-Americans, in the person of Magda Montiel, who -- because they are not committed to the militant counterrevolution and do not share their elders' reservations about the revolution but have a different style and modern outlook on politics -- reach reasonable albeit critical conclusions about the national situation and are accepted as valid interlocutors. Jorge Mas Canosa and Armando Perez Roura feel more envy than hatred. The young sector has made a convincing debut in this conference. They have the opportunity to be heard in Cuba and to be a decisive factor among the emigrants. Havana is not trying to saw the floor out from under the counterrevolution; the counterrevolution is scurrying to prop up the ruins. By insulting Magda Montiel the reactionaries are accomplishing several objectives. They are trying to discredit the conference and settle old political accounts, but most of all they are availing themselves of the opportunity to try to discredit their potentially most effective rivals who, to tell the truth, are not in Cuba but in Miami. I met Magda during the conference. I was impressed by her simplicity, open spirit, and unselfishness. She is a happy, successful, and fulfilled person. She is not gaining anything nor seeking anything for herself; on the contrary, she seems like a missionary dedicated to serving the community where she lives. I trust that in this brazen exhibition of sterile and primitive rage by adversaries who have not respected the privacy of her home nor the innocence of her children, Magda and her family will find new reasons to persevere.
