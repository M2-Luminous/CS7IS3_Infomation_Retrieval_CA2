The man from East Berlin was the head of a neo-Nazi squatting action at Berlin's Weitlingstrasse 122, and he was also briefly the head of Berlin's National Alternative, a local organization belonging to the NSDAP-AO [National Socialist German Workers Party--Foreign Organization] operating from the United States. Twenty-six-year old Hasselbach now lives abroad. Two months ago, he was sent a letter bomb, camouflaged as a shipment of books, at his mother's address. It contained TNT, which did not explode because a battery had run out. According to police explosives experts, the bomb could have destroyed three floors of the house. Talking to DER STANDARD during a short visit to Germany, Hasselbach draws parallels between the attack on him and the series of letter-bomb attacks in Austria. "There is a common style to them all," he said. It comes as no surprise to him that "something would happen after Gottfried Kuessel's conviction [for neo-Nazi activities]." While Kuessel, the leader of Austria's neo-Nazis, was in prison already, Hasselbach was still "fully involved in the scene, and they were talking about actions at that time." [passage omitted] According to Hasselbach, all active members of the right-wing scene are trained in handling explosives. He thinks the five men arrested in connection with the Austrian letter-bomb attacks -- of whom he knows Peter Binder, Hans Georg Ley, and Gerd Endres personally -- have the necessary knowledge to build a letter bomb: "Building such a bomb, following instructions, is quite easy. There are instruction booklets available. It is easy to buy the ingredients, especially for these nitroglycerine bombs." Building instructions are available from Gerry Lauck's NSDAP-AO, which operates out of Nebraska, in the United States. [passage omitted] Haider at Squad Meeting Hasselbach was a regular guest of Gottfried Kuessel's in Vienna. He attended training sessions and squad meetings there. His book Die Abrechnung [Settling of Accounts] says that "a well-known politician" appeared at one of these meetings in April 1990. Talking to DER STANDARD, Hasselbach was more precise: "It was Joerg Haider." He also said there were "regular contacts" between Kuessel, Walter Ochensberger, and Haider. "I even had his private phone number at one point. Haider was particularly enthusiastic about the young people coming over from the GDR." At a meeting in 1991, Haider attended only briefly, but he specifically shook hands with the people from Berlin. Hasselbach considers the group around Kuessel to be "one of the toughest in Europe." They are training new recruits professionally, he said. [passage omitted].
