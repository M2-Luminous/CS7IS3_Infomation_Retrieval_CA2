The council has already expressed its desire to deal with the issue; it has been in a state of alert for a week. However, none of the parties of the conflict have requested it to take a stand. Therefore, KRRiT itself asked Waldemar Pawlak whether the fragment of his Sejm speech, in which he criticized the mass media and accused them of censuring government communiques, might be treated as an official complaint. If so, KRRiT will look into the conflict and assess who was right. Who Has the Right To Criticize Relations between the government and the media are based on strange principles. The government, via its Press Office, informs only about whatever it wants, and it often evades journalists' questions. For example, a day before the general strike of Solidarity, instead of hearing a commentary, journalists were sent from one minister to another, from a minister to the prime minister, from the prime minister to the communique, which was finally signed by the director of the Government Press Office. Such policy is facilitated by the lack of a press spokesman. It is not the spokesman but the ministers themselves that should represent their policy, Minister Michal Strak stated in the Sejm. At the same time, the government wants the media to issue information about everything it does, regardless of the gravity of the matters, statements, visits. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak has several times voiced his dissatisfaction with the fact that his speeches are not published in their entirety, that the television broadcasts only brief summaries of events concerning him. In important situations, when asked about a comment, he himself evades answers. Luckily, There Is Television For some time now, the attack on the media has been stronger; politicians have been complaining mostly about the television. Minister Michal Strak keeps asking for special "windows" for the government, for Labor Minister Leszek Miller, who, when he took over the office, officially gave up the television succession from Jacek Kuron. Right now, he is discussing this matter with Television President Wieslaw Walendziak by mail. The television president agrees to prepare jointly the programs concerning the most important issues related to social policy; however, he consistently refuses to grant any "windows" to politicians. The most resounding conflict so far has been the one between the prime minister and "Wiadomosci" over the reading of the entire governmental communique concerning the strikes. The television employees admit that the government is exerting the greatest pressure on information programs. As for public affairs programs in the first program of the television, including the "Bilans" ["Balance"] program, the Government Press Office is for the time being submitting merely remarks. Walendziak's Adviser Rafal Matyja admits that political pressure on the television is quite frequent, but its directors do not want to publicize this. Most of it can be handled by the television itself. Only the most serious pressure, exerted most brutally, leaks outside. KRRiT member Andrzej Zarebski concedes that, as a result of the recent tensions around the television, KRRiT must "again lean over" the provisions of the law on radio and television that pertain to the possibility of making it possible to "the chief organs of the state to present directly and explain the state policy on the radio and television." This may alter the content of the KRRiT disposition in this matter, which has been prepared but not yet announced. The pressure has not so far been exerted to the still state-owned Polish Press Agency [PAP]. The PAP journalists say: Luckily, there is the television. The various governments, except for the Olszewski Cabinet, understood that this is only an information agency. Hand in Hand It is hard to tell whether there is a joint information policy of the coalition. Both the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] have their own vision and experience in contacts with the media. They only go "hand in hand" as far as criticizing the media, especially the television, is concerned. Not long ago, Aleksander Kwasniewski admitted that a lot more is being written about the left than a year ago, which is understandable. "However, if anyone thinks that this is because of well-wishing, he is naive," Kwasniewski believes. However, he calls this attitude of the media toward the left a constant element of the political game. Criticism became stronger as reports on the Solidarity strikes appeared. The coalition politicians unanimously accuse journalists of heating the strike atmosphere. As usual, television receives the greatest rap on the knuckles. The PSL, which does not have a daily or a major weekly and which has always complained about the negative attitude of the media toward them, hoped to improve this image when it came to power. The SLD, which can always count on TRYBUNA, has not so far turned it into a source of solid, firsthand information. It seems that its politicians are more interested in the image presented in media other than TRYBUNA. The PSL, apart from complaints of a purely political nature, is also criticizing the programs of the television Agricultural Section. PSL Deputy President Franciszek Stafaniuk complained in a letter to the television directors that the journalists present the arguments of the consumers, not of the peasants, that they are not propeasant, and, finally, that they devote too much attention to general information instead of typically agricultural affairs. Politicians, on the other hand, are trying to see to it that such people and not others are invited to the studio. Agricultural Section Director Leszek Spalinski admits that the source of the differences between his team and part of the PSL is the outlook on the future of agriculture. The team is in favor of changes, transformations of the structure of the rural areas, while some of the PSL politicians want to maintain the status quo. Search Within a Small Circle Rafal Matyja believes that, among such conflicts, the model of public television and its relation with the world of politics is being created. The definition and the role of public television in a democratic state will be the subject of a seminar that is scheduled for Friday [6 May]. Participating in the seminar will be members of the Board of Directors and the Supervisory Board of the television and KRRiT members. Journalists will not participate.
