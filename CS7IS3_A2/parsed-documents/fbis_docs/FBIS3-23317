According to a confidential analysis of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, an escalation of violence is imminent in the German capital. Above all an increase in the number of political murders has to be expected, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution warned the Berlin Senat and the police. The background of the alarming assessment of the situation is the formation of a new "trend" in the autonomous scene in Berlin. According to information of DIE WELT, it "is offensively advocating that the killing of fascists be deliberately accepted now when they are attacked." The authorities fear massive riots, particularly in connection with the international soccer match between Germany and England. It is supposed to take place in Berlin on 20 April, Adolf Hitler's birthday. In the scene paper INTERIM (no. 274) it is stated that the match planned "on the Fuehrer's birthday in the stadium built by the Fuehrer in the capital of the Fuehrer's Reich" is a provocation. INTERIM takes the view that the politically responsible persons want to use the opportunity to provoke riots "for the benefit of the 'law-and-order' policy in the election year." As the homes of refugees had to burn after the abolition of the asylum-law, Berlin has to burn now. It continues literally: "There must not be such an unspeakable alliance with a concentration of fascist groups of thugs, hooligans from the FRG and England who are prepared for violence, thousands of heavily armed cops, and riots in the surroundings of the stadium and far beyond it: Let us prevent the match!" Independently of these calls, extreme-left "groups of migrants" are currently also canvassing for an FRG-wide demonstration in Berlin on 20 April. They want to "strike back" against the "Nazis." And this is the definition of their terrorist position: "We are living in hostile surroundings. It is not surprising that a fascist might also be killed in a climate that it politically heated by racist pogroms and oppression." The authorities estimate the number of autonomous persons who are prepared for violence at more than 5,000 in the FRG. They continue to be concentrated in the conurbations of Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt/Main, and the Ruhr area.
