Krivchenko, chairman of the Commission for Reforming the Local Organs of Power, by Nikolay Belyy in Blagoveshchensk under the rubric "Organs of Representative Power"; date not given: "Provinces Want To Think"] [Text] Long before the election of the new Russian parliament preparation of documents for the reform of the local organs of power began in Amur Oblast. Now they are already prepared. What will the new organs of power look like away from Moscow? A. Krivchenko, chairman of the Commission for Reforming the Local Organs of Power, replies to ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. [Belyy] Albert Arkadyevich, here in Amur the people have seen and experienced various organs of power provided by God, the czar, and the Bolsheviks. Here were military governors appointed by the sovereign; subsequently in Blagoveshchensk there was a city public administration, a city, that is to say, petty bourgeois, administrative office [uprava], a city duma, a committee for public safety -- I'm talking about 1917 now -- and soviets of various levels. What now? And anyway, was a reform of the local power so necessary? After all, on a mundane level the old power got in no one's way; it just scribbled one or two things here and there, being only a pale shadow of the other, pro-party power, as we know. [Krivchenko] It is this power that we are reforming -- a window-dressing, a sham power, incapable of thinking properly and seeking compromises. A new parliament has been elected in the country; what are we supposed to do in the provinces -- press on with the soviets, which could offer nothing but the imposition of struggle against reforms, the government, and the president? Incidentally, long before the elections the activity of the soviets at various levels in Amur Oblast was suspended by the head of the oblast administration, and only new elections can resolve the situation legitimately. Yes, in Amur, as, moreover, in Mother Russia as a whole, people have experienced various organs of power, and our commission -- which incidentally, consists of 17 people, including former deputies of various levels, academics, and public figures -- recommends the revival of the ancient Russian forms of statehood and self-government which the Bolsheviks destroyed by force. Our commission has prepared a package of documents aimed at reorganizing the representative power and local self-government. All experience of power was thorougly studied -- from the epoch of military governors in Amur, to our own times; all the best was taken from the long history and practice of power. So far we have elaborated a provisionary statute on the fundamentals of the new power; it will be ratified at the first session of the newly elected oblast duma. [Belyy] So you are having a duma anyway. But no such body existed in Amur before 1917... [Krivchenko] Yes, that is right, and here we are restoring historical justice. We have a governor -- albeit not a military one -- but he does not have a system of checks and balances, as the local procommunist press writes. Now there will be one, in the shape of the oblast soviet. Yes a duma -- how is the Russian "dumat" [to think] worse than the bureaucratically soviet "soveshchatsya" [to consult]? In line with the fundamentals of the Russian constitutional structure, power in Amur Oblast is exercised by the organs of representative (legislative) power and executive power. The oblast duma is the representative structure of state power, the administration the executive structure. The duma is elected by the population on the basis of universal, direct, equal suffrage by secret ballot every two years -- it has 15 deputies. It carries out its activity on a permanent and nonpermnaent basis. The procedure for the organization and holding of elections to the duma and its powers have been elaborated. [Belyy] And what specifically stands behind the concept of "local self-government"? [Krivchenko] It will operate within the limits of population centers -- cities, microrayons, settlements, villages, stations, farmsteads [khutory], and other centers of habitation, and also in rayons. We have revived that ancient Russian concept, the volost [smallest administrative division of czarist Russia]. It is a territorial administrative unit uniting a few population centers for which the terms "rural soviet" and "settlement soviet" were formerly used. Farmsteads and stations also belong to our history. They are names which, if people so desire, can be restored not only to old cossack settlements, but to new ones as well. In cities under oblast jurisdiction and rayons the organs of local self-government are the elective representative organ (the city or rayon duma) and the head of local self-government (head of administration], appointed by the oblast governor. The elective representative organ of local self-government is formed by means of the election of between nine and 12 deputies, working, as a rule, on a nonpermanent basis. I believe that the following is a very important factor. Only citizens of the Russian Federation who have been living on the territory of the given electoral district for not less than three years can be elected to the oblast duma and to the organs of self-government. This will stop the nomination and election of "Varangians" [Norse invaders and founders of Kingdom of Rus], on whom not so long ago the soviets were wholly built, seeking "true people's power" and endlessly flouting the rights and dignity of citizens.
