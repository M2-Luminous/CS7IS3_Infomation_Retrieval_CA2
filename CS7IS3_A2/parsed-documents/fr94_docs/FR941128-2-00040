Take notice that on October 28, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) tendered for filing to become part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the tariff sheets listed on Appendix A to the filing. FGT states that by orders issued January 15, 1993 (January 15 Order), April 21, 1993 (April 21 Order), and September 15, 1993 (September 15 Order), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) approved the Stipulation and Agreement filed August 25, 1992 (Settlement) in Docket Nos. CP92&hyph;182, et al. and authorized FGT to construct and operate a major expansion of its system (Phase III Expansion). These orders also authorized FGT to provide firm transportation service through the expanded capacity pursuant to a proposed new firm transportation rate schedule, FTS&hyph;2. FGT state the initial orders in the Phase III proceedings were issued prior to final resolution of the issues in FGTs restructuring proceeding in Docket No. RS92&hyph;16&hyph;000. Ordering Paragraph H of the Janaury 15 Order provided that proposed Rate Schedule FTS&hyph;2 must comply with any general modifications made by the Commission in FGT's restructuring proceeding. Ordering Paragraph C of the September 15 Order required that Florida Gas shall submit for filing, not less than thirty days and not more than 60 days prior to the proposed effective date or commencement of operations authorized herein, revised tariff sheets in accordance with the Commission's January 15 and April 21 orders and this order. FGT states that although service under Rate Schedule FTS&hyph;2 is not expected to commence before February 1, 1995, it is filing the tariff sheets required to incorporate FTS&hyph;2 service into FGT's currently effective tariff. FGT states that it believes it is important that the terms and conditions affected by FTS&hyph;2 service be known to FGT and all shippers on its system as soon as possible and that it is in the interest of all parties to have final resolution of all issues related to FTS&hyph;2 service prior to the commencement of this service. FGT states the instant filing is being made in compliance with the Settlement and the above-referenced orders. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with ยง385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before November 25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate actions to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
