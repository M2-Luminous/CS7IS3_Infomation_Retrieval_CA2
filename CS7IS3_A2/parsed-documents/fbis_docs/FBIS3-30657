The materials will be submitted to the government, which is to discuss them on Wednesday [9 February], Zieleniec said. According to the Czech Constitution, parliamentary approval is not necessary for the Czech Republic to join the Partnership for Peace, Zieleniec said. After the government gives its approval, either Premier Vaclav Klaus or Zieleniec himself will sign the general declaration on joining the project. The Partnership for Peace programme, which was approved by NATO member countries on January 10, 1994 in Brussels, envisages military cooperation with the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and their eventual admission to the Alliance. Zieleniec said that after signing the document he would oversee the Czech Republic's special proposal for specific cooperation with the Alliance and that NATO would also draw up similar materials concerning this cooperation. These two documents will then form the basis of the agreement between the Czech Republic and NATO on the Partnership for Peace. While under the Partnership for Peace, Czech soldiers could eventually be sent abroad, Zieleniec said that the Czech Constitution requires parliamentary approval of sending armed forces outside of Czech territory. Therefore, "some adjustments will be necessary" to the regulations, he said.
