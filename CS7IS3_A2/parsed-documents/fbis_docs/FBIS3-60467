The disease has been observed in the absolute majority of rayons on the largest island in Russia. Fifty-eight people have been admitted to the hospital to date. The first fatalities were in the port of Kholmsk, where two people have died. In the opinion of doctors, the source of the infection was from newly arrived conscripts or convicts in prison camps on the island. The situation is complicated by the absence of vaccine for inoculations and medicine for those who are already ill. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by the head of the oblast public health department Aleksandr Moshenskiy that the last reserves of vaccine for inoculations are to be used exclusively on children.
