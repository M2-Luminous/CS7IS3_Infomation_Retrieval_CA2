Radio lesotho reported the CAF [Confederation of African Football] cup first leg preliminary round soccer match between Lesotho's Linare and Reunion's St Denis, cancelled earlier, would be played at the national stadium in the Mountain Kingdom capital at 7pm on Monday. A SAPA correspondent said shops in downtown Maseru were open, and the nearby border post, which was closed on Sunday, was operating again and commercial traffic was flowing. Supermarkets and cafes were closed on Sunday and no newspapers were available because of the closed border post. SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio said the Education Ministry had ordered schools, due to open for the first day of the year on Monday, to remain shut. South African Foreign Affairs spokesman Awie Marais said Sunday's fighting ended with heavy overnight rain storms, adding the two factions were maintaining their positions. He described the Mountain Kingdom capital as tense. But Maseru businesses were open in light drizzle on Monday, the SAPA correspondent said. News reports said five soldiers were killed and at least four civilians injured in fighting which began about 10 days ago. Government officials and diplomats have been unable to explain the cause of the dispute between the two military factions.
