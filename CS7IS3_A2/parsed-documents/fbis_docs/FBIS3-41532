Announcing the breakthrough on Monday, the Environment Affairs Department said South Africa had until now been represented at the IUCN by various government and nongovernmental organisations. The newly acquired state membership, however, would involve more votes for SA at IUCN general meetings, the next of which would be in January in Buenos Aires. The IUCN's seminal 1991 document Caring For The Earth set practical guidelines for sustainable living on a global scale. The union has played a leading role in the formulation of international conservation conventions such as Cites [Convention on International Trade in Environmental Species] (which monitors illegal trade in wild animals and plants), the Ramsar Wetlands Convention and CMS (the Convention on Migratory Species), to all of which SA is signatory. The IUCN was created in 1948 and 111 countries and a total of 682 organisations are reperesented.
