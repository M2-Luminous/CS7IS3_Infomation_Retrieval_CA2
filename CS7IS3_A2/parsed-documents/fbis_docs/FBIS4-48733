Earlier, Angolan Finance Minister Alvaro Craveiro, who took part in the talks, said negotiations with Brazil are on right track. He said a degree of understanding has been reached and further meetings have been scheduled to smooth the edges. [Begin Craveiro recording] The negotiations go beyond mere financial relations. The negotiations are linked to petroleum issues and a number of financial facilities, in addition to the problem of Angola's debt. There is a degree of understanding and we are on the right track to settle that issue. [end recording] The Angolan minister noted that bilateral trade exchanges have not yet been formalized, though they are being considered as part of wide-ranging cooperation. [Begin recording] [Craveiro] Such relations have not yet been formalized. They are being considered as part of wide-ranging cooperation. We will hold further meetings in the near future to formalize such relations. [Reporter] Has agreement been reached on the rescheduling of the debt? [Craveiro] Well, that is a [words indistinct] element. [end recording] Jose Aparecido de Oliveira says his country has opened a credit facility to pay for the supply of medicines and foodstuffs. [Begin Oliveira recording] It has already been agreed. We took the initiative of informing Minister Craveiro and the Angolan delegation that President Itamar Franco has recommended the Bank of Brazil to open a credit facility for the supply of foodstuffs and medicines to Angola. Actually, that is the first time for Brazil to take such an initiative. There were no recent impediments on the part of Brazil regarding the supply of perishables. It is the first time that that has happened. It is something new. [end recording] Trade exchanges between the two countries amount to some $200 million.
