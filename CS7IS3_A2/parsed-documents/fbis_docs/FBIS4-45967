At the Elysee [president's office] yesterday the head of state in fact expressed great firmness over the costs, reaffirming his opposition to any resumption of nuclear testing. The statement has been well received by the Left, but criticized by the Right. [passage omitted] Without being totally opposed to the head of state, [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe is less convinced: the refusal to resume testing threatens the entire nuclear deterrent system, the foreign minister believes: [begin recording] Juppe: We need a credible and adequate deterrent force. It exists today; will it exist in 10 years' time? We are not certain of that, because it has to be modernized, and in order to modernize it many experts, in fact most experts, consider that further nuclear testing will be necessary, before computer simulation makes it possible for us to do without it. The president of the republic has taken up a position. That is his right, no one contests his position as head of the armed forces up until the end of his mandate. But he cannot anticipate what his successor will do. It is for the future president of the republic in May 1995 to explain to the French people what his concept of the matter is. [end recording] That was Alain Juppe, who was the guest of Annette Ardisson just now at 0820 on France-Inter.
