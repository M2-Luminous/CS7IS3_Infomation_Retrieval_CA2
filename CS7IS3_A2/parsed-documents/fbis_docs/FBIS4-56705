In other words, a turnout was 73.82 percent and the abstention rate was 26.10 percent. From the time the first results were issued representing only 11.8 percent of the voting tables, the figures have always favored candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares of the United People alliance. Here are the latest figures available: Ernesto Perez Balladares, 33.19 percent; Mireya Moscoso de Gruber [Democratic Alliance], 28.86 percent; Ruben Blades [Papa Egoro Movement], 17.56 percent; Ruben Carles [Change 94], 16.36 percent; Eduardo Vallarino [Christian Democratic Party], 2.15 percent; Samuel Lewis Galindo [National Accord Alliance], 1.57 percent; and Jose Salvador Munoz [Doctrinaire Panamenist Party], 0.32 percent. The Electoral Tribunal must clarify that according to the law, the National Vote-Counting Board must proclaim the official results of the 8 May 1994 elections for president and vice presidents of the Republic. Only 15 hours after the elections and the closure of the polls, we have managed to unofficially announce almost 90 percent of the results, which is unprecedented in the history of Panamanian elections. At this time, the TE's main office declares a recess until 1400 while the computer personnel continue to register the results as they are received from the 547 tables that have not yet been counted. Issued in Panama City on 9 May 1994. Thank you.
