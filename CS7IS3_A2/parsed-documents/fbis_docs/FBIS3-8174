Bela Tonkovic was reelected the party president with a majority of votes. Zvonimir Nesic from Petrovaradin, and Stanka Kujundzic and Lazo Vojnic-Hajduk from Subotica were elected deputy presidents. The DZVH will continue its struggle for cultural autonomy through democratic means, and not only for the cultural autonomy of Vojvodina Croats, but also for all members of the Croat people who live in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it was concluded today at the assembly of Vojvodina Croats. The main objective is to stay and survive in the areas where the Croats have lived for centuries. With the reelection of Bela Tonkovic as the party president, the DZVH assembly opted for continuity in its work. The DZVH has established itself at home and abroad as the only legitimate representative of the Croat people in Serbia, so sooner or later even Belgrade will have to accept it as a partner in talks, it was said at today's assembly in Subotica. In his acceptance address, Bela Tonkovic called on all Croats who live between Subotica and Boka Kotorska to unite even more than before in order to join forces in their struggle for human and national rights which belong to them by all international norms. Other members of the presidency and council of the DZVH were also elected today.
