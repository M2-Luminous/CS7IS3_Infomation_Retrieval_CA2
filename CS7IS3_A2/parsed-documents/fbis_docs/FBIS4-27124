Commenting on his remarks, a MINJU CHOSON analyst today says: This fully shows how desperately the Japanese authorities are trying to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. It is too shameless and impertinent an act for the Japanese authorities to covet for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Although nearly half a century has passed since World War II, Japan is still failing to clearly repent of its crimes. It is reinforcing its "self-defence forces" with sophisticated military equipment, steadily increasing military spendings even after the cold war came to an end. Japan's nuclear armament which has reached the danger line in actuality poses a big threat to peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Asia. It is only too natural that Japan with such background cannot become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and it is as clear as noonday what grave consequences will arise in case Japan should obtain a permanent seat.
