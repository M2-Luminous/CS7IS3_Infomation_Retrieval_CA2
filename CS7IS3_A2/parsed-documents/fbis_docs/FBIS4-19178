PSD, PS Candidates Discussed The choice of long-time Social Democratic Party (PSD) luminary and former Deputy Prime Minister Eurico de Melo as head of the PSD list for the Euroelections is considered "surprising" by commentator Jose Antonio Saraiva in the 12 March Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO. Inasmuch as European elections, which lack the significance of legislative or municipal elections, often lead voters to select a party other than their own, the determining factor in the election is the identity of the head of the list, Saraiva comments. Consequently, the difference in the June Euroelections will be made by leader of the rightist Center Social Democratic (CDS) party Manuel Monteiro, who is running for the European Parliament on a platform of "nationalism"--as opposed to the internationalist values of the European community--that seems to be widely accepted by large groups of people. In addition, Monteiro's youth personifies the revolt of the new generation against the obligations assumed by the old. Eurico de Melo, while certainly not anti-European, will therefore be considered the "symbol of the old generation's abdication to European interests." He will thus contribute to the "aging" of the PSD, Saraiva concludes, adding that only speculation can explain Cavaco Silva's choice. By choosing a politician who made a smooth transition from legendary Prime Minister 5a Carneiro's era to "Cavaco-ism" and who supported Cavaco Silva from the outset, the prime minister may have wished to bring internal pacification to his party, or he may have launched a "trial balloon" to gauge de Melo's chances for the next presidential elections. Saraiva returns to the same theme in the 1 April EXPRESSO, this time stressing the "defensive" side of Cavaco Silva's choice. Fearing that Monteiro's nationalist discourse may resonate in the social democratic electorate, the prime minister sought a "conventional" candidate who cannot be suspected of "Europeanist excesses," Saraiva contends. However, Cavaco Silva may have erred. Monteiro, the embodiment of young urban voters who "tasted the delights of Europe and did not like them," seeks to represent youth revolt in a crisis of values that rejects foreign influences and "rallies round the flag in a future-oriented, post-European reaction." For his part, Eurico de Melo's "non-Europeanism" is not a reaction to Portugal's European experience, but the product of natural conservatism anchored in the past, Saraiva comments. The Euroelections may thus be reduced to a battle between "Euroenthusiasts," who will vote for the European-minded Socialist Party (PS), and "Euroskeptics," who will choose Monteiro's CDS. According to Cristina Figueiredo writing in the 12 March EXPRESSO, Northern politicians are "exulting" over Porto resident Eurico de Melo's candidacy. In their opinion, Cavaco Silva is indicating he will support him for the presidency, provided de Melo obtains "at least" 40 percent of the June vote. Diametrically opposed are those who believe that, while the prime minister has definitely parried off a de Melo presidential candidacy, simultaneously fielding an "illustrious" candidate for the Europarliament, he has, in the process, lost a good presidential candidate and created the problem of "reviving the hopes of former President Ramalho Eanes," Figueiredo comments. On the PS side, following a week of uncertainty and "intensive talks" between leader Antonio Guterres and PS luminary Vitor Constancio, the latter finally rejected Guterres's offer to head the Euroelections list, writes Jeronimo Pimentel in the 26 March Lisbon daily PUBLICO. The final candidate is long-time party official Antonio Vitorino. Joao Soares's nomination for the second spot relegated well-known PS official Joao Cravinho to third place--even if Cravinho headed the list in the 1989 Euroelections and is cited by Pimentel as being "disappointed"--and may cause great intraparty confusion, Pimentel comments. It will also expose Guterres to criticism for the manner in which negotiations were conducted. Constancio's presence at the head of the PS list would have been a threat to Cavaco Silva and a success for Guterres, contends Joao Amaral in the 26 March Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO. While Europe continues to be an "eminently political" issue at a theoretical level, it is an "essentially economic" question for the people, who are less concerned with threats to national sovereignty than with subsidies from Brussels, he writes. Constancio, a "prestigious and moderate" politician as well as a "respected and competent technocrat"--all Cavaco Silva's attributes as well--would have been the "most Cavaco-ist" of the candidates to the European Parliament and could have attracted PSD voters, Amaral continues. Additionally, economist Constancio has in-depth knowledge of his field, a factor of fundamental importance to the man-in-the-street when he thinks of Europe. Cavaco Silva must have "breathed a sigh of relief" when Vitorino's choice was announced, Amaral comments. Stance on Europe Writing in the 19 March EXPRESSO, Jose Antonio Saraiva reviews the candidacies for the Europarliament. CDS leader Manuel Monteiro is "feared" by other candidates for his unabashed "patriotic" feelings. PSD candidate Eurico de Melo is not considered a convinced Europeanist. Before choosing Constancio, the PS sounded out Manuel Alegre, a "romantic" who sees Portugal's future linked more to Africa and Brazil than to the "bourgeois states" of Europe. Finally, the Communist Party's (PCP) candidate, Luis Sa, is well-known for his anti-Europeanist stance. Saraiva contends that advocating European unity is increasingly considered a "sin" in Portugal. In their speeches, ministers are now less eager to "exalt" the European ideal, while they unceasingly stress that European integration will safeguard Portuguese interests. Consequently, the PSD will have to "use doubletalk" in the June elections: Eurico de Melo will make "patriotic" speeches while the government simultaneously concludes agreements that in fact will increasingly restrict Portuguese sovereignty. Saraiva concludes that Euroelections may thus be transformed into a public opinion poll centering on the Portuguese perception of the future of Europe and the role Portugal will play in it. It is increasingly obvious that the initial enthusiasm for Portugal's European integration is waning and that "two Europes" are confronting each other in a Europe essentially defined by market priorities and profits, writes Fernando Rosas in the 23 March PUBLICO. One is a community where unprecedented levels of productivity and accumulation translate into a large-scale offensive against employment, salaries, and social gains rather than a fairer distribution of wealth, improved welfare, and increased access to culture; a community where extraordinary technological advances coexist with the most savage attacks against the environment; a Europe that excludes its poor Eastern and Southern neighbors; a world condemned to an anonymous and uncontrolled bureaucracy, whose federalist ideal has been reduced to "two speeds," Rosas contends. The other Europe is the political heir of the the French Revolution, a community of citizens, human and minority rights, secular institutions, international solidarity, and the right to public education. In sum, a Europe that largely represents "the heritage that differentiates contemporary European culture," Rosas writes, adding that a careful observation of social and political events in the EU makes it uncertain whether these two Europes can continue to coexist in the future. "Suddenly, complete disorientation has occurred," exclaims Jose Manuel Fernandes in a 19 March PUBLICO editorial in view of the "grotesqueness" of the Euroelectoral campaign, in which all parties are vying to field the most anti-Europeanist candidates. In the view of both Cavaco Silva and Guterres, Euroelections are a mere rehearsal for the 1995 legislative elections, and a discussion of Europe holds no interest, Fernandes contends. Had a referendum taken place over the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, it would have allowed the "ghosts" evoked by Manuel Monteiro to be put to rest, he continues. The situation is more complex at present, especially because Europe has generally been reduced to a monetary question and to wrangling over Portugal's share of community funds at the same time that a fundamental issue such as intervention in Bosnia--which presupposes a common foreign and defense policy--is ignored. In their haste to outflank Monteiro, concludes Fernandes, the PSD and the PS seem unsure of whether they want a "Europe of grants" with Portugal waiting for handouts, or a gradually integrated and mighty Europe where the strong help the weak, even at the cost of a partial transfer of sovereignty.
