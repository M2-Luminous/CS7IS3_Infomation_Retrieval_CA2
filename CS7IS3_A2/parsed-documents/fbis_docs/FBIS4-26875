He said: The aim of the national education conference, convened by the party Central Committee and the State Council in the new situation of establishing a socialist market economic structure, is to mobilize the whole party and all sectors of society to implement the "Outline for the Reform and Development of Education in China" so as to accelerate the realization of China's grand objective of economic and social development in the nineties. The current conference will have a profound and far-reaching impact on the development of China's education and economy. The reports of foresight, made by the leading central comrades at the conference, have widened our horizons and instilled new ideas in us. We express our total support. Expounding on Shanghai's understanding of the strategic position of education, Mayor Huang Ju said: The sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy in Shanghai in the nineties has been, to a large extent, due to the importance it attached to education in the eighties. In recent years, Shanghai has become the favorite investment hot spot of domestic and foreign businesses. In particular, it has attracted many world-renowned transnational corporations. This is also mainly due to the unique advantage that in Shanghai the quality of workers is good, trained personnel are fairly concentrated, and education is developed. Practice has shown that an advantage in trained personnel constitutes the most important advantage in the investment environment. We can truly say that "today's education will become the science and technology of tomorrow, and the economy of the day after tomorrow." It is precisely from these historical experiences that we have learned that it is necessary to establish Shanghai's strategic position in education, which means the overall leading position in basic industries. More importantly, Shanghai, which is marching toward the 21st century, must have first-class education to match a first-class city. Shanghai belongs to the whole country. In establishing Shanghai's reform and education goals, we must also embody the strategic idea that Shanghai "serves the whole country and is geared to the whole world." It is Shanghai's bounden duty and obligation to train tens of thousands of high-caliber and high-quality personnel for the Chang Jiang basin and for various areas of the country. As an international metropolis, Shanghai should open up more channels of international cooperation in education, and become one of China's showcases with education geared to the world. Huang Ju said: In the past few years, Shanghai, like the rest of the country, has made marked progress in education but many problems still remain. The major ones are the following four contradictions: the contradiction between educational supply and the demand for trained personnel by large-scale economic and social development; the contradiction between the traditional educational system and Shanghai's lead in establishing a socialist market economic operating mechanism; the contradiction between the existing structure and distribution of education on the one hand, and readjustment of urban functions on the other; and the contradiction between educational barriers between regions and departments on the one hand, and the pattern of all-encompassing opening to the outside world on the other. To solve these contradictions, we must emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, actively explore new ways, and deepen reform. He discussed five aspects of Shanghai's practices and exploration in educational reform and development. 1. Promote high-standard basic education with a view to enhancing the quality of the whole nation. First, while mainly depending on government appropriations, Shanghai has ensured a steady source and increased the revenues for nine-year compulsory education. In the "Measures for Implementing the `Law of the People's Republic of China on Compulsory Education' in Shanghai," promulgated in 1993, it is stipulated that financial appropriations for compulsory education must be increased in two ways and that public expenses should be adjusted yearly according to changes in the prices of commodities. In addition, the measures also urge society to increase investment in education. Meanwhile, to strengthen the training of more teachers for elementary and middle schools and comprehensively upgrade the quality of teachers, we drew up the "Provisions for Elementary and Middle School Studies in Shanghai" to institutionalize the system for in-service teachers to continue their education, and to upgrade the educational level of teachers of elementary and middle schools. On the basis of reforming the distribution system and raising work quality and efficiency, we gradually improved teachers' wages. In 1993, the average pay of elementary and middle school teachers in Shanghai rose by 10 percent over 1992 after allowing for price rises. We have also constantly pushed forward the reform of courses and teaching materials. At present, the attendance rate of school-age children and the percentage of graduates of elementary schools going into middle schools have reached 100 percent. Enforcement of nine-year compulsory education in the 20 districts and counties of the municipality has been completed. 2. Enhance the vitality of education by reforming the method of running schools and the school investment system. The establishment of a socialist market economic structure is bound to demand different ways of running schools and result in calls for a new system in which schools will be run predominantly by the state with the participation of all sectors of society. In the past two years, Shanghai has established over 10 middle and elementary schools run by private individuals or by individuals with the help of the state. It has also approved applications for the construction of privately run schools of higher learning. In running schools through international cooperation, we have established a number of international cooperative schools of specialized studies including accountancy, commerce and trade, and management. We have also promulgated two regulations for the management of civilian-run schools and schools of international cooperation. We have explored the reform of the education investment system and introduced various channels of investment in education. First, we increased government investment by stipulating that the annual increase in local education expenses must be higher than the increase in the gross national product by 2 to 3 percentage points, and that budgeted educational expenses must account for over 20 percent of the total local revenue; second, we raised the proportion of the surtax for urban educational expenses from two to three percent. We have also readjusted the surtax for rural education expenses, increasing it by 30 percent; third, we adopted preferential policies to support industries run by schools. Last year, the total profits made by industries run by schools were 760 million yuan; fourth, we have established a fund for educational development to encourage enterprises, social organizations, and individuals to support education. The fund will reach 100 million yuan by the end of this year. Through the efforts of all concerned, Shanghai's basic education expenses increased by 34 percent, and higher education expenses, 30 percent, last year. 3. Optimize the allocation of educational resources through "joint construction, cooperative construction, merging, and readjustment." Limited by the past system of planned economy, there were barriers in Shanghai's schools, and university courses leaned heavily toward science and engineering. To deal with this contradiction, we carried out major readjustments to the structure of schools of higher learning: 1) we actively explored ways for joint construction of schools of higher learning between Shanghai and the central ministries and commissions, and both sides have signed an agreement on joint construction of Fudan University, Jiaotong University, and Shanghai Foreign Language University; 2) taking advantage of the "211" project, we introduced cooperation in running schools. The four universities were merged recently to form the new Shanghai University; 3) we did a good job in running schools through cooperation between central ministries and commissions, and Shanghai. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation will delegate the management of the Shanghai Foreign Trade College to Shanghai. Through this method, Shanghai's universities and colleges will be readjusted from around 50 to 40, of which local universities and colleges will be readjusted from 21 to 14 or 15. Applying the market mechanism, and in conjunction with large-scale urban construction and reform, we also readjusted the distribution of elementary and middle schools, and by applying the existing educational resources, we have organized the implementation of the "project for training badly needed personnel for Shanghai in the nineties." We have set up 10 training centers for that purpose. We plan to train, in two to three years, tens of thousands of specialized personnel in the fields of banking, insurance, overseas commerce, high-grade accountancy, and foreign law, all of which are urgently needed by Shanghai. 4. Reform the student enrollment and graduate employment systems. Higher education should be provided mainly but not entirely by the government. We have over the past two years taken the reform of student enrollment and graduate employment systems as a breakthrough in advancing the reform of institutes of higher learning, and gradually established a system requiring students to pay school fees while in university and independently select their own jobs upon graduation. With regard to measures, our first was aimed at changing the mechanism to establish a fee system and a corresponding scholarship and educational loan system. Last year's statistics showed fee-paying students accounted for 40 percent of the total student enrollment at Shanghai's institutes of higher learning, in addition to the 10 percent who were entrusted to the institutes by their employers for training. This total figure will increase to 60 percent this year, preparing the institutes of higher learning for next year's abolition of the division between paying and nonpaying students. The second measure was the reform-oriented experimentation with independent student enrollment at eight institutes of higher learning in Shanghai, to give students a greater opportunity to choose their own school and profession, and to promote basic education's shift from one emphasizing examination to one emphasizing quality. The third measure was the breakup of the planned distribution system of "unified job assignment" to establish a system of independent job selection for most graduates; to expand rather considerably the recommendation authority of schools, the personnel selection right of employing units, and the job selection right of graduates; and to appropriately lift restrictions on personnel selection and hiring based on a graduate's place of origin. The municipal government will also set up a qualified personnel market and the "Shanghai City College Graduates' Employment Service Center" to provide information and consultation services to graduates and employing units. 5. Strengthen moral education to comprehensively improve the quality of education. Over recent years, the municipal party committee and government earnestly implemented Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instruction that equally strong emphasis be placed on both spiritual and material civilizations. First, we incorporated school patriotic education and moral education into the master plan for promoting Shanghai's spiritual civilization, and gave them a prominent place in our work. Second, we strengthened organization and coordination, and mobilized the strength of the entire society, naming 20 municipal-level "youngsters' education bases" and setting up some 1,000 district and neighborhood youngsters' education bases to form a good atmosphere and environment throughout the city for patriotic education. Third, we attentively studied the situation and characteristics of opening up to the outside world and adhered to the principle of "emphasizing actual results and rejecting formalism" to carry out lively, impressive, and well-targeted ideological and moral education in various fields, and at different levels; to forge a lofty sentiment of cherishing a deep love for the motherland and enthusiastically seeking advancement; and to promote healthy and strong growth of the new socialist generation. In comprehensively improving the teaching quality, we, in addition to strengthening curriculum reform, emphatically carried out the experimentation and popularization of the credit system in institutes of higher learning. Speaking of Shanghai's primary goals in implementing the "outline," Mayor Huang Ju said: we must, first of all, study and implement the guidelines of the national education conference in real earnest. We will ask party committees and governments at all levels in Shanghai, top party and government leaders in particular, to study the important speeches made by central leading comrades, especially the guidelines of making education a strategic priority. As they study and relay them, they should make comparisons and examination, unify their thinking, act in unison, and truly bring forth a new generation of well-educated and self-disciplined people with lofty ideals and moral integrity. Plans and goals of educational development should be incorporated into the overall plan for Shanghai's social and economic development, and educational indexes must also be incorporated into the system under which the leading cadres at various levels are held responsible for the attainment of specified objectives. The report on government work submitted annually to the people's congress is obligated to set forth requirements and review educational work. In evaluating the performance of leading cadres we should look at their achievements in educational work. Second, we should improve the ranks of teachers and see to it that teachers' wages, housing, and other material benefits are raised and improved. We should work hard to fulfill the goal of raising the average wage of teachers to a level that is 10 percent higher than that of government employees. We must, in particular, improve the material benefits of young and middle-aged backbone teachers. We should learn from Beijing's and Dalian's experiences by incorporating construction of teachers' quarters into the city's urban development plans or quarters development plans. We should also adopt a policy that favorably tilts towards the teachers in terms of pensions and medical insurance. Third, we should concentrate the required financial resources to ensure construction of key educational projects. Fourth, we should step up educational legislation so that education will be brought within the jurisdiction of law. We plan to establish a basic framework of educational laws by formulating 40 or so sets of regulations within three to five years. We must also enhance our awareness of law enforcement and strengthen the supervision mechanism. Regulations, once promulgated for implementation, must be strictly enforced according to law. Mayor Huang Ju's speech was highly acclaimed by the conference participants.
