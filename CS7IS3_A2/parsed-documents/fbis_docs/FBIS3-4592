If the conditions were not met, the source said, plans to stage the military maneuver will be pushed for again. The South Korean government is expected to announce the suspension of Team Spirit '94 on Tuesday, the same day the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency are scheduled to begin their tasks on seven declared nuclear sites in North Korea, the official said. The United States will announce Tuesday the terms of the Pyongyang-Washington agreement made last Friday in New York and fully agree to Seoul's position, the source said.
