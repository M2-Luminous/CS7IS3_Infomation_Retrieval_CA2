But for How Long?"] [Text] In the Smolnyy the ides of March were marked by the high-speed transformation of the local executive administrative structures. The Government of St. Petersburg has been formed, and the administrative and territorial structure of the city has been altered. The Government of St. Petersburg, which is headed by Anatoliy Sobchak, includes 11 top officials, mainly former chairmen of City Hall sector committees. From the end of March seven city rayons will vanish at a stroke from the map of St. Petersburg. They are being replaced by three new, larger ones -- Tsentralnyy, Admiralteyskiy, and Kurortnyy. The authorities have a totally convincing case: Expenditure on maintaining the rayon-level bureaucracy must be reduced. As for the citizens, they have no particular enthusiasm for this latest reshaping of administrative structures. The man in the street has always been accustomed to our bureaucrats finding themselves a job which suits them. People are more worried about something else: What is going to happen to the social welfare offices, housing offices, militia departments, advice centers, and other rayon services to which everyone has become accustomed.
