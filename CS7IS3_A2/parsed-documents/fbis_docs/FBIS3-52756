During that period, we have witnessed relative, sporadic, and intermittent clashes among the Afghan struggling groups in that country, despite the general belief that after victory they would reach a relative understanding and begin rebuilding the country. But we have actually witnessed that they have failed to reach a comprehensive agreement. What are the reasons for the clashes? [Taherian] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. As you pointed out, during the past two years, and after the mojahedin entered Kabul, they have had various agreements among themselves that have never been completely put into practice. Perhaps one of the reasons is that none of those agreements has ever taken into consideration the rights of all the groups in a comprehensive and complete manner and has not paid complete attention to all the realities existing in Afghanistan. At times interference by those who did not know about the Afghan issue and were outside the region has resulted in a failure for any serious work to be done. It must be said, unfortunately, that the monopolistic tendencies of some individuals have become an added burden and resulted in our witnessing repeated clashes in the Afghan capital, Kabul, and intermittent fighting in various areas in Afghanistan in the past two years, an Afghanistan that has been beset by war, bloodshed, and destruction for 14 years. And that has continued because of what I told you. [Announcer] You made a passing reference to the role of foreign factors in this. What do you believe its extent to be? [Taherian] What is definite is that the forces outside the region and those elements who are not present in the region have had some connections with some of the groups. And those connections have always resulted in -- without taking into consideration the interests of the Muslim people of Afghanistan and what the people of Afghanistan need -- them seeking their own specific goals. That definitely is one of the factors that has resulted in continued clashes or at times has started clashes. In the past two years we have seen clashes that one can specifically connect to foreign elements, to the affiliation that some groups have with foreign elements. The result of all that has always been one loser -- the suffering Muslim people of Afghanistan. [Announcer] Mr. Taherian, achieving a relative understanding is an important parameter in the Afghan events. Everyone, particularly us in the Islamic Republic wish for the Afghan groups to solve their problems in peace and to reach an understanding. But what do you propose as a particular political solution to the Afghan problem? [Taherian] As you have pointed out, the Islamic Republic of Iran stood by the holy war of the Afghan Muslim people against the Soviet occupiers. After victory and mojahedin's entrance to Kabul, the Islamic Republic of Iran continued to stand by them and has always wished for the improvement of the Afghan situation and has given practical help to the Muslim people. It has done so during the jehad as well as the mojahedin victory and will continue to do so. We are certain that for regional stability, the Afghan problem should be solved through negotiations between the jehad groups. In answering your first question, I pointed out that the problems existing between the conflicting groups have their roots in the past two years and possibly even in the pre-victory period. The important principle that must be taken into account by all those interested in finding a solution is the reality of the situation -- Afghanistan is a Muslim and a multinational country. Any solution must take these two factors into account. Furthermore, all the groups have a large amount of weapons. The [Soviet] occupiers can not claim that they developed the country. While Afghanistan was occupied, they provided weapons for various groups more than anything else, and Afghanistan has been turned into an ammunition dump. These several factors must be taken into account for any solution that might be put forward. And the Afghan groups must also consider that any solution that is going to be planned and programmed, if it is going to be turned into law, must recognize the rights of all nationalities, groups, and parties. They must be given their portion of rights. We would be wrong to think that a group, on its own, could achieve supremacy. Unfortunately all groups have experienced this one way or another. If they go alone on a path, they would achieve nothing. It seems that the most reasonable way is first for the mojahedin and people of Afghanistan to find a solution based on Islamic principles and according to the ethnic conditions of the country. And second, Afghanistan's neighbors could prepare the grounds for such discussions and the necessary dialogue that must take place between the various groups, so as to allow Afghan groups to sit together around a table and find a reasonable solution based on Islamic principles acceptable by nearly all the people.
