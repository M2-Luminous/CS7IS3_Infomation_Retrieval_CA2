At 2230 Vladivostok time [1230 GMT], the fire and explosions were continuing. The area was concealed by thick smoke, therefore it is difficult to assess the damage. There is information about a great number of injured, mostly people hurt by glass splinters from windows which were put out in all the surrounding settlements. The director of Vladivostok private radio station, (Dmitriy Bruzgin), informed IMA-PRESS that more than 10 eyewitnesses had phoned the radio with reports of people injured.
