The aim of this meeting was to inform Mr. Martinez and to protest against the criminal act of Greek commandos in Albanian territory. After the presentation of Albanian Government, note of protest to the Greek Government, Mr. Selami set forth to Mr. Martinez a review of the relationship between the two countries, and informed him on the policy of certain Greek ultra nationalists circles as well as their continuous attempts that aim at thwarting the relations and destabilizing the situation in Albania. The policy of these circles has affected Greek official policy, added Selami, which is reflected in its attempts to hinder Albanian integration to European structures and in their anti-human stand towards Albanian emigrants as well as the unprecedented case of the open aggression against Albanian people and its sovereignty. This policy, pointed out Selami, is against the peace process in the region and runs contrary to the EU [European Union] policy, member of which is Greece as well. Further, Mr. Selami requested from Mr. Martinez to intervene in the Council of Europe to examine this terrorist act against the Albanian Republic and to arrest this attitude that aims to put the whole Balkan region in fire. Greece, as a member of Council of Europe, should be responsible for trampling down international rules that adjust the relationship between the two countries. On his part, Mr. Martinez thanked the Albanian delegation for the information in relation to Greek commandos terrorist act against Albania. We are worried about the Greek policy in Balkans, added Mr. Martinez. This is a grave incident and we will investigate it closely in order that the culprits should bear the responsibility. Albanian delegation had other meetings with several deputies of many European countries and informed them about this terrorist act. The delegation will present this issue in the meetings of several parliamentary commissions and other political groups. The note of protest was delivered to all the delegations and members of Council of Europe as well as the diplomatic corpses accredited in Strasbourg.
