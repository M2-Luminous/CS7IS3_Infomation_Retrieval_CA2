After talks with General Rose in Sarajevo's Serb suburb of Lukavica, General Mladic stressed the fact that the Bosnian Serbs had placed their most important [word indistinct] in the Sarajevo area under U.N. control and expressed satisfaction that the UNPROFOR commander was "aware that the Moslems have again breached agreement and declined to withdraw any part of their infantry." "I think it is good that General Rose insists on a balance of power and urges that the Moslem side should make reciprocal moves," he added. "I hope UNPROFOR will influence the Moslems to realize that they cannot expect the peacekeepers or NATO to wage war for them and that they should come to the negotiating table and settled disputes by political means. Before that, I don't believe anybody could guarantee the realization of their crazy idea about a multi-ethnic, multi-confessional or Islamic country on Serb territory," Mladic said. The agreement reached by the Croats and Moslems to form a federation in Bosnia is welcome if it is striving towards peace but it would not be good if this is not the case, said General Mladic. "We are ready for both," he said and added that the avoidance of the Moslem military commanders to meet with the Serb side indicated that they were still hoping to get somebody on their side to fight for their goals. Top military officers of the Bosnian Serb and Moslem armies were expected to meet at Sarajevo airport on Thursday to discuss ceasefire and free movement of civilians in the Sarajevo area but Moslem Commander Rasim Delic did not arrive to the meeting. After talks with Mladic, General Rose voiced optimism in view of the restoration of peace in Sarajevo. Rose said the bridge linking the Serb suburb of Grbavica and the Moslem part of Sarajevo was now open only for UNPROFOR troops and vehicles. Talks on free passage of vehicles of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are also under way, he added.
