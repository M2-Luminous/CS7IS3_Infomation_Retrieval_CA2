The serious work that has been started in the country will be continued. This was stated today by Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, speaking at a news conference here. He is in Davos to take part in the world economic forum. [passage omitted] V. Chernomyrdin said that the fight against inflation is one of the main areas for the government's work in 1994. Last year the task was to knock down the rate of inflation from over 30 percent to 12-15 percent a month. This task was fulfilled. "We should now keep to this level," the Russian prime minister stressed. "The rate of inflation will fluctuate around 20 percent a month in the first half of the year. We will try to bring it down to 15-18 percent by the end of the year." The head of the Russian Government noted the need for the restructuring of industry and of agrarian and other sectors of the economy. According to him, this will play a predominant role. He pointed out that there would not be any control over wages and distribution. The government is raising the question of granting more rights to the regions. Touching upon the formation of the government, V. Chernomyrdin reported that there were no lengthy talks with the president on cadre reshuffling. This question was discussed in early December and, but for the elections, but for the referendum, the reshuffle would have been carried out last year. "Therefore, there's no need to think things up, everything is going as agreed with the president," he stressed, adding that the reorganization of the government is continuing. [passage omitted] "Russia has always played and will continue to play a certain role in the world community. Difficult processes which are painful for us are under way in Russia today. We are experiencing difficulties. In order to join the market economy in a real way, to move forward into the world community, we should bring everything into line with the demands of market relations." [passage omitted]
