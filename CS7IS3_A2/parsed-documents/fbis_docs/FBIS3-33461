During the opening ceremony that began after 1500, a little over an hour later than scheduled and even so not graced by the sacred words of our national anthem, Dr. Fiallos Oyanguren summoned the 14 political groupings that will participate in the election jousts ending on 27 February of this year to conduct a high-minded campaign free of the violence that he said would only usher in death. However, what can we coastal dwellers expect of this election campaign that is now officially under way? Speaking for myself, I believe a great deal. Enjoying the right to exercise suffrage, we shall be able to elect those who for four years will sit in our regional legislative body, the Autonomous Regional Council. Nor is that all. The wide diversity of candidates among whom the coastal people may choose will enable them to determine for whom they should vote. It is not simply a matter of candidates, but also of the parties that back or represent them. That is why it is necessary to express opinions about some of them so as to provide another perspective. The people, particularly along the Atlantic Coast, need to be told very little about the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN). They need only to be reminded of the years during which it was in power, of the barbarities committed against our people, the suffering of the mothers, the hunger, death, and despair. Furthermore, its candidates include members of the fortunately now defunct Ministry of Interior. The Central American Unionist Party (PUCA), a party with minimum strength in the region and which in the 1990 elections received all of 120 votes. Throughout these years, its presence on the Coast has been little or nil. The Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN), a party that tries to sell the idea that it is the representative of the working class. However, what can we expect of a party whose top leader, Dr. Gustavo Tablada, betrayed the Nicaraguan people by forming the sadly famous "Center" group and, in a vile alliance with the Sandinists, assumed the presidency of the National Assembly? In the case of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC), one cannot speak of betrayal, for it has been a force that has opposed the current co-government on the national level. However, since this contest is merely regional, one must note that its "leaders" are not even from the Coast, nor do they enjoy the sympathy of the voters. The Nicaraguan Christian Social Party (PSC) is in truth a party that is not representative and that enjoys no popular support. The Nicaraguan Democratic Party (PADENIC) presents itself to the people with some new faces and others that belonged to other parties. It attacks the administrative corruption that unfortunately besets certain government agencies, but without presenting any real alternatives to the problems of the Coast. The Democratic Action Movement (MAD) is known in Bluefields as the Group of the 20 because that was the approximate number of persons who greeted its top leader when he visited our port city. It could once have been said of the Nicaraguan Resistance Party (PRN) that it had the support of a large sector of the population, but when it incorporated into its ranks individuals who had held public posts, it did not do so in the proper manner and has thus lost support and strength. Let Us Save the Atlantic Coast (DEX) is a movement that wants to save the Coast, but is running candidates in only one of the 15 districts. The people view the Authentic, Autonomous Coastal Movement (MAAC) as a movement having close ties with the Sandinists and are therefore reluctant to give it their trust. Yatama is a party that lost its identity from the moment it made a pact with the Sandinists, a party in which one cannot have confidence because it generated a lack of stability in the region. The Coastal Democratic Alliance (ADECO) is the work of the governor and deputy from the "Center" group, Dr. Alvin Guthrie Rivers, who with four years in the regional government is running in order to solve the problems of the Atlantic Coast. It is not very difficult to find persons among its members who are highly unpopular with the people. The Conservative Popular Alliance (APC) is a party which on the national level turned its back on the people and has become involved in the activities of the illegal National Assembly. The National Opposition Union (UNO), after serious research and consultations with the people and based on the real problems and needs of the people, presents new faces, persons with proven honesty, capabilities, and a firm willingness to make progress in our region. It is doing its utmost to achieve full application of Law 28. It should be stated that, just as it has demonstrated on the national level, the UNO [National Opposition Union] has not been able to govern in our region either. On the contrary, government has been in the hands of persons who have taken advantage of the administration of public service to get rich illicitly, so that the UNO is now seeking to take over the government and restore the people's confidence. It is the voters who will have the last word and who, in the secrecy of the voting booths and advised only by their conscience, will know how to make their votes count.
