Province 94WE0162B Lusaka TIMES OF ZAMBIA in English 10 Dec 93 p 2 94WE0162B Lusaka TIMES OF ZAMBIA Language: English Article Type:CSO [Excerpt] Fifty-five people have died of measles in Chama in Eastern Province since the outbreak of the disease in January. Provincial medical officer Dr. Godfrey Chishimba said 978 cases of measles had been recorded and the death toll could be higher because some occurred in remote areas without the knowledge of health personnel. Dr. Chishimba said most of the deaths occurred between January and September in nine places under chiefs Kambombo, Tembwe, Chibale, Mulilo and Chikwa. A team of medical staff had been sent to the affected areas to immunise people against the killer disease and that another group will soon go there to carry out another round of immunisation. Dr. Chishimba who complained of erratic supply of drugs to the province to contain the disease said the situation was under control. But reports reaching Chipata from Chama say there is a fresh outbreak of the disease and more people are dying especially in Chief Kambombo's area. [Passage omitted]
