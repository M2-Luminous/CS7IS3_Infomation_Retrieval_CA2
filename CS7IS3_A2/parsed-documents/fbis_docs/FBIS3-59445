Among other things, Vacaroiu assessed that over the first half of the year inflation will grow slightly, by 7 to 9 percent, but as a result of the package of measures intended to regain the balance of the macroeconomic structure of the country, during the second half of the year inflation will decrease to 3 to 5 percent. The average rate of inflation over 1994 will thus reach 75 to 90, perhaps 100 percent. The executive has prepared a number of draft bills that should be debated by parliament, from among which Vacaroiu mentioned the draft bills on the setting up of a stock exchange market, the draft bill on public finance, and the draft bill on the introduction of local taxes. Asked about a possible government reshuffle, the prime minister answered that the executive is always considering reshuffles, depending on the results of the work accomplished by ministers and state secretaries. Vacaroiu stressed that in the current transition the government needs the best minds, with good organizational skills, who could provide a new impetus to the reform process.
