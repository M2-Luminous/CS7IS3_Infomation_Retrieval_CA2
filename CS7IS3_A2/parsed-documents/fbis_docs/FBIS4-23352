The move was welcomed by Cape Point chief nature conservation officer Mr Howard Langley, but was slammed by green pressure groups. RSC councillors were met at Cape Point Thursday by protesters. RSC chairman Mr Piet Loubser said the executive committee's decision had been unanimous. "The professional (environmental) people we've had to advise us have done a fine job and the new development will have less impact on the natural environment than the present facilities." The R4 million development, which could be completed within a year, includes a sunken restaurant below the parking area with rockeries and indigenous plants on its roof, and a funicular rail system to replace the buses to the Cape Point view site. "Everything humanly possible would be done to ensure there was no damage to the environment," Mr Loubser said. Protesters bore banners and placards reading "no environmental impact assessment. No public participation. No unilateral decision!", "Our Point, our decision", "Will the people benefit", "1990 proposals -- what happened?", "Cape Point is our heritage" and "Cape Point real estate" over-written with "sold".
