The Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress Standing Committee and special Tibet People's Congress committees conduct inspect and supervise the implementation of laws and regulations as well as resolutions and decisions with legal nature formulated by the National People's Congress [NPC], the NPC Standing Committee, the Tibet People's Congress, and the Tibet People's Congress Standing Committee. It is necessary to focus the law enforcement inspection of a period on such major issues as reform, opening up, socialist modernization, safeguarding the unification of the motherland, and enhancing the unity of all nationalities. Special efforts should be made to strengthen inspection and supervision of the enforcement of laws and regulations concerning a socialist market economy so as to protect and promote the development of a socialist market economy. 2. While inspecting law enforcement, the standing committee and all specialized committees of the Tibet People's Congress should primarily inspect and supervise how laws and regulations are being enforced by authorities in charge of law enforcement, and see to it that the regional government and its departments, the regional higher people's court, and the regional people's procuratorate take timely actions to deal with problems emerging in the enforcement of laws and regulations. The inspection groups should not handle problems directly. 3. Law enforcement inspection should proceed according to plan. The plan should include what, how, when, and where the inspection will be conducted, as well as other requirements. The Tibet People's Congress Standing Committee General Office should submit its plan to the standing committee chairman and vice chairmen meeting for approval and then submit the plan to the standing committee for the record. The regional people's congress standing committee general office, or the specialized people's congress committees, will notify the regional people's government and its related departments, the regional higher people's court, and the regional people's procuratorate, as well as standing committees of relevant municipal, county (or prefectural) people's congresses and liaison departments of the autonomous region in various prefectures about the inspection plan. 4. Inspection groups must be formed in such a manner that they are small but capable, efficient, and mobile. The regional people's congress standing committee inspection group should be composed of a head and several group members. The head should be selected from among standing committee members at the people's congress standing committee chairman and vice chairmen meeting. Specialized committees should form their own inspection groups. The standing committee and specialized committees may recruit deputies to the regional people's congress and relevant experts to be members of their inspection groups. They may also invite people of authorities in charge of enforcement of law and regulations, or people in charge of municipal and county (or prefectural) people's congress standing committees, to take part in inspection. 5. The inspection groups' members and staff personnel should be knowledgeable about the relevant laws, regulations, and policies. They should collect information about the enforcement of these laws and regulations and hear reports by authorities in charge of enforcement of laws and regulations. 6. The inspection groups should go deep into the realities of life and the masses at the grass-roots to understand the actual state of how laws and regulations are being enforced and to study enforcement problems through hearing reports, holding meetings, interviewing individuals, conducting surveys, and conducting on-the- spot study. Relevant departments and local authorities should support their work and provide them with actual information and other needed assistance. 7. After the inspection, inspection reports must be prepared under the supervision of the heads of inspection groups. Contents of the reports should include a comprehensive review of the ways the laws and regulations they have inspected were enforced; analysis of the causes of problems about the enforcement of laws and regulations; suggestions for improving law enforcement; and suggestions for amending, supplementing, and interpreting the laws and regulations. The reports must state facts objectively and truthfully, and they must not evade problems. 8. The regional people's congress standing committee chairman and vice chairmen meeting should request the standing committee to place on its agenda the law enforcement inspection report prepared by the regional people's congress standing committee inspection group. The meeting will decide whether it should request the standing committee to place the law enforcement reports prepared by the regional people's congress' specialized committees on its agenda. For those reports placed on the agenda, they should be delivered by the heads of the law enforcement inspection groups at standing committee meetings and examined and discussed there. People of authorities in charge of enforcement of laws and regulations should hear the views and answer questions at the meetings. Standing committee members may raise questions with regard to major issues concerning the enforcement of laws and regulations. When necessary, the standing committee should come up with a resolution. Specialized committees should examine and discuss their own law enforcement reports that are not placed on the standing committee's agenda. 9. The law enforcement inspection report examined by the regional people's congress standing committee and the views it expresses should be referred to authorities in charge of enforcement of laws and regulations, and these authorities should earnestly improve their law enforcement and, within six months, submit a written report to the standing committee about their improvement measures and the results they have achieved. When necessary, the regional people's congress standing committee chairman and vice chairmen meeting should request the standing committee place the report on its agenda for examination. For law enforcement reports examined by specialized committees of the regional people's congress as well as the views they have expressed in examining the reports, the specialized committees should refer them to authorities in charge of enforcement of laws and regulations, and these authorities should report to the specialized committees on how they have improved their way of enforcing laws. If the specialized committees are not satisfied with the reports, they may request the standing committee to reexamine the reports. 10. For major typical cases of lawlessness discovered during the inspection, the regional people's congress standing committee chairman and vice chairmen meeting may refer them to the specialized committees and the standing committee's administrative office for investigation. The investigation results should be reported to the regional people's congress standing committee chairman and vice chairmen meeting, and the meeting may request relevant authorities handle the problems within a specific period. The relevant authorities should report the results in a timely manner. When necessary, the regional people's congress standing committee chairman and vice chairmen meeting may request the standing committee examine the results. For specially major typical cases of lawlessness, the standing committee may exercise its legal rights and form an ad hoc committee or group to investigate the cases. The standing committee will not directly handle these cases, which should be dealt with by authorities in charge of enforcement of laws and regulations strictly in accordance with legal procedures. 11. The media should report and publicize in a timely manner the law enforcement inspection carried out by the regional people's congress standing committee. The regional people's congress general office may hold news briefings to inform the media about the inspection. The public may be informed of the major typical cases of lawlessness discovered during the course of inspection as well as the results of handling the cases.
