Speaking at a news conference in Kiev Wednesday [1 June], he pointed out that he pinned his hopes on private foreign capital rather than centralized western aid in the resolution of economic issues. "We have no hope for a Marshall plan, that is why Ukraine should rely on its own forces in the first place," Kuchma was quoted as saying. He added that it was necessary to create such rules of the games that western partners did not fear to lose their investments. Commenting on his initiative to grant Crimea special status announced in parliament Wednesday, Kuchma said he meant the status of a free economic area. It is necessary to give Crimea more economic independence rather than take back powers, he said adding that Crimea should be kept within the Ukrainian state borders,. The presidential elections in Ukraine will be held on 26 June. Leonid Kuchma is Ukraine's former prime minister, presently the president of the Ukrainian Industrialists and Entrepreneurs' Union and the leader of the Interregional Bloc for Reforms.
