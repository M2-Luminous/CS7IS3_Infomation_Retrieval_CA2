In a statement to reporters following talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, Lord Owen explained that the agreement called for the deployment of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) between the warring sides. It is very important for UNPROFOR to be there because that would reduce the risk of new armed confrontations, Lord Owen said. Lord Owen said that progress had been achieved in the talks with Milosevic and that he now felt there was reason for greater optimism. Lord Owen and the other co-chairman of the international conference on former Yugoslavia, Thorvald Stoltenberg, who was also present at the meeting with Milosevic, said that there were three phases in the present diplomatic activities for resolving the Bosnian crisis. The first phase begins on Friday when the co-chairmen and special Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin will leave for Pale and Sarajevo, the seat of the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Moslems. The second phase will be the signing of the peace agreement. The final phase will begin only after the general cease-fire agreement is reached. That phase will cover the precise drawing of maps, the determining of borders between the Serb republic and the Croat-Moslem federation and the lifting of the sanctions, Lord Owen said. The U.N. Security Council imposed comprehensive and binding sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in late May 1992 because of its alleged involvement in the war of local Serbs, Croats and Moslems in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Churkin, who joined the talks between the co-chairmen and Milosevic, explained Moscow's stand on this issue, Lord Owen said. Lord Owen said that if they [word indistinct] be partners in the peace process, then that partnership should not cover only the drawing of maps, but also the specification of the process of the gradual suspension of the sanctions. Prior to today's joint meeting with the co-chairmen, Churkin met with Milosevic three times in the past 24 hours.
