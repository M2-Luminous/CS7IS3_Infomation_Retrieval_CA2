Abiola. Ambassador Kingibe, who was speaking with the PAN-AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY in Tunis, said he believed there was a better way of tackling the problem created by the annulment of the 12 June election. According to him, 12 June was a democratic event endorsed by the people of Nigeria and, therefore, it would be wrong of anybody who is talking of democracy to seek to impose his vision without consulting the people on the political future of Nigeria. He said the only way to reach all Nigerians on the issue was through their elected representatives in the national constitutional conference scheduled to begin later this month. Ambassador Kingibe, who was Abiola's running mate in the annulled election, said he did not run with Chief Abiola to be vice president of Nigeria by force. He advised Abiola to consider the implications of his actions on the nation and accept the realities of the moment. Ambassador Kingibe gave an assurance that the present military administration will disengage from politics and hand over power to an elected democratic government through the national constitutional conference.
