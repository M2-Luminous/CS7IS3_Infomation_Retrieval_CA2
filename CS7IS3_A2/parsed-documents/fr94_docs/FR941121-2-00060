FR941121-2-00060 FR941121-2-00049 [FRL&hyph;5110&hyph;6] Notice of Proposed Administrative De Minimis Settlement Pursuant to Section 122(g)(4) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act Regarding the Niagara County Refuse Superfund Site, Niagara County, NY AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of proposed de minimis settlement and opportunity for public comment. SUMMARY: In accordance with Section 122(i) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9622(i), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''), Region II announces a proposed administrative de minimis settlement pursuant to Section 122(g)(4) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(g)(4), relating to the Niagara County Refuse Superfund Site (``Site''). The Site is located in the Town of Wheatfield and City of North Tonawanda, Niagara County, New York and is on the National Priorities List established under Section 105 of CERCLA. This notice is being published pursuant to Section 122(i) of CERCLA to inform the public of the proposed settlement and of the opportunity to comment. EPA will consider any comments received during the comment period and may withdraw or withhold consent to the proposed settlement if comments disclose facts or considerations which indicate that the proposed settlement is inappropriate, improper or inadequate. The proposed de minimis settlement will be memorialized in an Administrative Order on Consent (``Order'') between EPA and eleven settling parties (``Respondents''). Under the Order, the Respondents will be obligated to pay an aggregate of $793,866 to the Hazardous Substances Superfund. The amount required to be paid by each settling party represents the share attributable to such Respondent of projected total response costs at the Site, based upon the Respondent's estimated volumetric contribution, plus a premium to account for the potential of cost overruns, the potential of failure of the selected remedy and other risks. Pursuant to CERCLA Section 122(g)(4), the Order may not be issued without the prior written approval of the Attorney General or her designee. In accordance with that requirement, the Attorney General or her designee has approved the proposed administrative order in writing. EPA intends to settle with other potentially responsible parties concerning the performance of the remedy selected for the Site and concerning payment of additional amounts to EPA in respect of past costs. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before December 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Regional Counsel, New York/Caribbean Superfund Branch, Room 437, 26 Federal Plaza, New York City, New York 10278 and should refer to: ``Niagara County Refuse Superfund Site, U.S. EPA Index No. II CERCLA&hyph;94&hyph;0213''.
