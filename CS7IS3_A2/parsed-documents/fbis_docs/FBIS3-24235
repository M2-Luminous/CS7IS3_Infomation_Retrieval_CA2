I said that the very problem of choice, the lesser of two evils, was essentially immoral. You, on the other hand, maintained that there are times of forced choice, when this is essential in the name of higher goals, for the sake, for example, of avoiding civil war. And you continued: A new constitution will be adopted, elections will be held, and we will have an opportunity to act on the basis of moral convictions. All this has happened. Now you and your faction in the Duma have voted for a political amnesty for the prisoners of Lefortovo. This was a free choice, so its time had come? [Shakhray] The choice about which you speak was made by me consciously and voluntarily, and I consider it, as before, correct. As far, however, as actual preferences are concerned, we will still be balancing on the razor's edge for quite some time. Take the present situation concerning the constitution. The majority of those in the Duma recognize, I believe, neither the constitution nor the Duma, but are, nonetheless, using both to resolve their problems. This does not afford them any delight, of course, and they are looking for sympathy. I made my choice on the basis of the fact that as of 3-4 October we have been in a state of civil war, although there are no hostilities currently. The possibility of their resumption is for me not ruled out. And I chose between the just but abstract demand for the proceedings to be brought to the point of the rendering of a judgment or, on the other hand, the adoption of a decision on amnesty as an important step en route to civil reconciliation. Let us look the truth in the eye. On the first day of business of the Duma it became obvious that it would adopt a decision on a political amnesty. This was borne out by the test voting, when on each occasion there was a shortage of two to five votes. But if a fact is obvious, it is necessary to think through one's actions on the basis of this fact. Otherwise it remains merely to throw up one's hands, which is what we are today doing: Where were the advisers, analysts, aides? We decided to support the amnesty not for amnesty's sake but as a step on the way toward civil reconciliation. And we insisted that this be done in a particular sequence, what is more. First, a Memorandum of Accord adopted by the Duma, then the negotiations of all political sides and branches of power, at which the terms of political, socioeconomic, and interethnic stabilization for the coming two years would be recorded. Finally, the president and parliament would adopt a document on legal guarantees of a political truce, the amnesty included. And only after this would the people go free. The sequence was broken, unfortunately. The communists and the agrarians wanted an amnesty without any obligations. And Russia's Choice believed that it would prevent this, manifestly overestimating its possibilities. [Yakovlev] But if the planned sequence in civil reconciliation was unsuccessful, you should not have voted for the amnesty, perhaps? [Shakhray] People breathe a sigh of relief when if only some opportunity for reconciliation appears. There is currently a mass of calls, and I am receiving a heap of telegrams from the provinces: Go for the next steps. I confess, this is for me the sole outlet in the information blockade in which I have found myself in Moscow.... Following the amnesty, there have come to be more opportunities for reconciliation, incidentally. We need to be able to avail ourselves of them. The time for this is two months. Besides, the present political amnesty has a number of paradoxical features, which are easily predicted. The amnesty corresponds to the interests of the president and the government. It is more beneficial having Rutskoy and Khasbulatov at liberty than in Lefortovo. In addition, the people who have been released have undertaken, as it were, not to call for bloodshed, assaults in the future.... [Yakovlev] Permit my disbelief: I heard what Anpilov was shouting as he came through the gate, and I know the character of Konstantinov. [Shakhray] If Anpilov or Konstantinov once again call for violence, the law enforcement authorities should act on the basis of the new circumstances.... A second paradox of the amnesty: It will be followed, in my view, by quite a lengthy period of interaction of the president, the government, and parliament. A considerable part of the Duma has discharged its election commitments: the release of the above-mentioned persons. Now they have no interest in the further elevation of either Rutskoy or Khasbulatov, they need other leaders. They will not, most likely, move to exacerbate the confrontation with the president: The law of self-preservation will operate. [Yakovlev] Today we know that the president did not comment on the amnesty directly. But the pressure on the prosecutor general led to his resignation. Aleksey Kazannik believed that it was more important to be honest than to swear fealty to the president. As far, however, as his entourage is concerned, how many days is it now that it has been publicly confessing that it was unable, did not know, could not think how to get around, as it were, what should be done according to the law. [Shakhray] You are to a large extent right, unfortunately. In addition, we have seen for ourselves that, apparently, we lack a mechanism of the interaction of president and parliament. The president, parliament, the public prosecutor's office, and the judicial system. But if intelligent conclusions are drawn from this lesson, what I have said: The need for forced reconciliation, will have been confirmed. [Yakovlev] I cannot say that I share your opinion, at the same time, on the other hand, I accept what is undoubtedly reasonable in your arguments. But how, pray, is it possible to be reconciled with the disregard for public opinion that was manifested so forcefully at that time? The gate of Lefortovo was flung open without people even having been told who were to blame--the one who signed the edict, violating the constitution and breaking up parliament, or those who, lodged in the White House, called for the storming of the Kremlin. Do you believe that it is not you and I but merely posterity that should answer this? [Shakhray] There is the ancient piece of wisdom, which has with time become a legal axiom: You cannot be the judge at your own trial. Both parties to the conflict are to blame, and neither of them has either the moral or the political right to condemn the other. You ask: Why are we leaving this to posterity? I shall answer the question with a question: Who would determine who was guilty? The victorious presidential party wanted to do so today. But if tomorrow there are multiple-choice elections, will those who lost the October events start to point to the guilty party? As far as public opinion is concerned, it has already rendered its verdict, and I can merely repeat it: A plague on both your houses. [Yakovlev] When I speak of the need to explain to people what happened on 3-4 October, I am not thinking merely in categories of the judicial investigation. It seems to me that the president should get up and tell people: In signing the edict of 21 September dissolving parliament I was a poor statesman insofar as I was unable to weigh the consequences this would have. Both Rutskoy and Khasbulatov should make their confessions: Lodged in the White House, we were thinking only of ourselves, of our power, forgetting about the inevitability of the casualties, which we had provoked.... [Shakhray] Were the said people capable of steps such as you have mentioned, we would not, possibly, have the present crisis.
