The committee began to debate a document of pledge and agreement between the parties to the dialogue of political forces to build a modern Yemeni state. The document was drafted by a subcommittee emanating from the political forces' dialogue committee. The draft document states the solutions reached by the dialogue committee to the current issues and problems that caused the current crisis. The draft is also a prelude to the building of a modern Yemeni state as it sets forth foundations for stability and order and ensures that such crises will not be repeated. This is meant to protect and safeguard unity, enhance Yemen's democratic process, and broaden popular participation along the road of establishing a developed Yemeni state that safeguards the rights of citizens and provides them with equal opportunities. This will allow for the achievement of balanced socioeconomic development. The committee is still in session and continues to debate the draft document.
