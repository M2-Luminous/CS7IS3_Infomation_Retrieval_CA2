FBIS4-28951 "dreas115_c_94030" FBIS-EAS-94-115 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 North Korea Radio Criticizes Remarks by Japan's Ozawa Radio Criticizes Remarks by Japan's Ozawa SK1506030094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1300 GMT 14 Jun 94 SK1506030094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1300 GMT 14 Jun 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to Japan's NHK broadcast, Ozawa, representative secretary of Japan Renewal Party, seized upon the fictitious issue of our nuclear development and made provocative remarks on a Fuji television broadcast, that the international community should deal with the issue resolutely, and that Japan should cooperate naturally if the United Nations adopts a resolution calling for sanctions. Ozawa went so far as to openly rave that the Japanese Government should take a series of steps for sanctions even before the United Nations adopts a resolution. This shows how desperately and frantically the Japanese reactionaries are committed to sanctions against us at the front of the international alliance led by the United States. The remarks by Ozawa, which is a grave infringement on our republic, an independent sovereign state, are an intolerable criminal act that drives the extremely strained military situation on the Korean peninsula onto the threshold of war. The Japanese reactionaries raved about taking the lead in taking sanctions against us at a time when the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors adopted an absurd resolution on the suspension of the agency's cooperation with our country and when the United States and its followers are persistently attempting sanctions through the United Nations. This is a very grave development in the situation and proves that Japan's hostile policy against our republic has reached an extreme.
