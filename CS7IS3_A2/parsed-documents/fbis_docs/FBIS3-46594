The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, delivered a New Year address at the joint meeting. His New Year address reads in full: Dear comrades, compatriots, brothers and sisters, Today we are ringing out 1993, a brilliant year which has been marked with a heroic struggle and great exploits, and ringing in a new year 1994, full of confidence and optimism. On the occasion of the new year, I extend warm congratulations and fervent greetings to our working class, cooperative farmers, intellectuals, officers and men of the People's Army, and all the other people who have been working hard with devotion for the socialist cause of chuche, with unfailing loyalty to the party and the revolution. My warm congratulations and compatriotic greetings also go to our brothers in the South, our fellow Koreans in Japan, and all the other Koreans abroad who have been striving for the peaceful reunification of the country. I also extend my new year greetings to the progressive people and our friends on the five continents who value justice and peace and are advancing towards a new world of independence. 1993 was a historic year which powerfully demonstrated the validity of our party's revolutionary line of independence and the might of chuche Korea. Last year the imperialists and reactionaries worked more malignantly than ever to isolate and stifle our Republic and crush our cause of socialism. As a result, the situation in our country became extremely tense. When the country and the revolution were faced with a stern trial, our party took resolute self-defensive measures by declaring the state of semi-war for the whole country, all the people and the entire Army in order to cope with the prevailing situation. It called on all the people to meet the enemy's challenge and bring about a great upsurge in socialist construction in the same revolutionary spirit and militant stamina as they had displayed during the years of the grim fatherland liberation war. The officers and men of our heroic People's Army and all the people, in hearty response to the party's militant call, stood up as one man in the struggle to defend the country's sovereignty and revolutionary achievements with an unshakable confidence in victory and in soaring spirits, foiled the enemy's challenge and aggressive scheme and honourably safeguarded the dignity and security of their socialist motherland. Thus they fully demonstrated the unbreakable spirit of chuche Korea. This means the victory of our party's revolutionary line, a great victory of the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses. Last year, while achieving one victory after another under the party's leadership in the political and military confrontation with the enemy, our people brilliantly adorned the last year of the Third Seven-Year Plan by accelerating the construction of the socialist economy with great revolutionary enthusiasm. During the Third Seven-Year Plan we made long strides in all fields of socialist economic construction in spite of the enormous difficulties and obstacles caused in economic construction by unexpected international events and the tension in our country. The production capacity of our chuche-orientated industry has been considerably expanded as a whole, the level of its technical equipment greatly raised and the structure of its branches has been improved still more, thus further increasing its independence and capabilities. In agriculture grand nature-harnessing projects to complete irrigation on a high level have been carried out victoriously, a great advance made in its mechanization and in the application of chemicals, and agricultural science and technology have developed still further in keeping with the requirements of the chuche farming method, with the result that a solid foundation of agricultural production has been laid to ensure a bumper crop every year. Numerous monumental creations such as magnificent and splendid Kwangbok and Tongil Streets, the monument to the victorious fatherland liberation war, the three-revolution exhibition and the May Day Stadium were built in Pyongyang during the Third Seven-Year Plan in accordance with our party's plan for the construction of the capital. They graphically illustrate the unfathomable creative force of our working people and the might of our independent national economy and clearly symbolize the heroic mettle of socialist Korea which is advancing triumphantly in spite of any upheavals in the world situation. Under our people-centred socialist system our people enjoy a worthy and happy life on an equal basis free from any social and political unrest and without any worries about their life even in the present complex situation, and a beautiful communist morality is flowering further throughout our society, the people sharing weal and woe and helping and leading each other forward, on the principle of one for all and all for one. Through the recent harsh trials and struggle we have convincingly proved once again that our party is a great party possessing an iron will and capable of seasoned leadership, that our people are a heroic people having unshakable revolutionary confidence and unbreakable fighting spirit, and that the socialism of our own style embodying the chuche idea is an unconquerable socialism which has struck its roots deep among the popular masses. I express my warm gratitude to our workers, farmers, intellectuals, the soldiers of the People's Army and all the rest of our people who, under the party's leadership, performed brilliant exploits last year in the revolution and construction. The new year 1994 is a year of a revolutionary advance when the building of socialism in our country will enter a new stage of development; it is a year of a worthy struggle for the entire party, the whole country and all the people to make an all-out effort and effect a great revolutionary upsurge on all fronts. The internal and external situation of our revolution is still complex and tense, and we are building socialism in a sharp confrontation with the enemy. To meet the requirements of the present situation and the development of our revolution we must carry out the revolutionary line of independence, self-sufficiency and self-reliant defence and expedite the three revolutions -- ideological, technical and cultural -- to further increase the political, economic and military power of the country. We must consolidate and exploit the successes we have already achieved in the socialist construction and must score a fresh, greater success. In this way we will add glory to the socialism of our country centred on the popular masses and fly the socialist banner of chuche higher. Setting the next three years as a period for adjustment in the sector of socialist economic construction as decided at the twenty-first plenary meeting of the Sixth Party Central Committee, we must in this period implement to the letter the agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first policy. Along with this, we must give definite precedence to the coal industry, power industry and rail transport, which must advance ahead of the other sectors of the national economy, and must continue to develop the metal industry. By carrying out the revolutionary economic strategy of our party during the period of adjustment for socialist economic construction we will consolidate the foundations of the nation's independent economy rock-solid, further improve the people's standard of living to meet the socialist requirements and secure a new launching point for scaling a higher eminence of socialism. This year we must concentrate our effort on the development of agriculture, light industry and foreign trade. This is a meaningful year which will mark the 30th anniversary of the publishing of the theses on the socialist rural question in our country. By striving to carry out the historic tasks set in the theses, we must make a new advance in the development of the rural economy. We must consolidate the successes achieved in the irrigation and electrification of the rural areas, raise the level of mechanization and application of chemicals, implement the chuche farming method thoroughly and thus boost grain and all other agricultural production. Our working class must increase the production of tractors, lorries and other modern farm machines, fertilizers, agricultural chemicals and a variety of other farming materials, and send them to the rural communities. All the cooperative farmers and agricultural working people must work in an assiduous and methodical manner with an attitude befitting masters who are responsible for the nation's granaries so as to attain without fail the high goal of grain production set by the party for this year. We must step up the revolution in light industry and effect a great upsurge in the production of consumer goods. We must adopt positive measures to improve and reinforce the light industry factories, modernize them, and increase the production of chemical fibres, synthetic resin and other materials for light industry. In this way, we will operate all the light industry factories at full capacity and maintain a high and steady rate of production. All the sectors and units ranging from those in the large-scale central light industry to those in the medium and small-scale local industry and those engaged in the production of "August 3 consumer goods" must produce various kinds of consumer goods in large quantities, increase their variety and improve their qualities radically. In order to adapt foreign trade to the changed circumstances and develop it, we must cultivate new foreign markets in every possible way and build up an unquestionable reputation. We must strengthen the bases for the production of export goods in many sectors of the national economy, increase their production and improve their qualities. All the sectors and regions must further boost export by exploring and using the resources for export and also develop processing trade. In order to develop agriculture and light industry and accelerate economic construction throughout the country, we must put efforts into the coal, electric power and metal industries and find a better solution to the problem of rail transport. The coal and electric power industries must make effective use of the existing production bases and create more production capacity in order to increase coal and power production greatly. We must strengthen the material and technical foundations of the railways, organize and direct transportation meticulously, lay heavy-duty rails extensively and satisfy the ever-increasing demands of the national economy for transport. All the economic sectors and units must launch a vigorous campaign for increased production and economy as a mass movement and make effective use of the existing labour, equipment and materials. They must tap potential reserves to the full to increase production to the maximum. All the economic officials must organize economic work and direct production efficiently in accordance with the party's economic strategy. They must give full rein to the people's revolutionary enthusiasm and creative activity and encourage them to overfulfill this year's national economic plan. Our intellectuals have an honourable duty to contribute their scientific knowledge and skills to socialist construction. Adhering to our party's policy of cultural revolution, they must strive devotedly to make new advances in science, education, literature and art, public health and all other fields of developing socialist culture. This year, too, we must naturally put efforts into strengthening the country's defence power to counter the enemy's moves to provoke war. We must be fully prepared politically and ideologically, militarily and materially, to deal with any contingency on our initiative; we must establish a social climate of regarding military affairs as important and assisting the People's Army whole-heartedly. In order to push ahead with the revolution and construction in the present situation, we must hold fast to our party's policy of the ideological revolution, further strengthen the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks and fully display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. Single-hearted unity and self-reliance are imperishable, glorious traditions of our revolution as well as the banner of victory. With the strength of single-hearted unity we have broken through harsh trials and opened up a brilliant road of victory; with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance we have overcome all difficulties and brought about great changes in the revolution and construction. When all the people are united with a single heart behind the party and the leader and fight courageously, displaying a high revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, we can defend and develop the socialism of our own style for ever in whatever trials and accomplish the socialist cause of chuche victoriously. We must defend like the apple of our eye the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks that has been cemented rock-solid under the leadership of our party and consolidate and develop it further. We must display higher the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, break through difficulties in our way and effect a fresh upsurge in the building of socialism. "Let us accelerate vigorously the general march of socialism in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude" this is the call of our party and the militant slogan which our people must uphold today. All the officials, party members and other working people must, in hearty response to the party's militant call, make continued innovations and uninterrupted advance in the spirit of Chollima spurred by the "speed of the '90s" and make the new year 1994 a year of historic advance in the revolution and construction in our country. To reunify the country is the supreme task of our nation which must not be delayed. We must accomplish the cause of national reunification as soon as possible, so as to meet the unanimous, ardent desire of the entire nation and hand down the reunified country to our posterity. With a view to paving the way to national reunification by the united effort of the nation, our party and the government of our Republic put forward "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country" last year and made all our efforts to put it into effect. This 10-point programme embodies the noble desire of our 70 million compatriots to achieve a solid unity of the whole nation transcending the difference in ideology, ideal and system and realise reunification and prosperity of our nation with a long history of five thousand years. We hoped the South Korean authorities to take the road of reconciliation and cooperation in response to our 10-point programme of great national unity, we also made an important proposal for an exchange of top-level special envoys between the two sides. But the South Korean authorities have taken the path of dependence on foreign forces, not national independence, and of confrontation between North and South, not national unity, by ignoring our magnanimous proposal and the desire of the entire nation for reunification. They have staged large-scale military exercises against our Republic frequently in collusion with foreign forces and have been jeopardizing North-South relations by clamouring for "military counteraction" and an "international cooperation system" on the pretext of our "nuclear problem." The so-called "civilian" regime in South Korea is only a disguise; in fact it does not differ from the successive military dictatorial regimes. The evil anti-communist fascist laws still remain intact in South Korea, and the desire of the South Korean people for independence, democracy and national reunification is not fulfilled. It is natural that the South Korean people and public figures say that there is no need to watch the present South Korean regime any longer and that they have nothing to expect from it. As for our "nuclear problem" about which the United States and her lackeys are making a fuss, it is the product of the obstinate maneuvers of the United States against socialism and our Republic. It is the United States that has created the fictitious "doubt about nuclear development by the North", and it is the United States that has actually shipped nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula and have been threatening us. Therefore, the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula must on any account be settled through Korea-U.S. talks. Pressure or threat will have no effect on us; such an attempt may invite catastrophe, far from finding a solution to the problem. The United States must see all the fact squarely and behave with prudence. Since a joint statement has been adopted by Korea and the United States, the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula can be settled fairly if both sides keep and implement the principles that have been agreed upon. The principles and the line of our party and the government of our Republic on national reunification remain unchanged. In future, too, we will make every effort to reunify the country in the form of confederation which is based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments, on the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity. The destiny of the motherland is immediately the destiny of the nation, as well as the destiny of all our compatriots at home and abroad. All the Korean people in the North, in the South and abroad must launch a nationwide struggle, rallied as one under the banner of great unity of the whole nation, and open a new phase for national reunification this year. The imperialists are now blustering on the international arena by vociferating about the "end" of socialism, but they cannot arrest the people's aspiration to independence, sovereignty and socialism nor can they turn back the trend of history. If the world progressive people push forward historical progress by strengthening unity and solidarity under the banner of independence against imperialism, they will be able to shape a bright future of mankind at an earliest date without fail. Our party and the government of our Republic will consistently implement the foreign policy of independence, peace and friendship in keeping with the requirements of the present situation. On the principle of independence we will make positive efforts to unite with socialist countries and non-aligned countries and develop good neighbourly relations also with capitalist countries which respect the sovereignty of our country. The government of our Republic will work hard to abolish the old international political and economic orders of domination and subordination, establish new ones on the basis of equality, justice and fairness and develop South-South cooperation on the principle of collective self-reliance. Our people's struggle today is arduous, but it is a noble and honourable struggle for the prosperity of our country and for the future of mankind. Our people who are fighting for the just cause under the leadership of the great party will always emerge victorious. Let all of us fight on vigorously to achieve a new success in socialist construction and hasten the independent and peaceful reunification of the country, united rock-solid behind the party Central Committee under the unfurled banner of the chuche idea.
