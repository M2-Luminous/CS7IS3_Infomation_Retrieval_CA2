Kozyrev on 3 November at the Foreign Policy Council under the MFA of the Russian Federation] [Text] I will make a couple of introductory comments and share our concerns and what we would like to consult with you about; naturally, this will not be an exhaustive presentation--I will only outline a list of topics. Unlike many of the USSR's allies in the "Third World," East Europe remains, and, I think, will remain our priority. They are unlikely to provide material or political support for our, as we call it, "red-and-brown" opposition. Our ties with East Europe and the incident with ratification--or, to be precise, failure to ratify--a treaty with Hungary is very indicative in this respect. In essence, not only East Europe but also the administration of the Russian Federation president and the government of Russia found themselves in a position of hostage in a political score-settling. After a number of attempts, the treaty with Hungary was never ratified only because the preamble formalizes the universally known and long-obvious fact that the interference in Hungarian affairs in 1956 was impermissible, albeit in a form that does not impose any legal or other obligations on Russia. I think this was a manifestation of the still-lingering syndrome that has its roots in the old ideological approaches when one not only could not write but even was not supposed to know the truth about the events in East European countries. We should have drawn certain conclusions from this "ostrich" position. I remember a situation in this very Collegium Conference Hall--at the time of the USSR MFA--when the meeting chairman said, flabbergasted and, I would say, indignant, that our embassies did not maintain contacts with precisely such forces, such persons, although they were known to the entire world--for instance, Lech Walesa or Vaclav Havel--apparently counting up to the very last moment on a sort of emulation of "perestroyka" occurring instead of an all-out anticommunist revolution taking place in these countries. Meanwhile, the problems encountered by young leaders and new elites in the East European countries were in essence our problems, too. These include reform of the bureaucratic apparatus--whether economic, of the Gosplan [State Planning Committee] type, enforcement structures, or the foreign policy agencies. I say this with a degree of criticism at ourselves. The difficulties of privatization and commercialization. And finally, aggressive nationalism, a mix of envy and arrogance in relation to the outside world stemming from the inferiority complex that society feels to a certain extent. As a result, Russian diplomacy in East Europe had to start in many respects not just from ground zero but from a negative point, and all this in an environment of disruption of economic ties. Today we can say that we have completed the first stage--the stage of establishing new relations between the new Russia and the revitalized states of East Europe, keeping in mind, of course, all the difficulties. The highlight of this stage was clearing the debris of the socialist camp era and creating in general a new foundation of political--and on this basis, mutually beneficial economic--ties. This encompasses first and foremost the political-legal base. Although, of course, the real mechanisms still leave a lot to be desired, but this apparently will constitute the core of the next stage, that is, realization of all the political opportunities that have opened as a result of the first stage. High-level visits by the president of Russia to practically all the East European countries and his meetings with the leaders of these states have resulted in the signing of a new generation of treaties and agreements. Troop withdrawal from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary has been accomplished in a civilized way. The pages related to the interventions of 1956 and 1968 have been turned for good. The final chapter has been written in the Katyn affair; a number of other "blank"--or, to be precise, "black"--pages in history have been brought to light. It is important both for us and for East Europeans to first look into the future; second, to orientate ourselves at those things that bring us closer: the communality of democratic and free market aspirations, the desire to live in a stable Europe, and the need for mutually beneficial economic ties. It is in the interests of Russia to have East Europe as a bridge rather than barrier to West Europe--without dismissing, of course, the inherent value of ties with East and Central European countries per se. Both we and these countries have actually set for ourselves the same strategic task: to take our proper place in the "club" of developed democratic states. The question is how to deal with this task through cooperation rather than elbowing one another aside. It is clear that we cannot forbid anyone to join NATO. The time of "Brezhnev doctrine" diktat has been consigned to oblivion together with the Soviet system in our country. I think our friends in East and Central Europe should move from fostering suspicions regarding some sort of new designs on the part of Russia toward a joint search together with us for answers to complex issues of modern times. Yes, we do not like expansion of NATO without Russian participation, even if it is not aimed against us. In this we are achieving understanding. Evidence of that is the American concept "Partnership for Peace," supported by many NATO countries. We can count on new relations with the West withstanding the trial by Central and East Europe in the sense of their membership of NATO. This will be further proof of political shortsightedness on the part of those who try to juxtapose partnership with the West and that with the East. One is hardly realistic without the other. I will be even more blunt: Without timely and persistent orientation toward alliance with the West, it is unlikely that Russia would have been able to avert the expansion of old and formation of new exclusive political blocs not only along the perimeter of CIS countries but possibly also closer to the external borders of the Russian Federation. Only a partnership with the West, the special relations established with leading NATO countries, make it possible to withstand the "trial by East and Central Europe"--I use this term again today, with all possible reservations, in the sense of joining the North Atlantic bloc. This is the real worth of the clamorous accusations of Westernism coming from the position of so-called patriotism. It is also clear, however, that we can only keep up with East Europeans if we ourselves move decisively along the road of domestic reforms and open foreign policy. We must, in particular, engage more actively in giving content to such ideas as "Partnership for Peace" or the "Balladur Plan," including from the angle of our relations with East Europe. We welcome fresh ideas and initiatives that would help us all together to reinforce the trust between Russia and the countries of Central and East Europe, including through joint actions, especially in peacekeeping. The relations between East European countries by themselves combine both the elements of competition and rivalry and the desire for integration. To a certain extent we will be able to use such subregional cooperation structures as the "Vicegrad Four" and the "Central European Initiative" in order to solve problems of interest both to us and to the countries of East and Central Europe. Which are: combating aggressive nationalism, protection of the rights of national minorities while preserving the integrity of the state, and so on. Our diplomatic efforts in the East European direction will be academic unless they are reinforced by the development of economic cooperation. So far we clearly have not utilized to a full extent the favorable conditions we have created at the political level, especially considering that East European countries also have an objective interest in restoring economic ties. I must say that now that the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations has a new leadership it will be possible to deal with these tasks with much greater success than was the case with their predecessors. In this area we are working in several directions. First, it is time to implement already existing bilateral agreements; second, we need to search for new forms of cooperation on the level of entrepreneurial structures. The question is how to give a boost to the restoration of civilized ties which in the end will displace the barbaric, mafiosi forms on one hand, and on the other, will not lead to a situation whereby in order to implement the agreements signed by the governments we would have to resort to old administrative methods. Third, the possibility of trilateral cooperation is of interest: West Europe--East Europe--Russia, with the participation, of course, of other CIS countries. All this, however, on condition that this will be a partnership of equals rather than attempts to solve one's problems, for instance, at the expense of Russia by receiving financial infusions from the West and dumping on Russia goods that are not quite competitive otherwise. An important special feature of the Soviet Union's relations with countries of East and Central Europe, with all their ideological shackles, was that contacts between people, particularly between scientific organizations and cultural institutions, were quite extensive. Today much of this is in jeopardy. We have to try not to lose, try to preserve cultural and spiritual ties. The scientific and cultural intelligentsia could play an important role in this. We will support inter-church ties in every way possible. This is the spiritual background of contacts with a number of countries of East and Central Europe. We need to encourage and find new forms of cooperation at the Russian regional level, including through such structures--created with MFA participation--as the Organization for Cooperation of Baltic and Black Sea Basin Countries. In all these matters we count on the active participation of the new democratic parliament. I must say that we are longing for a parliament that will legislatively regulate our activities, direct them with the help of laws, and oversee both us and other state agencies, including those working with East and Central Europe. There are many other problems--especially in the CIS zone--where the legislative base and parliament's oversight functions are especially needed, even though foreign policy and activities have been and will remain the president's prerogative. By the way, none of the countries of East and Central Europe--and the scale of their problems fades in comparison with ours--attempted to experiment with an annual vote of confidence in a popularly elected president or early elections of the president. The experience of a two-year parliamentary term in one of the countries also proved less than satisfactory. In our country, in my opinion, instead of painstaking work, such experiments bear the mark of irresponsibility and a Bolshevik penchant for extremism. I would like to call on all of you to use all the tools at our disposal. We have a democratically elected president; we will have a democratically elected parliament. Let us use these institutions as a base and work normally for four or five years, including in the area of East and Central Europe. Otherwise everybody will indeed abandon us and turn to NATO. The significance of East and Central Europe for Russia is so great that the development of relations with East European countries should be not so much the business of the diplomatic community as of our entire state organism and society as a whole. I hope that today's discussion will offer both criticism and analysis, and most importantly, will be fruitful and enrich us with new ideas.
