Initially, more than 100,000 tonnes of oil were extracted from Sector B-3 in a so-called test production operation. Full-scale industrial production is beginning now. How much oil is there in the area designated Sector B-3? [Kurek] The size of our oil deposits is an official secret. One of the reasons for this is that these resources constitute a part of our strategic reserve. All I can tell you is that, during the first stage of operations, we will extract 500 tonnes of crude oil per day from four wells. Once the field is fully operational, we should be able to obtain 1,500-1,700 tonnes of oil per day. [Jasny] Petroleum extraction is one of the more profitable economic undertakings, but it must be remembered that you have had to bear very considerable costs associated with developing the site for industrial extraction. Has this money been recouped yet? [Kurek] The money we made from the sale of the oil obtained in the test production stage is not the only sum we have earned so far. Our vessels also earned money by offering contract services to North Sea oil-extraction enterprises, and the profits from these operations were used to partly finance our own current expenses. However, it is true that, recently, the major proportion of our financial resources has come from the sale of our own oil. We not only recouped the equivalent of the outlays made to date but we were also able to ensure that the company is largely independent financially, using little outside assistance, and that we discharge all of our obligations in respect of the state budget. [Jasny] I understand from this that you ended the last financial year with a profit. Is that correct? [Kurek] It is. [Jasny] As far as I know, extraction from the oil field you are working at the moment is planned to continue for approximately a dozen years. What will Petrobaltic do when that is finished? [Kurek] Our company's very name indicates two different types of operations. The first is prospecting for crude oil and other raw materials, identifying deposits, and estimating the amount of raw materials found there. The second is extracting these raw materials. Apart from developing the B-3 sector for extraction, we have been carrying out parallel operations in prospecting for and identifying further deposits of hydrocarbon materials. We already know that there is a rather small oil deposit north of Rozewie that could be economically viable for extraction. To recap: Apart from our extraction operations, we also carry out a program of identification and documentation of further crude oil deposits, which we may develop for extraction at some future point. [Jasny] Your company intends not only to operate in the Baltic area but also to extend its offer to the Asian seas. Could you tell us a bit more about this project today? [Kurek] A petroleum extraction company should not be run as a provincial firm. It must be expansive and aim to actively extend its field of operation. We are currently in the course of negotiating cooperation in our particular business field with the Baltic states. Everything indicates that we will be able to work together with other oil companies in developing new extraction sites belonging to these countries. Perhaps we will also--together with other countries--search for and extract oil deposits in the Asian seas. That would be an excellent start in turning our company into an international business. Naturally, I cannot release any details concerning the aforementioned negotiations because these are always confidential. [Jasny] Is your company sufficiently prepared to enter the international scene? [Kurek] We must meet three essential preconditions if we want to be taken seriously in the international oil market. We must employ credible professionals, we must have considerable previous experience, and, finally, we must have sufficient financial backing. Any bank will lend money to a healthy and prosperous oil-extraction company. We do indeed meet all of these conditions. [Jasny] Nevertheless, your plans of expanding your business operations to include other seas around the world are still at the project stage, although I hope they will come true. But to come back to the concerns of the present day, we should also remember that all extraction operations carry with them an ecological risk of damage to the environment. Have you made sufficient precautions against--God forbid--some unwelcome developments in that area? [Kurek] From the very first stage of our operations--that is, the gathering of information on potential deposits and the designing of the proposed prospecting work--we pursue an integrated environmental protection program. Our equipment comprises machines and technical appliances that permit the extraction of crude oil without damaging the natural environment. We meet all of the requirements imposed on our particular kind of operation by the Helsinki Convention. We have at our disposal a range of state-of-the-art oil extraction technologies. There are no better solutions anywhere in the world. The system we use in Sector B-3 is fitted with multiple safeguards, and there is practically no possibility that the waters of the Baltic could become contaminated as a result of our operations. [Jasny] Thank you for talking with us.
