"We strongly condemn such a barbarous and atrocious act against innocent civilians," Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Kishichiro Amae said. Referring to the attack on an open-air Muslim marketplace that killed 68 civilians and injured some 200, Amae said Japan "considers that the offenders should be identified as soon as possible and duly punished." But the spokesman did not go so far as to express support for air strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Bosnian Serb artillery and mortar sites in the hills around Sarajevo. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali asked the NATO allies Sunday to authorize the use of air power in response to the shelling of Sarajevo. NATO is expected to decide whether to take such action in a meeting on Wednesday in Brussels, which will be attended by the ambassadors to NATO from its 16 member countries.
