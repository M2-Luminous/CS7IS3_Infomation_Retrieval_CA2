FR940919-2-00018 FR940919-2-00017 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;396&hyph;000] Alabama-Tennessee Natural Gas Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff September 13, 1994. Take notice that on September 6, 1994, Alabama-Tennessee Natural Gas Company (Alabama-Tennessee), tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, the following revised tariff sheet: Second Revised Sheet No. 4A Alabama-Tennessee proposes that this tariff sheet be made effective October 1, 1994. In this regard, Alabama-Tennessee requests that the Commission grant a waiver of Section 154.22 of its Regulations so that this tariff sheet might be made effective on less than thirty days notice. Alabama-Tennessee states that the purpose of this filing is to adjust the take-or-pay charges applicable to each of its jurisdictional sales and transportation customers pursuant to the reconciliation procedures established under Article I, Section A.3 of the settlement approved by the Commission on October 17, 1991. Alabama-Tennessee states that this reconciliation has resulted in an increase in the Direct Billed Obligation and a reduction in the Volumetric Surcharge (as those terms are defined under the settlement) that Alabama-Tennessee is authorized to collect from its jurisdictional sales and transportation customers. In addition to the waiver of Section 154.22, Alabama-Tennessee requests such other waivers of the Commission's Regulations as will be necessary to permit the tariff sheet to become effective as proposed in its filing. Alabama-Tennessee states that copies of its filing were served upon its customers and interested public bodies, and all persons on the Commission's official service list in the captioned docket. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before September 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
