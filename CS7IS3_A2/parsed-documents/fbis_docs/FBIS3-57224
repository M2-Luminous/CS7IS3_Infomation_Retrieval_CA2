The plan for their organizational development, which consists of three stages, is starting to be implemented. The plan has been designed through the end of 1995. The independent state's Army will finally acquire its own budget. The minister confirmed that by that time the Ukrainian Armed Forces will have a strength of 450,000 men. The Main Staff is being transformed into the General Staff, although the general complained of a certain shortage of cadres, particularly in the operational-strategic component. He reported that foreign experience, including Russia's, had been taken into account in the process of forming the General Staff. Vitaliy Radetskyy described as correct the decision on the nuclear weapons located on Ukrainian territory. He emphasized, however, that Ukraine is a space rocket power, since it is capable of manufacturing its own rocket to put a satellite into orbit. The minister said that Ukraine must create modern deterrent forces equipped with highly accurate weapons. Vitaliy Radetskyy drew his audience's attention to the problem of reducing conventional arms in accordance with the 1990 all-European treaty. He believes that these quotas are rather too low now, after the breakup of the USSR. Not only for Ukraine but also for Russia, particularly on the southern flank of its defense. The minister proposed two ways out of the impasse: a revision of the accords or the creation of new types of arms. In artillery, for example, if the reductions affect guns with a caliber of 100 mm and above, then guns with a caliber of 99 mm should be put into production. The minister described the problem of the Black Sea Fleet as very complex. He declared: "It is closely connected with the situation in Crimea. I, a Ukrainian citizen, believe that there can only be one president in our state. I believe that it will be harder to find the solution here than in the case of nuclear weapons." Vitaliy Radetskyy ruled out the possibility of an armed conflict in Crimea and also the possibility of Russia's strong-arm intervention. He also emphasized the nonbloc nature of Ukraine's military policy, stressing that it has no intention of being a younger or middle brother but intends to build equitable relations. He cited as an example Uzbekistan, which is prepared to supply cotton uniforms in exchange for Ukraine's repairing its military hardware. Turkmenistan is prepared to pay with oil and gas in exchange for the training of military cadres.
