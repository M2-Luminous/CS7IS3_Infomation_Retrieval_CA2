He said that the incident cannot be covered up. Addressing his party's assembly group meeting, Erbakan remarked that the F-15 planes that downed the helicopters are equipped with instruments that determine the identity of the target, but it is clear that these were not used. Pointing out that Turkey also has the same helicopters, Erbakan claimed that the uncontrolled shooting enhances the possibility that the helicopters were believed to be Turkish. Erbakan said that the suspects in the Saratoga incident were not tried by Turkish courts and charged that the presence of a Turkish officer in the panel of judges was merely for show. [Begin Erbakan recording] We are experiencing the same thing in this second Saratoga incident. What is the problem? Let us summon the pilots of Poised Hammer, which is located in Turkey. Let us bring them here and question them in court on how they shot, what they shot. This is a requisite of an independent country. Moreover, it is the requisite of law an human decency. [end recording] Erbakan claimed that Turkey is unable to play an active role in the face of the annihilation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Serbian hands. He declared that it must be known that no concessions can be made on the subjects of Bosnia or Cyprus.
