FR941206-2-00038 FR941206-2-00027 3. Evaluation criteria will address cost, environmental impact, dependability, dispatchability, risk, diversity, and the ability to verify demand-side alternatives. Evaluation criteria will be reviewed as the need for resources changes or when long-term commitments to purchase power expire. 4. Evaluation criteria will be consistent with Western's power marketing policy, which states that Federal power is to be marketed in such a manner as to encourage the most widespread use thereof at the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles. The policy, found in Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108 (58 FR 59716, November 10, 1993), is derived from section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 16 U.S.C. 825s. 5. Resource acquisition planning will be consistent with power marketing plans and associated contractual obligations. 6. Resource acquisition decisions will be documented and made available to Western's power customers and the public. II. Transmission Planning Principles: Western's transmission planning is conducted to assess the capability of the Federal transmission system to provide adequate and reliable electric service to its customers and the interconnected power grid. The principles of IRP that will apply to Western's transmission planning are as follows: 1. Western will conduct early and wide public involvement to confirm the purpose and need of a proposed transmission project. Western proposes that a public meeting be held early in the planning process once the need for system modifications has been identified and prior to start of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. 2. At the public meeting, Western will describe the need to be met and seek comments on alternative ways to address the need, including demand-side management, new construction, or upgrade of existing facilities. 3. Western will notify interested parties, including power customers, residents of the area, environmental groups, various resource suppliers including renewable generation entities, and other transmission utilities in the area, as well as other participants in the project if it is a joint project. 4. Alternatives that are feasible will be evaluated for cost, general environmental impacts, and system reliability concerns in coordination with interested parties. 5. The results of this evaluation will be made available to Western's power customers and the public. Transmission facilities needed for reliability will be based on mitigating problems related to power system operations or replacing unsafe, aged, worn out, or inefficient equipment. Western is committed to join the Western Regional Transmission Association and has joined the Southwest Regional Transmission Association (SWRTA). Both groups will promote coordinated planning and efficient use of transmission capacity and will provide another means for involvement by Western's customers. As appropriate, Western can invite other interested parties to attend SWRTA meetings as guests of Western. It is anticipated that some form of regional transmission group will be established in the Mid-continent Area Power Pool. This will also facilitate public involvement in considering Western's future transmission needs. Public Process The public process to determine the principles of integrated resource planning that Western will incorporate into its resource acquisition and transmission planning processes begins with publication of this notice. Comments on these proposed principles are being sought during a 90-day comment period. Following this comment period, the principles to be adopted will be published in the Federal Register . This public process ends with publication of final principles in the Federal Register . Final principles will be effective 30 days after publication. Environmental Evaluation Western is seeking comment on the IRP principles outlined in this notice through a public process. Methods, procedures, and criteria for implementing these principles have yet to be developed and will be project-specific. Western is committed to initiating an appropriate public process under NEPA and its implementing regulations for these project-specific actions at the earliest possible time. The potential environmental effects of the methods, procedures, and criteria will be evaluated in addition to analyzing the effects of the acquisition of resources in these subsequent processes. Determination Under Executive Order 12866 DOE has determined this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866; accordingly, no clearance of this notice by the Office of Management and Budget is required. Issued at Golden, Colorado, November 10, 1994. J.M. Shafer, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29706 Filed 12&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
