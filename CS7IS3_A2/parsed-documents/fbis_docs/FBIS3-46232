Governor Tian Chengping chaired the meeting and provincial party Secretary Yin Kesheng made a speech entitled "Improving Our Understanding, Unifying Our Thinking, and Further Strengthening Work in the Rural and Pastoral Areas." Provincial party and government leading comrades including Doba, Wang Hanmin, Ma Yuanbiao, and Liu Guanghe were present at the meeting. In his speech, Comrade Yen Kesheng first analyzed the situation in pastoral areas. He said: Since the introduction of reform and opening up, a profound change has taken place in Qinghai's pastoral areas, which have made historic achievements. Particularly in recent years the provincial party and government have introduced many policies and measures to strengthen agricultural and animal husbandry work. At a time when financial resources were quite tight, the provincial party and government increased investment in agriculture and animal husbandry, and paid attention to comprehensive agricultural development and structural adjustment. As a result, pastoral areas could maintain a good trend of stable economic development for many years. But we should soberly understand that animal husbandry production is still at a low development level, that the foundation of animal husbandry is weak, that its production structure is simple, that the comparative returns in grain production have reduced, and that the increase in the peasants' income is slow. If these problems are not seriously resolved, they will affect the development of agriculture and animal husbandry and the province's national economic development and will also be a drag on modernization. Therefore, we should under all circumstances put agriculture at the forefront of economic work and this should become the basic guiding principle in Qinghai's economic work. Comrade Yin Keshing pointed out: The 1990's are a crucial period for the province's reform and economic construction. Rural and pastoral areas throughout the province should further improve their operational mechanism so that their markets will be full of vitality. In line with the instructions of the party Central Committee and the State Council, the provincial party committee has decided to extend the period of contracted farmlands for another 30 years and that the period of contracted pastoral areas will remain unchanged for 50 years. [passage omitted] Comrade Yin Keshing continued: The central issue of the province's rural and pastoral areas is to increase the peasants' and herdsmen's incomes. Increasing their per capita net income will promote all aspects of work in the rural and pastoral areas. We should help the masses' increase their incomes and move toward moderate prosperity, and take this as the general objective. To achieve this end, the following two points should be given attention. The first is further adjusting and optimizing the production structure, developing township and town enterprises, and cultivating a high-yield, high-quality, and highly efficient agriculture by means of science and technology. The second is increasing investments, strengthening basic facilities construction for agriculture and animal husbandry, and improving production conditions. [passage omitted]
