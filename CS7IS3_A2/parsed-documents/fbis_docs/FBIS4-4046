Li Zemin, provincial party committee secretary, attended and spoke at the meeting. He emphatically pointed out: Comrades of party committees and government departments at various levels and the media and ideological front must understand the extremely important nature of media and ideological work in carrying out the strategy of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and implementing the party's basic line in an all-round way. Under the new situation of building a socialist market economic structure, we must take a clear-cut stand on the task, content, and battle front of media and ideological work, on what should be publicized and advocated and what should not be allowed, and on what should be resisted and opposed and what should be encouraged. We must pay special attention to guiding theoretical study, public opinion, social customs, and the creation of nourishment of the mind. We should effectively strengthen and improve ideological and political work at the grass-roots level. The meeting was presided over by Lu Zhangong, provincial party committee deputy secretary . Liu Xirong, Li Jinming, and Liang Pingbo, Standing Committee members of the provincial party committee, attended the meeting. Li Zemin fully affirmed the work and achievements made by workers on the media and ideological front in the province. He said: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, reform, opening up, and economic and social development in this province have developed, the people have emancipated and changed their minds through explorations and creations, the broad masses of media and ideological workers have worked hard and played a great role in improving and strengthening media and ideological work with great vitality. The media and ideological work have vigorously promoted the people's ideological emancipation and change of concept, created a favorable public opinion for speeding up reform and opening up, and promoted economic development. The media and ideological work have united the party and the people's hearts; have protected social stability; have promoted healthy social customs; and have provided a powerful spiritual motive force and ideological guarantee as well as powerful intellectual support and favorable public opinion in the society and a good environment for carrying out reform and opening up. Li Zemin said: At present, there is an unprecedented good trend in reform, opening up, and economic construction in Zhejiang like other places of the country. However, in the course of making progress, we have also met with some new situations and contradictions. To maintain this good trend in carrying out reform and development and to overcome difficulties and contradictions on our advancing road, we must implement the policy put forward by the party Central Committee for "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability," and correctly handle the relations between reform, development, and stability. Media and ideological work should be carried out in light of the overall situation. Li Zemin called on media and ideological workers to proceed with their work by keeping their minds on the overall situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to consider the following points as their guiding principles: 1) Taking economic construction as the central task; 2) persisting in being responsible to the people as well as the party; 3) adhering to and vigorously advocating the main theme while allowing diversification; and 4) keeping to democratic principle and the policy of explaining things to the masses. Li Zemin also put forward four correct ways and one basic task for implementing the guidelines of the national work on media and ideological work, further implementing the "Zhejiang provincial program for building socialist spiritual civilization," and doing a good job in media and ideological work in Zhejiang in the future. Earnestly organize the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and conscientiously provide a correct theoretical guidance. Party committees at all levels should take theoretical study seriously, make the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping the central element, and combine it with the study of the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and policies, laws, and regulations related to socialist market economy. We must link the study of theory with practice and our efforts to implement this year's general task and to study, investigate, and grasp new situations and resolve new problems. We must continue to make use of the party committee's core study group system to improve the quality and results of the study. We must earnestly carry out the theoretical education and training of party members and cadres. Comrades in the propaganda and ideological departments should take the lead in studying theory deeper and better. They should do a good job in theoretical study and propaganda. Under the current circumstances, every front must serve and subordinate itself to the party's general task. Particularly, it should earnestly study and comprehensively understand Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important thinking on reform, development, and stability and use it to guide work in every field. -- Create a favorable public opinion for deepening reform, promoting development, and maintaining stability, and earnestly guide public opinion. Party committees, propaganda departments, news media, and publishing units must guide public opinion well with a strong sense of responsibility and work hard to create a public opinion conducive to reform, opening up, and economic development; to the building of socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and a legal system; and to promoting national unity, easing people's minds, and promoting social and political stability. Foremost, we must clearly recognize the situation; understand the overall task; grasp well relations between reform, development, and stability and between the partial and general interests; and do our best to truthfully reflect problems. Second, we must keep ourselves in touch with reform, opening up, and economic construction and with the masses and real life. Third, we must use a variety of propaganda forms and typical examples to guide the masses, avoid the tone of teaching, and carry out our work in a way loved by the masses. Fourth, we must help supervise public opinion, avoid confusing it, focus on resolving practical issues, and settle and resolve conflicts. Fifth, we must strictly observe propaganda discipline and differentiate between internal and external consumption [nei wai you bie 0355 1120 2589 0446]. In light of this year's situation and task, we must emphasize the following in guiding public opinion: First, we must change the ideology guiding economic work. We must shift from the previous practice of doing things blindly on a large scale and of expanding our businesses and managing them loosely to one of optimizing structures, improving qualities, raising efficiency, and developing externally. Second, we must stabilize and strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the economy. The entire party and society must attach importance to agriculture and protect and support its development. We must maintain stability in the total output of grain and balance between regions. We must gradually establish a macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism to strengthen, protect, and support agriculture. We must work hard to overcome the relative low economic returns from growing grain and guide the peasants onto the path of intensive management in agriculture to benefit from the economies of scale. Third, we must vigorously promote reform in five major areas. We must guide the masses to correctly understand reform and ardently support and actively take part in it. We must guide enterprises to adapt themselves to changing external environments; to explore and experiment boldly; to become independent socialist commodity producers and dealers, responsible for their own profits or losses and for their own decisions about whether to expand or not; and to enter the market. Fourth, we must attach importance to strengthening correct guidance on flash-point social issues, do more work to promote stability, and truthfully report what we have done and accomplished to win the masses' understanding and support. Actively advocate good social ethics and earnestly guide it to achieve the goal of bringing up a new generation of socialist people with ideals, morality, knowledge, and discipline. To achieve the goal of bringing up such a new generation, we must make patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and Comrade Jiang Zemin's 64-character pioneering spirit the central elements of education and set different demands on different people at different levels. We must pay close attention to guiding people, especially juveniles, to cultivate correct idealism, faith, and outlook on world, life, and value; to oppose money worshiping, pleasure-seeking, and ultra-individualism; and to resist the corrosive effects of decadent capitalist and feudalist ideas. Society, school, and family must closely coordinate with each other, earnestly summarize their experience, promptly popularize effective educational forms and methods to earnestly carry out this work. We must promote traditional Chinese ethics such as making selfless dedication, acting heroically to promote justice, supporting the poor and people in need, and taking pleasure in helping others. We must promote truth, goodness, and beauty and denounce falseness, ugliness, and evil. We must concentrate our efforts on changing prevailing habits and customs in the countryside and advocate healthy and rewarding lifestyle. We must adopt multiple measures to curb the spread of such evil practices as holding wedding ceremonies and funerals in a big way, engaging in feudal superstition, and gambling. We must guarantee religious freedom, advocate atheism, strengthen the management of religions, and actively guide religions to adapt themselves to socialism. We must extensively launch cultural activities among the masses and promote the development of cultural activities in communities. We must make cultural activities in enterprises our focus and advance cultural activities in villages and towns, campuses, and homes to mold people's temperament. We must integrate cultural development in communities with education in professional and social ethics and with the building of civilized units. We must bring about the improvement of our social ethics through measures implemented in various regions and trades and professions. -- Work hard to create more and better spiritual products to satisfy people's cultural needs, and earnestly guide their creation. We must uphold the policy of grasping two links at the same time, attaching equal importance to both. We must promote the creation of outstanding and healthy spiritual products to bring prosperity to our cultural market and at the same time, pay attention to managing and cleaning up our cultural market to improve people's tastes in appreciating beauty and mold their spirits. We must work hard to create high-taste spiritual products to bring prosperity to the cultural market. We must encourage cultural workers to immerse themselves among the masses and penetrate deep into life to actively create spiritual products that are healthy in content, particularly products that eulogize reform, opening up, and modernization and are artistically appealing. Each year we must produce a large number of outstanding motion pictures, television programs, dramas, operas, music, dance, fine arts, and literary works that are loved by the masses. We must continue to carry out the project of creating spiritual products that are outstanding in five areas, and we must earnestly organize cultural activities on major holidays. We must carry out the work of eliminating pornography by strengthening the management of the cultural market, focusing on the management of the publication of books, newspapers, magazines, motion pictures, television programs, and audio and video tapes, as well as performances and entertainment. We must regulate the cultural market by controlling both production and circulation. -- Strengthening and improving grass-roots ideological and political work. This year particular emphasis must be laid on bringing into full play political advantages to correctly handle contradictions among the people and effectively strengthen grass-roots ideological and political work. To ensure a good job in the work of this aspect, it is necessary to, first of all, clarify the principle for pooling efforts and achieving a common understanding; second, to adhere to an effective method of guidance for clearing contradictions, neither sidestepping nor aggravating them; third, to emphasize, understand, and reflect the truth so as to obtain a real good grasp of situations; fourth, to stress the need to establish a responsibility system at each level for solving contradictions at the grass roots in the embryonic stage without reporting them to higher authorities; and fifth, to urge leading cadres to improve their style of work, to forge close ties with the masses, and to conduct ideological work in light of solving practical problems for ordinary people. This year, ideological and political work in rural areas should be focused on stabilizing the role of agriculture as the foundation of national economy; on striving to win a bumper grain harvest; on continuing to develop agriculture toward a pattern of high yields, high quality, and high efficiency; and on increasing incomes of peasants; so as to harness their enthusiasm, protect their interests, and maintain stability in rural areas. In enterprises, ideological and political work should be carried out with a clear objective in mind along with the progress in establishing a modern enterprise system and on the basis of different ownership structures, organizational forms, and operation conditions. A special effort must be made to conduct ideological and political work in enterprises experiencing hardships to guide their workers and staff to heighten the spirits and overcome difficulty while doing everything possible to help them tide over difficulty, thereby safeguarding stability of enterprises. In schools, it is necessary to pay close attention to carrying out ideological and political work among teachers and students, and to ensure the stability of schools of higher learning, in particular. Li Zemin emphasized: Propaganda departments and, even more, party committees at various levels are duty-bound to strengthen propaganda and ideological work. Under the current situation of establishing a socialist market economic structure, party committees at all levels should bear in mind the ideology of "grasping two links at the same time." We should focus attention on reform, development, and stability, and attach as much importance to propaganda and ideological work as to economic work. We should put propaganda and ideological work on the top of the agenda, conducting the work several times a year to analyze the situation, to keep abreast of social trends and ideological traits of the masses, to publicize their work plans and focal points, and to outline tasks and measures. In conducting propaganda and ideological work, the provincial, city, prefectural, and county party committees should discuss and deal with major issues related primarily to direction, including the direction of theory, of public opinions, of social trends, and of intellectual products; and should ensure that propaganda and ideological work develop along the correct direction. We should pay close attention to the overall quality, and show concern and support for the input into propaganda and cultural undertakings and the construction of their facilities. We should attach importance to the pattern and adopt policies to foster a rational pattern and to encourage intellectual products to reflect the spirit of our times. We should stress coordination and pool the efforts of the press, publications, radio, television, and other cultural departments. We should concern themselves with reform, improve the party and government's leadership system and method of propaganda and ideological work, support the reform of propaganda and cultural undertakings, and invigorate propaganda and ideological work. We should pay close attention to personnel and continually enhance their ideological and political awareness and professional competence by supporting them politically, ideologically, and in their work and everyday life. By doing so, we can bring into full play the talent and wisdom of ideological and political workers and enable younger ones to grow to maturity quicker. In the afternoon, Liang Pingbo, Standing Committee member and director of the Propaganda Department of the provincial party committee, relayed the guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work conference. The meeting was attended by deputy secretaries of all city (prefectural) and county party committees in charge of ideological work and their propaganda department directors; leaders of lecture groups, foreign publicity office directors, and editors-in-chief of party newspapers of all city (prefectural) party committees; party committee officials of enterprises and schools of higher learning affiliated with the provincial government; officials of work committees for organs under the provincial party committee and the provincial government, for schools of higher learning, and for enterprises; and responsible persons of the propaganda departments of the Provincial Trade Union Council, the Provincial Communist Youth League Committee, and the Provincial Women's Federation.
