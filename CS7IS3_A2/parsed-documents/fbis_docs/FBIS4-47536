The specimens were used to directly estimate the extent to which DNA is shielded by proteins contained in the chromatin from binding to the DNA- specific fluorescent stains used in flow cytometry. It was extremely important that the spheres be permeable by protein molecules, as this would make the method much more versatile. It was shown that the method described makes it possible to fractionate the cells and preserve their residual components in the form of individual particles of cellular dimension. By incorporating them into the gel microspheres, the macromolecular complexes are protected from physical damage during the course of routine laboratory testing with enzymes, antibodies, and flow cytometry.
