Commenting on the President's remarks at a news conference on 18 February after a cabinet session, Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of the international trade and industry, said: "American negotiators have often criticized the Japanese bureaucracy at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, but their criticism stems from misunderstanding. Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States has long continued unabated. We have to understand the President's irritation and to work to reduce Japan's current account surplus." At the news conference, the minister also said: "We do not mean that Japan cannot reduce its trade surplus with the United States and Japan should work to do voluntarily what it can do for the reduction of its trade surplus. I am convinced that the private sector is thinking of measures to reduce it." In this way, Minister Kumagai stressed the need for the private sector to make its own independent effort to break the current impasse in the Japan-U.S. relations.
