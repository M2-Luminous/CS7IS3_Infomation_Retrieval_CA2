Bossidy) to jointly develop an auxiliary power unit (APU) for small civil aircraft. KHI will assume 15 "risk and revenue sharing" involved in developing the APU and will be in charge of the development and production of gear boxes, an important element of the APU. In addition to KHI, it has been decided that BMW and Rolls Royce (a joint venture company of Germany's BMW and the UK's Rolls Royce), as well as Italy's Alfa Romeo Avio, S.A., will participate in more or less equal proportions; thus the APU will be an international project jointly developed by four countries. The prospect is for development expenses to amount to about $5 billion. The price per unit will be in the vicinity of Â¥35 million and it is forecast that approximately 3000 units will be sold by the year 2015. The APU will be installed in the rear of passenger planes and used for such purposes as starting the main engines and powering cabin air conditioning. Allied Signal holds about a 90 percent share of the world APU market. It has been decided that the APU to be developed will be adopted for the "Gulfstream V," a business jet already under development by Gulfstream. The first APU is slated to be delivered to Gulfstream in May 1995.
