Addressing in Tashkent the government meeting, he said that the chemical and machine-building industries are working inadequately. The president has leveled criticism at the managers who believe that the disruption of economic ties among the Republics of the former Soviet Union is the reason for the production slump. He believes that these leaders do not take advantage of the economic possibilities opened lately due to the Republic's transfer to the free market relations and inadequately use the reserves and rich resources of Uzbekistan. The president said negligent leaders of enterprises and industries have found a good niche. The president is particularly concerned by the fact that the nostalgic sentiments have not become a thing of the past in some places. Karimov believes that many leaders continue working without due account of peculiarities of the market and interests of the Republic. The president is sure that the use of outdated forms and methods makes it impossible to build a state with a great future.
