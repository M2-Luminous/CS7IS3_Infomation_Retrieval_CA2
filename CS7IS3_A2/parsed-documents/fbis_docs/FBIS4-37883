Officials have not so far confirmed the claim but an informed source said that the MKO has made the claim in order to project the country as insecure. The MKO also followed the same objective in the Mashhad bomb blast, he said. Twenty-six pilgrims were martyred and 170 others injured when a bomb went off at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as) [peace be upon him] on June 20. He said that by spreading rumors about attacks on military centres, the terrorist MKO try to pretend that their terrorist attacks are focussed on military centres and not social meetings. The claim is made at a time when security forces have collected documents and evidences on the involvement of the MKO in the bomb blast at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as). The Information Ministry has published a facial sketch of Mahdi Nahvi, a member of the terrorist MKO who was involved in Mashhad bomb blast and called on the nation to introduce him to security forces.
