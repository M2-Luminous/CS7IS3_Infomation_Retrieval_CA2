Following a comprehensive debate, various items were added to the part on ecology, but the controversial wording of the speed limit has remained unaltered. The passage says that the SPD is aiming at a universal speed limit throughout Europe, which would be 130 kilometers per hour for 90 percent of all super highways, Scharping said. The SPD chairman said that there was no criticism of his leadership -- "quite the contrary." The withdrawal of traffic expert Christoph Zoepel from his team was only mentioned briefly, [Scharping said].
