Tel Rumayda is the only settlement site in Hebron where the inhabitants live in temporary structures. In the rest of the enclaves the settlers live in new or rehabilated permanent homes, in the synagogue of Abraham our father, in Bet Hadassah, or in Bet Romano. At the beginning of the eighties, the settlers in Hebron waged a stubborn struggle aimed at settling on the grounds of Tel Rumayda, south of the Arab heart of Hebron. This struggle has seen endless confrontations with the residents of Hebron as well as with the military administration. Once Arab fruit trees were uprooted. Other times the settlers tried to fence in territory, of which the legal ownership was unclear. Thus it happened that on several occasions the IDF soldiers removed the fences, and the settlers came back and refenced them. Most of the land on the Tel was purchased by the Jewish community in Hebron 150 years ago. Today only a few plots remain under Jewish ownership. In 1984 the government authorized several families to settle in temporary structures on one of the plots. Today seven settler families live on that very spot. Settlement on the rest of the plots was held up by the national unity government in the mid-eighties. On the western part of the Tel is the ancient Jewish cemetery in which many generations of Jews were buried, among them rabbis and cabalists. The Israeli Government prohibited burials there in the first years after the Six-Day War. But in 1975, when the boy Avraham Yedidia Nahshon died in Qiryat Arba', his mother buried him in the ancient cemetery. The victims of the 1929 riots are buried in another section. The cemetery was destroyed by the Arabs after the Jordanian conquest and was rebuilt by the Jews of Qiryat Arba'. In 1976, remnants of Torah scrolls were laid to rest there that had been torn up and desecrated by Arabs in the Cave of the Patriarchs. Their location is marked today by a monument in the form of a Torah scroll. In a pamphlet put out by No'am Arnon on behalf of the Hebron academy, he describes "the large and impressive ancient walls from the period of the patriarchs," located on the southeastern part of the Tel. "These walls were excavated in archaeological digs in the sixties. Further digs conducted on the Tel in recent years exposed various finds from the Canaanite period and parts of the city from the time of the First and Second Commonwealth. On the eastern slopes of the Tel is Ayn Jidira (`the fountain of Abraham'), that constituted a water supply source for the ancient city. On the top of the Tel is Dir al Arba'in, an ancient Crusader fortress, with a beautiful view of the `Hebron Valley' and the entire city. On this spot there are Jewish traditions noting the graves of Jesse, the father of King David and Ruth, the mother of the Davidian dynasty."
