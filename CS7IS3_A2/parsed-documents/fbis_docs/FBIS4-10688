"The situation remains tense as Basic Industries Minister Marcos Portal has explained," a spokesman for state-owned Union Electrica Company has told NOTIMEX. "In the next few hours there could be a little more electricity if four or five generators that were out of order begin operations," the official added. On Tuesday and Wednesday there was an average of five hours of electric power in this capital of over 2 million people, where extensive areas have remained in the dark for over three weeks. Official sources stated two thirds of the electric power generating capacity of Cuba is out of service due to failure and lack of maintenance. "Today will also be a very tense day and even prioritized sectors such as the sugar harvest, industrial production, and the population in general will be affected," the spokesman for state-owned Union Electrica Company asserted. According to the spokesman, the daily power outages do not include hospitals and laboratories, selected production centers, state-owned organizations, military command centers, and the group of tourism installations. "Above everything are the water lines, hospitals, and bread making," the spokesman stated. Spokespersons for the Ministry of Basic Industries said a repair plan will enter into operations this month, but the recovery of some 60 percent of the electric power production capacity will only be achieved at the end of the present year. Other sources NOTIMEX consulted explained there are delays in maintenance due to lack of resources and, although some resources have been received, the recovery process in this regard will take two to three years. The failure of the system was added to the lack of fuel for thermal energy production, originated by the shortage of crude oil in the country, despite the efforts made by state-owned Cuba Petroleo (Cupet). Cupet representatives reported that 2.135 million barrels of crude oil were extracted during the first quarter of this year, representing 112 percent compliance with the oil program. The national production plan for crude oil, whose high content of sulfur is damaging the boilers of the thermoelectric centrals, so far this year totals [number indistinct] million barrels, that is 700,000 barrels over what was extracted in 1993. Cuba reduced its oil supplies from 91 million annual barrels to less than half that amount, following the disappearance of the Soviet Union, its former essential supplier. According to Cupet data, the production of 821 megawatts (26 percent of the total) is hampered by faults and that of 570 megawatts (18 percent) due to lack of maintenance. Resources equivalent to 372 megawatts (11 percent) have different limitations and the equipment generates lower-than-capacity amounts, according to the energy utility company.
