The analysis conducted by the Institute for International Relations -- which will form the basis for the government's security policy concept -- absolutely discounts the possibility of the republic becoming a neutral country or of it relying solely on its own forces and resources for its defense. The experts also reject involvement in a defensive system made up only of Central European states. The advantage of joining just the WEU is, according to diplomats, the possibility of reacting to situations that concern only Europe. Despite this, they give priority to incorporation into NATO, because it -- as opposed to the WEU -- offers a defense system with a functioning military structure. According to the experts, neutrality is no longer significant. "Following the cessation of the bipolar world, there is no one here to be neutral against," said one of the military officials. Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec has previously rejected neutrality. He described it as a dangerous snare. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has said the same thing. He rejected neutrality as a hollow concept belonging to the realm of third ways leading nowhere. It is apparent from the aforementioned document -- for which various institutions are now drafting comments -- that the republic does not consider anyone to be an enemy a priori and that it has no territorial or other political claims against any state.
