The revival of the Krajina authorities' links with certain Italian politicians almost coincides with the assertions that the National Union in Berlusconi's coalition "team" is in fact the one that is indirectly "promoting" territorial pretensions toward Istria, which is directly manifested by demands for the revision of the Osimo Agreements. This was why new Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino said, first in Bonn (!), and then in the House of Representatives of the Italian Parliament, that "Italy does not have territorial designs on Slovenia and Croatia." The Krajina authorities, pressed by accusations that they are responsible for the failure of the negotiations [with Croatia] and by Croatia's threats that it will not extend the mandate to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] after 30 September, responded quickly to Fini's invitation. "Mikelic has accepted the invitation and we will maintain contacts with Italy at the levels at which this is possible. In any case, we have been pleasantly surprised by the invitation, because this is a signal that the RSK [republic of Serbian Krajina] has become a subject in international relations, even though it has not been recognized." This was stated for BORBA by Slobodan Jarcevic, president Martic's adviser for foreign affairs and foreign minister in the previous government. The first Krajina-Italian contact at a "higher level" was established last September, when socialist Arduino Agnelli attended the session of the Krajina assembly, which declared him (and his wife) a "honorary citizen of the RSK." [passage omitted] Mr. Agnelli told us that many members of the European Parliament held the view that the alteration of borders that was allowed in 1991 would not be frozen on the "AVNOJ" [Antifascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders of the former Yugoslav republics. He assured us that Europe realized that the ethnic rights of the Serbs are their historical rights, and that the right to self-determination is stronger than formal communist borders, drawn without taking into consideration any historical or ethnic principles. This was the first encouragement from the Italian side that the RSK's destiny would not be subordinated only to `AVNOJ' borders and the UN Security Council's resolutions," Jarcevic said. Apart from Fini's message of support to the Krajina assembly at the end of last year, there have been no contacts or exchange of messages until the recent one that attracted public's attention. Two visits by Slobodan Jarcevic to Italy did not receive much publicity. In Italy, he met the representatives of the Association of Expelled Italians from Istria and Dalmatia and with Italian intellectuals in Milan and Trieste. [passage omitted]
