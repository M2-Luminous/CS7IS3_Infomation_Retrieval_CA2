The Moldovan Supreme Soviet at the weekend approved a referendum question asking Moldovans if they wanted their country to be "an independent, integral state or to unite or reunite with another country," meaning Romania. But Foreign Ministry spokesman Mircea Geoana said here that for the referendum to be valid, all Romanians should be consulted. [passage omitted] At the other end of the spectrum, Russian nationalists in the self-proclaimed Dniester republic in eastern Moldova, who have been fighting to take their territory into Russia, have called for a boycott of the referendum.
