Meals for infants from birth to 2 years of age shall meet the requirements in ยง210.10a (a), (c), (d) and (h). (d) Specific nutrient levels for children age 2. Schools with children age 2 who participate in the program shall ensure that the nutrition standards in paragraph (a) of this section are met except that, such schools have the option of either using the RDA and calorie levels for children ages 3&hyph;6 in the table, Minimum Nutrient Levels for School Lunches, in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, or developing separate nutrient levels for this age group. The methodology for determining such levels will be available in menu planning guidance material provided by FNS. (e) Requirements for meals for children ages 3&hyph;17 _(1) General . In order to receive reimbursement, school food authorities shall ensure that participating schools offer lunches which meet the nutrition standards provided in paragraph (a) of this section to children age three and over. (2) Nutrient levels. The nutrients of reimbursable lunches shall, as offered and as averaged over each school week, meet the requirements in the table, Minimum Nutrient Levels for School Lunches, in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section for children of the appropriate age group. (3) Records. Production, menu and nutritional analysis records shall be maintained by schools to demonstrate that lunches meet, when averaged over each school week, the nutrition standards provided in paragraph (a) of this section and the nutrient levels for children of each age group in the table Minimum Nutrient Levels for School Lunches in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section.

For example, a school has grades one through five, but if some first graders are six, the levels for Group II would be used as the majority of students are in this age group. Schools shall ensure that lunches are offered with the objective of providing the per lunch minimums for each age level as specified in the following table: Minimum Nutrient Levels for School Lunches 1Nutrients and energy allowances 1Group I ages 3&hyph;6 years 1Group II ages 7&hyph;10 years 1Group III ages 11&hyph;13 years 1Group IV ages 14&hyph;17 years Energy allowance/Calories 558 667 783 846 Total Fat (as a percent of actual total food energy) (1) (1) (1) (1) Total Saturated Fat (as a percent of actual total food energy) (2) (2) (2) (2) RDA for protein (g) 7.3 9.3 15.0 16.7 RDA for calcium (mg) 267 267 400 400 RDA for iron (mg) 3.3 3.3 4.5 4.5 RDA for vitamin A (RE) 158 233 300 300 RDA for vitamin C (mg) 14.6 15.0 16.7 19.2 1Less than or equal to 30% of actual calories offered. 2Less than 10% of actual calories offered.
