Will Washington bring us back the blood that has been shed? Or will it, for that matter, protect us from Zionist crimes? The United States is inviting us to Washington, contending that peace will resolve all problems. Hence, it wants the negotiators to sign an agreement there. It wants it to be said, in a familiar media stunt, that an agreement has been reached, that the United States is capable of resolving all problems, and that both sides have been granted justice. The Palestinian negotiators will have something to say on the occasion. They will say the following: We have asked for U.S. intervention, and we have obtained this intervention. We have signed the agreement and that ends everything, thus the blood shed in Hebron has not gone to waste. Much of this unconvincing talk will be heard. Attention will then be focused on how to find new answers to justify the next massacre. This is the way things are being handled and managed. How can the Palestinians accept this thoroughly rotten and objectionable situation? How can the free Palestinians accept all this misrepresentation of facts, all this humiliation, and all this gratuitous death?
