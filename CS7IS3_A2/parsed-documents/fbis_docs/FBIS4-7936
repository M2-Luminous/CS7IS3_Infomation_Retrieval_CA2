Drzycimski said that President Lech Walesa is open to talks with representatives of the ruling coalition or the prime minister about the filling of the vacant post in the government but stressed that Rosati's candidature was completely out of the question since it had already been officially rejected by the president. According to Drzycimski, the Thursday meeting between the president and the Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy will be devoted to discussing the results of a parliamentary delegation's visit paid recently to Moscow. The spokesman said also that the president had not taken a decision yet whether to sign the law on election to commune councils.
