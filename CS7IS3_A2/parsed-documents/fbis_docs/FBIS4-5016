The commonality between the two is that the coalition is on the offensive and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is entirely on the defensive. However, there is also a decisive difference between the two acts. In the first act, the coalition reaped the fruits of capturing power; in the second, it is trying to alter those fruits. In that sense, although the coalition parties are on the offensive, their unity is on the decline and they will have considerable difficulty in conducting state affairs. The Ichi-Ichi [Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, leaders of Shinseito and Komeito] lineup continues to pursue a positive, aggressive strategy; Hosokawa seems to be taking part in it, thus accelerating the political tempo. The confrontation with Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura will be the first step. In the end the Ichi-Ichi lineup, in alliance with Hosokawa, might go so far as to form a new new party [shin shinto]. [Kobayashi] Until the election last year, Hosokawa, Takemura, and Ozawa had all been advocates of a two-party system. However, the substance was different: The Ichi-Ichi lineup had favored a two-party system comprising the LDP and a new conservative party; Hosokawa-Takemura had favored a union of Shinseito and Komeito as well as a union of the Japan New Party [JNP] and Sakigake, and had wanted the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to join either of the two unions. However, since becoming prime minister Hosokawa has shifted his stance to the Ichi-Ichi lineup. Therefore, it has become impossible for Takemura to take the initiative. Shinseito and Komeito want to be the ruling parties again. There are two conditions for this: One is that the LDP should not have a one-party majority in the next general election, and the other is that there should not be a coalition government comprising the LDP and other parties. For this purpose, the current coalition parties must unite under the single seat constituency system as much as possible. As things stand, there is a possibility that a tripolar structure will come into being: a group comprising Shinseito, Komeito, and part of the JNP; a group comprising Sakigake, the SDPJ, the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and part of the JNP; and the LDP. Then there is a possibility that a coalition government consisting of the LDP plus a Sakigake union will come into being. This is what the Ichi-Ichi lineup dreads the most. Added to this, there is the problem of candidate adjustments. There is an 11-member single-seat constituency district for 14 incumbent coalition members, so some incumbents will have to change to the proportional representation system. However, even if elections are held on the basis of "the candidates of party A for the single-seat constituency system and the candidates of party B for the proportional representation system," there is no knowing how many votes for party A of the single-seat constituency system will go to party B of the proportional representation system. Under certain circumstances, candidates who have changed over to the proportional representation system will end in grief. Then a new new party will surely be preferable. The Rupture of the Hosokawa-Takemura Combination [Tase] The biporlarization of the coalition parties now in progress comes not so much from confrontation due to the difference of lines and policies as from emotional confrontation--in effect, a power struggle. Hosokawa's character has a lot to do with that. Hosokawa is the type who severs connections with his close friends in an instant. There is no knowing how long Hosokawa's honeymoon with the Ichi-Ichi combination will last. Therefore, since the political situation will progress for the time being based on individual emotions, it is impossible to determine what will happen in the future. However, it is now impossible to repair the rupture in relations between Hosokawa and Takemura. We may take this as an established fact. [Iwami] The Ichi-Ichi lineup wants to discard Takemura as soon as possible. That policy was decided on much earlier. The decision was made when the national welfare tax caused trouble; it may even have been made prior to that. Tase's indication that there exists an emotional confrontation is certainly true, but the confrontation between the two men is rooted in their differences as regards political ideas and methods. We did not know what Hosokawa would do in this connection, but that has become clear now. Hosokawa will go along with the Ichi-Ichi lineup. [Tase] However, his move is not a calculated one. If you say that is the characteristic of a lord, that is the end of it; but nobody knows his "outlook on the state" or his "line." What Ozawa is going to do and what Hosokawa has said are contradictory. Concerning the election system, Hosokawa has been advocating the medium-constituency plural ballot system, has he not? Strictly speaking, he may have no principles. [Iwami] Anyway, the tripolar structure has been consolidated in nine out of 10 cases. Concerning the new new party advocated by the Ichi-Ichi lineup, Secretary General Ichikawa has begun saying Hosokawa will be its president. If we tentatively call it the Hosokawa party, it is likely the Takamura party will come into being. The Kono party will also remain. The next election will be contested by these three parties. [Kobayashi] Contrary to expectation, the Kono party may have few dropouts. Since the number of small electoral districts has been increased to 300, the Kono party's surplus Diet members have considerably decreased in number. The problem is the Takemura party. Since this party will unite as an anti-Hosokawa party, it will include not only those members of the SDPJ who have considerable inclination toward the left, but also Sakigake members who have considerable inclination toward the LDP. If the Takemura party is challenged to policy discussions by the opposing parties, to what extent can it keep itself united? [Iwami] However, the SDPJ, the JNP, and all the other parties are going to split. The Takemura party will establish its own ideals and will somehow survive, even if its union is far from perfect. Takemura is trying to differentiate himself from Ozawa by publishing a book in opposition to Ozawa's. It is the LDP that is uncertain, and it may not be able to differentiate itself from the Takemura party. [Kobayashi] Another point is what kind of move will be made by the Diet members of the Japan New Party. There are some individual electoral districts in which the Japan New Party will have to compete with Sakigake. These districts will be captured by the Hosokawa party. Conversely, Sakigake will have to compete with Shinseito in some districts, and these districts may be captured by the Takemura party. [Tase] There is no knowing what Representative Secretary Sonoda will do. [Iwami] That being the case, in principle the Hosokawa party will try to win Diet members to its side one by one. The problem is the left faction of the SDPJ. During his address in Nagoya, Takemura extended his tolerance limit so as to embrace Gotoda and Yokomichi. Even the Hosokawa party is capable of embracing Michio Watanabe and Tomiichi Murayama. The party can try to bring members to its side one by one. [Tase] Any combination is possible depending upon the manner of adjustment of the ruling parties' candidates; the formulation of doctrines can wait. [Kobayashi] There is little possibility of there being policy disputes. In the U.S. House and Senate elections, there are few electoral districts where the policies of the Democratic and Republican candidates are different. In Japan, it is also unlikely that substantial differences will emerge no matter which side wins. The Leftist Faction of the SDPJ Has No Place To Go [Iwami] However, this time the basic policies of each party will become more clear than those of the current coalition government, otherwise political realignment is meaningless. In that case, those who cannot follow will be excluded. It is unlikely the left faction of the SDPJ will join the new new party. Since it is highly ideological to advocate the principles of "a major power" or of "a small but brilliant country," peacekeeping operations may come to the surface again as one of the indices. Hosokawa's new party, or Ozawa, has a rather clear view on such operations. On the other hand, Takemura is against them, and Kono leans towards Takemura. [Kobayashi] There are many Sakigake members within the Takemura party who can accept the left faction of the SDPJ, but DSP members will not. [Iwami] Then the pure left faction of the SDPJ will have no place to go. It may pursue its own lines, but there are those in the left faction who are not strict about principles. [Tase] There are still some active members in it. [Iwami] Ozawa says there will be "two-party party and other parties," but I think there will be a three-party party and other parties. [Kobayashi] In actual elections, both the LDP and Hosokawa party have firm support organizations. Who will conduct elections for the Takemura party? Sakigake aside, the SDPJ will have to depend on its left faction. [Tase] According to opinion polls, Takemura enjoys considerable popularity. It is unthinkable that Hosokawa's approval rating will continue, but the popularity of Takemura may continue for a fairly long time among a public who are fed up with the high-handedness of the Ichi-Ichi lineup. Then Takemura will fare well in elections. [Iwami] I am of the same opinion. [Tase] Some say Takemura is the first Vulcanian [Vulcan is the god of fire and metalworking in Roman mythology] politician since Miki. [Iwami] He has Vulcanian characteristics. I have a feeling he is a political type who is large in scale and whom we have not encountered for some time. There is something vague about Hosokawa, but Takemura is well-defined. He seems to be clear, fresh, and fit. However, being attacked from both sides by the Hosokawa and Kono parties, he will not attain enormous power. What makes the matter complicated is that Kono and Takemura overlap. Therefore, those who are thinking of leaving the LDP find it difficult to say they are going to join the Takemura party because of the difference in ideas. The focal point of political realignment is how many members switch over to Hosokawa and Takemura from the LDP. As Kobayashi says, the number may be smaller than expected because the number of small electoral districts was increased to 300. [Tase] There are already those who have been left out of selection in the adjustments to the fielding of candidates now being conducted by the LDP. Since such people are close to Takemura, they are watching his moves. [Kobayashi] The question is: What are these people actually going to do? Are they going to join the Hosokawa party, or are they going to be independent? However, under this tripolar structure, the form of government after elections is generally clear: The coalition of the Takemura party and the Kono party is more likely than the coalition of Takemura and Hosokawa. [Iwami] That is when each of the three parties is unable to hold a majority. [Kobayashi] That is right. On the other hand, a coalition of the Kono party and the Hosokawa party will be very difficult. The Hosokawa party cannot afford to slip down to an opposition party in full knowledge of the situation; therefore I think it is likely that a chaotic situation will occur after all: The Hosokawa party will ultimately establish a coalition government again through union with not three, but five or six parties other than the Takemura party and the Kono party. [Iwami] Only the Kono party and the Hosokawa party can put up candidates for all 300 electoral districts; the Takemura party will lag behind them. Then the question arises: Which one of the two will win? It is possible that one of the two will win a majority. Then there should be a one-party administration; otherwise, there will be a coalition government of the Kono party and the Takemura party, as Mr. Kobayashi says. [Kobayashi] Therefore the division of electoral districts is important. Since Shinseito, the JNP, and Sakigake will compete especially hard in urban areas, the JNP will have to join either the Hosokawa party or the Takemura party, depending upon the method of division. The division of electoral districts itself is a power struggle. Will a report of the eighth Election System Council concerning the division of electoral districts be accepted, or will there be a different division? The method of division will decide the outcome of 40 out of 300 districts. [Tase] The question is: Who in the ruling parties will take the initiative? [Kobayashi] It will be easy for the ruling parties to make adjustments in the fielding of candidates if the ruling parties divide into the Hosokawa party and the Takemura party; otherwise, these two parties will have to compete throughout the urban areas. The objective is to bring the heads of local governments to one side. When 300 electoral districts are allocated, blank districts will inevitably come into being, where a big city becomes a small electoral district, as it is; therefore, victory or defeat is a matter of which camp the mayor belongs to -- whether he leans toward the Hosokawa party or the Takemura party. [Iwami] However, the future trend will be decided by the rise and fall of the popularity of Hosokawa and Takemura. Is Hosokawa's popularity at its height now? The Possibility of a Takemura Cabinet [Kobayashi] According to a survey conducted by Fuji TV's "Report 2001," 60 percent approved of Hosokawa and 30 percent disapproved of him. From the time the national welfare tax became troublesome, Hosokawa's disapproval rating has increased a little, while Takemura's strong point is that he has no enemies. The LDP side may be relieved at the rupture in relations between Hosokawa and Takemura. If the two men are united, the LDP will have no good move to make. However, if they are divided, the LDP will have a good chance to form a coalition with the LDP as leader. [Iwami] This is going to be the first election under the single-member constituency system. If the Hosokawa party holds the advantage in each electoral district, members of the LDP may switch to the Hosokawa party in avalanche-like fashion. [Kobayashi] That is because the effects of election forecasts of the single-member constituency system are diametrically opposite those of the medium constituency system. Under the medium constituency system, those who were said to have an advantage over others often lost their elections. Under the single-member constituency system, however, the forecast that the chances that a candidate will succeed are 55:45 will shift immediately to 90:10. To the support groups and the influential people of the district, it does not matter which party wins. Since there is only one link between the district and the center, the support groups and the influential people will be "killed" if they back the wrong horse. [Tase] The LDP has no good candidates now. If Takemura makes his attitude clear by parting with Hosokawa, a considerable number of people in the LDP will be willing to form a coalition with Takemura as prime minister. In that case, the Takemura party and the LDP will be united instantly, not in the form of Takemura party's returning to the LDP, but in the form of a coalition. [Iwami] On the other hand, it is doubtful whether today's LDP has such centripetal force and mobility. [Tase] Today's LDP is not what it used to be in that the only active members are young ones who were elected three times or less. The other day I talked to a young member who said: "Mr. Gotoda telephones me, asking: `What is going on?'" This was unthinkable in former times. Members who were elected seven times or more were still not given any information. Therefore, there is no knowing what will happen in the LDP. As far as centripetal force is concerned, the Kono and Mori establishment is not functioning at all, which is not a surprise. The reason that the LDP seemed to have functioned well so far is that the Keiseikai, the largest faction, had run the whole thing through a kind of reign of terror. Now that the central force of the Keiseikai has disbanded and the Keiseikai is leaving the Sabokaikan Building, it is impossible for the LDP to have centripetal force. The president and the three key officials of the LDP are almost amateurish in their management of the party. Stranded in the stream of the times, the best they can do is dither. I do not think that the chiefs of factions are giving gratuities to their faction members at year's end any more. Diet members are going Dutch at their parties. [Iwami] The top-ranking leaders of the LDP used to rule through skillful factional maneuvering inside the party, but now that the factions are gone, they are at a loss what to do. They are in a state of weightlessness. I do not think that Kono will be able to find a new method of maneuvering, since there are neither responses nor clues. In that respect, we can say that the LDP is already in a state of dissolution. However, in the provinces, the local organizations of the LDP are still the strongest and the most massive. I think that the chairman of the prefectural assembly of every prefecture still belongs to the LDP. Therefore, the LDP is strong when it comes to elections. The "Japan-U.S. Relationship" and the "Economy" Are the Key Points [Tase] To change the subject, if the Hosokawa administration were to collapse, that would be due to "the relationship between Japan and the United States" and "the economy." The recent rupture of the Hosokawa-Clinton talks is a serious matter. "Mature relationship," indeed! That is a fiasco of the administration. We should not make light of the United States. It is no use to have a conference by summoning officials in a hurry at this belated time. Unless the administration gives definite directions to the bureaucrats, the situation will deteriorate further. However, the Hosokawa administration does not have such leadership. The matter can never be solved Hosokawa-style -- "I have had them discussing the matter." [Kobayashi] It is on Europe that the Hosokawa administration is placing its hopes. Japan thinks that Europe will side with it if it appeals to GATT. The Japanese Government seems to be hoping for Europe's help because the entry of U.S.-made products into Japan means a cut in the imports of European products that have entered until now. However, even if Japan's appeal to GATT is successful, Europe will enter into partnership with the United States thereafter. Europe and the United States comprise a community bound together by common interests regarding the opening of Japan's markets. The United States is exercising its political power to the full for the persuasion of European countries. Japan does not have enough power to compete with the international political power of the United States. [Tase] The observation of the recent negotiations of the officials shows that the rupture occurred at the last moment. Such a situation existed many times in past negotiations between Japan and the United States. However, past negotiations had been narrowly saved through a top-down approach. The Hosokawa administration allowed the rupture to happen without trying to do anything to prevent it. Such an approach is impermissible even though Hosokawa is a novice at diplomacy. [Kobayashi] It is the United Stats that gained the most due to the change of administration in Japan. The United States had been making concessions when Japan asked a question -- "Is it acceptable for Japan to be socialized?" -- which was raised when something happened to the one-party rule of the LDP. This time, however, there is no possibility of a socialist government, and if you do not like the Hosokawa administration, you can recall the government of the LDP. This is advantageous to the United States. The United States could not possibly make a concession to Japan owing to the circumstances surrounding the Clinton administration in the United States. However, the Hosokawa administration failed to reach a correct understanding of the situation. What was the current administration's understanding of the change of the U.S. ambassador to Japan from Armacost to Mondale? With the coming of Ambassador Mondale, the moves of the U.S. Embassy have become very political, have they not? [Tase] That is because Mondale is a lawyer. His way of thinking is similar to that of a group of lawyers who work with Mickey Kantor as the group's axis. Rendering great service to their clients during their tenure of office is their way of doing things. However, Japanese politics is not ready to cope with the situation. It is natural for Japan and the United States to clash with each other because the Hosokawa administration lacks the ability to play the part which had been played by the former administration -- add two things and divide by two to get an average. [Iwami] Takemura and others had been excluded from the inner circle of the Hosokawa administration, and this time there was no one around Hosokawa who could teach him the rudiments of summit diplomacy. [Tase] The dispatch of special envoy Kiuchi was also a fiasco. The U.S. side was dumfounded because he visited the United States not to bring any new proposals but only to pay a courtesy call. [Iwami] But the reports of the media were terrible. The next day's newspapers praised Hosokawa in chorus, saying "the age of the mature relationship between Japan and the United States has come." I could not believe my own eyes and said to myself, "What is the meaning of all of this?" [Tase] I had been boarding together with the brains of the Clinton administration until yesterday. If Japan's perception of the situation is the same as theirs, it will lead to grave consequences. The brain trusters themselves do not think that the setting of numerical targets is a smart thing to do. However, they say that Japan should not have broken off the negotiations just because of that. [Iwami] Japan's response was that the rupture of the negotiations was a great achievement on the part of Japan. [Tase] The Hosokawa administration is like the Konoe cabinet, which refused to deal with the Nanking government. At present Japan is producing an atmosphere in which people who attach great importance to good relations between Japan and the United States have to keep a somewhat low profile. They are being overwhelmed by the opinions which attach great importance to Asia. I think that this is really a dangerous omen. Despite that, however, Hosokawa is being evaluated highly. In short, he is not criticized, no matter how badly he manages national affairs. I can hardly understand that. [Kobayashi] For one thing, the media also is responsible for that. With the establishment of the Hosokawa administration, discussions on election systems are conducted only within the framework of the heiretsu system. The media almost always refuses to carry articles which point out problems with the heiretsu system. Even monthly magazines refuse to carry articles critical of the system. [Iwami] In the first place, it was a mistake for leaders of newspaper publishing companies to become members of government committees. [Tase] Hosokawa is never criticized for the absence of measures to boost the economy. This is also strange. [Kobayashi] Japan is a unique in that its government is rarely criticized for the country's recession. It was at the time of the oil shocks that a return to conservatism was advocated. There are two theories for that: one is that public opinion had it that only the LDP could solve the problem of recession; the other is the time- lag theory. This theory explains holds that consumers have a real sense that recession exists only after a certain period of time has elapsed. This is said to be the most likely reason. "The Opinion That Hosokawa Is Not To Blame" Is Rampant [Tase] Which theory explains the current situation? [Kobayashi] Neither theory can explain the current situation. Voters still have a great distrust of LDP government. It may be that such a level of misgovernment by Hosokawa is not enough to dispel that distrust. [Tase] I have another idea. I think that the people believe that the bureaucrats, and not Hosokawa, are responsible for the recession. [Iwami] It may be that Ozawa's consistent claim still has persuasive power: It is because of the misgovernemnt of the LDP that the current government cannot take drastic measures regarding Japan-U.S. relations and the recession. At first, the business community was opposed to Ozawa's claim that political reform should have priority over the budget, even if it is carried forward to the following year, but it approved his claim afterward. That persuasive power is still existent. In short, it says that government by the LDP is to blame and that the Hosokawa administration is trying to change that. Therefore, no matter what the Hosokawa administration does, it is no longer held responsible. In weighing government by professionals against government by amateurs, public opinion still bets on government by amateurs. [Kobayashi] The current administration has worsened the recession not by doing something about it, but by doing nothing about it. Since it does nothing, it is not held responsible. That is the way it looks. [Tase] That is right. The downfall of a government due to policy occurs when it tries to implement something -- like Thatcher, who initiated a poll tax. The recent national welfare tax is a case in point. [Iwami] The Hosokawa administration has been working out a barrage of policies. It is advocating themes one after another without pause. The Ichi-Ichi lineup is impatient, and it seems that Hosokawa himself is also very impatient. He may be obsessed that his administration will not last unless he works out policies one after another. There is a growing voice in Nagata-cho that the dissolution of the Diet will take place next year, but I have a feeling that he will decide on an early dissolution. As soon as a new new party is formed and electoral districts are decided on, there will be a dissolution. [Kobayashi] I think that there may be an early dissolution, contrary to expectations. After the passage of a political reform bill, a rumor spread at once that the dissolution would be late. I think that was rather intentional. New political parties, like the Hosokawa party and the Takemura party, will have an advantage when elections are held immediately after the formation of parties. New parties will naturally be born when electoral districts are decided on. Then an early dissolution is quite possible. [Iwami] The political situation will not be quiet for the time being. We must keep a constant eye on the political situation.
