FR940705-2-00195 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix G-II-B&hyph;2-k. Spills and accidents which result in overt exposures to organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules are immediately reported to the Institutional Biosafety Committee and NIH/ORDA. Reports to NIH/ORDA shall be sent to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Medical evaluation, surveillance, and treatment are provided as appropriate and written records are maintained. Appendix G-II-B&hyph;2-l. When appropriate, considering the agent(s) handled, baseline serum samples for laboratory and other at-risk personnel are collected and stored. Additional serum specimens may be collected periodically depending on the agents handled or the function of the facility. Appendix G-II-B&hyph;2-m. A biosafety manual is prepared or adopted. Personnel are advised of special hazards and are required to read and follow instructions on practices and procedures. Appendix G-II-B&hyph;3. Containment Equipment (BL 2). Appendix G-II-B&hyph;3-a. Biological safety cabinets (Class I or II) (see Appendix G-III-L) or other appropriate personal protective or physical containment devices are used whenever: Appendix G-II-B&hyph;3-a-(1). Procedures with a high potential for creating aerosols are conducted (see Appendix G-III-O). These may include centrifuging, grinding, blending, vigorous shaking or mixing, sonic disruption, opening containers of materials whose internal pressures may be different from ambient pressures, intranasal inoculation of animals, and harvesting infected tissues from animals or eggs. Appendix G-II-B&hyph;3-a-(2). High concentrations or large volumes of organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules are used. Such materials may be centrifuged in the open laboratory if sealed beads or centrifuge safety cups are used and if they are opened only in a biological safety cabinet. Appendix G-II-B&hyph;4. Laboratory Facilities (BL 2). Appendix G-II-B&hyph;4-a. The laboratory is designed so that it can be easily cleaned. Appendix G-II-B&hyph;4-b. Bench tops are impervious to water and resistant to acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and moderate heat. Appendix G-II-B&hyph;4-c. Laboratory furniture is sturdy and spaces between benches, cabinets, and equipment are accessible for cleaning. Appendix G-II-B&hyph;4-d. Each laboratory contains a sink for hand washing. Appendix G-II-B&hyph;4-e. If the laboratory has windows that open, they are fitted with fly screens. Appendix G-II-B&hyph;4-f. An autoclave for decontaminating laboratory wastes is available. Appendix G-II-C. Biosafety Level 3 (BL3) (see Appendix G-III-P) Appendix G-II-C&hyph;1. Standard Microbiological Practices (BL3). Appendix G-II-C&hyph;1-a. Work surfaces are decontaminated at least once a day and after any spill of viable material. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;1-b. All contaminated liquid or solid wastes are decontaminated before disposal. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;1-c. Mechanical pipetting devices are used; mouth pipetting is prohibited.
