The document was not so much a report as a letter of challenge. It advocated the British side's "independent action" in the "pre-1997 electoral arrangements" and in the "legislation on affairs before the handover of sovereignty." It advocated playing the "international card," and called for "continuing to seek international support" for Britain's position on the Chinese issue, and "especially cooperation with European allies and the United States" on this issue. It also called for "coming into contact with the Legislative Yuan of Taiwan," "reviewing the status of the Taiwan representative office in Britain," and "relaxing the restrictions" on it. The "report" did not wear any guise. It simply challenged China, and even interfered in China's internal affairs in an undisguised and even frenzied manner. Any people with a sense of justice and with judgment can easily see its essence. The "international card," the "human rights stick," and the "Taiwan chess-move [qi 2759]" all are nothing but tricks played by the British side since becoming helpless after being strongly condemned for its Hong Kong policy; such tricks will get Britain nowhere. Facts in the past more than one year prove this. It was not beyond people's expectation that the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the British Parliament would "fully support" Patten's "constitutional reform package." In November 1993 and in January 1994, the committee held hearings on the Hong Kong issue. It attacked China by saying, without grounds, that China "tried to impose a corruptive electoral system on Hong Kong" and also proved, without grounds, that Patten's package did not violate the Sino-British agreements. The committee was, in fact, Patten's mouthpiece and said only what Patten wanted it to say. The report by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the British Parliament was written according to a series of hearings between July 1993 and February 1994, and according to the conclusions it drew from its visits to China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. It proved that Patten had "chosen a correct line." This certainly could not deceive anyone. Here, we do not discuss whether the members of the committee listened to the voices criticizing Patten when they visited Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. Within Britain, the business circles generally were opposed to Patten's package. Some people of insight in political circles also criticized the British Government's Hong Kong policy. Percy Cradock, the former foreign affairs adviser to the British Government who participated in the Sino-British talks and was involved in signing the Joint Declaration and the following agreements, also repeatedly criticized Britain's Hong Kong policy for taking the wrong course after October 1992. In his written opinion submitted to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, he criticized Patten's handling of Sino-British relations and pointed out that this practice had led to confrontation and had harmed Hong Kong. He advised the British Government to "adopt the only option, of maintaining cooperation with Beijing when handling Hong Kong's future." After that, he again sent a letter the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, pointing out that some of Patten's testimony at the committee's hearing was untrue. However, the committee not only rejected more objective and responsible opinions such as those expressed by Cradock, but also denounced such opinions as "both untenable and dishonorable." As it treated different and even correct opinions in this way, could people believe that the report's conclusions were correct and tenable? The continuing Sino-British disputes were provoked by the British side. It was again the British side that undermined the Sino-British talks aimed at solving differences and at reaching an agreement on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong. From beginning to end, the British side had no sincerity for cooperation with the Chinese side at all, and it had made up its mind long ago to act perversely and unilaterally. The report pretended to be serious by saying that "if China does not cooperate,...it is necessary for the government to act independently." It made an unfounded countercharge and tried to make people feel that the British side's "independent action" was caused by "the Chinese side's unwillingness to cooperate." The Chinese side's sincerity for cooperation was clearly demonstrated in the document published by the Chinese side about the truth of the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political arrangements. The British side's practice of closing the door to the talks and rejecting cooperation on the issue of the political structure also was laid bare by its own White Paper on "Representative Government in Hong Kong." Here we quote two passages from the White Paper for our readers to make their own judgments: "The objective of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government in the talks was to establish whether an understanding could be reached with the Chinese side on a set of electoral arrangements which they could commend to the Legislative Council in Hong Kong." "When it became apparent during Round 17 that it would not be possible to reach agreement on the issues covered in the British draft Memorandum of Understanding, the British representative made plain that his instructions did not give him the authority to continue discussion of a first-stage understanding." The two passages made it plain that the Sino-British talks had to follow the will of the British side, and when it was impossible to reach an agreement according to the British side's opinion during Round 17 of the talks, the British representative simply refused to continue the talks. Look! Did the British side have any bit of sincerity for the talks and for cooperation? No matter how the Foreign Affairs Select Committee tried to conceal the British side's behavior in undermining the talks and rejecting cooperation, it was simply to no avail. The British side may "independently" arrange the 1994-95 elections and "independently" conduct legislation on affairs before the transfer of sovereignty, but all this will come to an end on 30 June 1997 and will never be able to extend beyond that date. No matter whether Patten believes this or not, the facts will provide him with a merciless answer.
