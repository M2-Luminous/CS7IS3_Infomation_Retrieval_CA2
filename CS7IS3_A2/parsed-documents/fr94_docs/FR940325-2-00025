If the ITC determines that material injury or threat of material injury does not exist, the proceedings will be terminated and all securities posted as a result of the suspension of liquidation will be refunded or cancelled. However, if the ITC determines that such injury does exist, we will issue an antidumping duty order directing Customs officers to assess an antidumping duty on CA cement, cement clinker and flux from France entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of suspension of liquidation.
