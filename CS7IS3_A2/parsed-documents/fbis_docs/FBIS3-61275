What Will It Be Like? And What Should We Expect From It?"] [Text] Some oracles were foretelling the speedy demise of the new parliament even before its birth. The logic of their arguments was as follows. Parliament will pursue its own line and display recalcitrance. This will not be to the liking of the president's circle, which will decide the fate of the Federal Assembly. No, the body of the people's elect does not afford grounds for expectations that it will agree to play the part of legislative decorator of the designs of the executive. Therefore, there are perfectly realistic grounds for the pessimistic forecasts concerning the breakup of parliament. Nonetheless, a new "action" against the new parliament, elected in accordance with rules laid down by the executive itself, could prove to be almost suicidal for the latter. An authority entangled in endless improvisations would become helpless and unproductive and, consequently, totally unneeded, except by the persons crowded on Olympus and around it. A new political situation has arisen. For the president, who came to power on a wave of almost nationwide support and who has managed largely to lose it, the time has come to reflect in earnest on how he will be remembered historically: a servant of the people, to fidelity to whom he took the oath, or a submissive servant of his immediate entourage. So from the viewpoint of his historical reputation the first president of Russia should abandon any thought of the breakup of the newly elected parliament, even if the latter displays an independence that does not suit the president. The new parliament could perform an innovative role. It has for the first time been formed on a multiparty basis. The organization of its work on the principles of the interaction of clearly structured party factions is a new aspect, which will make it possible to represent more precisely the interests of various groups of society and to take this more fully into account in lawmaking. It is important, however, that this objective possibility not be blocked once again by endless speechifying, wrangling, and scuffling at the microphones. Much here will depend on who is endowed with the right to turn the microphones on and off and keep an eye on strict observance of the standing orders and parliamentary procedures. Such a person is called different things in different countries. In Germany he is the president of parliament, in Anglophone countries, the speaker. Not to be confused with Snickers, which, as the advertisement claims, everyone enjoys. For the success of the work of the Federal Assembly and, possibly, for the fate of the fledgling Russian parliamentarianism, in general even, it is important that the speakers of both houses not resume the failed experiment of making the speaker some double of the head of state. Otherwise the country's political life would once again be reduced to a playing of the already dog-eared "whose side are you on" card. The danger of this primitive relapse has not been eradicated completely. The personality of the politician who occupies this seat is so important, therefore. There is no doubt that the figures of speakers are determined on the basis of a "balance of interests." In the State Duma, on a balance of interests of the party factions. In the Federation Council the interests of the regions will, most likely, clash with the position of the center, that is, the president. The result is not obvious. There is no doubt that the members of the Federation Council, the vast majority of whom being pragmatic people, will treat the president's nominee for speaker with respect. But that same pragmatism will determine the limits of the concessions also. Would the regional leaders have sufficient respect for Yeltsin to agree to a "Shumeyko," for example? And, on the other hand, would the president have the patience to "accept" a candidate of the regions who is inconvenient, perhaps, like E. Rossel, say? It would seem that any conflict with the upper house of parliament would further complicate the position of the president, who, according to the Constitution, does not have the right to dissolve the Federation Council, incidentally. In any event, the spread in terms of options of the relations of the president and the regions and, accordingly, in terms of the candidates for speaker of the Federation Council is great: from "compromise" (Gonchar?) to radical (Tuleyev?). Any serious complication with the Federation Council could show the president that it is no longer 1991. The president understands this, evidently. Do his associates understand it? Time of the Wreckers Is Coming to an End Appeal of the International Democratic Reform Movement to Members of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation The International Democratic Reform Movement Executive Committee welcomes the start of business of the State Duma and the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of Russia and wishes that it may be fruitful and constructive. We call on the political blocs and parties and each deputy to display state-minded wisdom, cast aside personal ambition, and concentrate joint efforts on the revival of the fatherland. The time of the Herostratuses and the wreckers is coming to an end, and the time of the creators is coming, and creation in isolation is impossible. We express the hope that the fruitful work of the Russian parliament will lend new impetus to the activity of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, which, following the October events, has virtually ceased. We are sure that without the reconstitution of the common fabric of the Eurasian space no state of the former Union can develop normally. Our movement declares its readiness for constructive cooperation with the new Russian parliament in any form acceptable for this.
