It is consequently running a totally negative campaign, trying to punch holes through the ANC's own carefully developed Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP]. The NP's media conference of Tuesday 19th April was yet another case in point. We do not want to be trapped into a sterile argument about figures and estimates. But we think it is appropriate to point up that these are the scare tactics used in other campaigns in other countries in recent years. In the USA, the public relations consultants employed by the NP, attempted to use the same ploy against the Clinton/Gore presidential campaign. In Britain the very same tactics were used against the Labour Party. The executive summary of the current document even makes the bizarre observation: "This report is based on the costing of the Labour Party policies in the 1987 and 1992 UK general elections... "We are at a loss to explain its relevance." To its credit, the NP did not conceal that its critique of the RDP was initiated by one Mr Tony Karpel, assisted by Mr Roelof Botha Jnr of the Rand Afrikaans University. This raises the question, do these scary figures derive from serious economic analysis, or are they thumb-sucks from manipulative PR consultants? We are dealing here with an election ploy, a public relations exercise that the NP prepared in secrecy. Our RDP is the result of serious consultative processes, which were transparent, open and involving a wide circle of people outside the ANC and its allies. It included consultations with business, parastatals, the trade unions, the civics, religious communities and, through the people's forums, a host of other economic players. During the short time that was available to us we have come up with new economic policies, whereas the NP, in government for 46 years, has nothing to offer. The people of South Africa have endured and suffered under the NP's policies for four decades. Those policies have left us with the unenviable legacy of massive unemployment, homelessness, economic decline and unequal education. Whatever else may be said, it is crystal clear that the NP has been an unmitigated disaster for this country. The document prepared for the NP by Karpel completely ignores the real social and economic imperatives and trade-offs associated with reconstruction and development. Instead it tries to score political points by exaggerating the costs beyond recognition while offering no solutions. Everyone agrees that we must make choices in using our limited resources. It is equally well-known that the legacy of 46 years of NP misrule will weigh heavily on the new government. Taking Tony Karpel's document at its word, it would appear that the NP is opposed, among other things, to: - supervised and hygienic child deliveries; - equal tax treatment for women; - ten years of free, quality education for all children; - upgrading of hostels; - reduced fiscal drag. The authors, Karpel and Roelof Botha Jnr, appear remarkably ignorant of most current policy debates. This is hardly surprising, since its principal author is a British consultant while his South African junior partner has never been an active participant in these. Running like a red thread through the document, are a number of groundless assumptions and bald assertions which the public are expected to believe merely because they've been pronounced. A telling example of this is the claim that: "Upgrading costs have been realistically estimated at an average of R16,500 [rand] per 15 square metres (housing 4 beds)." Firstly, no source is given for this astonishing assertion, which implies that upgrading one room in a hostel costs about a third as much as constructing an average township house. With regard to taxes on women, again the document gives no sources for its figures. There appears also to be the assumption that women in this society earn as much as men. In South Africa, which we all know to be extremely gender biased that is a ludicrous assumption. Every study of health care indicates that expenditures in these areas repay themselves many times over in savings in other areas of the health system. Thus the NP document does not use the costs for patients in public hospitals nor does it take into account the opportunity costs associated with unsupervised and unhygienic child deliveries. These are extensive in economic terms, even if we ignore, which we shouldn't, the costs in human terms. Adequate prenatal care and birthing facilities ultimately prove enormous net savings for the health care system as a whole, in addition to the visible social benefits. In another sleight of hand typical of the document, the guesstimates it employs when discussing retraining of health workers assume six-months of full-time retraining. This is certainly not the normal way to upgrade professionals. A programme of part-time study and workshops would come closer to normal practice. While it does factor in the opportunity costs - those of productivity loss based on its exaggerated assumptions it ignores the much larger opportunity costs entailed in continued neglect of primary health care. The social costs of course elude the authors completely. The costing of education is based on the assumption that "quality education" requires the current wasteful, racially differentiated spending that is at the centre of the NP's current practice. The authors consequently argue that South Africa cannot hope to achieve quality education for all. In the long run, a national education budget of R23 billion should suffice, provided the funds are used equally on all pupils and the inefficiencies involved in 19 education departments and bloated bureaucracy are eliminated. The NP seems to think that South Africa cannot accomplish what virtually all other countries with similar levels of economic development have achieved. When it comes to adult education, the sheer ignorance of the authors leads them to make an alarming array of unfounded assumptions. Just one example: The guesstimate suggests that South Africans who cannot read and write have had no schooling whatsoever. Even if that were the case it is a ridiculous assumption to make that because a child requires at least four years of education to be considered literate, and adult required the same time frame to reach the same level. No amount of scare-mongering can conceal the bitter, yet incontrovertible truth that the NPs policies, past and present, have wrought havoc on this country. By its constant red-baiting the NP tries to imply that the ANC's policies are inspired by communism. All fair-minded people know they are not. Our policies are inspired by common sense. The common sense that tells us that in the absence of an effort to address the basic needs of our people there can be no stability. And that without stability there will be no economic growth. The ANC is convinced that our plan is realisable, workable and affordable. What South Africa cannot afford is one day more of the NP's misrule, economic mismanagement and continuing corruption. The ANC challenges the NP to come forward with its plan. We shall not hold our breaths in expectation because the NP has more than amply demonstrated its intellectual poverty. The NP campaign, run by a party with no ideas of its own to offer, much in the manner of a lazy schoolboy, has been content to literally crib and copy the ANC's campaign down to our very slogans. Perhaps we do however have this one consolation: "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery".
