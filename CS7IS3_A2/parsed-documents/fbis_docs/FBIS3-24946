Reddy to the ANC's list of candidates to the National Assembly. A mass meeting in Durban, called by the Natal Indian Congress to explain the reasons behind the nomination, failed to convince the ANC supporters. They demanded that Dr. Reddy and former Natal MEC [Member Executive Committee], D.S. Rajah, be removed from the list on the grounds that they had been part of an oppressive system that had played no role in making life better for the masses. Dr. Reddy will make an announcement on his nomination today.
