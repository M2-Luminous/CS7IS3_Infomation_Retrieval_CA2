The minister also decided to appoint two deputies to the director of Asyut security to facilitate the issuance and following up of decisions. The decision falls within the context of the security strategy pursued by the Interior Ministry in view of the geographical terrain and social nature of Asyut Governorate. The interior minister's decision also took care to bolster the Asyut security directorate with a group of highly trained officers to meet current security needs. Minister al-Alfi met earlier today with the new commands that have moved to Asyut Governorate and instructed them on security operations there. The minister also issued a decision to set up four public directorates in the prison authority and to upgrade the latter into a department. These directorates have been bolstered by commanding officers who enjoy a high level of security performance.
