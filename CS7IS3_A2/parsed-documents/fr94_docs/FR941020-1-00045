FR941020-1-00045 FR941020-1-00013 IV. Impact Analysis Executive Order 12866 Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that the regulations are consistent with these priorities and principles. This NPRM will not result in more costs because the increased funding to Indian tribes and ITOs will come from the change in the allotment formula. Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. Ch. 5), the Department tries to anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperwork requirements on small businesses. For each rule with a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities'' an analysis is prepared describing the rule's impact on small entities. Small entities are defined in the Act to include small businesses and small non-profit organizations. This regulation would affect States and Indian tribes, which are not ``small entities'' within the meaning of the Act. For these reasons, the Secretary certifies that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96&hyph;511, all Departments are required to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval any reporting or recordkeeping requirements in a proposed or final rule. This NPRM contains no reporting or recordkeeping requirements. Therefore no submission to OMB is required.

Section 1357.40 is amended by revising paragraph (a) and by adding paragraph (g)(6) to read as follows: ยง1357.40 Direct payments to Indian Tribal Organizations (title IV&hyph;B, subpart 1, child welfare services). (a) Who may apply for direct funding? Any Indian Tribal Organization (ITO) that meets the definitions in section 428(c) of the Act, or any consortium or other group of eligible tribal organizations authorized by the membership of the tribes to act for them, is eligible to apply for direct funding if the ITO, consortium or group has a plan for child welfare services that is jointly developed by the ITO and the Department. * * * * * (g) Grants: General. * * * * * (6) In order to determine the amount of Federal funds available for a direct grant to an eligible ITO, the Department shall first divide the State's title IV&hyph;B allotment by the number of children in the State, then multiply the resulting amount by a multiplication factor determined by the Secretary, and then multiply that amount by the number of Indian children in the ITO population. The multiplication factor will be set at a level designed to achieve the purposes of the Act and revised as appropriate.
