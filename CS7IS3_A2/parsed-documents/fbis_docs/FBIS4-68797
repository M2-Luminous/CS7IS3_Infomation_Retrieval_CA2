That is how one might describe the main idea of the three significant assemblies of political leaders and the public that took place in Moscow on 16, 17, and 18 April. The strengthening of the position of the Union of Officers explains not only its congress but also the direct participation in the congress of the Russian Great Power Party and the constituent conference of the Public Committee for Legality and Popular Rule of many representatives from regional divisions of this organization. The documents and resolutions of the congresses earmark actively influencing the political life of Russia, and the Declaration of the Public Committee discusses the need to protect the rights of citizens of Russia from any forms of violence and discrimination. The leader of the Union of Officers, Stanislav Terekhov, was elected chairman of the Russian Great Power Party. The Public Committee for Legality and Popular Rule was headed by State Duma Deputy Yuriy Vlasov. Participating in the work of the congresses and conferences were S. Baburin, V. Ilyukhin, V. Isakov, E. Volodin, and a number of key politicians of the Russian opposition movement.
