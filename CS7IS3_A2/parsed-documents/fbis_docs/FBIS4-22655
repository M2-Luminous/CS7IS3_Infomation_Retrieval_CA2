Yu. Meshkov: `Easy, Gentlemen, Easy!'"] [Text] "If you happen to have been born in the Empire, it is best to live in a remote province on the sea." These lines from the poem by I. Brodskiy can no longer (or for now) apply to the residents of the Crimea. The former recreation zone of the great empire has been transformed into a disputed zone and, unexpectedly, with no prior indication, has acquired its own constitution, parliament, and president. People are not being shot here; things have become even quieter. But what will happen tomorrow depends on too many factors and above all whether Ukraine and Russia will continue to move further and further away from one another. Today we are speaking with the president of the Republic of Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov. He was born in 1945. His father is a Don Cossack, his mother--a Ukrainian, and his wife--a Russian. He has a daughter 23 and a son 13. He served in the border guards, graduated from the law department of Moscow State University, and has worked as a sailor, an investigator, and a lawyer. [Uglanov] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, in Kiev they call you a separatist. Does that offend you? [Meshkov] The only people in Kiev who call me a separatist are representatives of the Ukrainian Nationalist Party. (Their influence is rated at 0.3 percent.) The rest of the residents support our goals--solving crucial economic problems. If the Ukrainian government were also interested in improving the life of the people, it would never have proceeded toward isolation from Russia. From an economic standpoint that was suicide. But the government came to power relying on nationalistic structures, and now the sad result of the ill-considered economic policy of the Ukrainian leaders is so apparent that one might say that the question of its fate has already been decided. Unfortunately the government of Ukraine is still not accepting the changes in the consciousness of the people of Ukraine. Especially in the left-bank, eastern part of the country where nationalism has always been something alien to the people. [Uglanov] Your sharp statements are evoking a fairly painful reaction from Kiev. Are you not afraid that they will arrest you? [Meshkov] Since the time when I was serving on the border I have stopped fearing anything in this world except for the loss of my loved ones. Everything else is unessential when there is a grand purpose for which it is worthwhile to do something personal. This is not the ranting of a fanatic. This is about our republic's freedom. [Uglanov] Can you imagine the Crimea as a zone of military operations? [Meshkov] No. There are no forces inside the Crimea capable of provoking a conflict and there are no preconditions for one. And we have an aversion to anything that detracts from solving crucial problems. And in general Crimeans are preparing for the beginning of the vacation season. [Uglanov] Not everything depends on you alone. What political changes, in your view, must take place in Kiev in order for the Crimea not to become a "hot spot"? [Meshkov] Reasonable people must come to power. But now the people in power are accomplished politicians, virtuosos. While professing one ideology, they rely on forces which they previously destroyed, although they helped them to get in power. There has probably never been more of this in world history. You cannot deny that these politicians have intelligence, trickiness, and treachery. Today we must have people in power who reflect the objective interests of the citizens and the economy of Ukraine. We will have no problems with them. It is clear that both before and after 1954 the people of the Crimea remained a part of the people of Russia. You can write whatever you want to on the map of the Crimea and depict it with any symbols, and you can even stamp it with a trident--but that will change nothing in our consciousness! [Uglanov] How do you envision the future of Ukraine? [Meshkov] Reasonable people have one path. Either all of Ukraine will follow the path of the Crimea or they will be doomed to even greater troubles than they have now. As they say here, they are "sick of everything"--the orgy of nationalism and the waving of flags and tridents. This is no longer accepted. [Uglanov] Whom would you like to see in the post of president of Ukraine; whom would it be easiest for you to talk to? [Meshkov] In general I find it easiest to speak with the leaders of Russia. [Uglanov] As president of the Crimea are you counting on support from the Black Sea Fleet in the event of a critical situation? [Meshkov] I such situations an immense number of people gather in front of your building. And this is taken into account in Kiev. [Uglanov] You just reacted very sharply to the appointment from Kiev of a Crimean deputy. But in all Russian oblasts there are representatives of the president of the Russian Federation, and nothing is said. [Meshkov] In the oblasts, but not in the republics. Tatarstan, for example, has its own president and an agreement has been concluded with Russia for division of authority. But what is happening here? When there is a nationally elected president, suddenly there appears an individual authorized to oversee his actions and "represent the Republic of Crimea at the international level"(!) That is going too far. [Uglanov] I see that you have portraits hanging in your office... [Meshkov] Yes, that is Peter the First and Count Vorontsov. [Uglanov] Well, that is probably enough about politics. As the chief of the executive power, answer a good old question: How is the planting going? Or is there no time for it what with all the rallies? [Meshkov] I must answer joyfully. The planting has been more than successful. There was a difficult situation with fuel, equipment, and seeds. They rushed around the fields trying to solve these problems. Now I am calm: The problem of the harvest was solved in the stage of planting. [Uglanov] But there is a fuel shortage in Ukraine. [Meshkov] This is true. But we have no problems with fuel, and its price has dropped by almost half. Measures of an economic nature have been taken. So people may come to the Crimea with their own vehicles--there will be no problem refueling. If, of course, they manage to get across Ukraine. [Uglanov] And what about food products? [Meshkov] Help yourself--we have it all: to drink and to eat. Incidentally, we are negotiating with the Russian Ministry of Railways to reduce summer fares and railroad tickets. So if you buy a ticket and put down enough rubles to meet Russian standards, your capital will increase 20-fold here and your level of vacation will be tops. Unfortunately, there might be only one peaceful place for Russians to rest--the Crimea. Normal, Russian, homey. With doors open wide, the Crimeans receive vacationers with any kind of purses. [Uglanov] Is Foros also open to guests? [Meshkov] M.S. Gorbachev's dacha is being protected (for no good reason) by L. Kravchuk's personal guard. We will do everything we can to open up this historic place. [Uglanov] They say you are experiencing friction with Prime Minister Ye. Saburov. [Meshkov] Yes, everything is normal. That is one of the tasks of the special services--to create an uneasy situation. At certain stages they are successful. But on the whole we are working together.
