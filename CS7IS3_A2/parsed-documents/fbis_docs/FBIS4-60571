Following the proclamation of secession in the early hours last Saturday [21 May], reports said that members of the YSP Political Bureau and the Central Committee have been under house arrest. Unconfirmed reports say that a number of those members -- particularly the ministers or members of the House of Representatives -- have been killed. Political observers noted that following the declaration of secession, Aden Radio did not broadcast a congratulatory cable to al-Bid from [former defense minister] Haytham Qasim, but broadcast Haytham's letter to soldiers and officers on 'Id al-Adha. The observers interpreted this as an indication that differences have surfaced between al-Bid and Haytham. This, they added, was what prompted al-Bid to leave for al-Mukalla after 'Adnan [not further identified] helped him gain control of Aden and the radio so that al-Bid could broadcast the secession statement from Aden radio in his own voice. The observers noted that the formation of what al-Bid called the presidential council includes names that do not exist in Aden. Consequently, such a body can never hold a session. Al-Bid's thirst for the title of president was behind the issuance of the first order appointing al-Bid as the president. He did not even find an adviser or legal scholar to draft a decision based on any constitutional or legal law. Political analysts said anybody who has followed the reports broadcast over Aden radio since the declaration of secession will find that the newscasts have not included, over the past three days, any statements of support even from the YSP bodies to which al-Bid is affiliated. The Aden radio newscasts also show that only four people support al-Bid: Salim Jubran in al-Mukalla, Shaykh Hani (?al-Hadshi) and [name indistinct] in Aden, and a fourth person residing abroad. The analysts added that al-Bid's choice of 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri to be his deputy shows that the two men have agreed to return the rule of shaykhdoms and sultanates to the southern and eastern governorates so that Aden will become the capital of the shaykhdoms while Hadhramaut will be the lot of [former prime minister] Haydar al-'Attas, who was the only person who assumed a leading position in the YSP despite his affiliation with a sultanate dynasty. He is also known for his affiliation with the [words indistinct] the Hadhramaut Governorate. The return to the rule of sultanates will allow al-Bid, al-'Attas, and Bin-Husaynun to impose full control over the Hadhramaut oil after ridding themselves of the rest of the group, which is linked, through marriage, with the families of these three persons. The political analysts believe that al-Bid's appointment of (?Bin-Suraynah) as Shabwah governor is evidence of this. The political analysts ruled out the achievement of any of these goals because the way al-Bid and the separatist clique have acted has deprived them of any credibility, particularly before the sons of the southern and eastern governorates. The secession statement showed them to be a group of agents for an external party which has used them over the past four years to tarnish the image of Yemeni unity abroad and to undermine it locally through the crises and riots which they engineered. The task of the forces of constitutional legitimacy, unity, and democracy now receives Arab and international sympathy and support.
