An electric fan will suck in polluted air from the road level through a two- to three-meter-wide vent, which leads the air about one meter underground. Once there, the air passes through four layers of so-called ``geotextile,'' a filter-like fabric that absorbs the cancer-causing diesel exhaust particles (dep). Earth bacteria will deplete the remaining nitrooxides into harmless nitrogen and oxygen, both air components, when the air penetrates through the soil on its way back to the surface. The prefecture has earmarked 40 million yen for the pilot project in its budget for fiscal 1994, which starts 1 April. The system will be set up at a road with a traffic volume of more than 20,000 vehicles per day, the officials said. Despite some success in reducing greenhouse gases, including nitrooxides, thanks to the broad use of catalyzer cars, eight of 105 survey stations in Osaka have said they will not be able to reach nitrodioxide targets of below 0.06 ppm (parts per million) by the turn of the century.
