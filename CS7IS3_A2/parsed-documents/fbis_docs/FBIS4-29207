"The Japanese economy now stands at the crossroads," the Industrial Structure Council said in a report, citing such problems as the rapid aging of the population, the lingering current account imbalance and the "excessive" strength of the yen. The report urged the government to formulate a reform program by effectively combining three types of steps -- macroeconomic restructuring measures like social infrastructure improvement, microeconomic reforms such as deregulation and narrowing of the price gap between Japan and other countries, and overhauling the industrial structure for new business creation. The advisory body to the minister of international trade and industry said the government's failure to carry out these measures would deprive the Japanese economy of "industrial vitality" toward the next century, promote "industrial hollowing" and eventually degrade the overall life standard of the Japanese people. "The report is not merely a collection of recommendations that simply depict a vision of Japan's future economy," a ministry official said. "But it reflects a strong sense of crisis among council members about the future course of the Japanese economy," the official said. The council cited 12 industrial sectors as having growth potential toward the 21st century. They are housing-related services, medical and welfare services, culture, urban development, environmental improvement, energy, distribution, new manufacturing technology, labor services, business support, information and communications, and cultural services involved in Japan's internationalization. The proposed reform steps would help create a substantial amount of new business opportunities in Japan, with the market size of such business growing to 210 trillion yen in 2000 from the current 130 trillion yen in the 12 sectors combined. The council also said the reforms would produce 2.5 million new jobs by 2000. If large-scale industrial restructuring is carried out, the Japanese economy could achieve an annual growth rate of more than 3 percent by the turn of the century, the report said. It also said Japan's manpower structure would undergo big changes under the proposed economic reform. The proportion of workers in services and livelihood-related sectors would increase while those in distribution and transportation would drop, for example, the report said. Without the proposed reforms, Japan's economic growth would slow to an annual average of 1.6 percent during 1992-2000 and an average 1.2 percent during 2000-2010, the report said. The council said Japan should propose industrial policy coordination among developed countries as a way to spur new business creation, a step that may present solutions for global unemployment. The issue of trade and labor standards should be addressed in a manner that would enable free trade to be pursued in developing countries while upgrading labor conditions there, the report said.
