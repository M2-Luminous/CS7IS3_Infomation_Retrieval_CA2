But the "Russia's Choice" territorial bloc, which calls itself "Don's Choice" here, has very strongly protested the Statutes on Elections to the Legislative Assembly, approved by an oblast inner soviet decision. In the first place, State Duma deputy B. Titenko and other members of the bloc's regional political council stressed at a press conference, the inner soviet "adopted" this document after the new Russian Constitition depriving the old structure of its last juridical rights and powers had come into effect. According to the political council, the situation is not remedied by the "invitation to representatives of parties and movements," which was essentially a variation on "nationwide discussion." The Soviet's decision and confirmation followed as before. The blatant breach of the principle of separation of powers, since the "statutes," even at local level, do not allow a deputy's duties to be combined with work in the executive organs of power, is described as the second flaw.
