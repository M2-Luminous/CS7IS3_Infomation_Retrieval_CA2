It was reported that the United States has already begun to hand some weapons and equipment over to the ROK Army. The U.S. media has particularly stressed the aggravation of the military situation on the Korean peninsula since October 1993, when the United States and North Korea continued to hold contacts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Reporting this, the U.S. media mainly quoted high-ranking officials of the U.S. Department of Defense. The U.S. State Department, which is in charge of contacts with North Korea, has been busy rather controlling the public heat caused by those reports on aggravated tensions that spread like wildfire. Watching this, our people suspected that the U.S. munitions industry has an aim to let the ROK purchase its weapons, taking advantage of the tense situation on the Korean peninsula, and that the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. media are helping facilitate the realization of this aim. They harbored this suspicion although they had experienced a fratricidal war, and though they were well aware of the significance of the words, "Forewarned, forearmed." Our people, who want the North Korean nuclear issue to be resolved in a peaceful way, were vexed by reports carried in January on the U.S. plan to dispatch a national intelligence team to the ROK and to deploy Patriot missiles and updated Apache helicopters to U.S. forces in the ROK. This is because they know that the reinforcement of the ROK-based U.S. forces may further agitate North Korea, which is demanding that the United States and the ROK suspend the Team Spirit exercise to resolve the nuclear issue. The government showed a lukewarm attitude at that time toward the plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK-based U.S. forces because it was aware of the people's anxiety. The situation, however, has changed. The International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities ended in dissatisfaction, and the North Korean nuclear issue has been referred to the UN Security Council. Moreover, the North Korean chief delegate to South-North working-level contacts made remarks such as "no hesitation in bringing about war" and "sea of fire," agitating the people. U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry said in a news conference held on 25 March: "The reinforcement of the ROK Army is a matter of the United States' primary concern." He added: "The United States will recommend the ROK Army be equipped with gun-locating radar, Apache attack helicopters, and precision weapons for destroying guided tanks. Gary Luck, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, and the ROK Army are now holding intensive discussions on this matter." Of course, I think, his statement was made not only because of the North Korean delegate's remark. Secretary Perry also said that the Patriot missiles in question will be deployed to the ROK within a month. He explained that the United States originally planned to deploy the missiles in the second half of this year as a part of a long-term project of modernizing the Army, but it has decided to advance the date, regarding this as a prudent preventive measure. The Patriot missile is one of the updated weapons that the United States strongly "recommends" the ROK to purchase. We are well aware that the United States is greatly concerned about North Korea's reaction to be shown in case the United Nations decides to apply sanctions against it since North Korea has stated that it would regard any sanction as a provocation. As Secretary Perry said, however, there is no military crisis between the ROK-United States and North Korea. We are not under an emergency situation, in which a military crisis is likely to come soon, either. It is necessary, however, for the ROK and the United States to maintain an iron-tight defense posture in preparation for an emergency. On the other hand, the two countries should also continue to make efforts to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. The United States should not force the ROK to purchase attack weapons, taking advantage of the tensions between South and North Korea.
