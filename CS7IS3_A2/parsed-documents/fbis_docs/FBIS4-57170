This seventh mandate began on 10 January 1993, when the Municipal Assemblies of the People's Government were installed. Days back, the president of Cuba's parliament, Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, sent a letter to these delegates. The text of this letter explains that this process is spread over a two-month period because of the experience of the preceding year. This will make it possible to schedule meetings in such a way as to permit attendance by the greatest possible number of cadres and officials of the administrative bodies of each place, as well as by delegates to the Provincial Assemblies and by deputies elected by those districts. Alarcon's letter adds that this new progress report process has been conceived as a continuation of the effort increasingly to improve the method of tightening relations between delegates and their voters, and so as to explain the need to provide concrete and essential operational information to the people on the current situation and how to face it. Alarcon also calls for the people's participation in the effort to face the current situation and to support the measures that may be adopted in the quest for solutions. Alarcon's letter concludes by saying that the meetings will follow the special sessions of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] and that we must do everything possible so that these meetings will help enhance the people's understanding of the need to take the necessary steps to streamline internal finances and to promote economic efficiency. Everything seems to indicate that delegates and deputies from each municipality and province will have the appropriate scenario to promote these contacts with the voters of each district so that the progress reports will no longer be the classic rendering of accounts, which are often mechanical and tiresome, but a collective action of exchange of opinions, explanations, arguments, and information about the solutions found for current problems, and so as to resume the talks on agreements and declarations by the ANPP in its 1 and 2 May sessions. The people in general will be able to support once again the announced proposals for internal economic and financial adjustment measures conceived as the most important steps taken over the past few years to maintain this process of social equity.
