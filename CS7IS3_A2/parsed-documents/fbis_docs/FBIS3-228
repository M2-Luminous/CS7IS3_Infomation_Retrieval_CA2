"By frustrating the housing process rather than encouraging it, my impression is that the forum has now yielded completely to political influences which sole purpose is to delay the delivery of housing until after the election for political gain," Mr Shill said in a statement. Discussions with mortgage lending organisations were far advanced and it would be "sad" if the forum should try to impede progress in this regard. He was reacting to NHF criticism that the announcement was unilateral, premature and jeopardised a resolution on the housing crisis. Mr Shill pointed out that the scheme had been negotiated with housing role players for about a year and that it had been recommended by the fully representative National Housing Board. "The government has not been premature in announcing the scheme. If anything, we stand accused of allowing the NHF of delaying the process for too long." [as received] The NHF had literally since its inception delayed the discussions on the grant scheme, he said. "The suggestion that we have to delay the process -- which in fact means that the regional housing boards cannot proceed with their task until the administrative arrangements have been approved by the forum -- is preposterous. This decision was based on lengthy discussions and expert advice. Any accusations of premature and unilateral action is based on a frustration of not being able to delay matters any further." Citing examples, Mr Shill said in March last year the NHF declared December 1993 as their target date for resolving the subsidy policy but the body did not start discussions until September 1993 despite requests by him. It was then agreed by the Department of National Housing and the NHF that the target date for finalising the subsidy policy would be November 1993, but through further delays documentation was only agreed upon on December 14 1993, after which it was submitted to the National Housing Board for advice. "The National Housing Board recommended that the minister (Mr Shill) proceed with the scheme but at this late stage the NHF insisted on further changes and wanted to refer the matter to their plenary meeting on March 14, 1994." He was happy to discuss housing matters with the forum but the decision to proceed with the scheme and when to announce it remained his responsibility, Mr Shill said.
