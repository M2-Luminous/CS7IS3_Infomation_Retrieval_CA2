Probably few people have noticed it. However the government has taken the opportunity to issue a report on Denmark's economic cooperation in the European Union (EU). According to the preface by the economic affairs minister, it should also serve as a starting point for the campaign prior to the European Parliament elections in June. The report says that adjusting the economy to the strict requirements in phase two is going well. This phase is the last before the planned freeze of exchange rates and the introduction of a common currency. In other words, phrase three, where Denmark has slammed on the brakes. There is reason to ask why it is so essential to follow the process to the halfway point. Is the lesson from the monetary policy events in 1992 and 1993 beginning to sink in or does this indicate distaste for the prospect of a somewhat higher interest level in this country in relation to the core of the European and Monetary Union (EMU)? Phase two, which is now under way, is a transition stage with respect to monetary cooperation. Monetary and economic stability must be ensured before the irrevocable step of freezing exchange rates and establishing a joint currency is taken. That is the logical aim of the substance of the transition phase. Economic policy cooperation is expanded in phase two, among other things through the so-called convergence programs, which are updated continually. About 10 days ago the government delivered the Danish convergence program to the EU Commission. The convergence programs are intended to demonstrate that the individual countries are moving their economic policies toward the goals that are necessary in order to reach phase three, and this is evaluated primarily on the basis of the degree of price stability, the public budget deficit, long-term interest rates, and exchange rate fluctuations in relation to the old European Monetary System (EMS) margin. In the government's opinion this will not cause big problems where Denmark is concerned, as long as a number of economic factors also develop as expected, of course. Here the assumption of a growth of 0.5 percent in public consumption starting next year is an especially interesting test of credibility. A more basic question, however, is what the government intends to do if the test is passed. The second phase is meant to involve a gradual merger with phase three's assurance of monetary stability and lower interest rates. By the very nature of the case this outcome will apply only to the participants and thus not to Denmark. It seems a little strange that a question was raised a few days ago about reestablishing the old EMS cooperation when the new report says that returning to the situation that existed before 2 August 1993 will hardly be possible.
