According to the law of Latvia's international agreements, accords on foreign armed forces' presence and their status in the territory of Latvia can be signed only in the form of interstate agreements and only the Saeima has rights to determine if they can be signed or not, said Grinblats. The Latvia's law of international agreements is also violated by initialing the agreement on Skrunda radar station's legal status during its further functioning and dismantling, because the agreement does not provide for its ratification at the Saeima, say the faction members. Grinblats said that it contradicts with the above mentioned law and the Cabinet's earlier promises that all agreements, drafted during the Latvian-Russian talks, would be handed in to the Saeima for ratification. The faction demands that Cabinet respected Latvia's legislation and did not sign interstate agreements with Russia. The faction also appealed to the government to hand the initialled agreements in to the Saeima for taking further decisions.
