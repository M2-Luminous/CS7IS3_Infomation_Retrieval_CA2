We are very glad that the persons in charge of the Finance Ministry and the State General Administration of Taxation [SGAT] are attending this news conference at our invitation. They will answer your questions on the reform of China's fiscal and taxation systems. Those present here are Mr. Liu Zhongli, finance minister and SGAT director; Mr. Jin Xin, SGAT deputy director; and Mr. Xiang Huaicheng, vice finance minister. [Liu] To save time, we will dispense with opening remarks. Your questions will be welcome, and we are willing to answer them. [Liu Shaobo] I am Liu Shaobo from the Central Television Network, and I have a question for Minister Liu. The 30 billion yuan treasury bond issue did not go very smoothly last year, and this year's issue will exceed 100 billion yuan. What measures will you take to ensure its smooth issue this year, and will it be apportioned? [Liu] In issuing the 30 billion yuan of treasury bonds, we did indeed encounter some difficulties for a while. This was because the financial situation and financial order were poor last year. There were many unauthorized loans and instances of the illegal raising of capital funds, which diverted funds from legitimate uses to unnecessary purposes and which caused an irrational flow of funds. The situation improved soon after the State Council rectified the financial order, and the treasury bonds were in fact successfully issued by June or July of last year. The situation this year is different from last year, and our financial order has improved. At the same time, we will offer a preferential interest rate on treasury bonds and improve the methods of their issue. We will cooperate more closely with financial institutions this year. We will adopt international practices and gradually establish a system of first-class agents, and the bonds will be sold openly at second-class markets. We will also provide as many conveniences as possible to bond buyers so that people can buy and cash their bonds anytime they want. Judging from the size of the issue and our current financial situation, I believe that the issue will go smoothly and will win the people's support. [Unidentified correspondent] I am a Hong Kong reporter and have a question for Minister Liu. According to estimates, China will reach a peak period of servicing its foreign debts. To my knowledge, China's foreign debts in the first half of 1993 totaled $74 billion, while they were $69 billion in 1992. Will you tell us about China's current foreign debt situation, and can you give us some examples? What measures will the state take to service its foreign debts? [Liu] At present, China's foreign debt ratio stands at around 90 percent and its debt service ratio at 7.6 percent. According to international standards, the warning levels for debt ratio and debt service ratio are set at 100 percent and 15 percent, respectively. Our 7.6-percent debt service ratio is far below the international warning level. So, I don't think we have any big problem concerning our foreign debt. In addition, since we started opening to the outside world and using foreign funds, our credit rating has always been good. [Unidentified foreign correspondent in English, fading into Mandarin translation] I am from the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST. I have a question about the budget law that was submitted to the NPC yesterday. According to a plan to revise the law, China shall maintain a balance between its domestic budget [guo nei yu suan] and its external budget [guo wai yu suan]. If the deficit goes beyond its ceiling, will you, as the finance minister, be held accountable? [Liu] There are two parts to the budget law. One part says that no deficit is permitted for the routine, public portion of the central budget. A deficit, in the form of a bond issue, is permitted, to meet the needs of national construction projects. The law stipulates that the size and structure of the debt incurred from the bond issue must be rational. In other words, it must be within our solvency. At the same time, the law also stipulates that whoever violates the deficit ceiling and borrows more than an authorized amount of debt shall be held legally liable. So, if the deficit and the debts exceed the NPC-approved figures, the finance minister should of course be held accountable. If something unforeseeable, such as an extraordinary natural disaster, happens during the course of executing the budget, we may readjust the budget with the approval of the NPC Standing Committee. Then our responsibility will be assessed according to the adjusted amount of the budget. [Unidentified correspondent] I am from ZHONGGUO RIBAO and I have a question for Vice Minister Xiang. The promulgation of the tax assignment system [fen shui zhi] has caused more reactions in the central and western regions, particularly the old revolutionary base areas, ethnic minority regions, border regions, and poor regions, than in other parts of the country. They are worried that they might lose the preferential treatment and financial subsidies that they currently enjoy. Are their fears warranted? [Xiang] Their fears are unwarranted. First, after the new system takes effect, the old distribution pattern will remain unchanged. Some provinces in the western region which receive central financial subsidies will continue to receive them, with the amounts not being changed. Second, existing preferential policies will remain valid if they are the basis for the base figures of local revenues and expenditures. Third, after the tax assignment system takes effect and the central revenues gradually increase over the next several years, we will formulate procedures for spending transfers according to international practices. Then, the regions encountering difficulties and ethnic minority regions in the western part of our country will be the first to enjoy the benefits of the procedures. For this reason, if I represent the western region, I would be the first to approve of the tax assignment system. [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with XINHUA. I heard that Minister Liu will leave for the United States tomorrow to attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] meeting of finance ministers. I would like to know what the meeting's discussions will focus on and whether the issue of the trade deficit between China and the United States will be discussed at your talks with the U.S. treasury secretary. Thank you. [Liu] After consultations, it has been decided that the Asian-Pacific regional finance ministers meeting will be held in Hawaii on 18 to 19 March. The meeting will be a formal meeting of the finance ministers of Asian-Pacific countries. The primary goal of the meeting is to provide an opportunity for the finance ministers of the APEC member states to exchange views and opinions on regional issues of common concern to enhance mutual understanding. The main topic of the meeting is to discuss the strategy of macroeconomic growth, international financial issues, and building a domestic financial market -- a capital market. The meeting will be a multilateral forum, and thus it will not discuss bilateral issues. Therefore, China and the United States also will not discuss bilateral issues. [(Li Gao]) I am reporter (Li Gao) of GONG SHANG SHI BAO. I would like to ask Minister Liu a question, that is, will the implementation of the system of sharing tax revenues between the central and local authorities affect the economic growth of some economically developed provinces in the coastal region? [Liu] It should not and will not have any impact because the results of January and February have already proved this. This is especially true when it comes to the kind of tax called the value-added tax, which everyone and all localities are most concerned about. We have adopted a sharing system for value-added taxes, so they are actually shared taxes -- that is, after a locality's economy is developed, both the central and local authorities will benefit, and whoever develops faster will benefit more. Therefore, there will not be any impact. [Unidentified correspondent in English, fading into Mandarin translation] I would like to know what is the interest rate of your treasury bonds. The inflation rate in cities is about 20 percent, while your risk rate [as heard] is only about 13 percent. How can this encourage city residents to purchase treasury bonds? [Liu] I think that our goal this year is to keep the inflation rate at 10 percent. We are working on this. If it is 10 percent, then the (?annual interest rate of our three-year) treasury bonds, which is 13.96 percent, is a positive rate. Second, when we announced the interest rate for treasury bonds last year, we said that treasury bonds were meant to hold their value. If for some reason the inflation rate goes out of control, then [words indistinct] will still have to purchase [words indistinct]. Now that everyone understands the policy, I hope that everyone will enthusiastically purchase [treasury bonds]. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Minister, if your draft budget is approved by the NPC, it will be implemented as of 1 January 1995, which is only two and a half years from when Hong Kong reverts to China. Your draft Budget Law stipulates that localities are not allowed to permit deficits, and the Hong Kong Basic Law also stipulates that Hong Kong is not allowed to permit a deficit. But, Hong Kong's finance department has estimated that as of 1 January 1997, during the 1997-98 fiscal year, the money, including the land fund and financial surplus, left to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] by the British Hong Kong Government will be around 270 billion Hong Kong dollars. As a financial expert, do you think it is financially reasonable to leave more than 200 billion Hong Kong dollars idle and not be allowed to spend it? [Liu] Hong Kong is an SAR. It has its own Basic Law, and it should do things according to the Basic Law. There is a special clause in the Basic Law that concerns financial problems. Therefore, things should be done according to the Basic Law. The central government will not seek financial help from Hong Kong. I will not discuss this issue in detail with you, but there is one thing -- that is, the current Chinese Government has taken the Hong Kong people's long-term interests into consideration.
