ACTION: Proposed form amendments. SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is proposing amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4, which is the form that associated persons of financial institutions that are government securities brokers and dealers are required to file with such financial institutions, pursuant to sections 15C(b)(1)(B) and (b)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;5(b)(1)(B) and(b)(4)) and sections 400.4 and 449.3 of the regulations issued under the Government Securities Act of 1986 (``GSA''). 1 The amendments would update the disciplinary background provisions of the form to reflect amendments to the federal securities laws, and would provide the financial institutions of the associated persons and the appropriate regulatory authorities for the financial institutions with more useful information. 1 Pub.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background and Analysis The Department adopted Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 (Disclosure Form for Person Associated with a Financial Institution Government Securities Broker or Dealer) in the implementing regulations for the GSA issued on July 24, 1987 (52 FR 27910). Sections 400.4 and 449.3 2 of the GSA regulations require the form to be used by associated persons of financial institutions that are government securities brokers and dealers to provide the financial institution and the appropriate regulatory agency with certain information concerning employment, residence and statutory disqualification. Under the GSA regulations, associated persons that have a current Form U&hyph;4 (Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer) or Form MSD&hyph;4 (Uniform Application for Municipal Securities Principal or Municipal Securities Representative Associated with a Bank Municipal Securities Dealer) on file with their financial institution are not required to file Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4. Associated persons are not required to file G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 forms with their financial institutions that are exempt from filing notice as government securities brokers or dealers pursuant to part 401 of the GSA regulations. 2 17 CFR 400.4 and 17 CFR 449.3, respectively. The proposed changes to the body of Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 relate to Item 17, which requests information concerning the disciplinary history of the associated person. The changes are being made to reflect amendments to the Exchange Act by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (``Remedies Act'') 3 and the International Securities Enforcement Cooperation Act of 1990 (``ISECA''). 4 The Remedies Act gave the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') the authority to seek civil monetary penalties in court proceedings and to impose monetary penalties and order disgorgement in administrative proceedings. The Remedies Act also provided the SEC with both temporary and permanent cease and desist order authority to prevent violations of securities laws. The ISECA gave the SEC the authority to bar, suspend or restrict the activities of broker-dealers and the associated persons or those persons seeking to become associated with a broker-dealer, based upon the findings of a foreign court or foreign securities authority. By amending the GSA, the ISECA also gave similar authority to the appropriate regulatory agencies for financial institutions that are government securities brokers or dealers regarding associated persons or those persons seeking to become associated with such entities. 5 The ISECA added a definition of the term ``foreign financial regulatory authority'' to section 3(a) of the Exchange Act, 6 and provided that certain types of actions taken by foreign financial regulatory authorities will be deemed a statutory disqualification. 3 Pub.
