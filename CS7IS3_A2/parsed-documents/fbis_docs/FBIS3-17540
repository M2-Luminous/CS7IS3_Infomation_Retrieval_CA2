Their talks will take place on 26 March there and they will become an original Russian debut for the Norwegian minister in his present role. [passage omitted] On the eve of his visit in an exclusive interview with an ITAR- TASS correspondent in Oslo, Bjorn Tore Godal said it was particularly important that the meeting with the Russian foreign minister would take place in Murmansk since Norway attaches great importance to bilateral cooperation not only at state level but at regional level as well. "The program of action with regard to Eastern Europe" drawn up by the Norwegian Government gives priority to the Russian northwestern regions. The increased activity of the council for cooperation in the region of the Barents Sea also opens wide prospects. One should admit that the environmental situation in northern Europe at present is causing well nigh the greatest concern of the Norwegian public since the region is very vulnerable in this sense. The closeness of powerful nuclear arsenal of the ships of the Russian Northern Fleet hardly adds to the optimism of the Norwegians as regards ensuring ecological safety. The fact of Russian military presence at NATO's northern flank is an objective reality. In this connection the Norwegians pin great hopes on establishing the spirit of openness and partnership in relations between the East and the West in the military and political sphere. The readiness to join the Partnership for Peace program announced by Russia and the current joint exercises in the Barents Sea with the "Pomor" code name give evidence to the fact that these expectations are justified. The real contents and expanding range of the Russian-Norwegian cooperation predetermine the intensity of personal contacts between the foreign ministers of the two countries. One can have no doubts: the Murmansk meeting will be followed by other meetings. The more successful the present start in Murmansk is, the more often these meetings will be.
