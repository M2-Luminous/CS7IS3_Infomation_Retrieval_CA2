In other words, we will trade our products, mostly agricultural goods, for weapons. Formerly, the armed forces were allowed to make purchases of weapons, planes, and military hardware through the Defense Ministry and government. [passage omitted] As feedback from the military top brass, the commanders of the three armed forces voiced their discontent over this new policy during a meeting chaired by Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari. They said that the barter of crops for weapons will be a very complicated and time consuming process and the military have no expertise in trade. They also fear that the weapons or aircraft they receive from bartering with agricultural products will be costly and inapplicable to their requirements. In short, the armed forces feel that they are being pressed by the government. Frankly speaking, if the military top brass or professional soldiers, who have so far been fairly quiet, react against the policy, some will accuse them of trying to rock the boat again. A few might think that politicians are creating conditions for certain objectives. Some even claim that this barter trade policy will also be applied to other big projects such as the elevated electric train system. It is a fact that the armed forces need weapons and war equipment for national defense. However, they must also take the country's financial position into their consideration. They cannot go out and choose whatever they want as in the past. All military equipment is expensive. So they must make sure that the people's tax money is spent wisely. I believe that leaders of the military units are "career soldiers." Their reaction, however, in connection with the arms barter policy does not look good at all. The fact is that they do not understand some details of the policy. The government should be blamed for failing to clearly explain the policy to all concerned. This is Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's style, who always leaves something for others in the ministries concerned to tackle. Prime Minister Chuan should have clarified the new policy for everyone from the beginning. However, he passed the ball to Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak. He is good at making all sorts of comments or criticisms against other people. Ironically, he said very little about this policy. It is possible that he himself does not quite understand it. As a matter of fact, there is nothing difficult about this policy. For example, when a branch of service wants to buy weapons from a foreign country, it must first inform the government. The government will then review trade between Thailand and the country from which they wish to buy the weapons before holding negotiations to see if the country wants any agricultural products from us. We may even bargain to have them buy our crops. The point is that we get their weapons and at the same time sell them our goods. However, it should not be implied that this barter policy will be used with small purchases worth two or three million baht. The government failed to spell out all the details of the policy, while the military is frustrated in its attempt to get things clearly explained and understood. And reporters are accused of presenting inaccurate reports as if the military top brass and people in government circles could do no wrong.
