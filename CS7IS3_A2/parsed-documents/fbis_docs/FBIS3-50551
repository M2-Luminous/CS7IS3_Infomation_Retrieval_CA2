The leaders said they are seeking to establish socialism in Mexico through an armed struggle for which they have prepared for the past 24 years. Reaching the territory occupied by the EZLN, which made its public appearance on 1 January, is no easy task, because there are several rebel checkpoints manned by Indians who speak Spanish with difficulty and collect a "war tax" of approximately $17 for each media vehicle crossing it. The first EZLN checkpoints are about 25 km from San Cristobal de las Casas on the road to Ocosingo, in northern Chiapas State, which neighbors with Guatemala. At those rebel checkpoints the guerrilla Indians are blocking access to Ocosingo, warning that civilians cannot go there, because EZLN and Mexican Army troops are clashing. The rebels control about 65 km of highway, along which there are several checkpoints, up to the town of Altamirano, which has approximately 15,000 inhabitants. "Eliseo," who is about 20 years old and who wears a ski cap, said that he has been a member of this organization for five years and that it has conducted exercises all over the country. He denied that the EZLN has ties to other armed movements abroad. "It is we Mexicans who organized: there are teachers, peasants, and laborers among our companeros. There are also church people; we are mostly Catholic," Eliseo said when interviewed at the rebel checkpoint in Huistan. "If the government wants negotiation, we will reject it; we want them to leave leadership in the people's hands," he added. Along the road leading to Ocosingo, where fierce clashes are taking place according to various sources, people can be seen fleeing with their belongings on their backs in search of an escape route. The rebels, who are visibly nervous, are closely monitoring every movement in the area, especially vehicles, and are ready to fire. In Oxchuc, which has about 37,000 inhabitants and is also under subversives' control, the residents are quietly complaining about the situation, because they are unable to leave town in public transportation vehicles, because the EZLN has "borrowed" them. Oxchuc resident Ruperto Jimenez said that that town only has enough food for three days and that people fear for their lives if there were Army-rebel clashes. "We are EZLN members in honor of our hero Emiliano Zapata (leader of the 1910 revolution), and we are seeking to impose socialism," said a rebel "captain" stationed in Cuxulja. The rebel, who identified himself as "captain," is about 1.6 meters tall and armed with an AK-47 rifle. He said that his organization was established in the city in 1969 and was later transferred to the mountains, where "we became guerrillas and are now an army." In Altamira the rebels have occupied the square and a hospital run by nuns of the congregation Sisters of Charity, who are taking care of eight men, six rebels, and two policemen injured during combat. Planes and Mexican Air Force helicopters frequently overfly the conflict area.
