It is called "The Remains of the Day." Its subject is policy toward Germany in the run-up to World War II and its "hero" an English lord who has taken it upon himself to counter what he sees as anti-German and warmongering sentiments chiefly in England and France. To achieve this aim he makes his home available for secret talks between delegates from a number of different countries, including Germany. Many fine sounding words about peace and security are spoken, and about the need to help rather than further humiliate Germany. At one particular secret night meeting the noble lord brings together his own country's political leadership and a high-ranking German delegation. On the subject of the Sudetenland the British foreign secretary pronounces the classic sentence about "a distant country about which we know nothing." Naturally the leaders of the Western powers must be persuaded to accept Germany's just demands: all in the interests of peace and security. That was how the Czechs were sacrificed, and what was to ensue is history. People in the countries which feel vulnerable to an increasingly aggressive Russian nationalism are talking more and more about this history. However, as in 1938, there are very few who care about their cry for help. We have to think about the major outlines, about peace and security. Not so long ago we were informed as a result of the work of SVENSKA DAGBLADET's excellent investigative journalist, Mikael Holmstrom, that for some time now there has been a secret group consisting of representatives of a number of Western countries which, under the leadership of Prime Minister Carl Bildt, is trying to find a solution to the problem of Russia's demands on the Baltic republics, chiefly Estonia and Latvia. Last week this secret group succeeded in pressuring the Latvian Government into signing an agreement which -- as in 1938 -- will guarantee peace and stability. The agreement, which is currently being scrutinized by the Latvian parliament, means that Russia undertakes to withdraw all its remaining troops by 31 August at the latest, in return for being allowed to make use of the Skrunda radar installation until the end of the century, and that 35,000 retired officers and their families are granted the right to remain in Latvia, at the expense of the impoverished Latvian Government. This may seem like a major diplomatic victory which demonstrates the superiority of silent diplomacy in sensitive situations. However, this would be to forget two important facts. First, the Skrunda radar installation has none of the strategic value it is claimed to have. The United States, however, has every interest in Russia's not being forced to leave the base. For this could lead to calls for the United States to leave forward bases elsewhere in the world. The Latvian side must, of course, be made to "understand" this and Russia accepts with thanks. Second, the pension issue is hardly a case of humanitarian care for Russian officers who have served their time and who will be able to enjoy the autumn of their lives in Latvia. Many of them are elite soldiers, reserve officers in the 35-40-years-old range who are both armed and have their places of mobilization in the event of war. Their mission is clear. Last spring all the Russian forces in the Baltic held a staff coordination exercise the aim of which was clearly expressed: "to take strategic targets and hold them until the main force arrives." The significance of the agreement the Swedish Government is now seeking to force the Latvian side into signing is thus that an armed fifth column of 35,000 men with arms and a well defined mission to carry out in the event of war is to be allowed to remain in Latvia, and that a major military base there will not be closed for several years yet, perhaps never. It is most understandable that the Latvian side wants to defend itself against such a stab in the back. However, what is totally incomprehensible is that the Swedish Government can be involved in sacrificing Latvia this way to placate Russia. Perhaps our ministers ought to go together to see "The Remains of the Day," perhaps they should recall what happened once Hitler had been appeased with Sudetenland. You do not need to listen to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's threats to realize how precarious the situation is for our Baltic neighbors. On 5 April in Moscow, President Yeltsin signed an "Instruction" with the following wording: ``Concur with a proposal from Russia's Defense Ministry which has reached agreement with Russia's Foreign Ministry; on the establishment on the territory of all member states of the CIS and the Latvian Republic of military bases for the Russian Federation's Armed Forces, with the aim of ensuring the security of the Russian Federation and the above-mentioned states, and of testing new weapons systems and military technology. ``Instruct Russia's Foreign Ministry together with Russia's Defense Ministry and the other ministries and authorities affected to hold talks on this question with the member states of the CIS and the Latvian Republic, and to draft the necessary documents.'' This document is being taken very seriously indeed in Riga. In a reaction Deputy Speaker Andrejs Krastins has spoken of an "escalation," and said that Russia has now begun to "speak out clearly" about its intentions. The Russian side immediately retracted [the instructions] and said that Latvia was included "by mistake." This cat-and-mouse game is typical of Russian policy toward the Baltic states. There have been many similar maneuvers in the past. The game being played by Moscow is as distasteful as it is dangerous. It is late in the day. Sweden must now once and for all make it clear what we think about Russia's ever more aggressive policy toward our Baltic neighbors. Tomorrow it could be too late.
