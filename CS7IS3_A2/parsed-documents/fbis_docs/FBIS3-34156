The government dug several wells, reclaimed 5,000 feddans of land, and set up a number of farms to ensure provisions for the "Yarmuk," "al-Hudaybiyah," and "al-Qadisiyah" camps, where Egyptian, Algerian, Tunisian, and Palestinian terrorists will be trained in addition to some Asian and African nationals. Dr. Usamah Bin-Ladin, who is wanted by the law in several Arab countries, is helping the Sudanese Government to finance these camps. Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir issued a decree -- which was published by the newspaper AL-INQADH on Wednesday, 5 January -- granting 1,550 square meters of residential land to Bin-Ladin's al- Hijrah Company to build its headquarters on. Al-Bashir's decree also transferred the ownership of "al- Mukabarat" agricultural project in the Northern region to Bin-Ladin. Agricultural produce from the project's 20,000 feddans will used to supply the terrorist camps. These camps are being opened in the Northern Region in the wake of the amendment of the Sudanese Citizenship Law.
