In the case of some subjects of the Russian Federation, the agreements with foreign states number already in the dozens, but, very likely, not a single federal department has a complete picture of their international activity today, since these international ties are developing in many respects chaotically, without the proper coordination within the scales of the Federation. The chief reason for the chaotic development is the lack of a corresponding legal base. The only provision that one can be guided by is one of the points of Article 72, which includes "the coordination of international and foreign economic relations of the subjects of the Russian Federation" among the subjects of joint jurisdiction. Consultation of the Federal Agreement allows one to clarify that the subjects of the Russian Federation are "independent participants" of such ties (Article III). The available legislative base is not only scant, but extremely indeterminate, and at times poorly formulated. It gives rise to more perplexed questions than it provides clear answers. What is meant by "international ties?" The authors of the Constitution clearly wanted to underscore that these are not "international relations" that pertain to the jurisdiction of the Federation itself. But in what consists the difference between them? Elucidations in regard to this cannot be found either in the Constitution, or in foreign legislation, or in international law. It must be stated that the key concept of our legal base--"international ties" does not have a concrete juridical content. And what is an "independent participant of international ties?" In relation to whom is it independent? In relation to the Federation? And to what extent is it independent--without any limitations or with limitations? As we see, this concept, too, does not have concrete juridical content, and it is impossible to find its interpretation [rasshifrovka] either in foreign legislation or in international law, since such a term does not exist there. Perhaps, things are still more difficult with respect to "the coordination of international relations." Throughout the world the coordination of the international activity of the subjects of the federation is effected (in various forms) by the federal authorities. Originally (in the Federal Agreement) this is how it was planned in our country, too. But the Constitution for some reason included such coordination in the joint jurisdiction. In practice, this means that coordination of the international relations by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, to put it mildly, is not entirely lawful, since both ministries are not joint organs, but organs of the federal executive authority. De facto there exists at the present time a vast vacuum in the sphere under review--a vacuum that may have serious negative consequences and for this reason should be filled very soon. From a legal standpoint, the best way out of the situation that has developed would be the adoption of a relevant constitutional amendment [novella]. However, the present policy and juridical situation in the country make such a path improbable. A more realistic and satisfactory solution is the adoption of a federal law on the international and foreign economic ties of the subjects of the Russian Federation. In the given context, there is no possibility of examining the conception of such a law. But it is expedient to point out some key aspects. Taking into account world practice and our own experience, the right of the subjects of the Russian Federation to agreements with foreign states should be anchored in the law. Here one can utilize the experience of the FRG, whose Constitution establishes: "In so far as the laender [states] have the power to legislate, they may, with the consent of the Federal Government, conclude treaties with foreign states" (Article 32). The law should precisely define the rights of the subjects of the Russian Federation to permanent representations abroad. The subjects of other federations have many dozens of such representations, and the rich world experience must find reflection in the law. In particular, it is important to point out that the foreign representations of the Russian Federation act outside the sphere of the authority of the embassies and consulates of the Federation. The law will have to establish a concrete mechanism for the coordination of the international activity of the subjects of the Russian Federation in accordance with both the Constitution and with international law. Here it is expedient to establish a mechanism for the examination of disputes in regard to the application of the powers of the Federation and its subjects. The law, naturally, must establish the rights as well as the obligations of the subjects of the Russian Federation, including the conscientious fulfillment of both their own international obligations and the obligations of the Federation. The agreements of the subjects of the Russian Federation must not contradict the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the international obligations of the Russian Federation. Finally, the law must establish that the maintenance of international links is effected by the subjects of the Russian Federation at their own expense. This last limitation, possibly, will break up some ambitious designs, but it is necessary for the development of normal federative relations. On the whole, the law is called upon to guarantee the unity and effectiveness of the international activity of the Russian Federation on the basis of the powers of the Federation and its subjects and with mutual consideration of their interests. In the discussion of the proposed law, it should be taken into account that at the present time, in the overwhelming majority, the 89 subjects of the Russian Federation have neither sufficient experience nor an adequate number of trained personnel. If it is our desire for the law to function on the level of international standards, it is necessary to assist the subjects of the Russian Federation. Since the problem has all-Russian dimensions, the adoption of a long-term federal program of support for the international ties of the Russian Federation is expedient, in my view.
