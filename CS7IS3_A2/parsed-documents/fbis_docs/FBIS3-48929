The figure includes nationals of 136 countries, "ranging from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe," Sykora said. The inflow of Chinese has declined, while the number of immigrants from the former Soviet Union has been on the rise, he reported. They often work without residence and labor permits. "They arrive in the Czech Republic, as to a blessed country, in order to earn money here," he added, and noted that the employers, too, are punishable for hiring illegal workers. The latest problem are Tunisians, Sykora said. During foreign police round-ups, when foreigners are checked, some 70 percent of the detained are from Tunisia. These people are usually heading for the West, he reported. Sykora called nonsense the allegation that 30,000 Americans were living in Prague. He explained that according to the current estimates, about 80 million foreigners had arrived in the Czech Republic this year. If they come from the States of visa-free contact with the Czech Republic, they can stay here for 30 days with no registration necessary. Therefore, it is not possible to estimate the number and nationality of people staying in the Czech Republic illegally.
