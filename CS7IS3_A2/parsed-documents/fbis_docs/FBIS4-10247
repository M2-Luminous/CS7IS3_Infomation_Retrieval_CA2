On 26 March, in a televised address to the nation and flanked by a crucifix, former theology student Paz Zamora acknowledged "his mistakes, made in good faith" during his presidential administration (1989-1993). In addition, he announced his retirement from public life, and therefore, his decision to withdraw from running for president in the 1997 elections. However, yesterday Paz Zamora formally requested to make a statement "as another citizen, without seeking protection in any privileges whatsoever," to the parliamentary commission that has proceeded to unmercifully question several fellow party members who occupied high-ranking positions during his administration. According to Paz Zamora, his only "sin" that has been proven up to now is having cultivated a close and "naive" friendship with an alleged drug trafficker who goes by the name of Isac, surnamed Chavarria, and alias "Oso," whose habit is to constantly bite and gently suck a rosary in public. As result of that friendship, Paz Zamora's main apostles and several leading members of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) were investigated and accused by the police of links with drug trafficking and cross-examined by a parliamentary commission. All of the former public officials proceeded to defend themselves firmly and some of them, such as Susana Seleme, Paz Zamora's private secretary during his presidential term, even denied on more than three occasions being involved in anything. She even described herself as "the biggest victim of good faith mistakes" committed by the former president. On the other hand, this past Friday the Bolivian Interior Ministry, apparently always well-advised by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), indicated its lack of solid evidence in its accusations against the MIR during an appearance before the parliamentary investigation commission this past Friday. During cross-examination by the parliamentary commission, General Renato Lopez, head of the Special Front in the Struggle Against Drug Trafficking (FELCN), and Prosecutor Leopoldo Ramos, reluctantly admitted that their only evidence was based on unsubstantiated accusations made by confessed drug trafficker Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez, a former MIR activist arrested during Paz Zamora's administration and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Lopez and Ramos even accepted the possibility that they may have to publicly apologize to some MIR members because some of the accusations that were mysteriously leaked to the media now seem not to have any support whatsoever. Nevertheless, up until today, most commentators and politicians in Bolivia agree in predicting the inevitable political demise of the MIR and its leader, Paz Zamora. Parliamentary Investigation Commission President Edil Sandoval, has acknowledged Paz Zamora's request to be cross-examined and has announced that the former president could present his testimony this coming Tuesday. Based on the content of the letter sent to Sandoval, Paz Zamora insinuates that he would like to be cross- examined publicly in presence of the media, as his fellow party members have been. Their respective testimonies were broadcast daily and live by La Paz Radio Panamericana. However, the members of the parliamentary commission summoned a meeting for this Monday to decide if the cross-examination will take place publicly or privately in honor of the former president's investiture, which would be contrary to Paz Zamora's request.
