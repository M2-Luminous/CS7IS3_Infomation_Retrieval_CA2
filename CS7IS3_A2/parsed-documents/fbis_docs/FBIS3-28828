However, Ozawa himself appears to be acting at his or his party's own convenience. Before aiming for an ordinary nation, Ozawa should perhaps strive to become "a normal person" who can be understood by the people. Parting With the SDPJ Is Inevitable The Hosokawa administration, which appeared to be sailing smoothly after its inauguration, is now showing conspicuous signs of fraying. In addition to a mounting offensive by the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] which overcame its danger of refracturing, loud noises of discord are heard from within the coalition. The source is none other than the existence and the conspicuous statements and behavior of representative Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. First of all, the political reform bill is vitally important to the coalition administration. The solidarity among the SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan] upper house members who oppose the bill has strengthened with time. At the outset, Ozawa used his close associate, upper house member Sadao Hirano, to try to persuade the rebelling group. He reportedly even dangled the bait of cabinet posts to the hardline faction of Dietman Osamu Yatabe, et al. However, he is said to have switched his direction by stating: "It is now impossible to change their minds. There are 15 or 16 persons with whom we cannot communicate. The party cadres are also opposed at heart to reform. The SDPJ is beyond our reach. There is nothing we can do if a defeat in the upper house results in dissolution and a general election." He also spoke to his associates as follows. "If an election results, both the SDPJ and the LDP will definitely split. Because the tail wind has died down and organization is lacking, the JNP [Japan New Party] and Sakigake [Harbinger] Party will not increase their seats. The only winners will be Shinseito and Komeito. These two and the JNP should unite, embrace the LDP reformist faction, and form a major force. If Hosokawa's popularity should wane at that point, we can set up Hata (deputy prime minister and foreign minister). They enjoy similar popularity among the people." This is interpreted to be a clear cutoff of the SDPJ. Nonetheless, given the fact that he considers even Prime Minister Hosokawa as one of his chess pawns, Ozawa's dictatorial demeanor is apalling. Of course, the SDPJ does not remain silent. Diet Affairs Committee chairman Koken Nosaka, who met with Ozawa on 29 November, reportedly said in rage to those around him after the meeting as follows. "We fear neither a dissolution of the coalition government nor an election. We endured political reform to a certain extent, but if an opening of the rice market and a rise in the consumption tax are forced down our throats in the name of maintaining the coalition, our party will be dealt an early death. We can make a breakthrough by striking out." Chairman Tomiichi Murayama is also reported to have conducted secret liaison with "don" Seiroku Kajiyama, former secretary general and a conservative member of the LDP. The SDPJ's anti-Shinseito, anti-Ozawa posture is becoming more pronounced. The trend was accelerated by the "constitutional revision statement" made by Defense Agency Director General Keisuke Nakanishi on 1 December. While explaining it as his personal view at a lecture in Tokyo, Nakanishi made an extremely provocative statement for an incumbent director general of the Defense Agency. "I feel that it is ridiculous to continue to adhere zealously to a Constitution of a half-century ago. We should remake it to respond to realistic standards while respecting the spirit of constitutionalism. I am speaking with conviction. I am prepared to resign at any time." Actually, Nakanishi resigned as the director general the following day, because the resulting confusion caused a halt in the supplementary budget deliberations. Nonetheless, it was a well-known fact that the crux of the Nakanishi statement was the same as Ozawa's longstanding argument. A commentary was even leaked by a Shinseito affiliate that "it was Ozawa's farewell declaration to the SDPJ." SDPJ upper house member Masatoshi Ito says with heated indignation: "It is outrageous. It was a mistake, after all, to team up with Shinseito. The Nakanishi statement was actually Ozawa's statement, and this clarifies the fact that the party advocates a power state. The SDPJ cannot relinquish its party spirit of protecting the Constitution. We must sever our ties with the coalition government as soon as possible." Upper house member Masao Kunihiro similarly declares in a harsh tone: "If Ozawa continues to try to push through his unreasonable demands, it will result in Ozawa's one-man control which is worse than the LDP's one-party domination. We must not allow it to happen. Cabinet members, including Director Eda of the Science & Technology Agency (United Social Democratic Party [USDP] representative), should leave the coalition, and I believe that they will." There are also voices from within Sakigake [Harbinger] party ranks that fear Shinseito's constitutional reform posture, and the Hosokawa administration has suddenly begun to careen because of the single Ozawa faction. "All Right for Budget Formation To Be Postponed Until Next Year" Ozawa is also committing mistakes in the aspect of business stimulus measures. He has spoken frequently to his close associates as follows. "The people are overly absorbed with the immediate future. They should persevere longer for the time being. It is necessary for the politicians to take the leadership and guide the people by displaying that leadership. A system for that purpose must be established." At the root of Ozawa's thinking is the idea that "government by the foolish masses" will result by listening to the people's voice, and what is necessary is a politician with strong leadership who can lead the foolish masses that tend to be "overly engrossed with the near future." However, as an extension of such a concept arises a contention to "postpone antirecession measures" that holds contempt for the people. For example, we quote a paragraph from his address before the Aichi Prefectural League on 25 November. "There are requests for us to do something about the recession. Although the government has taken various steps, there is no indication of an improvement because it is a structural recession. The previous concepts will not work. In order to execute drastic monetary and fiscal measures, a prerequisite is to reform politics itself. Therefore, political reform must precede antirecession measures." He also stated clearly to a leading politician: "In order to pass a political reform bill, a broad extension of the Diet session is necessary. For that purpose, it is inevitable that the formulation of the budget be postponed until next year." Of course, the content of what is called political reform here refers to electoral system reform which is often debated as being problematical. Nonetheless, his nerve in declaring that the antirecessional measures, which everyone argues loudly today as a most urgent task, "can be postponed until after political reform," and to also postpone the formulation of next year's draft fiscal budget including the income tax reduction anticipated at the earliest by the people, cannot be imagined of the leader of a responsible government and ruling party. However, like boss, like subordinate. Facing the executives of the Japan Department Stores Assn who came to petition for an early antirecession measure, Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] Minister Hiroshi Kumagae, Ozawa's close associate, declared: "First, we must pass political reform. After that, we will push through a business stimulus measure with a bang." The petitioners were reportedly aghast at the lighthearted use of the term "with a bang." Meanwhile, the stock prices which reacted against the Kumagae remark fell below the 16,000 yen level with a loud "bang." As such, no insensitive remark could make amends. "Although the Hosokawa administration is said to be a political reform administration, it is a big mistake to say that reform is all it has to do. The present national task is business stimulation and, unless you start by coping with it, politics will be unnecessary" (LDP Dietman Shinji Sato). This remark does not cast a damper on the government, but it is a fair argument that castigates it. However, Ozawa's apparent disinclination to heed it is clear in his aforementioned address. Professor Setsuo Takahata of Teikyo University's economic dept comments as follows. "Japan's economy is said to be first-rate, but its politics is ridiculed as being third-rate. However, at the present rate, its economics could also become third-rate. Although Mr. Ozawa has offered various proposals for Japan's future, his remark indicates his absolute lack of knowledge about its current economic state. His continued stress on a 10-percent consumption tax as a source of tax reduction also has a reverse effect on the consumer mind which has continued to cool. Speaking of tax reduction, it could have been done in the summer at a cost of 5 trillion yen. Now, it will not be effective unless it is about 10 trillion yen. This is not merely economic tone-deafness, but economic ignorance. The economy will not improve within this century with Mr. Ozawa's awareness level." Cultivation of Zoku Dietmen Aimed Toward Money and Votes There are other problematical and quesionable statements. The Ozawa statement about rice goes as follows. "I have not said that rice must be deregulated. However, tariffication is a principle of free trade which Japan does not negate." His intent is not clear, but he seems to say, in essence, that rice importation is inevitable in order to maintain friendly relations with the other nations of the world. If so, why does he fail to debate it seriously among the coalition parties, and merely stacks up established facts in a manner that bewitches the people? It is only natural for the SDPJ to increasingly react and claim that it is contrary to the public commitments made by the eight factions when they formed the coalition. "In effect, only Shinseito's future exists in Ozawa's eyes. The future image of Japan, of which he speaks, is also merely a future image with the condition that Shinseito becomes the focus of politics" (an LDP leader). Ozawa's comments are dangerous and unreliable to the point that such views have a sound of credibility. For example, he has stated about the LDP, his alma mater, as follows. "The LDP is like a large tree at which one looks up, but it is hollow inside. Therefore, forming Shinseito was inevitable" (from his aforementioned address in Aichi). We will not question here who was responsible for the hollowing out of the LDP. However, if he had bolted from the party based on such a judgment, it is the normal sentiment among the people to want him to cleanly discard all LDP-style methods and senses. However, the collection of funds goes on as usual, and political methods have not changed. For example, Shinseito recently successively formed "research committees" completely similar to those of the LDP and increased the number of petition windows. "In effect, the intention is to gather votes and money by looking after their special- interests organizations that no longer go to the LDP with their petitions. They are aiming at mass cultivation of the zoku Dietmen" (a Japan New Party Diet member). Prime Minister Hosokawa, who has sought to eliminate the zoku Diet members, has reportedly expressed displeasure concerning this trend. When the mass media criticized this, he (Ozawa) incorrigibly refused to reconsider, but conversely criticized the mass media, saying: "Various problems are aired in the mass media, but the mass media is arbitrarily using names to do business. I do not want you to misunderstand, because they are not reporting the truth" (from his Aichi address). No One Gives Advice to Ozawa Moreover, since 8 November, he has refused to hold any scheduled press conference, which he himself originally began with the foreign press and magazines allowed to attend, on the pretext of "a divergence of views between the mass media." Although there was a plethora of pending bills, including those on political reform, rice and the budget regarding which he should have explained to the people in press conferences as the representative of a public political party, he makes no attempt to do so. If he shows up at a press conference, he will be questioned about the unexplained portion of his own nebulously acquired funds. He cannot avoid the suspicion that he is evading the questioning. An Ozawa associate comments on this problem. "Well, Mr. Ozawa's contention is probably that `there is any number of ways other than a press conference to communicate to the people,' but actually there has there been no increase in TV appearances or local appearances by him. His true feeling is: `What is wrong with not talking if I do not wish to talk?' There are some within Shinseito who believe it is wrong. However, they are afraid and do not dare give him advice. They can only be yes-men, because they know that, if they resist him, they will be thrown out." LDP Dietman Yoshinobu Shimamura makes the following critical comment. "It has been made clear that his `open press conference' was a lie. Ozawa thinks that he can do anything to form a political system which he can control himself. It is too obvious. He exposed his true self by his refusal to hold any press conference. Although he says that he will lay out antirecession measures, he only thinks of using it to pass political reform, and there is no reason to expect an honest measure." Without an honest antirecession measure, without obtaining any consensus within the ruling coalition on rice deregulation, and finally under circumstances where the SDPJ could leave the coalition, the Hosokawa administrative has suddenly become unsettled. Materialization of the political reform bill, which is the major public commitment by the Hosokawa administration, seems to be difficult not only within the year, but even if the Diet sessiion is drastically extended. The Nakanishi statement on constitutional amendment has not only given the LDP an excuse for attack, but also polarized the divergence of basic doctrines that previously existed among the ruling parties, and has impressed the public with the protusion by Shinseito. If Ozawa should seriously cut off the SDPJ, the collapse and dissolution of the coalition and a general election will result. During this recession, a political vacuum exceeding a month will recur due to conflicting party interests. It is the presumptuous behavior of such men in power that has marred this nation.
