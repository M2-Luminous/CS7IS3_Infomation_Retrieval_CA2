[Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur has apparently issued no specific guidelines for his ministers to follow in European councils. In prime ministerial circles, comments are heard -- although these are only preliminary thoughts, not decisions -- that the French Government's attitude will vary depending on the positions adopted by those Italian ministers who happen to be MSI [Italian Social Movement] members. If they advocate neofascist positions, France should fight them, we are told, but otherwise, EU rules include no provision for boycotting a democratically elected government. Although [former Socialist Culture Minister] Jack Lang championed a boycott before the national convention of the Socialist Party on 17 April, the party's leadership argued that this position lacked realism. [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard felt the need to issue a press release stating that the presence of neofascist ministers, should it be confirmed, would be "a serious cause for concern." "The very notion is unacceptable," he added. "Fifty years after World War II, it is not possible to forget what became of Europe under fascism and Nazism." The Socialist Party decided to start talks with other European socialist and social democratic parties "with a view to adopting a common position in European institutions, especially at the European Parliament." Charles Millon, president of the UDF [French Democratic Union] group in the National Assembly, also mentioned the prospect of an Italian government including neofascist ministers. On 24 April on Radio J [private station], he said he wished "that EU members would make it very clear to the president of the Italian Republic that the government he is to call to office (must be) devoted to the values of the European civilization, that is, respect for human rights, for the individual, and for democratic principles." Mr. Millon added that should the values "still be fascist values, which do not square with European philosophy (...), there will be a major problem." "The EU is like wedlock; to be married, the partners should have common social and political views," he concluded. He has been so far the only UDF member to take a stand on the issue. At the RPR [Rally for the Republic], people close to [National Assembly President] Philippe Seguin noted that Jacques Chirac has had telephone conversations with Gianfranco Fini, the former MSI national secretary and the founder of the National Alliance; that Isere Deputy Richard Cazenave has attended the founding conference of Mr. Fini's new party; and that [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua has said that he maintains a close relationship with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi. However, Mr. Seguin has never been shy of admitting that in his eyes, "the only noteworthy party in Italy is the PDS" (Democratic Party of the Left, the former Communist Party). And neither has he tried to hide his affinity with Giorgio Napolitano (PDS), the former speaker of the Italian House of Representatives, who has now been replaced by Irene Pivetti (Northern League).
