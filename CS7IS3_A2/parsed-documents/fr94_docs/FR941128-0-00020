FR941128-0-00020 FR941128-0-00006 Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;13&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1.

Applicability: Model 369D, E, F, and FF series helicopters with pitch control assembly, part number (P/N) 369D21800 or P/N 369D21820, installed, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the inner tang of the pitch control assembly lockwasher (lockwasher), loss of the locknut, disengagement of the pitch control assembly, loss of tail rotor control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Within 25 hours time-in-service or 90 calendar days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, remove the tail rotor (T/R) assembly and pitch control assembly from the T/R gearbox in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. (b) Inspect the lockwasher, P/N MS172209, for dents in either side of the inner tang inside radius as shown in Figure 1 of MDHS Service Information Notice (SIN) No. DN&hyph;185, EN&hyph;78, and FN&hyph;64, dated September 23, 1994, using a 5x or higher magnifying glass.

If any slippage is detected, replace the lockwasher with an airworthy lockwasher in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. Reapply the 0.125 inch-wide torque stripe to the surface of the locknut and swashplate. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, FAA. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office.
