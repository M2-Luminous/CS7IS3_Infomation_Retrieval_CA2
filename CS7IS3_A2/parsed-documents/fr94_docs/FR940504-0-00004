FR940504-0-00004 FR940504-0-00002 One commenter believed that the proposed change, at least as it relates to Reserve Bank adjustment practices, impedes the ability of correspondent banks to compete with the Reserve Banks. This commenter stated that the adjustment accounting practices of its local Reserve Bank require intercept processors and depository institutions to engage in a burdensome reconcilement process. The commenter stated that the Board should not incorporate the operating circulars into Regulation J. The proposed amendments, however, would not incorporate the operating circulars into Regulation J, but rather would provide greater detail as to the scope of the operating circulars. Issues related to adjustment posting alternatives generally can be settled between the Reserve Bank and the parties involved and would not be affected by the proposed amendment to Regulation J. Thus, the Board has adopted the amendment as proposed. Section 210.3(f) The Board proposed to add a new paragraph to §210.3 to clarify that Regulation J supersedes the U.C.C., other state laws, and Regulation CC to the extent of any inconsistency. This provision parallels §229.41 of Regulation CC, which provides that Regulation CC supersedes the U.C.C. and other state law to the extent of the inconsistency. The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendment as proposed. Section 210.5(a) The Board proposed to amend §210.5(a) to conform the warranties made by banks that send items to Reserve Banks to the transfer and presentment warranties in U.C.C. 4&hyph;207 and 4&hyph;208. A sender would warrant that it was (or acted on behalf of a person who was) entitled to enforce the item. The U.C.C. substituted the concept of ``person entitled to enforce'' for ``person with good title'' in recognition that the right to enforce an instrument is not limited to holders. In addition, the proposed amendment would require the sender to warrant that the item was not altered, dropping the adverb ``materially.'' The U.C.C. formerly incorporated the concept of a ``material'' alteration as one that changed the contract of the parties in any respect. The revised U.C.C. refers to such a change simply as an alteration. Finally, the proposed amendment would clarify that the sender also makes the warranties set forth in Regulation CC and that the Regulation J warranties may not be disclaimed and are made regardless of whether the sender's indorsement appears on the item. One commenter was concerned that dropping the word ``materially'' would mean that repair of MICR encoding on a check that rejects from automated processing would constitute an alteration. Section 3&hyph;407 of the U.C.C. defines ``alteration'' as an unauthorized change that purports to modify the obligation of a party or an unauthorized addition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a party. The 1990 version of the U.C.C. appears to use the terms ``alteration'' synonymously with the former term ``material alteration'' (see Official Comment (1) to U.C.C. 3&hyph;407). MICR repair, which is intended to facilitate check collection and not to affect the obligations of the parties to a check, is unlikely to be considered an alteration. Sections 210.5(d) and 210.12(i) The Board proposed to add new paragraph (d) to §210.5 and new paragraph (i) to §210.12 to give a Reserve Bank a security interest in a sender's or prior collecting or returning bank's assets held by the Reserve Bank. The security interest would attach when a warranty is breached or other obligation is incurred. The proposed provisions were based on similar provisions in subpart B of Regulation J, which gives a Reserve Bank a security interest in the assets of a sender of a payment order to secure overdrafts and other obligations (§210.28(b) (3) and (4)). Two commenters were concerned that the proposal would give Reserve Banks greater rights than private-sector banks to resolve warranty breach issues. One of the commenters stated that the proposal appeared to give Reserve Banks a complete self-remedy for breaches absent a court order or agreement of the parties. The commenter noted that security interests under §210.28 are designed to secure overdrafts, which are easily determinable, as opposed to warranty breaches, which are often a matter of dispute. The commenter requested that the proposal be clarified to provide that security interests do not attach and a Reserve Bank may not set off or realize upon collateral without a judicial determination or agreement of the parties. Section 9&hyph;501(5) of the U.C.C. provides that when a claim of a secured party is reduced to judgment, the secured party's lien on collateral relates back to the date the security interest was perfected. Accordingly, the Board believes that a Reserve Bank's security interest in the assets of a warranting bank should attach on the date the warranty is breached (generally the date the Reserve Bank handles the check in question) so that the Reserve Bank may take actions to protect its collateral, if necessary, as discussed below.
