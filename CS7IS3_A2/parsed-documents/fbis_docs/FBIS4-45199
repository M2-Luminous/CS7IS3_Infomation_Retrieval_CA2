Two presumed public prisoners were arrested in the operation, considered "one of the most important carried out to date by the National Institute To Combat Drugs [INCD]." Reports provided by the INCD, which is subordinate to the Attorney General's Office, reveal that Hermenegildo Vazquez Reynoso and Rutilo Larios Tovar were arrested in the underground parking lot of the Plaza Patria shopping center. They were engaged in closing a purchase and sale deal involving 78 kg and 800 grams of the drug. It was stated that the drugs, hidden in the false bottom of a pickup truck's platform, are thought to have been intended for shipment to Tijuana, Baja California, and subsequent smuggling into California for sale and consumption. According to the department itself, and based on laboratory tests, the confiscated cocaine, distributed in several "bricks," had a high degree of purity. Hence, it was estimated that, after processing, its weight would have been increased up to 700 percent; which would have netted the drug dealers sizable profits. The authorities stressed that the capture of those now indicted and the drug confiscation "resulted from an extensive investigation." They added that it is being continued in both Jalisco and Baja California, to determine culpability, and whether those responsible belong to a group engaged in international narcotics trafficking. It should be noted that, nearly a year after the aforementioned institute's creation, and although it has highly sophisticated technological equipment and agents who are graduates of the Attorney General's Office's own Training Institute, its results in the battle against the drug traffic have been minimal. For this reason, yesterday's confiscation is regarded as one of that institute's most important achievements.
