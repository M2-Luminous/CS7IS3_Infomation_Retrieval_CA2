Sabirov, termed the current condition of the construction complex of the republic critical. Awash in Debt In 1933, only seven facilities were commissioned out of the 30 that had been slated to be commissioned. The capacity that would have made it possible to increase the output of foodstuffs and construction materials failed to be commissioned; we did not succeed in increasing the commissioning of residential buildings and facilities for social, cultural, and consumer services, despite increasing the proportion of funds invested in that sphere. Last year, buildings with an area of 1.275 million square meters were built, which comes to 88 percent of the 1992 level. The main failures in the commissioning of housing occurred in Naberezhnye Chelny. Out of 148,000 square meters promised by the mayoralty of Naberezhnye Chelny, the city checked in with only 32,400 meters. A projection of the KamAZ Joint-Stock Company did not come true. The main customer for housing in the city failed to commission a single square meter. The problem in Naberezhnye Chelny lies in a genuine energy crisis which has developed there. The shortfall in heat generation comes to 37 percent. This prevents not only the hooking up of new consumers of heat but even the normal operation of the existing housing stock. However, work at the complex of the central boiler plant, which is slated for commissioning, proceeds at a slow pace. The output of the construction materials industry continues to decline. Last year, the decline came to 18.6 percent compared to 1992. Difficulties in the placement of products in conjunction with reductions in the volume of construction are one of the reasons. Tatarstan Republic Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov, who made a report at the conference, referred to the high rate of inflation, a cutback in budget expenditures, and the striving of many managers in the construction complex to manage in the old way and maintain the strength of the work force through, among other things, "eating away" at the fixed assets as the causes responsible for the slump in investment activities. The crisis of nonpayments by customers, which is growing worse, is a most serious problem. As of 1 January 1994, the indebtedness of customers came to R185.1 billion, out of which about one-half was defaulted debt. The rate of growth of nonpayments and the proportion of defaulted debt in construction were the highest in the national economy. Just as in construction, the nonpayment crisis has become aggravated in the construction materials industry. As of the beginning of 1994, the indebtedness of buyers for goods, work, and services came to R19.2 billion, and the debt to suppliers--to R18.9 billion (of which the debt in default accounted for 45 percent). In response to numerous questions from participants in the conference concerning prospects for the elimination of the debt, M. Sabirov promised to pay all debts of the Republic of Tatarstan Cabinet of Ministers UKS [Capital Construction Administration] by the beginning of April. However, he did not support the notion of introducing mutual-offset arrangements, citing the extreme technical difficulty and, correspondingly, ineffectiveness of this procedure. The main task, said the speaker, is to modify the mechanism for attracting and using financial resources. In the current year, priority support will be granted to the sectors which must ensure the stabilization and steadiness of functioning of the economy of the republic. We must be prepared for the scope of financing out of budgetary funds to diminish. Investment out of the funds of enterprises will not increase, either. It has been proposed to use the funds of commercial banks and foreign investment in order to stabilize the volume of capital investment. Are `Projects in Progress' Forever? M. Sabirov called the growth of "projects in progress" a heavy burden on the economy of the republic. As of the beginning of 1994, roughly R1.3 trillion in prices in effect were "tied up" in such facilities. The prime minister stressed that there is only one way out of this situation: to commission, whatever it takes, the facilities under construction at which work is highly advanced and whose operation can generate profits quickly. Some of the "projects in progress" can be sold to domestic and foreign entrepreneurs on a competitive basis. However, developers are not interested in such sales because the lion's share of proceeds frequently does not end up in their wallets but rather, for example, in the privatization fund of the republic. This was the case with the sale of a concert hall in 1993, when the administration of Kazan received only 30 percent of the cost of the facility. Enterprises and organizations are in no hurry to put up "projects in progress" for auctions because of, among other things, the rapidly growing prices of real estate. In turn, potential buyers are restrained because of the absence of property rights to the parcels of land under the facilities purchased. Apparently, it is necessary to develop and introduce a package of regulatory documents which will stimulate the commissioning of facilities, impede the growth of the volume of construction in progress, and invigorate the market for construction products. In conjunction with this, the proposal was aired at the conference to lay a tax on idle property at all facilities whose construction is in progress. The State Property Committee of Tatarstan is now preparing a draft decree on measures to reduce the number of facilities at which construction is in progress. As was stated, the decree will envision devices to influence enterprises and their managers. All of this may be commendable, but it is worthwhile to recall that in the USSR, they were fighting "projects in progress" in capital construction with all their might over the last 30-40 years; meanwhile, their volume increased year after year.... Housing Policy The bold and quite controversial idea that it is precisely housing construction that can restore the health of the republic's economy as a whole within a short period of time was stated at the conference. To this end, a special-purpose program, "Housing," is being developed in the Republic of Tatarstan; single-family housing construction should become one of its main areas. Well, those wishing to build their own housing are indeed numerous here. However, as M. Sabirov noted, given its current cost, the population of the republic is unable to build single-family dwellings without support from the state. Such support is envisioned; it will be expressed in the allocation and sale of parcels of land, easy loans (interest-free and low-interest), tax relief, and the introduction of mortgage financing. It is expected that a family of average affluence will be able to buy out housing built on credit, on the pledge of real estate, within 25-30 years. M. Sabirov stated that easy loans for those wishing to build housing will be issued very shortly. However, it is important in principle that the right of low-income citizens to improve their housing conditions in keeping with waiting lists will continue to exist at the same time. The only question is with what funds such housing will be built and, correspondingly, to what extent. The introduction of preferences for investors is envisioned, in view of the fact that we cannot manage without attracting off-budget funds into housing construction. The preferences include the transfer of residential buildings to be remodeled to entrepreneurs on the terms of 100-percent financing, with the subsequent transfer to them of up to 30 percent of the total space as their property; the sale of dilapidated and unoccupied housing stock to entrepreneurs and the use of up to 30 percent of the space at their discretion; the construction of housing and allocation of parcels of land through tenders. The "Housing Initiative" corporation which has been established in the republic is developing a program for attracting off-budget entities and mortgage investment systems to housing construction and to the upgrading of the dilapidated housing stock. The first Joint-Stock Mortgage Bank in the republic is already being created (founded by the Tatsotsbank, the "Housing Initiative" corporation, and the Kazzhilgrazhdanstroy PSO [Production and Construction Association]). This bank will extend long-term credit for the construction of civil and industrial facilities on the pledge of real estate. "Housing Initiative" proposes to build commercial housing, sell it at auctions, and reinvest the proceeds into new construction. The switchover to low-rise buildings is one of the directions of the new housing policy. This will it make it possible to use cheaper local materials more extensively and to use less expensive small-size construction equipment. It is necessary to change the output mix of some facilities at prefabricated concrete plants and other industrial enterprises in the construction sector which are geared toward medium- and low-rise [as in the original] housing construction. As a result, the tenor of the conference turned out to be approximately like this: Everything is bad, but we cannot just lay down and die. We must work and look for a way out. Well, the ability of builders to "take the blows" of fate is commonly known. It is a pity that with every passing year it is becoming increasingly difficult to answer what was once a humorous question: Is it a big deal to build a house?
