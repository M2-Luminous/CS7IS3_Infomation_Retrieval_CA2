FR940920-2-00056 FR940920-2-00027 As required by Section 304(b)(2)(B) of the Act, in developing the BPJ/BAT permit conditions, the Agency considered the age of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed, the engineering aspects of the application of various types of control techniques, process changes, the cost of achieving such effluent reduction, non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements), and such other factors as the Director deemed appropriate. The types of equipment and processes employed in exploratory drilling operations are well known to the Agency. Region 10 has issued numerous general and individual permits for exploratory oil and gas operations. The records for this permit and those earlier permits thoroughly discuss the types of equipment, facilities and processes employed in exploratory drilling operations. With regard to the engineering aspects of the application of various types of control techniques, there are no BAT permit limitations based on installation of control equipment. BAT permit limitations based on the newly issued guidelines can be achieved through product substitution for drilling muds and cuttings. Any costs of achieving the effluent limitations and any non-water quality environmental impacts were also evaluated by the Agency where the guidelines are applicable. A discussion of such evaluations is presented below with respect to any limitation where applicable. As required by Section 304(b)(4)(B) of the Act, the same factors as in BAT are considered in determining BCT permit conditions, with one exception. Rather than considering ``the cost of achieving such effluent reduction,'' any BCT determination includes ``consideration of the reasonableness of the relationship between the costs of attaining a reduction in effluents and the effluent reduction benefits derived, and the comparison of the cost and level of reduction of such pollutants from publicly owned treatment works to the cost and level of reduction of such pollutants from a class or category of industrial sources.'' BCT effluent limitations cannot be less stringent than BPT; therefore, if the candidate industrial technology fails the BCT ``cost test'', BCT effluent limitations are set equal to BPT. B. Ocean Discharge Criteria Section 403 of the Act requires that an NPDES permit for a discharge into marine waters located seaward of the inner boundary of the territorial seas be issued in accordance with guidelines for determining the degradation of the marine environment. These guidelines, referred to as the Ocean Discharge Criteria (40 CFR part 125, subpart M), and section 403 of the Act are intended to ``prevent unreasonable degradation of the marine environment and to authorize imposition of effluent limitations, including a prohibition of discharge, if necessary, to ensure this goal.'' (45 FR 65942, October 3, 1980) If EPA determines that the discharge will cause unreasonable degradation, an NPDES permit will not be issued. If a determination of unreasonable degradation cannot be made because of a lack of sufficient information, EPA must then determine whether a discharge will cause irreparable harm to the marine environment and whether there are reasonable alternatives to on-site disposal. To assess the probability of irreparable harm, EPA is required to make a determination that the discharger, operating under appropriate permit conditions, will not cause permanent and significant harm to the environment during a monitoring period in which additional information is gathered. If data gathered through monitoring indicate that continued discharge may cause unreasonable degradation, the discharge must be halted or additional permit limitations established. The Director has concluded that there is sufficient information to determine that exploratory oil and gas facilities operating under the effluent limitations and conditions in this general permit will not cause unreasonable degradation of the marine environment pursuant to the Ocean Discharge Criteria guidelines as long as discharge does not occur shoreward of the 5 meter isobath (Tetra Tech, 1994a) as discussed in Section V.B.4. of this fact sheet. Conditions imposed under Section 403(c) of the Act are discussed in Section V.B.4. below. C. State of Alaska Standards and Limitations All dischargers to State waters must ensure compliance with water quality standards and with limitations imposed by the state as part of its certification of NPDES permits under Section 401 of the Act. The state waters of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas have been classified by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) as marine waters with water use classes 2A through 2D (water supply; water recreation; growth and propagation of fish, shellfish, other aquatic life, and wildlife; and harvesting for consumption of raw mollusks or other raw aquatic life). In the best professional judgement of Region 10, the requirements and discharge limitations in the proposed permit will ensure compliance with the state water quality standards. In issuing this permit, EPA has considered Alaska's antidegradation policy (18 AAC 70.010(c)). The exploratory discharges authorized under this proposed permit are expected to have minimal impact because: _The relatively short duration of exploratory activities, _The intermittent nature of the discharges, _The limited areal extent of the discharges relative to the total area of coverage, and _The controls placed on the discharges via the proposed NPDES permit. Given the above, and since the project is not expected to result in any violations of state water quality criteria, EPA believes the project complies with the state's antidegradation policy. D. Section 308 of the Clean Water Act Section 308 of the Act and 40 CFR 122.44(i) authorizes the Director to require a discharger to conduct monitoring to determine compliance with effluent limitations and to assist in the development of effluent limitations. EPA has included several monitoring requirements in this permit, as listed in the table below in Section V. IV. Summary of New or Changed Permit Conditions This section of the fact sheet is intended to provide readers with a brief summary of the parts of the general permit which are substantively different from the previous general permits for offshore oil and gas exploratory activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. For detailed discussion of the requirements and their bases, please refer to Section V of this fact sheet. Many of the new and changed requirements are a consequence of the final Effluent Limitations Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards for the Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category promulgated by EPA (see 40 CFR part 435, subpart A).
