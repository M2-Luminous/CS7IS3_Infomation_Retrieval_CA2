Billerbeck: "The Danger of Data Theft"] [Text] Systems Forum: What is the Data Security Situation in Germany? Experts Criticize a Lack of Awareness of the Problem. In Germany, there is a lack of awareness of the problem of data security. This was the conclusion of a panel discussion on the occasion of the Systems Computer Fair in Munich. The group of experts were unanimous primarily in saying that there cannot be complete security against data theft. The title of the panel discussion on the occasion of the Systems Fair was chosen to be provocative: "The absolute worst-case scenario caused by data theft." The discussion lasted about one hour. However, there was quick evidence that the problem of data security in German government offices and companies cannot be given high enough importance. This is because our entire society is dependent to a large extent on the availability of advanced information technology. That is precisely the problem, said Prof. Klaus Brunnstein from the University of Hamburg. "We need this technology but it cannot be made 100 percent secure." With the increasing complexity of data processing solutions and the trend toward variegated services, the effects of breakdowns in the technology become more and more painful. This involves not only the theft of important data but also simple breakdowns of hardware and software. According to Brunnstein, "Hardware errors make up a greater percentage of the problems in EDP than we generally believe." The famous viruses account for a maximum of 25% of such problems. Regarding data theft, the scientist from Hamburg sees the greatest risk potential in system administrators. These are the individuals responsible for managing EDP systems in companies and government offices. In their role as experts, the systems administrators are usually only poorly monitored and could thus easily access all important data. Peter Schikora is the director of the FastComtec company. He sees the absolute worst-case scenario for information technology happening in the near future. He cites reports which see the Telekom division of the Federal Post Office suffering damages to the extent of 20 million Deutsche marks per week through the manipulations of hackers. In industry, data on research and development projects worth millions are passed back and forth over virtually unsecured data lines while appropriate security measures would only cost about 150,000 Deutsche marks. "However, data protection is obviously too expensive," according to Schikora, "primarily because the original copy of the stolen data is still available even after the theft." To tackle the problem, management also needs to be sensitized. Prof. Alfred Bullesbach is the data protection officer at Debis, a subsidiary of Daimler Benz. He says, "Data protection is a management task." In the final analysis, if the available information technology is to be used, the appropriate awareness for the dangers and strategies to defend against these dangers must be developed. The virus expert from Hamburg, Brunnstein, also sees a considerable lack of information on the part of the police and the criminal prosecution authorities. Very few policemen, judges, or prosecutors are capable of properly evaluating and classifying criminal offenses in conjunction with EDP systems. Appropriate training is urgently needed in this area. Brunnstein also sees another problem. "Our companies invest about two to five percent of their DP budgets in data security. However, this investment is usually directed toward the central computer and only rarely toward the PC networks in the company." However, it is precisely these networks that face the greatest danger. Brunnstein classifies computers into three categories. The first category is "inflexible but secure." These are computers that, for example, also permit monitoring of the administrator and therefore provide a high degree of security. The second category is flexible but not secure. In Brunnstein's opinion, this category includes all PCs running under the operating systems MS- DOS ("Not an operating system, but free housekeeping software," says Brunnstein.), Mac-OS and Unix. Brunnstein puts the newer systems of Windows NT, OS/2 and the most recent network systems into a third category. These systems have good approaches to security but they have not been proven in actual practice.
