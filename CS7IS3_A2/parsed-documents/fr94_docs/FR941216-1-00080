FR941216-1-00080 FR941216-1-00012 (a) Operating rules. Local procedures to ensure safe and efficient rail movement of A&E shall be developed, and shall include the following minimum requirements: (1) Movements in the classification yards are considered switch movements. All others are considered transfer movements. Before cars containing A&E move, air hoses shall be coupled, air brakes cut-in and in proper working order, and the car doors closed. Cars should remain coupled while in motion. Safety precautions shall be observed when breaking air hose connections. (2) When single explosives-loaded cars are spotted, the hand brakes shall be set and the wheels properly chocked. When more than one car is spotted and its engine detached, the hand brakes shall be set on enough cars to ensure sufficient braking. Hand brakes shall be set on the downgrade end of the cut of rail cars. Reliance should not be placed on the automatic air brakes to hold spotted cars. (3) A person should be stationed at the hand brake of a car mover when in use. (4) During transfer movements within establishments, full or partial loads in rail cars shall be blocked and braced so they cannot shift position. (5) Empty rail cars shall remain in warehouses, magazines, buildings, or loading docks until all warning placards have been removed or reversed, as appropriate. (6) Special care shall be taken to avoid rough handling of cars containing A&E. These cars shall not be ``sent off'' while in motion and shall be carefully coupled to avoid unnecessary shocks. Other cars shall not be ``cut off'' and allowed to strike a car containing explosives. (7) A buffer car should separate rail cars containing explosives and the switching engine when in motion. (8) Flags or signals at both ends of a rail car or cut of cars shall protect personnel working in, on, or under the cars. During these periods, cars shall not be coupled or moved. (9) Portable transmitters and railroad locomotives equipped with two-way radios shall not transmit when passing explosives operating buildings where electro-explosive devices are in use. The contractor shall determine minimum safe distances based on radio frequency (RF), frequency modulation (FM), and amplitude modulation (AM) of the transmitter. (b) Rail car inspections. (1) Qualified personnel shall inspect empty rail cars intended to transport A&E upon arrival, verifying that the carrier has complied with DOT requirements. (2) Before loading, the brakes shall be set on cars spotted for loading, and bridge plates equipped with side boards and stops shall be provided. (c) Loaded incoming rail car inspections. (1) Railroad cars with A&E should, upon arrival, be inspected at remote sites. If no problems are found, rail cars may be opened for interior inspection or moved to the designated unloading point. (2) A&E-loaded cars on which foreign and suspicious articles have been attached outside or underneath the car, or that have a defect which could affect the safety of the establishment or the contents of the car, shall be moved to the suspect car site for disposition. (3) Cars should be inspected after unloading A&E to ensure that they are clean and free from loose explosives and flammable materials, and that placards and car certificates have been removed. Explosives swept from the floors shall be disposed of properly. ยง184.38 Intraplant motor vehicle transportation. (a) Operating rules. Procedures for safe transportation of A&E in motor vehicles shall be developed locally, and should include the following: (1) Brakes shall be set and the wheels chocked while loading and un-loading on a grade. (2) A&E shall not be loaded or unloaded when a motor vehicle's engine is running, unless the engine is providing power to accessories used in the loading and unloading, such as mechanical handling equipment. (3) Vehicles, including flat-bed, partly or completely loaded, shall have the load blocked and braced to prevent shifting during transit. (b) Vehicle inspections. All motor vehicles used to transport A&E shall be inspected before loading to ensure the following: (1) Batteries and wiring shall not come into contact with containers of A&E. (2) Exposed ferrous metal in the interior of the vehicle body shall be covered with nonsparking material when scrap and bulk explosives are being transported in containers that could be damaged, or when explosives could otherwise become exposed. (3) A portable fire extinguisher of the appropriate class shall be carried on motor vehicles used for transporting A&E. (4) Motor vehicles transporting A&E within the establishment but outside the explosives area, shall bear at least two appropriate placards. These placards should be removed or covered whenever the vehicle is not loaded. Reflectorized placards are preferred. (5) Motor vehicles or equipment with internal combustion engines, used near explosives scrap, waste, or items contaminated with explosives, shall have exhaust system spark arresters and carburetor flame arresters (authorized air cleaners). They should be inspected and cleaned to prevent accumulation of carbon. (c) Loaded incoming vehicle inspections. (1) Vehicles with A&E should, upon arrival, be inspected at remote sites. If no problems are found, vehicles may be opened for interior inspection or moved to the designated unloading point. (2) A&E-loaded vehicles on which foreign and suspicious articles have been attached outside or underneath the car, or that have a defect which could affect the safety of the establishment or the contents of the vehicle, shall be moved to the suspect car site for disposition. (3) Vehicles should be inspected after unloading A&E to ensure that they are clean and free from loose explosives and flammable materials, and that placards and vehicle certificates have been removed. Explosives swept from the floors shall be disposed of properly. ยง184.39 Inspection of pyrotechnic, propellant and explosive mixers. Mixers used for manufacturing pyrotechnics, propellants and explosives shall have an initial inspection prior to use and shall be on a periodic inspection schedule during operating life. (a) The initial inspection shall, as a minimum, require radiographic and dye penetrant inspection of the blades and blade to shaft areas, blade to bowl clearances, allowable tolerances, testing for proper function of operating systems such as bowl positioning mechanisms, safety interlocks, fire detection and prevention and test of computer controller software selfcheck.
