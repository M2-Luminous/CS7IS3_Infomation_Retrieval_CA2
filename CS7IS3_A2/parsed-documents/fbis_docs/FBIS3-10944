August marked the beginning of a recovery in terms of levels of losses and reductions in inventories, and increasing numbers of employers reported a more favorable economic situation. They were also more optimistic about the country's economic and sociopolitical conditions that would them to carry out investment programs. All of these responses were taken from the private economic research firm's monthly poll of over 400 industrialists in the country's main development sectors. When one takes a closer look at the various subsectors, however, the results are highly dissimilar. On the one hand, some sectors were helped by the vigorous growth in internal demand. These sectors produce goods not easily marketed abroad, and their activities are linked to the production of durable consumer goods, construction in particular. This group includes industries that produce cement and building materials, wood and manufactured products made from wood, equipment, and electrical items. On the other hand, thanks to the recovery of exports, another group managed to reverse the levels of losses suffered during the first half of the year. This group includes plastics manufacturers and printing shops and publishing houses. By the month of October, plastics exports had increased in value by 68 percent, which can be explained by the vigor of sales to the United States and the Andean Group. Sales of publishing houses and printing shops rose 4 percent. To a lesser extent and more as a reaction to the domestic market, a recovery was visible among producers of processed foods, porcelain and glass, basic metals, metal products, and nonelectrical machinery. This last group includes sectors greatly affected by the economic liberalization program [apertura] and the revaluation of the peso. Many were able to compensate--although only partially--for their loss of domestic market shares by increased exports to neighboring countries. They are the textile industries, leather and manufactured leather goods, paper and cardboard, industrial chemical substances, and rubber products. Textiles found a better market in Venezuela with a 90-percent increase in sales. Likewise, producers of leather goods (excluding shoes) sold 123 percent more to that country than during the same months of the previous year. Paper mills sold 78 percent more products to Venezuela and 60 percent more to the rest of the Andean Group countries. Sales to Venezuela by manufacturers of industrial chemical substances dropped 16 percent, but rose to Peru, Ecuador (17 percent), and other South American countries (over 20 percent). Special mention should be made of the transport equipment and materials sector, which joined with construction in leading the sector throughout 1992, substantially reducing their level of losses starting in the first quarter of 1993. Nevertheless, levels of production and orders at the end of the year are far higher than they were previous to 1991. This sector benefited greatly from the liberalization of trade since it was able to import consumable expenditures at a lower cost. It was also aided by lower interest rates and the expansion of credit that boosted demand. Nevertheless, the high levels of sales of national and imported vehicles in late 1992 and early 1993 came in response to demand, which explains the abovementioned behavior of this industry's main indicators. It is one more sector that benefited from expanded access to the Venezuelan market: During the first 10 months of 1993, exports rose by 143 percent. Finally, the results of the poll show that the utilization of the installed capacity of industry in 1993, 77.2 percent, did not suffer major variations in terms of its behavior over the past five months. However, that figure did increase for beverages, ready-to-wear, leather, plastics, cement, and glass and porcelain.
