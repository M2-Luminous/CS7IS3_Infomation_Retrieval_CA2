Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and former foreign minister, was apparently having second thoughts about his defection plan now because his bid for the top government post seems unlikely to succeed, KYODO NEWS SERVICE reported. He decided on Sunday [17 April] to quit the LDP in an attempt to seek ties with the ruling coalition parties to achieve his goal of succeeding Hosokawa. Watanabe had been expected to make a formal announcement on his defection plan today. Watanabe held a 65-minute meeting with LDP President Yohei Kono today and told him he will consult with his faction members on the matter, KYODO said. They may hold another round of talks on Tuesday. KYODO said an LDP official quoted Watanabe as telling kono, "I understand your feelings, so please give me a little more time to think about it." The 70-year-old LDP veteran cited major differences between him and the ruling coalition over security issues as one of the main reasons for him to reconsider his plan to quit the LDP, still the largest single party in the Japanese Diet (parliament). Kono appealed to Watanabe to stay in the LDP, saying, "unless the coalition decides to revamp its combination of political forces and accept you, your defection will be of no use," according to KYODO.
