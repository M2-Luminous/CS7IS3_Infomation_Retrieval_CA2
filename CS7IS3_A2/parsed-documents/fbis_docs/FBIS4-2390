NATO's two American F-16 warplanes bombed artillery positions of the Serb forces south and southeast of Gorazde, a Serb-besieged Muslim enclave, yesterday evening. It was the first time during the two-year Bosnian war that the United Nations requested attacks on ground positions. In late February, NATO war planes shot down four Serb aircraft which violated the "no-fly zone" over Bosnia. The attack, launched under the U.N. request, aimed to protect 12 U.N. military observers in the Gorazde region from threatened Serb shellings, said the U.S. Defense Ministry [as received]. However, the headquarters of the Serb forces said in a statement that there was no threat at all to the UNPROFOR in Gorazde and the NATO air attack was "groundless." Therefore the raid had led the United Nations into the civil war of Bosnia, it added. The statement noted that NATO's attack was mounted to rescue the Muslims from defeat in their spring offensives and to block the realization of the Serb proposal for a "perpetual ceasefire throughout Bosnia." The Serb statement went on to say that the U.N. action was one for encouraging the Muslim forces, whose aim in launching the offensive was to provoke Serbs' counter-attacks and make them a pretext for foreign military intervention. In conclusion, the statement said that the Serbs were not to be cowed but would use every possible means to defend themselves.
