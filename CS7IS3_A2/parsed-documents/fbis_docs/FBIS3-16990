He said that this position was set forth by Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata during his talks with Russia's Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday morning. To quote Morimoto, the Japanese side emphasized that the declaration signed in Tokyo last December by the Russian president and the Japanese prime minister creates a basis for broadening political dialogue between the two countries. The Japanese diplomat also said that Japan would continue to support the Russian reforms and coordinate its moves with the G-7. During the talks Chernomyrdin and Hata stressed that Russia and Japan could jointly tackle major international problems. Morimoto also said that the talks with the Russian prime minister had convinced Japan that relations with Japan were one of the priority aspects of Russia's foreign policy. "Neighbors are not chosen. As neighbors, Russia and Japan must cooperate," he said. He pointed out that the Japanese foreign minister was satisfied with the discussion of the territorial issue. The Russian prime minister confirmed Russia's adherence to the Tokyo declaration and stated that a time would come when the territorial problems would be solved. "This problem is very complicated and we are well aware that it cannot be solved at one go," said Morimoto. He also announced that Hata had invited Chernomyrdin to visit Japan this year. In Chernomyrdin [as received] invited Hata to visit Moscow. The dates of the visit will be coordinated through diplomatic channels. Russia's possible admission to the G-7 was not discussed in detail, said Morimoto. Japan believes, however, that G-7 should broaden cooperation with Russia. "Such an initiative must come from Italy, because it currently chairs the G-7 and is the organizer of the forthcoming summit in Naples. Let us hope that this problem will be solved," he said.
