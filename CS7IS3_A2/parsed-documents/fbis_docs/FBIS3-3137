Huang Diyan, vice-chairman of the Bank of China and a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), made the remarks at the current NPC session. Since 1985 when Hong Kong entered a transition period, mainland- funded enterprises have expanded their business and many new ones have mushroomed, thanks to the mainland's reform and open policies, he said. For instance, he said, such long-established enterprises in Hong Kong [H.K.] as China Resources (Holdings) Co., Ltd., China Merchants (Holdings) Ltd., China Travel Service (Holdings) Hong Kong Ltd., the Bank of China Group and China Insurance Hong Kong (Holdings) Co., Ltd. all have had impressive development, with their assets reaching more than one billion, ten billion and even 100 billion H.K. dollars each. The Bank of China group has become the second largest banking group in Hong Kong, with savings deposits of 400 billion H.K. dollars and total assets of 700 billion H.K. dollars. Many mainland enterprises such as China International Trust and Investment Corporation, Everbright Industrial Company and China Overseas Building Development Co. have opened and developed their business in Hong Kong in recent years. Huang said mainland enterprises in Hong Kong are playing an increasingly important role in Hong Kong's economic activities. Many means of livelihood, especially those supplied by the mainland, are shipped and marketed by mainland enterprises including China Resources (Holdings) Co., Ltd. Mainland enterprises also manage marine and river transport, especially shipping between Hong Kong and mainland ports. Huang said his Bank of China Group in Hong Kong extends most of its loans to Hong Kong's industrial and commercial sectors, infrastructure and other social sectors. Last year the bank extended loans worth 16 billion H.K. dollars to Hong Kong's local industry and mortgage loans worth nearly 100 billion H.K. dollars for Hong Kong residents to buy housing units. The Bank of China Group has helped local authorities keep Hong Kong's financial market stable and ensure a healthy operation of Hong Kong's banking and securities sectors, Huang said. In the future, he said, mainland-funded enterprises in Hong Kong should continue to develop in order to build up an economic foundation for Hong Kong's smooth transition. Mainland-funded enterprises should not only play a bigger role in economic activities in Hong Kong but also try to have their own spokesmen in the political field -- their own representatives in the Hong Kong Legislative Council's functional constituencies, Huang said.
