I am watching closely developments in the Republic of Georgia and so is Ambassador Edouard Brunner, my extraordinary and plenipotentiary representative to Georgia. We both share your concern over the absence of progress in the talks on the comprehensive political settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia. The Security Council continues to look into all aspects of the situation in Abkhazia, including a proposal put forward by the Governments of Russia and Georgia to deploy peacekeeping forces in the region. In its Resolution 896 of 1994, which was adopted unanimously on 31 January, the Council acknowledges the difficulty of the condition of 300,000 people, who, as is known, have been forced to leave Abkhazia. However, the Council stressed the necessity of substantial progress in the political solution of the conflict before it would be able to consider the possibility of deploying peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia. The third round of talks between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides, which is to take place in Geneva between 22 and 24 February, will have paramount importance. In advance of the forthcoming talks, I ask your delegations to do everything in order to make progress in the peaceful solution of the conflict. It is very important for both sides to demonstrate the progress that the Security Council is striving for. In this connection, Ambassador Brunner is planning to meet Mr. Vladislav Ardzinba in Geneva on 20 February. Finally, let me express my heartfelt appreciation of the support given to Ambassador Brunner by the Russian Government in its capacity as facilitator. I would like to assure you that he and myself will continue to assist actively the parties involved in finding a comprehensive peaceful solution to the conflict. Yours respectfully, [Signed] Butrus-Ghali
