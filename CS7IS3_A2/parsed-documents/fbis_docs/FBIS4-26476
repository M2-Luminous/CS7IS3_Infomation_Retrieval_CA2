On Tuesday [21 June], Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev flew to Brussels, headquarters of the treaty organization, to sign the Partnership for Peace program originally proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton in response to some eastern European countries' desire for NATO memberships. Shortly after the signing ceremony, Kozyrev and NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Balanzino announced at a press conference a cooperation protocol between Russia and NATO setting forth general principles for their future relations. The protocol, put forward by Moscow as a precondition for joining the Partnership for Peace program, acknowledges Russia's major power status and its influence in Europe, stating that Russia and NATO will have extensive dialogue and cooperation and conduct political consultations on European and global security and peacekeeping missions. NATO has placed some restrictions on Russia's request for more political consultation on security issues. Both sides will remain independent in their decision making, the NATO leadership pointed out today. In fact, the two documents reflect the concessions made by both sides after six months of bargaining. Their differences focused on whether a special relationship would be established between them. Since U.S. President Clinton proposed the program in January, Russia had repeatedly changed its position on the issue in an effort to gain special relations with NATO commensurate with its status as a world power. NATO, however, insisted that all participants in the Partnership for Peace plan be equal and demanded that Russia first join the program before discussing any special relationship. At a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels on May 25, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev announced that Russia would join the Partnership for Peace plan "unconditionally." But he proposed that in the meantime Russia and NATO establish more extensive cooperation in military and security matters and urged NATO to sign a separate cooperation agreement with Russia on European and global security. Evidently, special ties between Russia and NATO remained the cornerstone of the new conception proposed by Grachev. Essentially, Russia wanted greater say in international affairs, specifically, the right of veto on international issues within the framework of the treaty organization. The dilemma facing NATO was that it could neither neglect Russia's request nor meet it. On the one hand, NATO hoped Russia would join the program because a new security mechanism in Europe could hardly work without Russia's participation, and NATO did not want to irritate the nuclear power by disregarding its request. On the other hand, NATO worried that other countries would be displeased if special relations were established with Russia. The treaty organization was also trying to prevent Russia from taking advantage of special relations in order to strengthen its role in NATO. As a compromise, NATO was ready to take Russia's world power status into consideration without conceding the right of veto. In light of NATO's tough stance, Russia readjusted its policy. At a NATO meeting in Istanbul on June 10, Kozyrev announced that Russia would soon sign the partnership for peace plan. Russia based this decision on the following considerations: First, Russia wants to end its dispute with NATO for fear the quarrel could deepen mistrust between the two sides. Second, Russia worries that it will become isolated when other eastern European countries and former Soviet republics join the program one after the other. Third, Russia sees many uncertain factors in the program and should join in order to develop the situation in a direction favorable to the interests of the former Soviet republic. With these compromises, Russia and NATO have finally signed the two documents. But differences remain over Russia's role in NATO and NATO's future role in general. Therefore, both cooperation and disagreement will continue to dominate relations between Russia and NATO, and this relationship will, to a large extent, determine the future pattern of security in Europe.
