It is well known that in the past, especially in recent weeks, not only has the Khmer Rouge resorted to sabotage activities to annihilate law and order and public security within the country, it has also further nurtured the notion of dismembering Cambodia into two parts and taking control of the country once again. This being the case, the appeal for military aid to enable Cambodia to circumvent "the great danger of the Khmer Rouge" does not contradict the country's fundamental law at all. Actually, it suits Cambodia's vital interests perfectly. For this reason, actions by donor countries do not constitute an intervention in the internal affairs of Cambodia as alleged by some countries, especially Thailand. In fact, it should be acknowledged that aid for the reinforcement of Cambodia's defense is also for the promotion of the country's democracy, independence, and sovereignty that the international community has strived to bring to existence through the May 1993 elections. It is really ironic to say that military aid to Cambodia will affect the security interest of its neighbors. The tiny and badly damaged Cambodia does not have enough force to act as have been alleged. Obviously, only aid to the Khmer Rouge and obstruction of assistance to Cambodia's legitimate government is tantamount to interference in the country's internal affairs.
