I believe, said Luzhkov, there are two important problems in the message: the combating of crime and the stabilization of the economy. These two problems must be solved as early as possible and to do so available forces should be used efficiently. The Mayor said he was completely unsatisfied by the words said by the president about privatization. The problem should have had more emphasis in the message. The state has received nothing from the voucher privatization campaign: neither money nor a new owner. The completion of the campaign means a failure for the Russian economy, said Luzhkov. The Moscow Mayor believes that the president did right when in his message he spoke about the protection of the Russian-speakers in the CIS countries. I have just returned from Sevastopol and I am alarmed by the fact that the forceful "Ukrainization" of the Russians is taking place there. There are 75 percent of Russians living in the city. I intend to report to the president about this, he said. The Moscow Mayor said that if in such historically Russian cities as Sevastopol and Narva, Russian residents are being forced to take on an alien life style, culture, language and their rights are infringed upon, the problem could develop from a diplomatic one to one with grave social and political consequences.
