FR940223-2-00019 FR940223-2-00016 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Submission of Data by State Educational Agencies AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Notice of dates for submission of State revenue and expenditure reports for fiscal year 1993 and of revisions to those reports. SUMMARY: The Secretary of Education announces a date for the submission by State educational agencies (SEAs) of preliminary expenditure and revenue data and average daily attendance statistics for fiscal year (FY) 1993 and establishes a deadline for any revisions to that information. The Secretary sets these dates to ensure that data are available for timely distribution of Federal funds. The data will be published by the Department's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and will be used by the Secretary in the calculation of allocations for FY 1995 appropriated funds. DATES: The suggested date for submission of preliminary data is March 15, 1994. The mandatory deadline for submission of final data is, including revisions to preliminary data, September 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: SEAs are urged to mail or hand deliver ED Form 2447 (The National Public Education Financial Survey_Fiscal Year 1993) by the first date specified in this notice. SEAs must mail or hand deliver final data and any revisions to preliminary data on or before the mandatory deadline date to_U.S. Department of Education, Office of Educational Research and Improvement, National Center for Education Statistics, Attention: GSAB_Fiscal Survey, 555 New Jersey Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20208&hyph;5651. An SEA may hand deliver any revisions to room 410 of the address above by 4 p.m. (Washington, DC time) on or before the mandatory deadline date. If an SEA's submission is received by NCES after the mandatory deadline date, in order for the submission to be accepted, the SEA must show one of the following as proof that the submission was mailed on or before the mandatory deadline date: (1) A legibly dated U.S. Postal Service postmark. (2) A legible mail receipt with the date of mailing stamped by the U.S. Postal Service. (3) A dated shipping label, invoice, or receipt from a commercial carrier. (4) Any other proof of mailing acceptable to the Secretary. If the SEA mails ED Form 2447 through the U.S. Postal Service, the Secretary does not accept either of the following as proof of mailing: (1) A private metered postmark. (2) A mail receipt that is not dated by the U.S. Postal Service. Note: The U.S. Postal Service does not uniformly provide a dated postmark. Before relying on this method, an SEA should check with its local post office. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. William J. Fowler, Jr., at the address specified above or by telephone: (202) 219&hyph;1921. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the authority of section 406(g) of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1221e&hyph;1(g)), which authorizes NCES to gather data from States on the financing of elementary and secondary education, NCES collects data annually from SEAs through ED Form 2447. The report from SEAs includes attendance, revenue, and expenditure data from which NCES determines the average State per pupil expenditure (SPPE) for elementary and secondary education. In addition to using SPPE data as useful statistics on the financing of elementary and secondary education, the Secretary uses them directly in calculating allocations for certain formula grant programs, including chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (chapter 1), Impact Aid, and Indian Education. Other programs such as title VII of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, the Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education program, and the Drug-Free Schools and Community Act make use of SPPE data indirectly because their formulas are based, in whole or in part, on State chapter 1 allocations. In December 1993, NCES mailed to SEAs ED Form 2447 with instructions and requested that SEAs submit initial data to the Department by March 15, 1994. If an SEA does not submit initial FY 1993 data on ED Form 2447 on or about March 15, 1994, it should inform NCES, in writing, of the delay and the date by which it will submit FY 1993 data. Submissions by SEAs to NCES are edited by NCES and returned to each SEA for verification. NCES acknowledges that data submitted prior to September 6, 1994, may be preliminary and are subject to revision by an SEA not later than September 6, 1994. To ensure timely distribution of Federal education funds based on the best, most accurate data available, NCES establishes, for allocation purposes, a final date by which ED Form 2447 must be submitted. However, if an SEA submits revised data after the final deadline that results in a lower SPPE figure, its allocations may be adjusted downward or the Department may request the SEA to return funds. SEAs should be aware that all of these data are subject to audit and that, if any inaccuracies are discovered in the audit process, the Department may seek recovery of overpayments for the applicable programs. Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e&hyph;1(g). Dated: February 17, 1994. Sharon P. Robinson, Assistant Secretary for Educational Research and Improvement.
