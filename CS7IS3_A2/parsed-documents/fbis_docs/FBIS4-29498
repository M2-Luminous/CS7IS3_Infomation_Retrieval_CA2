[Vo Van Kiet] My visit was to help create conditions for renewed cooperation between Vietnam and these countries. We renewed and restored all the relations we had in the periods from 1992 to early 1993 and from 1993 to early 1994. Vietnam and these countries signed a number of agreements. We signed with the Russian Federation a new treaty to replace the old one, which had been signed with the former Soviet Union. We successfully surmounted this hurdle. The new treaty, though based on the same old friendly spirit, does not follow the old pattern of doing business. The two sides now will conduct business in accordance with the new principles of relations. This will create new advantages for us to expand our friendly cooperation. During this visit, our businessmen and officials from various sectors were able to get in touch with the real situation. Through their exchanges of views and observations, they saw with their own eyes many potentials more substantively. This was a good opportunity for us to rebuild our relations. [Correspondent] How far did Vietnam and these countries discuss those difficulties that obstructed their relations? And is there any prospect that those treaties and agreements already signed between Vietnam and these countries during your visit will soon be implemented? [Vo Van Kiet] They raised their demands with us and also resolved those issues we raised with them such as the question of debt liquidation, the transportation issue, and the question of ensuring synchronization for the working apparatus of both sides. All these issues will be resolved on a step-by-step basis. For instance, Kazakhstan, a land-locked country, asked us for cooperation in ground and air transportation. But we were only interested in railroad cooperation. This time the two sides [Vietnam and Russia] signed a new treaty to replace the old one signed with the former Soviet Union. From now all, all new agreements will be based on the new principles laid down in this treaty. Based on the spirit of this new treaty, we will review various old agreements to adjust and revise inappropriate provisions. Both sides will continue to discuss issues concerning the avoidance of double taxation and measures to promote investment protection while strengthening cooperation in the implementation of the treaty. [Correspondent] Will the establishment of direct relationships between Vietnam and the CIS states be more advantageous than the relationship between Vietnam and those republics of the former Soviet Union in the past? [Vo Van Kiet] In the past, we made contact with various Soviet Republics through the former Soviet Union, now we have established direct relationships with the CIS states as well as with the Russian Federation. This has created favorable conditions for us to directly get in touch and closely cooperate with these independent states. Dear friends: the Prime Minister also answered many other questions asked by newsmen, including those issues related to Vietnamese workers abroad, measures and orientations for cooperation with these friendly states to reorganize Vietnamese workers and provide jobs for them, plans to help and create favorable conditions for them to return home at the end of their contracts, and appropriate measures to deal with those Vietnamese workers who violate the law of the host countries.
