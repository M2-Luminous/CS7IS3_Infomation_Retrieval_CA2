This time the subject of the controversy is not a confused vote by what is little more than an honorary body -- namely, the European Parliament; or a remark by a former prime minister, who is now merely a party leader -- namely, Michel Rocard. In the case of an incumbent chief of state, who is also one of the most authoritative political figures of the European Union -- namely, Francois Mitterrand -- the Berlusconi government decided to treat it as a diplomatic incident. Spiteful Reference "Nothing frightening has happened in Italy," the Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's office] replied tersely. "The majority and the government that the Italian people have chosen in no way represent anything suspicious. Our country's media and the institutions operate in a context of freedom and observance of the law." But this time the note was not confined to a defense of the recent election result, and proceeds from an attack, using language more appropriate to a newspaper editorial than to a diplomatic document. "Nobody in our country would ever dream of passing judgment on the conditions of legitimacy in which public powers are exercised in the allied democracies -- even less for the purposes of a domestic political struggle." This latter was a spiteful reference -- the insinuation that the French chief of state spoke mainly as the leader of a Socialist Party defeated in the elections, divided, and in difficulties; and that his aim was to hit the victorious French Right of Edouard Balladur, much more than Berlusconi. The conclusion is very terse, too: "Self-control and respect for others, however, are virtues that demand reciprocity." This was enough to make it clear that the wound inflicted by the interview to the traditionally cordial relations between Rome and Paris will be difficult to heal -- if not for French diplomacy, then certainly for the Elysee Palace [French president's office], at least until its incumbent changes next year. Italian diplomatic circles yesterday evening were wondering, entirely informally, whether the incident would have repercussions in the coming weeks --which will bring some important decisions for the future of the EC (starting with the appointment of Delors' successor) -- on the two countries' choice of alignment. Traditionally, it is Mitterrand who has both formulated and represented France's European policy. And in recent weeks the Berlusconi government has made it known that Italy's traditional alliance with Paris and Bonn on the policy of European federalism can no longer be taken for granted and that Rome is paying increasing attention to London and to Britain's ideas about the development of the European Union. But this scenario has nothing to do with yesterday's response from the Palazzo Chigi. When the ANSA and AGI bulletins, relaying the international agency reports, reached the Palazzo Chigi at about 1900 hours yesterday, the ill feeling which emerged did not concern European policy but probably related to the much older issue of Berlusconi's and Fininvest's unsuccessful attempts to extend their presence in French television, frustrated (as in Britain) not only by rigid antitrust laws but also by the explicit mistrust of the French political world. Indeed, it was the thrust of Mitterrand's accusations and anxieties that stung. Indeed, the French president shifted the focus of the polemics against the new Italian Government over the anxieties repeatedly expressed on several sides in recent weeks concerning the presence in it of Fascist ministers. On this point the French president, while standing by his earlier statements, seemed very prudent, ruled our any immediate threats, and "placed his confidence in the Italian people." Unsure Ground But Mitterrand sank his knife into a political area in which the Berlusconi government feels much less secure and more exposed. Italian legislation on television is already much more accommodating to conglomerates, and Fininvest's hegemony has already been the subject of criticisms. Mitterrand's anxieties about his transfer to politics and then the government are rekindling the most dangerous controversies in Italy which, unlike those over the presence of National Alliance ministers, involve even the majority forces -- more openly the League, less explicitly the National Alliance.
