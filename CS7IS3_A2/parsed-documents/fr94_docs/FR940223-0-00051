FR940223-0-00051 FR940223-0-00021 III. Contents of This Final Rule This final rule adds 1 site to the General Superfund Section of the NPL. This site is ALCOA (Point Comfort)/Lavaca Bay in Point Comfort, Texas, which was proposed to the NPL in Proposal # 15 (58 FR 34018, June 23, 1993) based on an HRS score of 28.50 or greater. The group number identified for this site based on its score is 4/5. Group numbers are determined by arranging the NPL by rank and dividing it into groups of 50 sites. For example, a site in Group 4 has a score that falls within the range of scores covered by the fourth group of 50 sites on the NPL. Public Comments EPA reviewed all comments received on this site. The formal comment period ended on August 23, 1993. EPA has carefully considered public comments submitted and has made certain modifications in response to those comments. EPA's response to site-specific public comments and explanations of any score changes made as a result of such comments are addressed in the ``Support Document for the Revised National Priorities List Final Rule_February 1994.'' Statutory Requirements CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites ``among'' the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, and section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certain enumerated and ``other appropriate'' factors in doing so. Thus, as a matter of policy, EPA has the discretion not to use CERCLA to respond to certain types of releases. Where other authorities exist, placing sites on the NPL for possible remedial action under CERCLA may not be appropriate. Therefore, EPA has chosen not to place certain types of sites on the NPL even though CERCLA does not exclude such action. If, however, the Agency later determines that sites not listed as a matter of policy are not being properly responded to, the Agency may place them on the NPL. Economic Impacts The costs of cleanup actions that may be taken at any site are not directly attributable to placement on the NPL. EPA has conducted a preliminary analysis of economic implications of today's amendment to the NPL. EPA believes that the kinds of economic effects associated with this revision generally are similar to those effects identified in the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) prepared in 1982 for the revisions to the NCP pursuant to section 105 of CERCLA and the economic analysis prepared when amendments to the NCP were proposed (50 FR 5882, February 12, 1985). The Agency believes the anticipated economic effects related to adding 1 site to the NPL can be characterized in terms of the conclusions of the earlier RIA and the most recent economic analysis. Inclusion of a site on the NPL does not itself impose any costs. It does not establish that EPA necessarily will undertake remedial action, nor does it require any action by a private party or determine its liability for site response costs. Costs that arise out of site responses result from site-by-site decisions about what actions to take, not directly from the act of listing itself. Nonetheless, it is useful to consider the costs associated with responding to the site included in this rulemaking. The major events that follow the proposed listing of a site on the NPL are a search for potentially responsible parties and a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine if remedial actions will be undertaken at a site. Design and construction of the selected remedial alternative follow completion of the RI/FS, and operation and maintenance (O&M) activities may continue after construction has been completed.
