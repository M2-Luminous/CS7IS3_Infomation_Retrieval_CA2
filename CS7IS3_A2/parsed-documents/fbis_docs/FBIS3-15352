Fighters of the Tajik opposition based in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan are subjecting border posts as well as villages near the border to mass shelling. They are even using rocket projectiles. In connection with this the Republic of Tajikistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in which it says that the Tajik side reserves the right to act, even to the extent of destroying fire points of the Tajik opposition fighters on the territory of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan if the Government of this state does not take the necessary measures. [video cuts from studio shot of Mirsaidov to show Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander of the collective CIS peacekeeping forces in the Republic of Tajikistan, being interviewed by an unidentified reporter] [Begin Pyankov recording] Today we cannot permit artillery and mortars to fire for half an hour with the aim of destroying a border post, a kyshlak [village], or other positions. We cannot remain inactive so it is precisely at this point that the danger arises of our forces, including the peacekeeping forces -- the Russian border guards and subunits of the Armed Forces of Tajikistan -- being drawn into battles with subunits and their firepower--to put it simply, the enemy forces on Afghan territory. All of this can further complicate the situation--and I stress complicate the situation--and nothing more. There cannot be any new major war, any new large-scale killing ground or new large-scale action. [end recording] Regardless of the difficult situation in which our country finds itself, the people of Tajikistan look to the future with optimism. Enlivenment of the social and political life indicates that with every passing day the people are becoming even more optimistic.
