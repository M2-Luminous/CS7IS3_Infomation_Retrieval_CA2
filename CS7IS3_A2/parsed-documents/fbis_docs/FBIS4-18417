The boss of the Elf oil company meets with Birgit Breuel, the boss of Treuhand, the group responsible for the privatization of industry in the former East Germany. The Frenchman tells the German of his intention to renege on the construction of a gigantic refinery, a 15 billion-franc project launched by Philippe Jaffre's predecessor, Loik Le Floch-Prigent. Jaffre explains that he no longer believes the refinery can be profitable given the collapse of oil prices. According to the gossip going around, he thinks that Elf funds would be much more use fully invested in the large groups privatized by [Prime Minister Edouard] Balladur. Reacting to Jaffre's remarks, Birgit Breuel brandishes the draft of a letter denouncing the irregularities that, in her view, occurred during the privatization of Elf. She threatens to send a copy of the letter to the French commission on stock exchange operations and to its U.S. counterpart, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), if Jaffre does not start work on the project on 28 February, as envisioned in the contract. Three days later, surprise surprise, Jaffre receives a notably less acrimonious missive containing no more threats of denunciation. As for German officials, they affirm they will do everything possible to avoid the worst, that is, demanding from Elf the 5 billion franc-indemnity envisioned in case of non-compliance with the contract. What happened after the stormy meeting at the airport that made the Germans soft-pedal the issue? The deal had almost become an affair of state. Chancellor Kohl, who expected that the refinery would symbolize his policy of maintaining employment in the former East Germany, was furious. At the Elysee, Francois Mitterrand's advisers contended that Elf's exit would complicate the already deteriorating Franco-German relations. And at the Matignon [office of the prime minister], Ambroise Roux, one of the old "justices of the peace" for management, had asked Balladur to compel Jaffre to respect his obligations, because French credibility was at stake. Fortunately, the Germans understood they would not easily find someone to replace Elf, given the drop in oil prices. Therefore, in early March, the Elf boss received a second letter from Germany granting him another postponement. According to the PETROSTRATEGTES magazine, the French company now has until 30 April to lay the cornerstone. And a Russian oil company, Rosneft, has promised to participate in the project to the tune of 20 percent by furnishing crude oil. Between oilmen, it is perhaps normal to pay in liquid.
