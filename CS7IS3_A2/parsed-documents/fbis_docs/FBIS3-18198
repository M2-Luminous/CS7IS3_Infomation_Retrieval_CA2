The meeting is seen as the first step towards enhancing relations and understanding between the organization and Russian officials. The conference comes after an influential Russian newspaper reported last Friday that Moscow might establish relations with the PKK in retaliation for "Ankara's use of the Chechen card" against Russia. The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA said in its report that such an initiative on Moscow's part was natural, and argued that it was illogical that their relations with Kurds were so limited. The paper also said there were representatives of the PKK both in Russia and in Armenia, and that they had established contact with officials there. Moscow-based sources said on Monday that the conference, called "History of Kurdistan," was organized by the Kurdistan Committee-Moscow, one of the PKK's committee offices that are widespread throughout the region. The main participant at the conference is the PKK's so-called Kurdistan National Liberation Front (ERNK), although "other Kurdish parties" have also been invited to attend. According to TDN sources, the Russian Ministry of National Affairs is actively involved in organizing the meeting, in which the "current developments in Turkey" will be the main topic discussed. The nationalist Kurdish movement in general, a review of the Kurdish movement in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, as well as terrorism, were cited among the issues to be discussed. Sources close to the PKK had said earlier this year that the PKK had rented several apartment blocks in Moscow and was aiming at improving its relations with Russia. In recent weeks, messages have been sent from the ERNK to Russian officials requesting for the establishment of relations and cooperation. Although Russia's policy related to Turkish Kurds has not been voiced openly, Western diplomatic sources say that Moscow seems to want to see Ankara sitting at the table and negotiating with the PKK. On March 1, Bilgin Unan, deputy undersecretary at the Turkish Foreign Ministry, will be visiting Moscow as part of routine political consultations between the two countries. A statement released by the ministry said on Monday that Unan would visit Russia as guest of First Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin. Bilateral relations and regional and international problems are to be on the agenda of talks.
