At a conference for Higher Education Ministry officials, Rodriguez said Cuba has an ample level of certitude on imports, exports, and other resources, in addition to its economic planning system. He estimated that the changes introduced in the Cuban economy can be slow according to the people's needs but not according to the possibilities of the island. Among the economic measures implemented since last August, Rodriguez mentioned the depenalization of the dollar, the opening to foreign investments, and the increase of tasks authorized for self-employment. The Cuban finance minister said 1994 will be better than 1993 for Cuba from the economic standpoint, "as it will break the violent economic fall suffered from 1989 to 1993." He based his assertion on the possibilities of having a cheaper sugarcane harvest, the recovery of sugar and nickel prices--two of the country's main economic sectors--and getting tourism to grow 25 percent. Other factors that will mark this year in the Cuba economy, according to the specialist, will be the substitution of imports, the discovery of new oil deposits, the recovery of fuel, and an increase -- although not an extraordinary one -- in agricultural production.
