Georgi Pirinski, a member of the OSD Political Council, who until yesterday was the deputy of Nora Ananieva [leader of the BSP parliamentary group], has withdrawn from this post. Here is what he said to our reporter about his motives. [Correspondent] Mr. Pirinski, was your decision to withdraw from the leaderships of the BSP and the BSP parliamentary group a personal one or one made by the OSD, and what made this step necessary? [Pirinski] It was my own personal decision. It is not connected with personal motives, but with the issue of what kind of policy the party will follow in practice during the coming months. As you know, since the autumn of last year a discussion has been in progress within the BSP on whether the party should actively commit itself to the market reforms or whether it should adopt a more rigid and closed position in defense of social rights and social demands. The recent BSP congress correctly concluded that commitment to the reforms put the BSP in a very good light in the eyes of society as a factor for stabilizing the state and making some attempt to move forward. However, seeing how the accents were placed at the plenum following the congress, what is in store for us? In my view, the very composition of the Executive Bureau and the commissions lends weight to the opposite viewpoint -- the rigid or closed position. I do not find this position well-founded, and this viewpoint is not in the interests of either the BSP or society.
