During the meeting, the BNS leaders discussed the six issues they announced from the very beginning of the talks. The talks concluded half an hour ago and the BNS leader stated the following to our reporter Sorin Croitorescu: [Begin Costin recording] In our talks with President Iliescu this evening we advanced six points. As we affirmed at the beginning of the discussions, we had the advantage of being the third confederation that met with the president, so the joint claims of the major trade unions have already been discussed and over discussed. Thus, during our talks this evening we had the opportunity to also approach other subjects that we consider of maximum importance. First of all, we provided arguments and reasons that led to the current relation between our confederation and Romania's government. The reason is the lack of a relation of partnership that President Iliescu believes to be the basis for any relations in any society, especially in a society with problems such as the current Romanian society. The second point of our discussion referred to the issue of joint claims, that is the claims of CNSRL [National Confederation of Romania's Free Trade Unions]-Cartel Alfa-BNS, a point on which we did not linger too long because our viewpoints, namely the viewpoints of the two confederations, do not differ. The third point of our discussions was the draft social accord that our confederation submitted at the end of January, and we were surprised to see that there was no reaction whatsoever from the government, presidency, political parties, or even trade unions. Very few people praised or criticized this material and we still believe that only through a social-economic accord can this moment of crisis be overcome. The fourth issue discussed was the memorandum with the IMF. Before the start of talks in the Romanian Parliament, we gave the press an analysis that we allowed ourselves to make. We believe that it is absolutely necessary to present a viewpoint on this memorandum, because even on a superficial reading of the text, one can notice that the memorandum lacks the social component. And as far as all current major transformations that Romania's government wishes to carry out are concerned, if these are not supported by a program of retraining and by the creation of new jobs, then the idea of reform will be destroyed from the very beginning. The reason for this, as I have already mentioned, the social costs will be very high and if we, as partners -- on the one hand we, the trade union confederations and on the other hand the executive power -- will not know how to find a moment of balance in which the costs of the transition should be at the lower possible level, at an acceptable level, we will discredit from the beginning the idea of reform. This evening, it was suggested to us that we should continue the discussions that started yesterday with the executive and as soon as we almost reach the final stage of the talks -- regardless of whether or not all issues will have been solved -- we will certainly have the mediation of the presidential institution in the conflict that exists between trade union groups, that is trade union confederations and the Romanian Government.
