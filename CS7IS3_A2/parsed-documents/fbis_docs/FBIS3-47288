Namibian President Sam Nujoma said Namibia would continue to support in the future, too, the Korean people in the struggle to realize reunification of the country. He said the United States has not abandoned its aggressive nature toward other countries. Mohamed Bel Hadj Amor, general secretary of the People's Unity Party of Tunisia, actively supported the tasks to glorify the cause of Korean-style socialism, the policy of national reunification and foreign policy set forth by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year address. In the New Year, too, the DPRK will continue to exalt its might as a powerful country in the van of the developing countries, he said. He hoped that the concrete wall, a symbol of Korea's division, would be removed and an epochal advance be made in the struggle of the Korean people to reunify the country.
