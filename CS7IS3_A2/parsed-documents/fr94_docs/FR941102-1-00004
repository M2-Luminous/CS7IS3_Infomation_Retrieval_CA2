FR941102-1-00004 FR941102-1-00001 Elimination of Reporting Requirements in 10 CFR Part 73.71(c)(2) 10 CFR Part 73.71(c)(1) requires that licensees maintain a current log for recording safeguards events. An event that must be recorded in the log is defined in Appendix G, Part 73 as ``Any failure, degradation, or discovered vulnerability in a safeguard system. *␣*␣*.'' 3 10 CFR 73.71(c)(2) requires that a copy of the log be submitted quarterly to the NRC. 3 The full definition in 10 CFR Part 73, Appendix G, Section II is: (a) Any failure, degradation, or discovered vulnerability in a safeguard system that could have allowed unauthorized or undetected access to a protected area, material access area, controlled access area, vital area, or transport had compensatory measures not been established. (b) Any other threatened, attempted, or committed act not previously defined in Appendix G with the potential for reducing the effectiveness of the safeguard system below that committed to in a licensed physical security or contingency plan or the actual condition of such reduction in effectiveness. The NRC proposes to eliminate the requirement that licensees submit copies of the safeguard event logs. Until recently, the NRC staff published an annual report which contained trending analysis of log events. However, the NRC now believes that the greatest benefits of dissemination of these statistics on safeguards equipment performance and lessons learned about the causes and prevention of safeguards equipment malfunctions have been realized, and that continuing to publish that report is no longer cost effective. However, licensees will still be required to enter events in the logs, and make those logs available for review and inspection at the respective plant sites. Having the logs available at the plant site should be sufficient for normal record reviews, and any necessary in-depth reviews. Therefore, the NRC believes that public health and safety will not be adversely affected if the logs are no longer submitted to the NRC. Public Comments The former Nuclear Management and Resources Council, now known as the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), commented that power reactor licensees should be deleted from the list of licensees subject to the provisions of 10 CFR 73.71(c). According to NEI, comparisons among plants using the data provided in the logs are not meaningful because the number of events reported by each site is dramatically influenced by a number of site-specific variables such as the number and design of system components and unique physical arrangements. NEI stated that comments received from industry were almost unanimous in advising that licensees receive insignificant information from the NRC's quarterly ``Safeguards Events Analysis Report.'' NEI further commented that the real benefit in recording safeguards events lies in its usefulness as a management tool to measure a plant's specific performance, independent of other facilities. One licensee commented that if the requirement to submit a log to the NRC were not deleted, the frequency of submittal should be reduced from 4 times each year to 2 times each year as required for submittal of fitness-for-duty performance data in 10 CFR 26.71(d). The licensee noted that timeliness would not be adversely impacted in a significant way by annual or semiannual rather than quarterly reporting. The licensee also suggested that evaluation of trends is more meaningful when based on events over 6 months or a year rather than only 3 months. The NRC believes that, in the early years of this program, there was considerable benefit from comparisons of the performance of a site's security equipment with the performance of the rest of the industry, notwithstanding differences in site-specific variables. However, the NRC now believes that the greatest benefits have been realized and that continuing the program as a regulatory tool has a diminishing cost benefit. As such, the NRC agrees with the comments that the primary benefit in logging events is the usefulness of the log as a means for the licensees to track and trend the performance of the safeguards systems at their own plants. In fact, the NRC has already discontinued publication of the ``Safeguards Events Analysis Report.'' Although the NRC is proposing to eliminate the requirement that licensees submit their safeguards event logs, licensees would still be required to enter events into their logs and maintain those logs on site for review by the NRC inspectors. Written Reports This proposed rule would not require additional written reports. On the contrary, under this proposed rule, reporting will be reduced for all licensees under 10 CFR Parts 50, 55, and 73. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion The NRC has determined that this proposed rule is the type of action described in the categorical exclusion, 10 CFR 51.22(c)(3)(iii). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this regulation.
