He urged it to investigate in detail the attempt on the life of parliament member Vladimir Bortnik, to ensure law and order, and to set up an effective legal mechanism for this purpose. "An outrageous attempt on the life of Vladimir Bortnik, Ukrainian parliament member and president of a state concern providing material and technical supplies and services to the country's agro-industrial complex, was committed on May 30," Zvyahilskyy said. "The Ukrainian political and state leader was gravely wounded by five bullets fired pointblank by hired killers. His life is in danger." "The anti-state mafiosi structures," Zvyahilskyy stressed, "which have lost the elections, are now unleashing a reign of terror against the state and the people. It is not without reason that the killers have chosen Vladimir Bortnik as their victim. He had opposed attempts to rob Ukraine, refusing to buy oil products and other materials for agriculture at prices, dictated by the mafia. "The brazen attempt on the life of Ukrainian parliament member Vladimir Bortnik, committed in broad daylight in the very centre of Kiev, shows that even the first frail sprouts of economic and political stability in Ukraine and the government-planned course of gradually raising the people's living standards infuriate the anti-state groupings and mafiosi structures, which are used to shamelessly robbing our country and our people. They have repeatedly threatened to make short work of members of the government and me personally, as acting premier of Ukraine. Now they have gone over from threats to outright terror." "The impunity with which the anti-state mafiosi groupings had acted so far," Zvyahilskyy said, "cannot be tolerated any longer, because this threatens the national security of Ukraine and the vital interests of our citizens."
