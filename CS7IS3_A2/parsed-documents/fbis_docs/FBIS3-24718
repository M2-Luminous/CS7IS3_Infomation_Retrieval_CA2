Answering questions from his audience at an ANC rally in Rustenburg on Sunday morning, Mr Mandela said the TEC knew ANC supporters in the homeland were being harassed and intimidated. He said the TEC was addressing this problem and would take appropriate action, saying he realised Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope was persecuting the ANC. But he assured the crowd President Mangope would be powerless after the April 27 elections. "He is fighting a losing battle. The TEC is now the authoritative power in Bophuthatswana, and we are not without teeth," Mandela said. The crowd when ecstatic when they thought the ANC leader said President Mangope did not have long to "live". Realising he had been misheard, Mr Mandela quickly clarified he had meant President Mangope did not have long to "lead" as president of the homeland. Answering Bophuthatswana residents' fears of being harassed if found with a South African identity document, he pointed out voters could use their Bop [Bophuthatswana] ID documents. Amplifying his leader, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation (MK); ANC military wing] chief Joe Modise said Bophuthatswana was completely dependent on the South Africa for its survival. However, if the situation did not improve, Mr Modise said they might have to move troops into the homeland the elections to allow political freedom. Taking a dig at the National Party's campaigning tactics Mr Mandela said it would cost tax payers nearly R[Rand]500,000 if the NP had to pay people R10 each "for food and transport" to get a crowd. "If the national party offers you stew, potatoes and an orange to go to the rally, I say go. And then vote for the ANC," he said, smiling broadly. He said the NP's electioneering tricks created hostility. Reacting to accusations from the NP that campaigners were being harassed by ANC supporters in the townships, Mr Mandela said ANC offices in five rightwing towns and the homes of two ANC officials had been bombed recently. The NP had not complained or taken any action to prevent more attacks, he said. It was in the interest of all ANC supporters to allow the NP to campaign freely in the townships. "I appeal to you all. I don't want that party to say they lost the elections because they were not allowed to put their views across to everyone." His American style of campaigning to meet the people and mingle with supporters nearly came to grief on Sunday. As crowds surged forward to shake Mr Mandela's hand at his car, a trapped reporter nearly had her legs crushed when the bodyguards in the car behind surged forward to close the gap. She was forced to leap onto the bonnet of the car and spend a terrifying few moments while the bodyguards sped forward to try and get her off the car. Only cries from the crowd persuaded them to stop and allow her to be carried away. A peace monitor was overheard commenting: "There is no proper control here today. The marshals are ineffective and this incident is a warning that someone could get seriously hurt soon if security measures are not beefed up". A minute's silence was observed at the rally for former Cosatu [Congress of South African Trade Unions] president and mineworker, Elijah Barayi, who was buried in Carletonville on Sunday.
