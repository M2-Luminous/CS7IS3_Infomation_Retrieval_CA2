Like rustics in other parts of China, farmers in the province are now enjoying an increasingly important role in the urban economy. In Anshan, one of the province's largest industrial cities, 50,000 farmers are now engaged at construction sites in the city. They earned more than one billion yuan last year, one-third of the total earned by all builders in the city. The rural builders have won out in fierce competitions with urban builders owing to their flexibility in business operation and a strong sense of responsibility as well as efficiency. They have received national prizes for painting, glazed tile stamping and terrazzo floor polishing. A construction team led by Dong Shaowen, a former farmer, won the top national building prize last year. A village-run real estate development company in the suburbs of Shenyang, capital of the province, has built more than 140 buildings for sale, covering a total floor space of 500,000 square meters. In the coastal city of Yingkou, rural builders are playing an equally important role as urban builders in the construction of a port in the city. A farmer in the suburbs of Dalian, also a coastal city of the province, invested 400,000 yuan in the city's sports shop seven years ago. The shop has now topped 30 million yuan in sales. It has business with more than 600 enterprises from over 20 provinces and cities in the country. Rural people are also found dealing with refrigerator production, top-class shoe-making, department stores, restaurants and entertainment centers. Experts say rural people not only make money but also re-invigorate their ideas in urban areas. With the market economy being established in the country, rural people are sure to play an even bigger role in the country's urban market.
