Yuriy Povkh, under the rubric "The National Army": "Clipped Wings, or Why Have Innocent Young Pilots Proved Guilty?"] [Text] Breaking the silence of the frosty winter morning, the silver-winged fighter planes thundered over the town. Its residents, who have lately grown unaccustomed to regular flights, watched in amazement as the ferociously elegant MIGs performed steep 360-degree turns. A flight day was beginning. This was a day out of the ordinary for the pilots of the fighter regiment. For some, this meant the opportunity to rise once again into the skies, feel themselves masters in the air, see for themselves how obediently their fearsome military machines were behaving -- these marvels of late twentieth-century engineering. Yet, the usual bravura intonation was lacking in the words "out of the ordinary": One could hear undisguised bitterness and sadness in the voices of the pilots when the talk turned to flying. Why? Because they compared the flights they had just completed to offering a drop of water to someone dying of thirst in the desert. That is why the pilots took extreme care as they lifted their winged machines into the sky. Moreover, the weather that day did not give them much joy: Dense snow that hid the horizon alternated with brilliant sunshine. At times, this produced a kind of "cocktail" -- a term used by the aviators to describe difficult weather conditions -- over the airfield and the designated flying zone. Nonetheless, none of this prevented Col. V. Yavorskyy, the commander of the regiment, and his subordinates from demonstrating their excellent flying skills. Thus, Maj. Valeriy Nedbay, the senior navigator, performed his assignment with distinction by executing a difficult flight, hitting his target, and landing with the help of stand-by controls. An equal degree of proficiency was exhibited by Maj. Vyacheslav Kamchatnyy and Maj. Mykola Onyshchenko, captains Andriy Lyashenko, Vyacheslav Kovalenko, Vitaliy Bryzhadov, and others. In other words, they showed that "there was still powder in the old powder horns." Unfortunately, however, many pilots, who are regarded as young, were not given the opportunity to rise into the skies. All they could do was watch their colleagues from the ground. Captain Viktor Ostapenko was one of those who remained on the ground. As it turned out, this had nothing to do with his age. He has been an officer for five years. Under the earlier standards, he would have been wearing the insignia of airman second class for the last two years. But this has not happened. This is not because of any failing on Viktor's part. Nor can we talk of failings on the part of any of the other pilots; we need only recall that they are often called peculiar because of their fanatical devotion to the skies. It is the chronic scarcity of fuel that has clipped the wings of Ostapenko and his colleagues, (he is hardly alone). As a result, the airman has meager flight experience. During all of last year, he spent only four hours in the air. An absurd figure, to say the least. But even this figure is misleading, because Capt. Ostapenko spent the lion's share of this time on routine testing of the level of his proficiency. Every fighter pilot has to undergo such testing during the year. This is hardly a matter of improving flying skills; it is a matter of not losing the level of qualification already attained. For the sake of comparison, let me say that a pilot in the U.S. Air Force, who has flown fewer than 50 hours in any year, is regarded as potentially accident-prone and is kept under watchful observation by his command. Obviously, it would be wrong to say that everything has been allowed to drift in the regiment and that good bread is being wasted on the pilots. Clearly, the command of the regiment does not currently have the forces and means that are at the disposal of the armies of developed countries. Consequently, the unit is conducting systematic instruction closely linked with combat training. The pilots are improving their theoretical knowledge and tempering their bodies physically. (Most often, this consists of cross-country races [kros], which, through the irony of fate, are conducted on the landing strip). Instruction on the shooting range is not at all rare these days. In a word, Col. Yavorskyy is doing everything in his power to ensure that the regiment assigned to him should remain a fighting unit. But you must admit that the pilot's job is to fight in the air and not on the ground. What will be the consequences of this kind of "freeze" in the training of air personnel? I heard the answer to this question from Lt. Col. Mykola Horyachov, senior airman and inspector of the rayon directorate of the anti-aircraft defense force [PPO]. Commenting on the existing situation, he said: "At present, there has been a virtual halt in the training of young pilots in the regiment for reasons that we all know. Small wonder, therefore, that potentially promising officers, who have served for five to seven years, are openly admitting that they are afraid to fly. `If things go on this way, there will be more takeoffs than landings,' say the pilots. And they are right. Because the making of a professional pilot has always been closely linked with the mentorship or more experienced pilots. Unfortunately, we do not have this today. It is always easier to destroy something than to build it. The `old men' will retire in a few years, and the young lads will not even have an opportunity to feel the safety of wings. Because the experience amassed in bits and pieces by more than one generation of fighter pilots will remain unutilized. There is absolutely no doubt that all of this will have a negative impact on the future fate of the aviation of Ukraine's anti-aircraft defense component [PPO]." A pessimistic prognosis, as you can see. One would very much like to believe that Lt. Col. M. Horyachyy's words are not prophetic. But reality dictates its own logic. A closer examination reveals that the problem is not solely confined to the fuel shortage. The technical condition of the airplanes themselves is also of concern to everybody. First and foremost, the condition of the so- called "sparok", which are used to train pilots and to refresh their skills. There are only two such planes left in the regiment. A third has been sent for repairs to Russia, and, it appears, that is the end of that trainer airplane. The regiment cannot perform these intricate repairs on its own. Our eastern neighbor also makes new spare parts and motors. How are these training fighter planes, which require continual maintenance because they are the most frequently used, to be kept in the proper technical condition? In other words, even if fuel were to become available, regular flights might not be possible. It might be possible to partly maintain pilot training at the necessary level by using flight simulators. But this, too, is not as simple as it sounds. These expensive machines were left at the previous location where the regiment was stationed, and now the lack of funds makes it difficult to transport them to the regiment's new headquarters. They cannot be transported like bricks, because they are delicate machines, filled with electronics. Moreover, the need for repeated assembly will inevitably have an adverse effect on the future use of these flight simulators. And so, like Mohammed who was forced to go to the mountain when it failed to come to him, the pilots now travel hundreds of kilometers to "fly" the flight simulators; moreover, spending large sums of both the state's and their own money to do so. But the flight simulators are not the most serious problem to have resulted from the redeployment of the regiment. The move itself shook the whole system of the aviators' lives to its very foundations, as they say. Specifically because of the relocation, some dozen and a half pilots, most of whom held command posts, have left the regiment. And those who remained were adversely affected by this "experiment." It "ran over them" like a steam roller. The equipment was transported, but apparently no one gave much thought to the people. The following statistics tell the whole sad story: 40 percent of the officers and warrant officers have apartments at their former place of service. And those who had no apartments to begin with have sent their families to live with their parents. They themselves live in barracks. Recently, still another problem was added to all the problems that the regiment already has: Complete disarray in providing the regiment with financial security. Not once have the aviators received their pay on time at their new location. The delays have lasted up to a month. On the day that I visited the regiment, the delay had substantially exceeded even this period of time. And there is no one to complain to that you have a family and children, who need to eat every day. As to the transfer pay that is to be paid when a serviceman is stationed to a new location, close to 40 percent of the officers and warrant officers simply never got it. By now, the galloping inflation has "eaten up" this money. Small wonder that in this difficult situation requests for discharge from the Armed Forces have come down like autumn leaves. Close to two dozen pilots (!) and thirty engineers and technicians have expressed their desire to leave the army. The pilots are not deterred even by the fact that they are unlikely to find a job in their specialty in civilian life. Currently, civil aviation's own pilots do not know what to do with themselves. Moreover, it is no easy matter to retrain a fighter ace into a civilian slow-speed cruiser [tykhokhid]. The difference between these two kinds of flying equipment is approximately as great as between a Formula-one racing car and the Zaporozhets. Nevertheless, those who have decided to leave the army are resolved to do so at any price. Some are even prepared to give up their pensions -- their rightful reward for service -- just as long as they are allowed to leave. But the highest staff does not act on the requests of these officers, and, in my view, the given situation was very aptly described by one of those who wants to leave: "It is as if we had been sold into slavery -- they neither allow us to serve nor to leave." Incidentally, the overwhelming majority of officers who have expressed a desire to be discharged into the reserves are airmen first class -- the army's golden fund, as it were, the mentors of the young. How can one help but recall the words of Lt. Col. Horyachyy? They say that the pilots who do not have the opportunity to fly in their units will soon be sent to flight schools. There they will once again pilot training airplanes. Undoubtedly, even this desperate step could keep the situation under control for a while. But for how long? Will this provide a fundamental solution to the problem, considering that these schools are themselves maintained on "starvation rations"? It seems to me that the processes that are currently under way in the aviation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are becoming more and more reminiscent of a well-planned diversion, aimed at depriving the country of its fighter aviation in the shortest possible time. Judging by the statements of some people's deputies, they still fail to understand (three years later) the need for an army, regarding it as no more than an obedient supplier of military equipment that can be sold to fill some of the holes in the state budget. To be sure, equipment can be replaced in time (although this, too, is very problematical), but what to do about the people who when asked on the questionnaire "Will you serve in the Armed Forces if the present situation remains unchanged?" unanimously anwered "No!" A pilot must fly. Always, the harshest punishment for a pilot was to be kept from flying. Today, through no fault of their own, most flight personnel have been punished in just such a way. And now the once most combat capable regiment, which has glorious military traditions and a huge collective store of experience, is being forced to give up one by one the high positions it had won. Just a short time ago, its pilots were the visiting card, as it were, of all our Armed Forces. There is hardly a high-ranking guest to whom they did not demonstrate their skills -- in the skies of Ukraine, as well as abroad! Here is but one situation that I witnessed. I recall the outburst of astonishment from those present in the fall of last year at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Kiev, when the fighter pilots emerged out of a thick fog and streaked like lightning above the steep banks of the Dnieper. On that occasion, they did what few aviators are able to do... I firmly believe that pilots are born. Naturally, you can teach a person to operate a complicated fighting machine and to transport large shipments, but you cannot instill a love of the sky in an individual. This requires an inner passion of the soul, a vocation -- a strong amalgam of strength, courage, and will. The celebrated French writer and professional pilot, Antoine de St. Exupery, was a thousand times right when he wrote that he would give all the gold in the world to experience just one flight. Apart from this purely spiritual aspect, there is also an economic one. This, too, cannot be overlooked. * * * Have you ever considered how much the state spends to train a single pilot? It turns out that it spends the same amount as to train twenty physicians! And all these funds come from the pockets of taxpayers. That being the case, should we treat our pilots in such a thoughtless manner and clip their wings?
