The announcement of Russian mediation in a dispute in the south of Balkans will not please the West and NATO in the least. They are, according to what the weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS writes today, already rather alarmed by Russia's rapid and unexpected diplomatic offensive. Although Greece's official reply to Moscow's proposal to mediate in resolving the dispute with Skopje has not been made public here, TO VIMA announces the beginning of a new action by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who is already supposed to visit FYROM next week. This latest move by Moscow in an area of the Balkans in which Washington and NATO have shown such an open interest will cause new worries for the West, political circles here assess. It is also being pointed out that the worries of the West will be even greater as this latest Russian diplomatic action confirms the increasingly closer links between Russia and Greece, which are drawn together by friendship between peoples, the same religion, and historic roots. The West's fears of Russia's growing role have already resulted in the so-called Partnership for Peace agreement starting to take the shape of an association of countries based on exclusively anti-Russian orientation, TO VIMA comments. Greece itself announces a much more active and aggressive policy in the Balkans to protect its national interest. According to Khristos Saliberis, chief of the Greek General Staff, carried by today's TO VIMA, Greek policy is moving from the defensive to the offensive, which basically means the neutralization of aggressive neighbors like Turkey and protection of Greeks from Epirus to Cyprus.
