Liu said the Chinese Government, as a host, places great importance on the conference. He told Mongella that the preparations for the conference have been fully conducted according to the plan under the leadership of the State Council and the guidance of the organization committee of the conference. He said the conference's significance and background have been widely popularized in China and the holding of the conference here has won powerful support by the people from all walks of life. Liu said the preparations that China has made have been supported by the United Nations. Both secretary-general and deputy secretary- general of the U.N. have introduced China very good experiences and raised feasible suggestions. Meanwhile, he said: "Mongella has offered us very good ideas in this regard". "It is our inclination to continuously maintain and strengthen such cooperative ties," he added. Mongella said she has known more about China's preparations for the conference after she made a study tour of Beijing and other parts of the country.
