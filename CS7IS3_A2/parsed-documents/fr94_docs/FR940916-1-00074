FR940916-1-00074 FR940916-1-00016 A. Exceptions and Definitions The AAR and several individual railroads recommended that remote control operations and operations with helper locomotives located near the end of the train be excepted from any two-way EOT device requirements. The commenters contended that in these types of operations the purpose of the two-way EOT device, to initiate an emergency brake application commencing at the rear of the train, disappears since either a crew has control of the brakes or the locomotive placed near the end of the train is able to initiate a brake application from other than the head end of the train. Union Pacific Railroad Company also recommended an exception for all empty trains, loaded trains used in short turnaround service of sixty miles where grade is not a factor, and trains with less than 4,000 trailing tons. One commenter also sought an exception for trains equipped with secondary, fully independent brake systems that would require the development of a unique EOT device to initiate an emergency application from the rear of the train. One railroad suggested that no exception should be given to any trains currently using one-way devices and that all trains except those operating with an occupied caboose should be equipped with two-way EOT devices. In defining ``mountain grade'' The American Short Line Railroad Association (ASLRA) and other commenters recommended that the definition should be based on a variety of factors including tonnage, length of grade, speed, percent of grade, and grade distance. The ASLRA felt that a definition based on these factors would be consistent with the intent of Congress not to require every small railroad to fall under the legislation. Several other railroad representatives recommended that the definition of mountain grade be based on both the gradient and distance. Many of the railroad commenters proposed definitions of 1.5&hyph;2 percent grades for a distance of five miles. Two commenters addressed the definition of ``heavy tonnage,'' stating that it should be defined as any train weighing over 100 tons per operative brake. Railroad representatives suggested that the effective date of any regulation requiring the use of two-way devices should be extended for the full four years permitted under the Act. The commenters felt that the later the effective date, the fewer the number of one-way devices that would have to be discarded and the longer the time for railroads to spread out the costs of the new two-way devices. Railroad commenters also recommended a grandfather clause for any two-way equipment purchased prior to the issuance of a final rule. Labor representatives recommended that two-way devices should be required on all cabooseless trains that are not specifically excepted in the RSERA. However, these commenters also admitted that grade situations are probably the area where the devices are most useful. Two labor representatives suggested requiring the use of the devices on grades of one percent or greater. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) wanted ``mountain grades'' defined as areas with one percent grades for two miles. One individual conductor felt that two-way devices should be mandatory on all trains in which the rear is unoccupied, with a weight in excess of 2,000 tons, and a length of greater than 3,000 feet. FRA Conclusions. Based on consideration of Congress' purpose in enacting ยง7 of the RSERA and after review of the comments received and the accidents relied on for support of the use of two-way EOT devices, FRA feels that the devices should be required on trains that operate at speeds in excess of 30 mph and on trains that operate in mountain grade territories. However, FRA believes that certain operations, other than those specifically listed in ยง7 of the RSERA, should also be excepted from the requirements regarding two-way EOT devices. FRA recognizes that the safety concerns for requiring two-way EOT devices are less prevalent in operations (i) of trains having the ability to initiate a brake application from other than the front end and (ii) of trains equipped with fully independent secondary braking systems. FRA further agrees with several of the commenters that the definition of ``mountain grade'' must be based on some formula that takes into account not only the percent of grade but also the length of grade and the speed of the train. FRA thinks that a definition based on these factors would sufficiently limit the number of areas covered by the definition, so as not to be overly burdensome to the industry, and yet would include those areas that would most benefit from the added safety provided by the two-way devices. Furthermore, in order to provide the industry time to acquire a sufficient number of two-way EOT devices and to ease the economic impact of acquiring the devices, FRA proposes to mandate compliance with any final regulation requiring the use of two-way EOT devices as of January 1, 1997. Requiring earlier compliance is not warranted by the marginal safety benefits, and later compliance would not be consistent with the spirit of the RSERA (even if, as is possible, FRA is unable to issue a final rule by December 31, 1993). B. Operational Characteristics Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) reported that it has used two-way EOT devices for seven years and has had no reports of an emergency being initiated from the front end. Although BN experienced some problems with undesired emergencies in the beginning, they were due to start-up problems. CP Rail Systems reported that it has about 700 two-way devices in service since 1989 and has had no undesired emergencies due to faulty operation of the equipment, nor has it had occasion to use the devices. Several railroads that currently use either one-way or two-way EOT devices stated that they have experienced effective communication between the head and rear units in trains as long as 1.5 and 2 miles. However, these railroads also reported that they have experienced communication problems in several circumstances, such as the following: when trains are split by an overpass or viaduct; when trains operate in some mountain or tunnel locations; and when trains are in a major yard where bridges, power lines, towers, and industrial structures are more prevalent.
