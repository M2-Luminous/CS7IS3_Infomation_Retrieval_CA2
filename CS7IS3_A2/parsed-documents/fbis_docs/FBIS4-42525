He noted that they have not been stationed there to attack, but rather to defend the St. Petersburg region and because they are dependent on the services a garrison can provide. Gustav Hagglund, who yesterday drank morning coffee with members of the Association of Women Journalists, said that originally the intention had been that around 60 percent of Soviet soldiers returning home would be stationed in Ukraine and Belarus. Because of the collapse of the Soviet Union these plans came to nought and the majority ended up being stationed in garrisons near the Finnish border. These garrisons have -- in part through Finnish assistance -- been extended in order to be able to accept a larger number of soldiers. One of the reasons why those returning home are keen to live in a garrison is that there they can get free meals every day, while the meal allowance paid out to those who do not live in garrisons is only enough for food for one to two days a week. Hagglund also pointed out that in numerical terms the troop force is hardly increasing at all, since conscripts from the garrisons are being transferred elsewhere. On the other hand, the numbers of permanent staff have increased and the quality of equipment has improved as a result of the transfers. He takes the view that as long as the political situation is under control in Russia the troops do not represent any danger to Finland, but on the contrary are a stabilizing factor. If, however, something happens and problems with discipline arise the troops are of course a danger, Hagglund said. He added, however, that the Russian Army has hitherto been surprisingly united and was not even split by the nationalists' uprisings. Despite poor wages and wages that at times have completely failed to materialize the Army has remained intact. Nor can he recall that the Soviet Army has ever rebelled, so on the whole he views the current situation in Russia with calm. The threat could be that the nationalists take over power or that a civil war flares up because of further fragmentation. On the subject of Finland's own position he said that future defense strategy is entirely dependent on what decision the country reaches on the European Union [EU] question. If Finland and Sweden do not join, cooperation will continue with the Nordic area -- cooperation that came about in the seventies when people came up with the idea of talking about Fennoscandia. If Sweden were to join the EU but not Finland, the points of reference would be different and attention would then be drawn to the Baltic countries that would probably eventually seek membership in the EU. According to Hagglund, membership in the EU would give Finland political support in a crisis situation and with it a certain security guarantee. He takes the view that it is difficult to plan as long as EU membership is an open question. The defense forces are following the same defensive line as before -- a line that, according to Hagglund, could well serve as a model for other small countries. On the subject of the purchase of equipment from Russia and the former East Germany, Gustav Hagglund said that this equipment by no means is scrap, but is equipment that has "filled gaps." However, he admitted that quality has not increased as a result of the purchases and said that what the Army needs now is high-tech equipment to come up to the levels of the nineties. With the purchases made the Army is more on the level of the seventies. However, today there is no money for high-tech equipment and he believes that if the Armed Forces had received 450 million markkas in money instead of in materiel as a way of reducing the Soviet Union's debt to Finland, it is likely that more equipment for the nineties would have been bought. According to the original framework agreement with the Soviet Union for the years 1991-95, Finland would buy equipment totaling 3.7 billion markkas from the Soviet Union. Half of this sum has now been deferred, and of the remaining half, 50 percent has gone to domestic industry. Only one-quarter of the original sum remains in trade with our eastern neighbor.
