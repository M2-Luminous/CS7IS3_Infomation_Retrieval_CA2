Agency officials did not disclose the reason for the apparent reluctance to file a criminal complaint with law enforcement authorities. Jonan Denki Co. sold some 12 tons of domestic rice at one of its stores in Tokyo without a government license. The Food Agency had repeatedly warned the chain to call off the plan, saying that selling rice without a license is a violation of the Food Control Law. Over 2,000 people rushed to buy the rice, which sold out within three hours. The officials said Monday the sale was regrettable, but they did not say the agency would file a criminal accusation against the company. They said the agency will "persistently continue" to instruct Jonan Denki to stop such sales. The discount store said it procured 29 tons of rice from the village of Ogata in Akita Prefecture. It plans to sell the remaining rice at another of its Tokyo stores next Sunday. The government has imported foreign rice to make up for shortages from last year's poor rice harvest, but since February many consumers have queued at shops selling domestic rice.
