Its theme was the intensification of the fight against crime which the power ministries are planning in the near future. Vladimir Rubanov, deputy secretary of the Security Council, said that the benefit gained from the additional anti-crime measures, calculated according to UN methods, should be about 10 trillion rubles. Five trillion rubles will be spent on the measures themselves, and the Security Council will oversee the conduct of the campaign. Aleksey Ilyushenko, acting procurator general, said that the procuracy would coordinate this work. In view of the provisions of the draft law on the fight against crime which permit the Interior Ministry to introduce agents into commercial structure, to create sham firms, and to work with securities, journalists raised the question of corruption. Viktor Yerin replied to this: [Begin Yerin recording] We have special structural units which directly and on their own initiative engage in operational work among their own personnel, revealing unscrupulous people.

Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, pointed out to those assembled that the counter-intelligence service was restoring its investigative apparatus and that about 800 experienced personnel had already returned. [Begin Stepashin recording] The president gave the go-ahead and draft decrees are now being prepared by [word indistinct] together with us, and these decrees on creating a directorate of active operations will be signed, most likely next week. It is rather broader than the Vympel group. It will be a directorate not only of the central apparatus but will also operate in a number of regions, in particular in St. Petersburg, in Krasnodar, in Yekaterinburg, in Novosibirsk, and in Murmansk.
