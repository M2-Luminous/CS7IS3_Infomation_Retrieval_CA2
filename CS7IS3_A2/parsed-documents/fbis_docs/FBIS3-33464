As the president of the PLIUN, Dr. Alfonso Moncada, says, with the collapse of socialism the liberal principles that exalt man are gaining more currency than ever. Humanist liberalism. The social liberalism that advocates equal opportunity, social and economic justice, truly fraternal relations among the members of society, and broad freedoms. I am talking about progressive, revolutionary liberalism (even though at times these words may seem discredited), which has nothing to do with the economic neoliberalism that makes the poor poorer. Now that socialism has failed, progressive, revolutionary liberalism is one of the hopes for the world's poor. Nicaragua needs such progressive, revolutionary liberalism. Regrettably, however, the PALI [Liberal Party] (which has no further names and sports a plain red flag with neither symbols nor letters) is split and thus unable to develop its full potential. We must seek liberal unity. I will mention Dr. Moncada once again, acknowledging that he is right when he says that liberal alliances can be established with parties that have a liberal ideological foundation even though they do not call themselves liberal. I am thus enthusiastic about the fact that the PLIUN, the PUCA [Central American Unionist Party], and the PJN [National Justice Party] (which is predominantly Evangelical Protestant) are coming together to seek solutions to the nation's problems. Unity for change. But this does not rule out efforts towards unity among all liberals. I thus would like to bring up once again a point on which Dr. Arnoldo Aleman and Dr. Alfonso Moncada agree: a liberal plebiscite. The liberal rank and file need to be summoned to a plebiscite from which will emerge a broad-based convention that will unite the Liberal Party (without any other names, with a single flag and a single anthem: the "Beautiful Sovereign"). Each liberal faction or group would run its slate of candidates for convention delegates in each municipality, and the delegates would then be chosen in proportion to their vote so that all groups (PLIUN, PLI, PLC, PALI, etc.) would be represented proportionally no matter how small they may be. But let us not forget our brothers in the PUCA and the PJN. Their liberal roots run deep and are long-standing. Ever since Zelaya and even before it there has been a strategic liberal identification with the Morazan Central Americanists and the Evangelical Protestants, and thus we will have to include them in any plans for liberal unity. All the more so now that they have joined with the PLIUN in seeking political solutions to the problems of our people. Nonetheless, what the head of the PLI, Dr. Guillermo Selva, said also makes a great deal of sense. Although there would be a plebiscite for total unity, that would take time and cost money. This is why I agree with him that the first step would be to form the Liberal Federation with all liberal parties or parties holding a liberal philosophy, without exclusions, and on an equal footing (until we count heads to find out how strong each group is). Why wait any longer? Yours truly is a member of the PLIUN but not an officer. At least not now. I am thus publicly challenging the Boards of Directors to see which one will take the initiative and, paying more attention to common ground than differences (which we naturally have, since there are "wings" or "factions" in every party), invite the others to begin talks towards a Liberal Federation. Like many other liberals, I am ready to work and contribute in whatever modest way I can to achieve liberal unity. But the floor now belongs to party officials like Dr. Virgilio Godoy, Dr. Arnoldo Aleman, Dr. Alfonso Moncada, etc. I am issuing the challenge...let us see who takes it up. Let me go somewhat further. We must do more than seek liberal unity. For the good of Nicaragua each political family must seek its own unity. The Conservatives. The Marxists. The Social Christians. This would strengthen Nicaragua politically, because it is absurd for such a small country to have so many parties.
