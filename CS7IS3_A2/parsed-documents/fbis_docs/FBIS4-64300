The article cites a number of sources as saying that Simitis has often observed to aides that "a certain apparatus" exists at the core of the party that attempts to exclude those party officials who disagree with the views of the majority. The article also cites Simitis' belief that the disappearance of internal party minority views entails "tremendous political dangers" and that, if this is not resolved at the congress, PASOK will become "ideologically poorer" and face the June European Parliament elections "with its wings clipped." Simitis' concern is that the party not become a "mere manager for government decisions." Yiorgos Papandreou on Succession The Athens daily TA NEA published on 5 April an interview by Notis Papadhopoulos with Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yiorgos Papandreou. In the course of the interview, Papadhopoulos asked the deputy minister whether his rumored close relationship with Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis would influence him after Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's tenure. The deputy minister replied that while Arsenis is a long-time personal friend, it is too soon to speak of a future PASOK leadership, especially in view of the name he bears. Papandreou added that he sees his role in PASOK as substantial and that he will devote himself to party unity.
