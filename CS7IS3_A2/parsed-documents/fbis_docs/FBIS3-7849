The only unclear point is why did the Serbs gamble with NATO's patience? Did they expect that they would again get away with their humorless jokes, or have they finally started paying the high price of their own mistakes? According to as yet unconfirmed information, the illogical bombing of Novi Travnik and Bugojno is a fresh Serbian ploy designed to pin the blame for the bombing on the Croatian aviation, which would result in fresh conflicts between the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. This would definitely bury the cease-fire signed between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO, and the chetniks -- who else -- would profit from this. In any case, the U.S. pilots have exhibited their resolve to implement the UN resolutions, which will perhaps finally force the Serbs to reconsider their megalomaniacal and bestial appetites. An intercepted radio message, transmitted a day before the bombing of Novi Travnik, and ordered by the Serbian units in Donji Vakuf, reads: Tomorrow six of our nightingales will sing the newly composed Serbian heroic song about Bugojno. Are we dealing with the carelessness of the Serbian ham radio operator, or yet another rusty screw in Mladic's propaganda machinery? It does not matter. What matters is that four [words indistinct] did not work in this case, because how could six sparrows harm two falcons?
