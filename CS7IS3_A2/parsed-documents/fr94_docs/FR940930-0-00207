FR940930-0-00207 FR940930-0-00029 Friday September 30, 1994 Part III Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration 49 CFR Parts 212 and 234 Grade Crossing Signal System Safety; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 189␣/␣Friday, September 30, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Railroad Administration 49 CFR Parts 212 and 234 [FRA Docket No. RSGC&hyph;5; Notice No. 7] RIN 2130_AA70 Grade Crossing Signal System Safety AGENCY: Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: FRA is issuing a final rule requiring that railroads comply with specific maintenance, inspection, and testing requirements for active highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. FRA is also requiring that railroads take specific and timely actions to protect the travelling public and railroad employees from the hazards posed by malfunctioning highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. This action is taken in part, in response to a statutory requirement that FRA ``issue rules, regulations, orders, and standards to ensure the safe maintenance, inspection, and testing of signal systems and devices at railroad highway grade crossings.'' EFFECTIVE DATE: These rules will become effective January 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Goodman, Chief, Signal and Train Control Division, Office of Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590 (telephone 202&hyph;366&hyph;2231), or Mark Tessler, Trial Attorney, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590 (telephone 202&hyph;366&hyph;0628). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On January 20, 1994, FRA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in which FRA proposed to require that railroads comply with specific maintenance, inspection, and testing requirements for active highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. FRA also proposed to require that railroads take specific and timely actions to protect the travelling public and railroad employees from the hazards posed by malfunctioning highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. A public hearing was held in Washington, D.C. on March 1, 1994. The comment period in this rulemaking closed on March 21, 1994. The final rule issued today reflects many of the comments and the testimony presented by 25 parties. FRA had issued an earlier NPRM on June 29, 1992 (57 FR 28819), in which FRA proposed rules requiring specific and timely response in situations involving malfunctioning highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. A public hearing was held in Washington, D.C. on September 15, 1992. This prior NPRM did not address maintenance, inspection and testing of such warning systems. Due to comments received and an intention to widen the scope of the rulemaking to include proposed standards for maintenance, inspection, and testing pursuant to the mandate of 49 U.S.C. 20134(b), (formerly §202(q) of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 431(q)) (Safety Act) as amended by section 2 of the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act (Pub. L. 102-365)), an open meeting was held on December 11, 1992. Among the comments received was a joint submission from the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, the Association of American Railroads, and The American Short Line Railroad Association. In addition to commenting on the prior NPRM, the labor/management group proposed specific regulatory language addressing both timely response and maintenance, inspection, and testing. The NPRM issued on January 20, 1994 reflected the consolidation into one rulemaking docket of the timely response rulemaking with proposed standards for maintenance, inspection, and testing of grade crossing warning systems. The NPRM generated a wide range of comments. Individual comments were received from: thirteen state regulatory agencies representing eleven states; five commuter rail authorities; three freight railroads; one union; and two industry associations. Additionally, a joint submission was received from the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, the American Short Line Railroad Association and the Association of American Railroads (``labor/management group''). This final rule amends 49 CFR Part 234, ``Grade Crossing Signal Safety'', and to a lesser extent, 49 CFR Part 212, ``State Safety Participation Regulations.''
