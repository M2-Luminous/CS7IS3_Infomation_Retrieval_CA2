The delegations were led by Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign minister of the Republic of Croatia, and FRY Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic. The meeting was held on the basis of the recently signed declaration between the two countries. After the talks, which were of a consultative character, both sides said that they reached an agreement on several matters. This is assessed as a step forward in the implementation of the joint declaration. Both sides have taken all necessary steps to ensure that the two governments' offices open in Zagreb and Belgrade by the 15 February deadline and that all related technicalities are agreed upon. They also agreed to set up a joint commission of the two governments to deal with displaced persons, refugees, and other humanitarian issues. The two governments are to appoint high-ranking and responsible members of the commission as soon as possible and invite ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] and UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] representatives to take part in the commission's work. The commission will be open for contacts with the families of missing people and their associations. Both sides took on the responsibility to unconditionally exchange information on the missing persons and make extra efforts to find them. At the same time the commission will be allowed access to all locations presumed to house either imprisoned or missing persons. The two sides also examined all other issues of importance for the normalization of relations between the two countries and for Croatian-Serbian relations as a whole. They agreed to examine these issues at regular meetings at high political level, in principle once a month, in the capitals Zagreb and Belgrade on an alternating basis. To this aim Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister, invited Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic to visit Zagreb. The invitation was accepted with pleasure and the date was fixed for 12 February. On this occasion there will also be held the first meeting of the joint commission for missing persons and humanitarian issues.
