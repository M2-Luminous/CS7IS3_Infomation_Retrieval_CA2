It calls for stepping up recruiting and training to build a well-structured contingent of minority cadres who are politically qualified, competent, and meet the needs of modernization of the armed forces. The circular notes that in units stationed in areas where people of minority nationalities live in compact communities, leading bodies at the regiment level or higher should include a minority cadre. Army organs at all levels and people's armed force departments at the county and city level should have a certain number of minority cadres. To raise the quality of minority cadres, designated academies or colleges should -- where the number of minority soldiers undertaking courses justifies doing so -- set up a special class to improve their literacy levels. Training courses for Tibetan youngsters should be instituted on a experimental basis at relevant academies and schools to recruit Tibetan primary school and middle school students. After undergoing systematic training, they should be assigned as cadres to army units. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to recruit more minority graduates of regular institutes of higher learning and secondary vocational schools who are good in both conduct and learning, to replenish the ranks of army cadres. The circular also calls for implementing a preferential policy for minority cadres regarding retirement and job placement after demobilization. It has been learned that the CMC attaches great importance to the development of the ranks of minority cadres in the military. The CMC has emphasized again and again that this work should be carried out as part and parcel of the development of the ranks of army cadres as a whole. As things stand now, over 80 percent of minority cadres in the military have undergone training in academies and colleges. In light of the characteristics of the growth of minority cadres, special consideration has been given to job assignments and promotions of minority cadres so that they can give the best account of their talents. Tens of thousands of fine minority cadres in leadership posts at all levels throughout the army -- who make up an important force in the construction of our military -- are putting their talents to good use. According to statistics, among the cadres of Mongolia, Hui, Tibetan, Uygur, Zhuang, Korean, Man, Dong, Bai, Tujia, and Ewenki nationalities on active duty in the service, over 40 have been appointed the rank of major general or higher. The development of the contingent of minority cadres has served as a powerful boost for the modernization of armed forces, and for the enhancement of the army-civilian and national unity.
