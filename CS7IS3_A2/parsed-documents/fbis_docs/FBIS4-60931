But at present there are a number of foreign companies, including French ones, operating in Crimea, whose economic potential is oriented toward Russian markets. Yevgeniy Saburov pointed to a difference in principle between his current activity and what he did in Vladimir Oblast, where, he said, significant successes were achieved. Crimea, unlike Russian regions, is a fairly independent entity that has its own, albeit incomplete, statehood. Its prospects, the Crimean deputy prime minister said, depend on drastic changes in legislation, and this is its main difference from the Russian situation. Few people know, Yevgeniy Saburov said, that three edicts have already been signed -- on taxes, on currency regulation, and on banks. "The Kiev authorities," he added, "have assured me that any economic transformations will only be welcome, but I have information that they are already beginning to put up some resistance. If Ukraine really treated us as its own territory, and the Crimean population as its own population, they would have hardly resorted to such actions." "Initially it seemed to me," Yevgeniy Saburov continued, "that there is no political bottom line to the Crimean issue, but only a financial problem, particularly the splitting of the Black Sea Fleet. In this case the issue is who will have the right to sell decommissioned ships and who will receive lease payments -- Ukraine or Crimea. Facts show that Kiev wants to have this money for itself, although it is Crimea that supplies Sevastopol with water, food, and all the rest. I think such conduct is unethical." At the same time, Yevgeniy Saburov went on, political implications of the problem are becoming more and more visible. Kiev is doing its utmost to hamper integrationist processes in Crimea, fearing that it may lose not only the peninsula, but also Donbass, Lugansk, Nikolayev, and Odessa -- a vast territory that accounts for over one-half of Ukraine and, like Crimea, is attracted by Russia. "I would like to deal with purely economic matters, but I understand that I will also have to tackle political problems, although I am not at all enthusiastic about that," Yevgeniy Saburov stated.
