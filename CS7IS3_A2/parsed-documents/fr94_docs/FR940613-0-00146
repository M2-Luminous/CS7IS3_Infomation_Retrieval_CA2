The intent of the rule is, where deemed necessary, to apply the same standards for private land uses and developments to lands within the designated wilderness boundaries, as would be applied outside of wilderness. Under the proposed rule, those lots within wilderness would be classified as farm/forest/grazing lands. Most of the private land parcels within wilderness are less than 160 acres, and so, even without the wilderness lands restriction, the proposed rule would not consider the development of any new residences appropriate. In developing the proposed rule, the Department determined that the protection of the wilderness resource is paramount. Congress designates wilderness to protect and preserve a variety of natural resource and other values; scenic value is only one of many attributes. Uses and developments on private lands have the potential to impact a full range of wilderness values, including scientific, cultural, historical, and water quality values. One of the most important aspects of the recreational experience within wilderness is the opportunity for solitude and to experience an area where man is only a temporary visitor. A standard which would allow development of new structures so long as they are not visible from the wilderness simply ignores the fact that other, non-visual impacts may result from the construction of new structures. Furthermore, the Forest Service is unaware of any location from which a new structure could be developed within the wilderness and also not be visible because of the area's topography. As noted in the proposed rule, the repair and maintenance of existing structures that may be located on private land within a wilderness is not affected by this standard. Therefore, after considering this comment, no change was made in the final rule regarding the construction of new or replacement structures in wilderness. Comment: Lack of standards for livestock grazing, timber harvesting, pesticide application, water quality, and ground disturbing activities. One reviewer objected to the lack of standards in the proposed rule for livestock grazing, timber harvesting, pesticide use, water quality protection, and ground disturbing activities on private lands. Response. This concern is fully addressed by the proposed rule. In determining what approach it should take to the regulation of private lands, the Forest Service determined that if other federal, state, and local laws and ordinances are enforced, then the HCNRA Act's purposes would be accomplished. Accordingly, in developing the proposed rule, the agency assessed existing ordinances and laws for their capability to protect on private lands the values for which the HCNRA was established. In many instances, the proposed rule expressed these local ordinances as standards. However, the proposed rule made it very clear that other laws would be enforced; if not by the promulgating government, then, if necessary, by the Forest Service through acquisition (condemnation) action. In ยง292.23 paragraph (a)(1), the final rule retains the language of the proposed rule, with minor editing, to make clear that land uses are compatible if they conform to applicable local, state, and federal laws. This provision is intended to cover such matters as those referred to by the reviewer. Examples of the types of ordinances and laws that this clause refers to include the following: Oregon Forest Practices Act; Idaho Forest Practices Act; Idaho Water Quality Standards and Wastewater Treatment Requirements; Oregon Water Quality Standards; and the Idaho Agricultural Pollution Abatement Plan. The Department is not aware of any situation which merits standards different from those currently imposed by other laws. The proposed rule addressed the concerns raised by this reviewer by providing for compliance with environmental and other laws and ordinances. Therefore, no modification has been made in the final rule as a result of this comment. Additional Changes Adopted in the Final Rule In the process of reviewing the comments on ยง292.23, the Department recognized the need to make two other changes. 1. Residences on less than 160 acre parcels in farm/forest/grazing lands. As drafted, the provision at ยง292.23(b)(1) that limits residences on farm/forest/grazing lands to minimum lots of 160 acres could be interpreted to mean that an existing house on a lot that is less than 160 acres would prompt the Secretary to exercise the acquisition authority. This is not the Department's intent. It is recognized that some of these smaller parcels have existed with residential developments for years and there is no reason that they should not continue as a recognized nonconforming use. Consequently, the final rule is modified to make clear that nonconforming lots (i.e., less than 160 acres) with permanently affixed residences (i.e., constructed on a foundation or basement), existing on the effective date of the final rule, are in compliance with the Act. 2. Sites used for the extraction of common mineral materials. The proposed rule, at ยง292.23 (a)(7), would only allowed extraction of common materials for road construction and maintenance and would limit sites to not exceed 5 acres. The use limitation ignored other forms of construction that may also use smaller quantities of materials, such as in the repair or construction of structures. It is impractical to require a landowner to find a gravel source outside of the HCNRA boundaries, when a source may exist already within a mile of his or her property. Upon reconsideration, the 5 acre size limit appears to be excessive for the foreseen uses for this resource and the esthetic concerns for the HCNRA. Therefore, the final rule is modified to eliminate the references to only road construction and maintenance and to decrease the size limit to not exceed 2 acres. As written, the final rule may be more generally applied to the extraction of common mineral materials for construction and maintenance purposes so long as these sites have screening and are less than 2 acres in size.
