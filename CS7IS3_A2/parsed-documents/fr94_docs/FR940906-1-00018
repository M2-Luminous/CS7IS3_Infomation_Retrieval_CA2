SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 11, 1994, OSHA announced that it had established the Steel Erection Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee (SENRAC) (59 FR 24389) in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 (NRA) and section 7(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) to resolve issues associated with the development of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Steel Erection. Appointees to the Committee include representatives from labor, industry, public interests and government agencies. The first two SENRAC meetings were held in Bethesda, Maryland on June 14&hyph;16, 1994 and in Denver, Colorado on July 11&hyph;13, 1994. The Committee established workgroups to address issues on fall protection, allocation of responsibility, construction specifications, and scope of the standard. Also, the Committee groundrules were formally adopted. At the third meeting, held in Boston, Massachusetts on August 16&hyph;18, 1994, the Committee determined that the proper allocation of responsibility for safety should be evaluated for all construction activities, not just for steel erection, and that any Committee recommendation to OSHA on this issue will be independent of its consensus recommendations for subpart R. Also, the Committee addressed the scope of subpart R to determine whether it will apply to erection activities other than steel buildings. These issues will be addressed again at the September 20&hyph;22 meeting in Washington, DC and the Committee acknowledged that all affected interests should actively participate in these discussions. Agendas for the meetings are as follows: Washington, DC (September 20&hyph;22): On September 20th, OSHA will make a presentation to the full Committee regarding the economic considerations involved in this rulemaking followed by a meeting of the Fall Protection workgroup. The September 21st meeting will begin with a full Committee discussion of the scope of the standard, addressing whether certain erection activities should be covered (i.e., precast concrete, towers and bridges). A meeting of the Allocation of Responsibility workgroup will follow. This workgroup session will include discussions with representatives of building owners and general contractors to determine the proper allocation of safety responsibility among all parties involved in the construction process. The afternoon session will consist of a meeting of the Construction Specifications workgroup and presentations on this subject. The Construction Specifications discussions will continue on the morning of September 22nd and will be followed by a full Committee meeting. St. Louis (November 8&hyph;10): To be determined at the September 20&hyph;22 meeting in Washington. Washingtion, DC (December 6&hyph;8): To be determined at the November 8&hyph;10 meeting in St. Louis. All interested parties are invited to attend both the workgroup and full Committee meetings at the times and places indicated above. No advanced registration is required.
