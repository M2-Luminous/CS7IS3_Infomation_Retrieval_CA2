That is why Russia's Western partners, such as European Union members, refuse to support Moscow's call for suspending and subsequently lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia, a high-ranking official from the Russian Foreign Ministry told Interfax. Russia works on the assumption, he said, that after the signing of an agreement on settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina sanctions should be suspended and gradually lifted as the agreement begins to be implemented. "Unfortunately, such an agreement failed to be signed at the Geneva round of talks attended by spokesmen for all the warring sides -- Serbs, Muslims and Croats -- and by the foreign ministers of European Community countries. The reason for this was the dispute over territories between Bosnian Serbs and Muslims," the diplomat said. As a result Bosnian Serbs are losing in tactical terms. Western analysts see in their actions, not without grounds, elements of the plan to form "Greater Serbia," that is join the Serb-populated areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina to Yugoslavia." According to Interfax's interviewee, a clear stand taken by Belgrade could put an end to fears felt by the West and draw the lifting of sanctions nearer. "It's obvious that the pressure Belgrade could exert on Bosnian Serbs with a view to signing a peace agreement as soon as possible would draw nearer not only an end to the bloodshed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also the lifting of sanctions against Belgrade and Yugoslavia's return to the world community," he said.
