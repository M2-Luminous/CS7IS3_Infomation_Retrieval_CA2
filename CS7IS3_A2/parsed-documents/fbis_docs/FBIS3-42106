Do You Want a Bomb? No Problem"] [Text] It is a commonplace that it takes 1 kg of uranium to produce one atom bomb. It is another matter that this is only raw material. And the bomb ends up with considerably less power than, for example, the one dropped on Hiroshima. And this depends largely on the degree of enrichment of the uranium. But the fact is that it works! And now the information obtained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia: During the past year several dozen thefts of uranium-235, uranium-238, and other radioactive substances from secret defense industry enterprises of the country have been registered. The figures for last year are being amended. In each case no less than 1 kg has been stolen, and most frequently they each take a piece weighing 4-6 kg. One more stipulation must be made here: We are speaking only about cases where the criminals were apprehended and the dangerous cargo confiscated. One could quite logically assume that we have not managed to arrest all the uranium thieves. And now attention: According to figures in the German press, as of today the FRG is investigating 150 criminal cases involving illegal trade in radioactive substances. Law enforcement organs there assume that the lion's share of these substances migrated to Germany over the vast expanses of the once inviolable Union. But even that is not all. Let us not be idealists: In spite of German meticulousness and care, there is no doubt that this is only a certain part of the whole. The ones who failed. If there were no uranium smugglers who succeeded, this business would wither on the vine. The Russian nuclear business is three years old. Previously it was simply impossible. Now it is attractive to many. May Dreams Last year Vladimir K. was still working in a large Moscow scientific research institute that dealt with problems of nuclear energy. On his way home from work he usually met his friend Aleksandr P., who was not employed anywhere and lived on odd-job earnings. In spite of the difference in their social positions, both of the young people were equally short of money. When entertaining his friend, Vladimir frequently told him various stories from the institute to the effect that they practically have uranium coming out of their ears and nobody is worried about it. In his words, an equal if not a greater mess was being made in the neighboring associate enterprise, which is also secret and to which Vladimir also has access. One warm May evening the friends did not have enough money for beer and were dreaming about wealth. If there is uranium coming out of their ears, why not take advantage of an opportunity? This could be done best in the "P.O. box enterprises," at the associated enterprise. ... In the middle of May Vladimir K. managed to steal a 4 kg chunk of uranium which, although it was considered to be only slightly enriched, still "gave off radiation." In order not to get a large dose, Vladimir wrapped what he had stolen in special foil and the placed it in an ordinary cellophane package. He boarded the commuter train and went home to Dedovsk near Moscow. He had no Geiger counter, so up to this point he did not know what kind of doses the other people in the car or he himself had received. In Dedovsk the friends buried the package of uranium in a suburban forest and started to think about to whom and, the main thing, for how much they could sell the "bomb." The task was not that simple, and it was necessary to bring four more people from that same company in on it. Through joint efforts they managed to make connections with people who knew something about prices on the black market. It turned out that they should ask no less than $60,000 for this piece. By this time none of the six were working anywhere, the transaction promised good money, and they were already dreaming of a new life. They began to look for a buyer. But from that moment, in the words of one of the operatives, "they began to suffer from an old affliction"--the fear of losing their wealth. They thought someone might find the package of uranium in the forest, so they dug it up and moved it to Dedovsk, where they hid it in a garage. Then they hid it again, in the garret of a residential building whose residents had no suspicion of the danger that threatened them. Their search for a buyer lasted a half-year. In the words of the "nuclear" six, they would have sold the goods to anyone who would pay good money; they were not concerned about what happened to their product after that. It was considered axiomatic that the "bomb" would interest foreigners and therefore they looked for contacts with them. The business even reached drivers of heavy trucks from the Baltic region. But after hearing the proposals, the majority of the Baltic residents stepped on the gas, and the few who did agree to buy paid a miserly price. Ultimately the zealous activity of the six was noticed by the regional administration for fighting organized crime. Experienced operatives from the Moscow suburb Krasnogorsk watched the group for three weeks and then arrested them. A special group assigned to work with radioactive substances was called to confiscate the stolen uranium. When the leader of the operations group spoke with the official representative of the enterprise the 4 kg of uranium had come from, he stated that "every mouse is accounted for around here." To which the Krasnogorsk militiaman responded: "Maybe a mouse cannot get by you, but 4 kg of uranium were stolen from you." Our Country Is Large... A militia colonel and deputy department head of the Main Administration for Economic Crimes of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, Vitaliy Zus, confirmed to the correspondent that dozens of thefts of radioactive materials are registered here in a year. Of rare earth metals--hundreds. Traffic in radioactive materials is a sign of the times. We know the explanation for this kind of trafficking: the collapse of the Union, the conversion that has been started, economic confusion, and the liberal conditions on the borders that facilitate taking goods out. In spite of all its cataclysms, Russia has remained a country with immense territories. With a great multitude of defense enterprises and the most diverse "P.O. Box enterprises" where radioactive elements and that same uranium are used. A demand for inexpensive radioactive substances has arisen among mysterious foreign consumers. But the conditions at the secret enterprises have remained the same. A worker of that same department of the Main Administration for Economic Crimes, militia Colonel Sergey Mayorov, noted that about 90 percent of the thefts of strategic raw material can be explained by the possibility of free access, including for people from the outside. And also there are all kinds of violations of rules for accounting for and storing raw material. The stolen uranium and other radioactive substances are usually offered to foreigners or intermediaries who are able to travel abroad. Of course it is easiest to meet such people in large cities, in Moscow. Most frequently it is there, to its white stones, that the uranium trail extends. Where does it come from? From everywhere where there are defense "P.O. Box enterprises." And they are everywhere: Siberia, the Urals, Central Russia...but the Urals still take first prize in this matter. They are a real Klondike for "nuclear" thieves. From existing data it is possible to compile a portrait of businessmen of this breed. Judging from the practice and thefts of radioactive substances, they work, as a rule, in groups, and not alone (people working alone are caught more easily). The group usually includes (along with "proletarians") middle-level technical managers and also some representatives of the leadership of the enterprise--in case they have to provide a cover at a dangerous moment or simply "not notice." Or put their signature on a document for writing materials off. Then the courier takes the commodity in a capsule to the capital, where the buyer is given the opportunity to take 1 gram of the substance for analysis. If the commodity meets his "standard"--the transaction is completed according to the classical formula of "commodity-dollars." One well-informed person told a correspondent that if the buyer thinks of violating the gentleman's agreement, he is punished by death. This person even confirmed that the ones trapped by the militia, as a rule, are "people working on their own or terrible dilettantes." Reality convinces us that what he said is true. A department chief of the Economic Crimes Administration of the Moscow City Internal Affairs Administration, Boris Blontsev, told about one such case. In a closed compound in Chelyabinsk Oblast 4.5 kg of a substance containing uranium-235 was stolen from a defense enterprise. The thief managed to successfully cover his tracks and soon he was on his way to Moscow with his mysterious parcel. The lone thief had no idea of whom to offer his parcel to or how many thousands of dollars to ask for it. Ultimately he ended up in a meeting with a buyer who turned out to be...a militia worker. Workers of law enforcement organs think that the single person from Chelyabinsk had practically no chance of succeeding. Seize the Moment! While preparing this article I had occasion several times to see various consultants. All of them agreed with the opinion that a dangerous time had come and it is becoming advantageous and almost safe to engage in trade in semimanufactured nuclear products. Quite recently a tonne of titanium could be purchased in Russia for 350 rubles [R] and then shipped abroad, where one could obtain $7,500 for it and buy household electronic equipment there, and then take it home and sell it for a fantastic profit. More than one Russian has become a billionaire from such speculations...prices of rare metals in Russia are now approaching world prices, and buying and selling them can produce a solid income, especially if they are shipped contraband, that is, if you do not pay for licenses, quotas, etc. Not long ago investigators from Moscow confiscated seven ampules of cesium--a total of 1,550 g. When they brought it to an academician for consultation he was amazed: Never before in his life had he seen all at once seven ampules of cesium, 1 kg of which costs $50,000. Half joking, the academician said that: "He had an atomic bomb lying on his desk at that time." In certain circumstances, cesium can be extremely explosive. Specialists from law enforcement organs think that there is another, possibly the strongest, precondition for smart "nuclear dealers," and one might call this precondition this: state feebleness. Until recently any accident involving radioactive substances came mainly under the purview of the KGB. This information was systematized, analyzed, and immediately sent up to the very top. KGB people played first fiddle in all kinds of "P.O. Box enterprises." A couple of days ago I phoned the corresponding service of the former Ministry of Security and asked for information on the countries to which stolen radioactive substances go from Russia. A day later the official representative reported: The Department has no information on this subject. That is, it does not know. One can perhaps believe this answer too: The Department has not had time for this recently. I received a similar answer from the Russian customs service: "It seems that there are such cases, but they are individual and are no big deal." Most likely this answer can be accepted as well. But when you recall the endless Russian borders which are now called penetrable...the customs service is up to its neck in work and there is simply no possibility of keeping track of many regions. In circles close to the government one most frequently encounters this position: "The problem of the sale of stolen semimanufactured products for an atomic bomb abroad is fabricated, we know nothing about this." And could it be that the militiamen who encountered criminals of this kind were really just exaggerating because they were afraid? And who would let it enter their mind to risk their health in this way even for dollars? According to information from the Ministry of Justice of Russia, articles concerning the theft and attempts to sell radioactive materials were introduced into the Criminal Code back in 1988. But during 1988 and 1989 not one person in Russia was convicted under these articles. In 1990 one was convicted. Then for two years in a row there was silence, and in the first half of 1993--there were 12 individuals. We have no figures for the second half of the year yet. We managed to obtain this information from unofficial but reliable sources: When investigating criminal cases involving the theft of radioactive substances they manage to arrest only every tenth criminal. And this certainly does not mean that his case is necessarily taken to court. As a rule, they use a multitude of intermediaries and also couriers to transport the material--people who have no idea of the content of their cargo. But even if a person is caught red-handed, his first words will usually be: "I found it." Or: "I bought it from somebody I did not know." Just try to find where it all ends. Information from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia: During 11 months of last year 8,793 crimes involving all kinds of strategic raw material (including radioactive substances) were committed in the country. In spite of the numerous official appeals from law enforcement organs to the government for help and the various committees and other levels of authority, no reaction followed. Which in translation can mean: "Catch them yourselves!" A Bomb for... And now the main question: Where does the river of uranium flow from Russia? For now we know for certain that our compatriots do not intend to make and keep a private atom bomb. But is the final destination of these exports Europe? From the majority of my consultants who had at least in some way been involved with the problem of uranium and similar substances I most frequently heard this address: the Near East. According to certain information, emissaries are sent to Russia, forming the demand and prices on our uranium black market. They say that unofficial Iraq has long shown an interest in goods of this kind. Evil tongues even assert that there are chunks from the Urals in the atom bomb that they are now assembling. But officials so far do not want to either confirm or deny these assumptions. Paradoxical as it may be, a circumstance that significantly complicates the fight against theft of radioactive raw material is the coincidence of the interests of the "uranium" criminals and those who...are responsible for the safety of our radioactive reserves: Both are interested in remaining silent. Neither one side nor the other wishes to risk their own necks. Not until a critical mass has accumulated.
