Ma, in response to an inquiry by Kuomintang Legislator Cheng Chien-jen, stressed that the export of toys manufactured by a Taichung Prison to the United States has also not violated either ROC or United States law. The associated press reported in a dispatch from Colorado on Monday that a 10-year-old boy found a note from a toy glider he bought. The note read, in broken English: "Hey lucky friends. This toys make in prison Taiwan ROC." The writer asked the recipient of her note to "investigate Taiwan ROC disobey international human right law." Ma noted that the present law requires inmates to learn skills in prisons. "The process is legal," Ma said. He emphasized that none of the inmates in Taiwan's prisons have been exploited, and that the firms contracting with the prisons here have not subsequently gained an unfair competitive edge. Ma said the government will give an accounting of its prison-labor practices to the United States. He tried to play down the significance of the incident, saying it has drawn wide attention only because of its dramatic nature. Officials at Taichung Prison identified the writer of the note as Liu Hsing-ping, 40, who began serving his nearly 13-year sentence for theft and rape in January 1991. The prison has 45 workshops where inmates are employed by 35 manufacturers engaging in toy-making, printing, sewing and other lines of work. According to ROC law, the inmates are paid to work six to eight hours a day, with 40 percent of the pay going into their pockets and the remaining 60 percent used for upgrading prison facilities.
