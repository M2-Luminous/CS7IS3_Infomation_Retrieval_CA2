Early last week, American NATO airplanes launched two air strikes on Serb positions. Officially, this was done to protect the UN staff, but the real message was that the Serbs should not seize Gorazde. Considering the unrelenting attacks against the Muslim enclave, the Serb commanders clearly failed to understand the message. One week after the first attacks, Gorazde is still under fire. The UN threatened new air strikes, but Washington had already ruled out the possibility of a substantial extension of military actions from the start. The last few days, President Clinton tried very hard to convince the Serbs that the United States, the United Nations, and NATO are not taking sides in the conflict, and that NATO air strikes were not intended to change the military balance in favor of the Muslims. The U.S. President and his advisers speculated that, following these very limited bombings, the Serbs would understand that the West is serious about its threats. This military message would prompt the Serbs to stop their military action in Gorazde, and to return to the negotiating table. The message to the Serbs was enforced by comments in Washington, that the United States had crossed the Rubicon, and that there was no going back: Indeed, a superpower should live up to its commitments. In other words, if the Serbs ignored the warning, the United States would have to launch large-scale military operations. The commentators were wrong. Apparently, Washington had not taken any strategic decision at all on the future course of action. The possibility that the Serbs would join the poker game had not been contemplated, or at least not sufficiently. The Americans had no answer to the taking of UN hostages and to the renewed attack on Gorazde. The option of new air strikes was ruled out. First of all because the U.S. Government was concerned about the fate of the UN military. And second because of the disapproving reactions on the part of the Russians. The latter had strongly objected to the bombings, and had deferred their plans to join the Partnership for Peace in protest. The choice between Gorazde and future relations with Russia went against Gorazde. And most importantly, the United States had not crossed the Rubicon at all: Clinton was afraid of military escalation. Once again, it became apparent that Washington has no policy at all, and that President Clinton's foreign policy is made up of a succession of ad hoc decisions which are not based on any coherent political concept. So the argument that a superpower should live up to its commitments so as not to lose its credibility turned out to be wrong. The policy pursued by this administration is anything but consistent: It can go back to square one without further ado. There is a feeling of total malaise at the United Nations in New York. It was already a well-known fact that the Europeans are unable to take a military and political stand. Which is why the United Nations was increasingly hoping for U.S. leadership. Last year President Clinton lost credibility when he threatened action but backed out because the Europeans raised objections. However, it looked as if he had learned from his mistakes. In recent months, the President repeatedly insisted that the West should not utter empty threats. Last February's ultimatum for Sarajevo was a success. After that, a few Serb fighter planes were shot down. The United States linked a new political initiative to the new determination, which led to a compromise between Muslims and Croats. To everyone's dismay, however, it is now revealed that the President lacks genuine interest in foreign policy, and that he walks out when things get too tough and dangerous. American public opinion has not woken up, yet. This is mainly because there are no American UN soldiers in Bosnia. In addition, President Clinton has not taken the trouble, so far, to explain to the American public why the Balkan states are so important to the United States. The political experts are divided. Many believe that the United States should stay out of the hotbed because there are no explicit U.S. interests at stake. Former Secretary of State Eagleburger argues that the political will to play an active political and military role is lacking. However, according to Eagleburger and many other foreign experts, not only Bosnia is at stake, but also U.S. credibility as a superpower. Superpowers should not be soft, and certainly not utter empty threats. Once the United States has decided to take military action, it should deal heavy blows and not hesitate to bomb Belgrade, for instance. The antiquated bombs which were dropped by the F-16 fighter planes last Sunday and Monday hit one tank and barely left a few deep holes in the ground. However, they caused serious political damage which goes far beyond Bosnia's interests. North Korea must have observed with interest and relief that U.S. threats need not be taken too seriously. If the Serbs can make a fool of the United States, there is no reason for North Korea to assume that the United States would take a tougher stand against Pyongyang, and that it would stake everything to keep North Korea from producing nuclear arms.
