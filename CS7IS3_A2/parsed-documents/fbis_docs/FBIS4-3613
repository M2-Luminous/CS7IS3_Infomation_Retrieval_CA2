It looks as though China has been co-operating fully in the Government's stated aim of releasing more land to take the heat out of the property market. That is particularly true of the release of 25.38 ha set aside for private sector residential development, 38 percent more than a year ago. The whole package is more than double the minimum 50 ha for which the commission's approval is required. However, while the figures are high for the first meeting of the year, there is no guarantee the trend will continue to stay ahead of past years. In previous exercises, more land has been released as the season has progressed, bringing the figure up to considerably more than yesterday's total. Over the whole of last year, the commission released 127 ha. It may be that yesterday's agreement was a political signal, designed to take some of the steam out of property prices, rather than a genuine indication of the prospects for the year ahead. There are no grounds, therefore, for more than cautious optimism that the Hong Kong Government has a clear idea of how much land needs to be released to reduce prices without precipitating a crash. Nor are there for confidence that the Chinese Government's assessment of the market will be the same. It is unclear whether the Government understands what it is doing. How can people have faith in the competence of an administration which opens a new phase of its sandwich-class housing scheme just as it is trying to slow prices down and then finds the banks are unwilling to lend into a falling market? Nevertheless, the fact that the two sides are working together on a sensibly measured increase in the amount of land released at the beginning of the year bodes well for continued Sino-British co-operation on economic matters and for the Hong Kong Government's ability to get its programme right despite its inexperience in the market. It has set itself the delicate task of taking some of the air out of the property bubble without bursting it. The success of the enterprise depends less on the current balance between supply and demand than on the market's perception of future land supply. The decisions of the Land Commission suggest the Government may yet confound the sceptics and alter perceptions without engineering a crash.
