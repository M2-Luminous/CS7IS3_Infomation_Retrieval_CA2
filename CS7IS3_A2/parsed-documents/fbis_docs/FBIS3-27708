South Korea said the exchange of special envoys is designed to seek a peaceful settlement of the nuclear dispute through dialogue and to pave way for improving the South-North relations. The proposal was made by South Korean vice minister of national unification and chief delegate of the South in inter-korean talks, Song Yong-tae, in a telephone message to his DPRK counterpart, Pak Yong-su. Song proposed that the meeting begin from 10 a.m. March 1 at the "House of Peace" on the southern side of the Panmunjom military demarcation line. He hoped that both sides could reach an agreement as soon as possible on the exchange of envoys. The DPRK agreed to begin a new round of dialogue with South Korea in its talks in New York with the United States on February 26, on the condition that South Korea proposes it first. The two sides have held three rounds of talks on the exchange of envoys but failed to reach agreement owing to their differences over the timing of the exchange, the envoys' responsibility, and the agenda. The last meeting was held on October 25 last year on the northern side of the Panmunjom demarcation line.
