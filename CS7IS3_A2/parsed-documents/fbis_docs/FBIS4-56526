From time to time it is necessary to come to earth and look at ourselves in a mirror so as not to forget that despite the passage of time we continue to live in a country that has not changed. Perhaps this is Judge Jose Agustin Fernandez's only merit, if we need to find a positive side to the decision. Or perhaps it is Electoral Prosecutor Carlos Aranda Daroczi's merit to remind us the kind of country in which we live because instead of formally filing charges against Oviedo he simply handed the file on the alleged crime to the judge. The fact is that Army Commander Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo is free to continue participating in politics for as long as he chooses. Neither his natural Armed Forces commanders nor the law or ordinary justice can stop him. The truth is that the judge was the last hope. Of course, we could not expect the present Armed Forces commander in chief [President Juan Carlos Wasmosy], for whose candidacy Oviedo worked without pause during the electoral campaign, to order his retirement for breaking a law. Neither could we expect Gen. Oviedo to get scared and request his retirement because of Rambo [Hermes Rafael] Saguier's protests or the reports presented by [Liberal Party leaders] Domingo Laino or Bogado Gondra. We would offend the intelligence of Gen. Oviedo if we thought he would authorize an eventual entry of U.S. troops into the country at a time there was a possibility of retiring him and when the only ones who could control him were those in "Strong Roads 94-South." Now that we can no longer object to the Army commander on political, legal, and least of all military grounds, we must sit down and mentally design policies for the 1993-98 period, with a military leader as the central axis of the transition to democracy. Our reality for the next four years, even though it might hurt to admit it, will be one of a civilian government under Armed Forces tutelage. The country's rudder will be operated from the barracks for as long as the state apparatus continues as it is today. That is why there is resistance to reforming the state, the privatization program, judicial branch changes, and the appointment of independent-minded officials. The current situation favors the unofficial handling of public affairs because institutions operate based on political loyalties and because these political loyalties are nothing else than blind obedience to the individual in command, never fearing the law, and least of all support for reasonable government. Prosecutor Carlos Aranda discovered a single possible electoral crime in the files. He handed the judge the evidence of an act at the Interior Ministry involving Oviedo and the then-Colorado Party presidential hopeful Juan Carlos Wasmosy and his running mate Angel Roberto Seifart. During this act, Oviedo said the ANR [National Republican Association-Colorado Party] and the Armed Forces would rule for ever. Let us remind ourselves of some data from the archives regarding military interference in politics, just to make the prosecutor and the judge blush before their friends: - "Laymen Club charges that the military are interfering in politics." (ABC COLOR 6 Jul 92) - Former President Gen. Andres Rodrigues votes in the internal elections of the Colorado Party. Gen. Oviedo justifies military men voting in the internal elections of the Colorado Party. (ABC COLOR 14 Aug 93) - Current Colorado Party President Eugenio Sanabria Cantero reveals that the ANR consulted Gen. Rodriguez, who in turn consulted the Armed Forces about the Wasmosy-Seifart ticket. (ABC COLOR 7 Sep 92) - "Former Colorado Party Presidential candidate Luis Maria Argana urges his fellow party members not to be afraid of the military men currently in power." (ABC COLOR 25 Oct 92) - "Frutos [not further identified] criticizes the generals who support the Wasmosy-Seifart ticket." He mentions Generals Oviedo, Marino Gonzalez, and Rodriguez. (ABC COLOR 21 Nov 92) - "Lino Oviedo again meddles in politics in Fuerte Olimpo. Military man participated in a political rally organized by Wasmosy and Seifart." (ABC COLOR 5 Dec 92) - "Colorado Party internal elections. Oviedo gives his opinion before polling concludes. `The people can lump it if they have the desire to return to the past,' he said referring to Argana after announcing that he had voted for the Wasmosy-Seifart ticket." (ABC COLOR 28 Dec 92) - "The military men who participated in the ANR rally may be punished." (ABC COLOR 5 Feb 93) Finally, after ANR's victory was made known on election day, Oviedo, who was still euphoric, stated that his remarks at the Interior Ministry during the election campaign were not made to "lift the spirit and courage of the Colorados, because his voice and vote respond to only one person." The last hope of a military caudillo who would bow before the law has now vanished with Judge Jose Agustin Fernandez' decision. We must now resign ourselves to putting up with a military chief as the focal point of the transition to democracy in the 1993-98 period, and at the same time observe how the pieces are moved in a plan that contemplates the immobility of the state's obsolete structure so that it can remain at the service of those who seek continuity. The background data showing that the law has been violated is useless, the law itself is useless when those who administrate it think more about the bench they sit on than the justice that concerns us.
