FBIS4-53559 "dreas098_a_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 20 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Reports Concerning Public Utility Rate Continue Reports Concerning Public Utility Rate Continue Cabinet Gives Official Approval OW2005055094 Tokyo KYODO in English 0538 GMT 20 May 94 OW2005055094 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's Cabinet on Friday [20 May] gave the official go-ahead to the premier's proposed freeze of public service charges until the end of the year. The cabinet endorsed Hata's call for halting all planned hikes on domestic phone charges, public housing rents, taxi fares, expressway tolls and fire insurance premiums. The government also requested local governments to follow suit, asking them not to raise charges on their services such as public- sector buses and subways, and water supply. It is the first freeze of public charges since 1974, and the first such sweeping one since 1964. Hata's "political decision" came on Wednesday in response to a torrent of criticism from the public and business circles that governmental organizations are too willing to raise charges while the private sector is forced to make cuts to cope with the worst recession in the postwar period. The step, generally welcomed by businesses and consumers, was described by political analysts as an attempt to win public support for his precariously positioned minority government. Hata's announcement also came as "a bolt out of the blue" for most bureaucrats who supervise public-sector organizations' charges. Some top government officials made clear they are irked by the decision, which was taken without consulting them. One such official said, "ministries are all opposed to the measure. That's why it was a political decision. But they will follow their bosses' decision." Cabinet members lauded the move and insisted that the margin of increases will not be raised when the freeze ends. "The significance of the step lies in its being a sweeping one. It is our political decision," said Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio Terasawa. "We need to boost consumer confidence to lift the economy," he told a press conference. Transport Minister Nobuaki Futami said at a separate press conference that his ministry will not allow larger hikes in expressway tolls or taxi fares because of the freeze than those already applied for. Futami also said he will take account of the economic conditions in considering the timing of lifting the cap on charges, suggesting a possibility of extending the freeze beyond the end of the year. Construction Minister Koji Morimoto, however, said he regards the measure as applying only for this year. "I am not thinking about (a freeze) of one or two years beyond the year-end," he said. Some cabinet members called for a review of the way expressway tolls are determined. During unofficial talks after the cabinet meeting, Futami said the basic problems concerning the method of calculating highway tolls should be reconsidered by the year-end. He reportedly argued that the principal problem is that the depreciation costs for the land are reflected in the tolls. Morimoto admitted at the press conference the need for reviewing the calculation method, while emphasizing the importance of maintaining the construction plans for expressways. Highways are built by public corporations with borrowed money which they pay back with the revenue from tolls.
