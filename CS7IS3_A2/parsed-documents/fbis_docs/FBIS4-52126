This was disclosed on 3 May by a Russian official in charge of the development project. Negotiations have continued between Russia and the Japanese firms for nearly a year through the mediation of a major U.S. aircraft manufacturer. There is a possibility the Japanese firms will make major moves toward participating in the development project once the prospect of raising funds is opened and Russia's plans for the repayment of their investments are confirmed. Russia hopes the Japanese firms will provide full technological assistance in designing the passenger cabin of the Ilyushin-96M and in manufacturing aircraft parts. Major points of the proposals made by Russia during the negotiations are: 1) The passenger cabin is jointly designed; 2) the Japanese firms manufacture kitchen and toilet facilities; 3) Russian participants manufacture ceiling and ceiling storage cabins; and 4) the passenger cabin (measuring 15 meters in length) prototype is displayed at the Paris Air Show scheduled for June this year if it is ready in time. With regard to the funds, Russia has asked the Japanese firms to provide approximately $3 million as the initial cost of the development project. So far, Russia has asked them to invest $25 million in the development project, but it is said to have cut the amount by one-eighth in an attempt to lure the Japanese firms into the project.
