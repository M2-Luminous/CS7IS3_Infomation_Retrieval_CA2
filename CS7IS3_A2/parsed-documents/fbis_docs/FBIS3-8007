The Croatian Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs stated in the purchase request that most of the masks are intended for firemen and a smaller number for the civilian population. Dlouhy's Ministry of Industry and Trade originally consulted on the sale with the Foreign Ministry, which, in turn, submitted the request for assessment to the appropriate UN committee. Acting on its recommendation, the License Administration of the Ministry of Industry and Trade has not granted the Zubri Rubber Works the required export license. A diplomatic official who does not wish to be named for fear of difficulties at work told MLADA FRONTA DNES yesterday that, although the Czech Republic and Croatia were to be trading partners, the actual initiator of the contact was a certain Slovak firm that mediated this deal for the Zubri Rubber Works. The rubber works would have received almost 45 million korunas for the sale of the gas masks to Croatia.
