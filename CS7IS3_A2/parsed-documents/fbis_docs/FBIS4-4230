"By the 25th of this month, the first batch of bonds worth 20 billion yuan had been purchased by state commercial banks and non-banking financial institutions," said SDB President Yao Zhengya. "The sell-out of the bonds marks a good start for key state projects in obtaining enough capital funds this year," said Yao. According to the usual practice, these projects should obtain 40 percent of the yearly financing during the first six months of the year. However, the planned capital demand was only met by 19 percent of the projects during the January-June period of 1993 due to a national financial squeeze. The State Development Bank, the country's first policy bank, was established to ensure the smooth channeling of funds to major construction projects, mostly in the basic industries and infrastructure sectors, and technical renovation of "pillar" state firms. According to Yao, the bank will issue a total of 65 billion yuan in bonds this year. The other issues will be made in May, July, August and October, with amounts of 8 billion, 13 billion, 12.5 billion and 11.5 billion yuan respectively. The bonds, which include 45.5 three-year maturity bonds and 19.5 five-year maturity bonds, will be bought by banks and other financial bodies under quotas set by the People's Bank of China, the central bank. The interest rates are 12.5 percent for the three-year bonds and 14 percent for the five-year ones. The national treasury provided the bank with one billion yuan as a discount this year to make up for the gap caused by the low interest loans extended by the bank to the projects.
