Goodlad arrived in Hong Kong yesterday for a three-day visit to discuss Hong Kong's political future with Governor Chris Patten and the Executive Council. His arrival came as British opposition spokesman on foreign affairs Jack Cunningham announced he would meet Chinese leaders in Beijing later this month for talks on Hong Kong's future. While China has virtually severed ties with British and Hong Kong officials it has approved the visit by Britain's Labour spokesman on the territory. Cunningham will meet Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu and head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping, as well as other Chinese leaders. Cunningham will also visit Hong Kong for talks with political and business leaders, including Patten. Goodlad's visit comes 10 days before Patten flies to London to meet Prime Minister John Major to discuss the next moves over Hong Kong's political future. Goodlad said he hoped there would be further talks with China over constitutional reform despite China's threat to disband the legislature after 1997. "We would think it would be highly desirable that there should be a through train and we hope to continue discussions with the Chinese side on that subject," Goodlad said. "We very much hope there would be further talks on the important subjects for the prosperity and the stability of Hong Kong." The minister had a one-hour meeting with Patten and spoke to Executive Councillors yesterday as well as attending a cocktail party with Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod and some of Hong Kong's leading businessmen. Goodlad will go to the new airport site as well as visiting the Black Point power station in Tuen Mun today. But this morning Goodlad will confront the Legislative Council's Nationality Committee to explain why the British government has refused to grant citizenship to more than 6,000 ethnic minority residents who will be left stateless after 1997. Topping the agenda will be the move by the House of Lords to give non-Chinese ethnics [as published] the right of abode in Britain. The bill, which was introduced by Lord Bonham-Carter last month, has majority support in the House of Lords but will be blocked by the government in the House of Commons. Committee chairman and independent legislator Emily Lau said she wanted Goodlad to explain the government's position over the controversial legislation. "Like a bad penny, we'll keep showing up," she said.
