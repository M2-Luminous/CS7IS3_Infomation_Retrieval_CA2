Chemically treat or pave both shoulders of 30 miles of State highways within the county. 5. Pave all parking lots within the city. 6. Revise the specifications for winter anti-skid materials to require cleaner, less friable materials, and reduce the quantity used per lane-mile. 7. Require crop rotations on highly erodible lands. 8. Retire highly erodible sections of farmland and plant indigenous vegetation as a cover instead of leaving land fallow. 9. Plant crops and windbreaks across the prevailing wind direction on highly erodible lands. In summary, the State must document its selection of BACM by showing what control measures applicable to each source category (not shown to be de minimis) were considered. The control measures selected should preferably be measures that will prevent PM&hyph;10 emissions rather than temporarily reduce them. The documentation should compare the control efficiency of technologically-feasible measures, their energy and environmental impacts and the costs of implementation. F. Selection of BACT for Point Sources The reviewing authority determines BACT on a case-by-case basis. As described above, EPA would expect the reviewing authority to select an emissions limitation that reflects the maximum degree of emission reduction of each pollutant subject to regulation (PM&hyph;10 and/or PM&hyph;10 precursors), taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, that it determines is achievable for such facility. In light of preceding discussions of BACT and its statutory bases, it is EPA's policy that BACT be determined using the analytical methodology established in the reviewing authority's current PSD program to the extent that it is consistent with guidance contained in this notice. The analytical methodology used should, at a minimum, consider a representative range of available controls (including the most stringent, those capable of meeting standards of performance under 40 CFR part 60 or 61, and those identified by commenters during the public comment period). Selection of a particular control system as BACT must be justified by a comparison of the candidate control systems considering energy, environmental, and economic impacts, and other costs, and be supported by the record. In addition, if the reviewing authority determines that there is no economically-reasonable or technologically-feasible way to accurately measure the emissions, and hence to impose an enforceable emissions standard, it may require the source to use design, alternative equipment, work practice, or operational standards to reduce emissions of the pollutant to the maximum extent feasible (see, by analogy, 40 CFR 52.21(b)(12); 40 CFR 51.166(b)(12)). Alternative approaches to reducing emissions of particulate matter including PM&hyph;10 are discussed in ``Control Techniques for Particulate Emissions From Stationary Sources'' - Volume I (EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;81/005a) and Volume II (EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;81&hyph;005b), September 1982. The design, operation, and maintenance of general particulate matter control systems such as mechanical collectors, electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters, and wet scrubbers are discussed in Volume I. The collection efficiency of each system is discussed as a function of particle size. Information is also presented regarding energy and environmental considerations and procedures for estimating costs of particulate matter control equipment. The emission characteristics and control technologies applicable to specific source categories are discussed in Volume II. Secondary environmental impacts are also discussed. The BACT/LAER Clearinghouse, the EPA Control Technology Center, and past BACT analyses for new and modified major sources under the PSD program may be used to assist in identifying available control options and maximum achievable emission reductions. The EPA will continue to evaluate the need for additional guidance and will produce additional materials as appropriate.
