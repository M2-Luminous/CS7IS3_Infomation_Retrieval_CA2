"He is concerned about the Ukrainian side's open demonstration of its unwillingness to adhere strictly to the understanding on the separate basing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy, which was contained in the Moscow agreement. "The Ukrainian side is making totally inappropriate hints about the possibility of resolving the contentious issue with the help of a third power. Needless to say, the Russian side will not tolerate any outside interference in the question of the Black Sea Fleet. One has the impression that the Ukrainian side does not realize what the realities are and is losing control over the situation. In these circumstances it is becoming less and less consistent and more unpredictable both in its actions and in its statements. This constitutes a serious danger. At the same time it is obvious that the Black Sea Fleet cannot be used as a hostage of Ukraine's internal political disagreements. "In connection with circumstances which have taken shape Boris Yeltsin is holding intensive political consultations with competent departments."
