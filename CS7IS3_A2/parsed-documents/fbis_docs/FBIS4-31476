The consultation was part of Goncz's recent series of political discussions with parliamentary party leaders. Surjan said he had agreed with the president on the key importance of a smooth transfer of governmental affairs. They both supposed that a coalition government would be formed. Regarding the KDNP's future, Surjan said the party should break out from the category of a religious party, and emerge in political life as a socially-committed party with its own system of values and its own message for the whole of society.
