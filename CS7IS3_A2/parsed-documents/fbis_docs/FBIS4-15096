He linked this primarily to the Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov's current unofficial visit to Cyprus, where he has been kept from returning. As he explained, the presidential plane cannot leave Cyprus because the Turkish authorities have not given permission for its flight over their air space. The most likely reason for their refusal is that the flight has been requested later than is stipulated by Turkish legislation. As a spokesman for Meshkov's administration has reported, presidential aides in Simferopol have asked Russia's Foreign Ministry to help settle the affair. "Meshkov's plane was registered in Ukraine. This means that no one but the Ukrainian authorities should interfere," a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official explained. The authorities could easily do so since the Ukrainian Embassy in Ankara has been functioning for two years now, he added. Meanwhile, Ukraine's Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskiy, accompanied by a unit of national guards, arrived in Simferopol without any preliminary agreement with the presidential administration. Some other Ukrainian generals are now in the Crimean capital. Among them -- a deputy chief of staff and senior security and intelligence officers. The Chief of the Ukrainian Air Force Headquarters Anatoliy Lopata is in Sevastopol for inspection. The Ukrainian President's Military Adviser Vladimir Petenko is also in the Crimean port.
