At a press conference during a meeting of the Executive Council of Klaus' Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the prime minister said he would therefore begin "fundamental discussions" with the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) on solving the problems in this area. Benda is a member of the KDS. Following the dismissal of Deputy Environment Minister Petr Gandalovic (ODS), the ODS has lost contact with this ministry, Klaus said. The Executive Council also appointed a committee to draft a bill which would set a final limit on who would be eligible to receive compensation for suffering endured during the communist period. ODS Chairman and Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus emphasized that the matter did not mean the end of general restitution of property. The committee will be headed by ODS Vice Chairman Jiri Vlach. Klaus said the number of cases concerning the redress of the most serious grievances had passed its limit. "I fear that by drawing things out extensively, we could reach the absurd conclusion that every citizen was aggrieved during his life under the communist regime," he said.
