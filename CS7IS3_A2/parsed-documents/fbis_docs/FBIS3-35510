Stones were also thrown at the Western Wall compound and the Jewish worshipers were evacuated. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that four policemen were lightly wounded in the Temple Mount riots. There was also a riot near the Nabulus Gate by Muslims who had left Temple Mount prayers. They threw stones and bottles at the police forces and some of them were detained. Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that thousands of worshipers who left Temple Mount are now standing around the Nabulus Gate compound and refuse to disperse.

The police set up roadblocks and detained residents from the territories for questioning. [passage omitted] Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that during the clashes with the residents of the territories, a border policeman and three policemen were wounded. Since the morning, there have been violent incidents and riots in many locations in the territories. Shots were fired at Israeli vehicles, and there were many stonings of Israeli vehicles by Arabs. In the wake of those incidents, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] imposed a curfew on Hebron and the Bethlehem area, and a closure on the Gaza Strip, but the IDF is trying to avoid unnecessary confrontations with the local Arab population. The IDF spokesman announced that the IDF has been beefed up in the territories.
