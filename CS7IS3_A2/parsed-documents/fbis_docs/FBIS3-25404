Addressing a meeting of the International Press Institute in Cape Town, Ms. de Lille said the media had blown out of all proportion the white brain drain as if the whole country would come to a standstill as a result. Her statement is in contrast to African National Congress leader Mr. Nelson Mandela's call to whites not to leave the country.
