Bosnian Serb sources announced on Sunday that local Bosnian Croat troops and units of the regular Croatian army from the Orasje region (northern Bosnia) on Saturday evening used tanks, 60mm mortars, anti-aircraft guns and infantry weapons to attack Serb positions eight km south and southwest of Orasje. The attacks failed to cause any damage and the Bosnian Serb army held their fire. The Moslems continued offensive actions in the region of Srbobra (former Donji Vakuf), and Mt. Vlasic (central Bosnia) where they are also regrouping and massing reinforcements. In the Vlasic front, the Moslems used 128mm light rocket launchers and heavy mortars.
