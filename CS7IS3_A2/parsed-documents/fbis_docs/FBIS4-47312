G. Bronevich, A N. Karkishchenko, Taganrog Radiotechnical Institute; UDC 519.237.8] [Abstract] This paper examines rather complex statistical objects, random processes characterized by their own probability distributions. The objects are formalized using the concept of a statistical class, which is introduced in this article. The main vehicle for describing statistical classes is level sets. These sets are defined by set-theoretical operations on statistical classes, in particular, measures of mutual inclusion and equality of arbitrary classes. Many properties of level sets are studied in the first part of the article. It is shown that a group of these sets can be used to define a statistical class. Operations on statistical classes are a natural extension of operations on level sets. The link between level sets and the traditional axiomatic theory of fuzzy sets is described. The set of minimal events, described in this paper, leads to the representation of a statistical class in the form of a fuzzy set. The link between fuzzy sets and probability distributions is established. The measures of inclusion and equality used for statistical classes can be transferred to arbitrary fuzzy sets, and more importantly, to fuzzy intervals and numbers. However, not every fuzzy set corresponds to a statistical class, and this is an issue that must still be addressed. References 6: 4 Russian, 2 Western.
