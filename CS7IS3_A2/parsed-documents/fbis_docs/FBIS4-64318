In a statement after meeting with ANAP mayors in Istanbul today, Yilmaz said that the current difficulties in the country stem from a lack of confidence in the government. Asked to comment on Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's statement that no one should engage in efforts to seek a new government, Yilmaz said: [Begin recording] It is natural that she should speak like that, but everyone knows that we did not initiate the quest for a new government. This quest comes from all sectors of society. We only announced that we are ready to do our task on this matter. Such a quest is an indication of a consensus that the present government is not the solution to our problems. [end recording] Yilmaz declared that the search for a confidence-inspiring and broad-based government will continue despite the prime minister's appeal to the contrary. Even if a broad-based government cannot be established, Yilmaz noted, a minority government is a possibility if a general consensus is reached. [passage omitted] In a news conference in Ankara today, Fikri Saglar, secretary general of the Social Democratic Populist Party, noted the recent search for a transition government and said that his party is categorically opposed to this. Saglar remarked that his party will not support any nondemocratic solution. Pointing out that certain circles launched this quest the moment they realized that their interests were undermined, Saglar said that those who are looking for a government of technocrats or a transition government are actually yearning for dark periods and want to attain the dark monies of those dark periods.
