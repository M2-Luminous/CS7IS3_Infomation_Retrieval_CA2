Economic and Social Development in 1993: Basic Situation Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory about building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the party's 14th National Congress, people of all nationalities in the province worked hard to deepen reform, broaden the open policy, and accelerate development in 1993. There were remarkable achievements in all areas of economic and social development. 1) Economic Development Reaches New Level; Structural Adjustment Scores New Progress Gross output value stood at 9.65 billion yuan for the entire year, up 10 percent, a gain of 2.5 percentage points over last year and higher than the goal of 9 percent set at the beginning of the year. Specifically, the primary industry grew 5.5 percent, the secondary industry 12.9 percent, and the tertiary industry 9.5 percent. The rural economy developed across the board. Grain output for all 1993 reached 2.03 billion kilograms, 104.3 percent of the target and a historic high. There was a substantial increase in acreage planted with barley, assorted legumes, soybean, vegetables, herbal medicines, and tobacco, which are highly sought after on the market and fetch good prices. Township and town enterprises continued their strong momentum, their gross output value hitting 3.05 billion yuan for the year as a whole, up 42.8 percent from the preceding year. Industrial output rose steadily, expanding by 3.65 billion yuan, a gain of 12.8 percent over a year ago. (Gross industrial output value stood at 12.08 billion yuan, up 13.9 percent.) Heavy industry, particularly metallurgy and the building materials industry, grew substantially. Nonstate industry expanded more rapidly than state industry. Enterprises enjoyed higher margins of profit. Among industrial products, the production to sales ratio climbed from 95.4 percent to 97.6 percent, the profit to funds ratio from 5 to 6.5 percent, and the working capital circulation rate from 1.3 to 1.4 times. The combined profitability index of industrial enterprises that practiced independent accounting hit 76.6 percent, 10 percentage points higher than 1992. Enterprises in the building industry found themselves in an improved position and completed an additional 850 million yuan worth of projects, or up 13.3 percent over last year. Potential was tapped in the transportation and posts and telecommunications industries. Railroads, highways, and airplanes carried 5.8 percent more cargo than in the preceding year, while the volume of business in the posts and telecommunications industry rose 53.4 percent. 2) Key Areas Report New Achievements; New Projects Completed Fixed assets investment in all society totaled 5.16 billion yuan, up 35.5 percent, or 12.5 percent after adjusting for inflation. This includes the 3.37 billion yuan in local fixed assets investment, 131.2 percent of the target in the plan for the year, up 27.1 percent from a year ago, or 4.1 percent after adjusting for inflation. Of the total local fixed assets investment, capital construction investment by state units amounted to 2.59 billion yuan, and another 900 million yuan went to modernization and transformation. The overwhelming majority of key projects proceeded smoothly. Among national priority projects, all work on bridges, culverts, and tunnels relating to railroad construction has been completed. The double-tracking of the 62-kilometer Zhongwei-Gantang railroad was completed and the line has now been put into service. Among the region's own priority projects, the construction of the mine and rotary kiln in the second phase of the expansion of Ningxia cement plant was completed; they went into trial production last October. Work was essentially completed on the pumping station at the Yanhuanding project, trial operation has begun for some parts of the project, irrigating 21,400 mu for winter last year. These are some of the major projects completed last year: the transformation of the Yinchuan chemical fertilizer plant, the expansion of Ningxia coking factory, the Ningxia ferro-alloy plant, the resin plant at Qingtong gorge, steel cable workshop at the Shizuishan steel plant, Xiji vermicelli plant, Zhongwei modern building materials plant, Ningxia ferric oxide plant, the coal mine in Pingluo county, Guyuan granary, and centralized heating in county towns like Yanci and Pingluo, centralized supply of heat to Yanci, Pingluo, and other county towns, No 2 waterworks in the old city of Yinchuan, the expansion of the capacity of the telephone systems in Yinchuan, Taole, Pangyang, and Xiji, distance-programmed telephone projects in Shizuishan, Qingtong Gorge, Zhongwei, and Pingluo, and the highway from Rujigou mine to the opening of the ravine for the transportation of coal. 3) New Strides Made in Reform-Deepening; New Developments in Broadening the Policy of Opening to Outside World Rural reform continued to deepen. The transformation of the operating mechanism of state enterprises became more thoroughgoing. Rapid progress was made in the reform of the property rights system. Multiple economies continued to take shape. The number of private enterprises and individual industrial and commercial households rose 50.4 percent and 19.8 percent, respectively, from a year ago. The entire economy became more market-oriented. The market for every commodity continued to expand. New progress was made in the development of the markets for capital goods like finance, securities, and real estate. The implementation of Document 6 of the CPC Central Committee and the effort to tighten macroeconomic regulation and control have been remarkably successful; the once disorderly financial market has changed markedly for the better. Region-wide 427 million yuan in loans that were illegally or improperly made were recovered. The reserve fund rate of the various specialized banks increased from 3.4 percent in July to over 10 percent by year end. The open policy continued to be broadened on all fronts across the board. Exports last year totalled $111.24 million, approaching last year's level, including $74.71 million worth of goods exported by the localities themselves, up 11.6 percent from the previous year. A total of $36.66 million in foreign capital was utilized during the year, an increase of 260 percent from 1992, and 181 enterprises funded by the three kinds of foreign capital were approved in all of 1993. 4) New Achievements in All Social Undertakings; Improvements in People's Living Standards There was a total of 257 scientific and technological [S&T] achievements above the provincial or ministerial level in all 1993 and 168 patents were granted. In rural areas, yield-increasing technologies including ton-grain technology, high-yield paddy farming technology, the transformation of low-yield land, and dry crop agriculture were introduced over large areas. Altogether 4.6 million mu were brought under cultivation using the new technologies. Eighteen new crop varieties were selected and submitted for approval. On the industrial front, a host of new technologies, new products, and new processes were developed. The vertical cement mechanical kiln, electromagnetic bridge crane, and ATC cam knife-shifting equipment, among others, were put into production with fairly good economic results. ' Institutions of higher education in the autonomous region admitted 3,378 students in 1993, up 24 percent from a year ago, and secondary specialized schools admitted 4,397, up 16.6 percent. At the elementary school level, 95.2 percent of school-age children were in school, up from 94.6 percent in 1992. The "231" project was further implemented. Region-wide, the number of illiterates dropped by 48,800 people, and the two counties of Pingluo and Zhongwei inspected and accepted the anti-illiteracy campaign organized by the autonomous region. A variety of social undertakings continued to make progress. Urban and rural household incomes continued to increase. The per capita income in urban areas was 1,907 yuan, up 304 yuan from a year ago or 3.3 percent after adjusting for inflation. Per capita net income among peasants was 667 yuan, up 48 yuan from last year, but actually unchanged from a year ago after adjusting for inflation. The market was booming, with social commodity retail sales for the year reaching 4.3 billion yuan, up 15.4 percent from last year. According to sample surveys, the natural population growth rate for the year was 14.07 per thousand, down 0.068 per thousand from a year ago. The region's total population stood at 4,953,000 at year end, 37,000 fewer than projected. Even as the region's economy chalked up new achievements last year, there were some outstanding problems and contradictions, primarily overly rapid price increases. The overall price index for the year was 12.8 percent, and the household living expenses price index jumped 14. percent, significantly higher than the target set at the beginning of the year. Funds and rail transportation continued to have considerable "bottleneck" effects on the economy. Times were tough for a number of state enterprises. The amount of losses was significant and the number of money-losing enterprises high. 2. 1994 Economic and Social Development Plan: Major Targets and Tasks Nineteen ninety-four is a critical year for the completion of the Eighth Five-Year Plan. It is also crucial for the push to create a socialist market economy. Grasping the opportunity, deepening reform, expediting development, and maintaining stability...such is the keynote for region-wide work. The design and implementation of the 1994 regional economic and social development plan should adhere to this keynote and contribute to it. It must be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory about building socialism with Chinese characteristics and be thoroughly true to the spirit of the 3d Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 2d meeting of the 8th National People's Congress. The plan should further liberate our thinking, promote reform all round, expand the open policy, and strive to adjust the structure and raise profitability. It should take bold solid steps toward creating the basic framework for a socialist market economy, spur the steady, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, and fuel social progress all round. Based on these demands, the principal targets of the 1994 regional economic and social development plan are: -- Gross regional output should reach 11.4 billion yuan, up 9 percent over 1993 in constant prices. The primary industry is projected to grow 4 percent, the secondary industry 9 percent, and the tertiary industry 13 percent. -- Fixed assets investment in all society should be 4.77 billion yuan, up 9.4 percent in constant prices, including 1.38 billion yuan in capital construction investment by local state units, 750 million yuan in technological transformation, and 1.1 billion yuan in collective and individual investment. -- Local revenue should reach 602.49 million yuan, up 9.8 percent in constant prices, after the tax separation system is introduced. -- Exports should reach $105 million, imports $70 million. The amount of foreign capital utilized is estimated at $35.5 million. -- Social commodity retail sales should grow 14 percent to reach 4.9 billion yuan. -- Overall retail prices should rise no more than 10 percent or so. -- Work hard to improve profitability. The energy conservation rate, the rate of sales of finished products, and the circulation of working capital must all go up. The ratio of unprofitable enterprises must be brought down 5 percentage points, while the amount of losses should be trimmed by 10 percent. -- The natural population growth rate should be contained below 14.4 per thousand. Total population at year end is projected to reach 5.02 million. These are the major tasks of economic and social development for 1994: 1) Make Agriculture the Top Priority Steadfastly, Spur Rural Economic Development Across the Board Grain output is projected to total 1.9 billion kilograms in 1994; oil-bearing crops, 70 million kilograms; beet, 600,000 tons; fruit, 130 million kilograms; meat, 83 million kilograms; and aquatic products, 150,000 tons. The gross output value of township and town enterprises will reach 3,664,000,000 yuan, up 20.3 percent. Peasants' net incomes will be 720 yuan per capita, 53 yuan more than the year before. We should concentrate on doing a good job in these areas: 1) Intensify the adjustment of the rural industrial structure. As far as grain crops are concerned, we should grow more beer-producing barley, legumes, corn, and buckwheat As for cash crops, we should expand the planting of beet, hops, asparagus, chili, and man-made licorice root. In forestry, we should tackle the development of second-generation high standard farmland and forest belt in the Huangguan region and the comprehensive treatment of desertified areas. Moreover, we should continue to develop commercial orchards and commercial forests. Turning to the animal husbandry industry, efforts should be made to raise beef cattle, sheep that produce mutton and wool, and pigs that produce lean pork. 2) Build up a host of agricultural commodity production bases. Develop an agriculture that is high-yield, high-efficiency, and good-quality. In addition to creating various agricultural byproducts commodity bases already planned, we should build 16 high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficiency agricultural demonstration zones of all types across the entire region. 3) Step up the development of the agricultural infrastructure to enhance agriculture's lasting power. Continue to tackle the Huang He treatment project. Complete Phase 1 of the irrigation expansion project funded by the World Bank. Launch Project 4071 in the three counties including Guyuan which was funded by the World Food Program and designed to fight poverty and environment. The Huang He Daliushu key water control project, long-hoped-for by the people in the region, has been included in the "National Program for Agricultural Development in the 1990's" adopted by the State Council. It has also made its way into the list of projects, the fourth batch so far, approved by the State Council that may be considered for receiving loans from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan. This year we should concentrate our energies on reviewing and approving the necessary documents, drawing up the migration plan, and repaving the roads on site. Also we need to continue to tackle with diligence preliminary work for the Liupanshan water diversification project, the Xingren water pumping project, the Shabotou key water control project, and the remaking of another irrigated area in the Hetao region. 4) Further accelerate the development of township and town enterprises. Push for the adoption of the shareholding cooperative system vigorously. Increase inputs in township and town enterprise through various channels and at all levels. Import technology and attract qualified personnel to come to Ningxia. Expand lateral economic and technical cooperation both within Ningxia and between the region and other places. Improve the overall quality of township and town enterprises. Step up planning and guide township and town enterprises to achieve the right degree of concentration. Fully utilize and transform existing small towns and build new ones. Strive for breakthroughs on all these fronts this year. 5) Do a good job in poverty relief and development. The autonomous region should concentrate on putting to good use funds like the "three xi" and "work in lieu of loans." Work hard to secure other anti-poverty development funds from the central government. Targeting the impoverished areas, we must win the war on poverty. Beginning this year, the regional planning commission will work together with a number of mountainous counties to design an anti-poverty strategic plan. 2) Keep Output in Industry and Transportation Growing at a Steady Pace While Raising Profitability. These are the projected outputs for the major industrial products in 1994, taking into account market demand and production capacity: coal, 13 million tons; electricity generation, 9.1 billion kilowatt-hours; aluminum, 85,000 tons; ferro-alloy, 125,000 tons; cement, 1.4 million tons; chemical fertilizers (net amount), 330,000 tons; tires, 1.3 million sets, bearings, 1.9 million sets; machine tools, 2,280; machine-made paper and cardboard, 120,000 tons; sugar, 40,000 tons; and cigarettes, 53,000 crates. The profit to investment ratio of industrial enterprises is projected to rise to 7 percent, up from 6.5 percent a year ago. The turnover rate of working capital was 1.45 times, up from 1.4 times in the previous year. Overall labor productivity and the profit to costs ratio are also projected to continue to go up. Stopping enterprises from losing money and increasing their profits must be tackled as a major task this year. Intensify the responsibility system to stem losses and increase profits. Turning-losses-into-profits targets should be handed down from level to level all the way to the grass roots and enterprises. There should be evaluation at fixed intervals. Rewards and penalties should be meted out at year end. Ningxia should concentrate on stemming the losses of enterprises run by the region whose losses exceed 2 million yuan each and making major enterprises whose profits top 5 million yuan each even more profitable. At the same time, give priority to energy conservation work in high-energy-consumption enterprises. Further overhaul our thinking and liberalize our policies. Be supportive of nonstate enterprises when it comes to credit and transportation, etc. To spur the adjustment of the industrial structure and boost the staying power of development, we must continue to tackle industrial capital construction projects and technological transformation projects now under way aggressively so that they pay economic dividends as soon as possible. In the energy industry, the focus is on building the Lingwu mine and completing the No 1 well at Yangchang Wan. No time should be wasted in completing track-laying on the Dagu feeder railway. Begin construction on the power plant in the second phase of Daba power plant project. Continue construction on the Hexi headwork power station at Qingtong Gorge. Build the Sanying-Haiyuan and Yinchuan-Helan 110 kilovolt power transformation and transmission works. In raw materials industry, complete the expansion of the second phase of Ningxia cement works, the transformation of Qingtong Gorge cement plant, the heavy oil catalytic cracking transformation of Ningxia oil refinery, and the energy consumption project at the Shizuishan steel works. Tackle preliminary work on these projects: phase three of Qingtong Gorge aluminum plant, the natural gas pipeline, the transformation of Ningxia chemical industrial plant, and the transmission of electricity from Ningxia to other provinces. Turning to the processing industry, complete a host of technological transformation projects, including those at Xibei bearing plant, the Yinchuan electric wire plant, the Yinchuan dacron plant, and the Dahe machine tool plant. Complete the expansion of Zhongwei paper-making plant and 5233 plant. Begin construction on the deadweight meridian tire project at the Yinchuan rubber plant, the 500,000-set spherical roller bearing project at the Xibei bearing plant, the Ningxia fermentation plant, the Shizuishan sanitary porcelain works, the Yinchuan metallic magnesium plant, and the Ningxia pharmaceutical plant. Turning to transportation and posts and telecommunications, continue to coordinate with the central government's plan to accelerate the transformation of Baozhong Railway and Baolan Railway and the construction of Jinghu Yinlan, Xilanwu Class 1 guanglan main lines. Complete the construction of the Yingu Highway and Yinchuan Huang He Bridge. Start construction on Yinchuan Hedong Airport. Begin the expansion of the handling capacity of the municipal telephone system of Yinchuan to 30,000 lines. Begin phases two and three of the mobile communications project. Proceed with the program-controlled telephone projects in such cities and counties as Yongning and Helan. 3) Maintain Investment on a Sensible Scale; Further Accelerate Key Projects Social fixed assets investment for the entire region is projected to reach 4.77 billion yuan (excluding Baozhong Railway and Changqing oil-field), up 9.4 percent from the preceding year. Specifically, investment by state units will total 3.67 billion yuan, up 10 percent, and investment by collectives and individuals, 1.1 billion yuan, up 7.3 percent. Of all investment by state units, 2.27 billion yuan (1.38 billion yuan from local governments and 890 million yuan from the central government) will go to capital construction; 1 billion yuan (750 million yuan from local governments and 250 million yuan from the center) will go to technological transformation, 285 million yuan will go to real estate development, and 150 million yuan will be invested in other projects. Of all capital construction investment by local state units, local governments have tentatively allocated 60 million yuan in their budgets, lending by the various banks in the region will amount to 250 million yuan, the head office of the Construction Bank will make available 136 million yuan in special loans, and various central ministries and commissions will chip in with 87 million yuan. In addition, 180 million yuan will come from special funds like those of electricity, transportation, and posts and telecommunications; 5.4 million yuan from the energy and transportation fund; 29 million yuan from the special agricultural fund under the region's finance department; 14 million yuan from the "three xi" fund; 175 million yuan in funds raised by the sectors, municipalities, and counties themselves; 104 million yuan in foreign capital, 108 million yuan in funds raised through the issue of bonds, etc., and 40 million yuan in other funds. Continue to make a success of the technological transformation of existing enterprises, particularly large and mid-sized state enterprises. Continue to implement the "doubling" plan in key enterprises. In technological transformation projects, limit the share of investment in local products and import more technology. Modernize equipment and develop new products. Eleven projects have been designated as key national and autonomous regional construction projects for 1994. Among key national construction projects are the Lingwu mine and Baozhong Railway. Among key regional construction projects are the following: Yinchuan Hedong airport, Yanhuanding water-pumping project, phase two of Daba power plant, Yinchuan dairy products factory, Yingu Highway (including Yinchuan Huang He Bridge), Ningxia tourist hotel, the expansion of the handling capacity of the Yinchuan municipal telephone system, the transformation of Yinchuan rubber plant, and the expansion of Xibei bearing plant. Eight projects have been designated as key preliminary work in the region: Daliushu key water conservancy project, Liupanshan river diversion project, Xingren water-pumping, phase three expansion of Qingtong gorge aluminum plant, expansion of Ningxia chemical industrial plant, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia natural gas pipeline, Guyuan cement plant, and the Aerda imitation silk project, a Sino-Indonesian joint venture. 4) Grasp Opportunity To Further Open Up to Outside World Fully capitalize on the existing favorable opportunity to increase exports and foreign exchange earnings. Even as Ningxia continues to do well with traditional staple exports, it must strive to develop new flagship exports. The export sector should be given preferential treatment when it comes to obtaining bank credits and securing rail transportation. Promptly give qualified enterprises the authority to handle foreign trade on their own. Make use of the region's coastal areas as window to the outside world. Go all out to open up and develop an international market. After a unitary system is introduced in foreign exchange, the autonomous region will no longer control or issue to lower levels a foreign exchange distribution plan. The state imposes quota management on 26 commodities and applies an automatic registration system to some commodities which are sensitive on the domestic market. As for other commodities, it will be up to the enterprises themselves to organize their importation. Continue to utilize foreign loans extensively and effectively, using most of them to finance the transformation of large- and medium-sized state enterprises and the autonomous region's key construction projects. Our plan calls for the utilization of $18.48 million in foreign loans in all 1994, including $8.48 million in foreign loans taken out by the state and $10 million international commercial loans. Tighten foreign debt management. Adhere to the rule that the borrower must also be the repayer and put an end to the present situation in which borrowing is often dissociated from repaying. Further improve the investment climate. Continue to attract direct foreign investment in a variety of ways. Direct foreign investment is estimated at $17 million for 1994. In accordance with the industrial policies of the state and the region, we should steer even more foreign capital to foreign-exchange-earning industries, infrastructural projects, basic industries, other projects using advanced technology, and the technological transformation of existing enterprises. Actively spur the development of the "three kinds of enterprises either wholly or partially funded by foreign capital," making them more upscale and enabling them to operate at a higher level and on a larger scale. Increase the percentage of foreign capital that actually materializes. 5) Steer Economic Construction Onto the Path of Relying on S&T Progress In Earnest; Further Develop Education The autonomous region is set to tackle 37 key S&T projects and 17 S&T dissemination projects in 1994. In agricultural S&T, the main focus should shift from exclusively pursuing quantity to pursuing both an increase in quantity and an improvement in product quality and to increasing the value of commodities. Accelerate the introduction of better varieties of cash crops and step up research on their farming technology. Intensify research into the processing technology of famous, high-quality, and unique agricultural byproducts. Put together a host of S&T demonstration projects. In the short haul, we should concentrate on research in mulberry cultivation and silkworm raising, man-made licorice, and tobacco cultivation. Actively promote technological advances in industrial enterprises. Strongly encourage them to set up research and development offices. Import and absorb applicable technology extensively. Accelerate the transformation of traditional industries using new technology. Continue to develop new integrated electronic products and research new materials technology. It is proposed that enterprises join forces with institutions of higher education and scientific research units to set up a variety of organizations of technology development. Institutions of higher education and secondary specialized schools will admit 2,500 and 4,400 students, respectively, throughout the autonomous region in 1994. Increase the proportion of self-financed students as appropriate in accordance with a plan. Continue to diversify and increase the channels of educational funding. Compulsory education should primarily be funded by local governments. Encourage society to raise and pool funds for education in a variety of ways. Encourage private education. Make a success of "Project Hope," which aims to solicit educational donations for the mountainous areas in the south. Make vocational education and adult education more attuned to the demands of the market. Capitalize on the enthusiasm of all quarters in society for education. Continue with "Project 231." 6) Continue To Improve People's Lives and Develop Miscellaneous Social Undertakings With the economy developing and social productivity rising, we should continue to improve the people's living standard. By developing the rural economy across the board and raising the prices of grain and beet by an appropriate margin, we must work hard to boost peasants' incomes substantially. As output expands and profitability rises, state enterprises should raise their workers' wages correspondingly. Take pains to implement wage reform in units and institutions carefully and meticulously. Be solicitous about the livelihood of retired personnel, workers in troubled enterprises, and peasants in impoverished areas. Vigorously push ahead with the commercialization of urban housing and expedite housing construction. Accelerate the reform of the social security system. Continue to improve facilities that play an intimate part in the daily lives of the people: urban water supply system, roads, liquefied gas supply, etc. Actively develop cultural undertakings, publishing, radio and television broadcasting, public health, and sports. Increase investment in a variety of ways and through diversified channels to improve the infrastructure of social development. Continue to tackle family planning work successfully, focusing on rural areas and the floating population and going all out to keep the natural population increase rate below the target in the plan.
