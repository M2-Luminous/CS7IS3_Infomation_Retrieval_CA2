During the meeting the American side briefed the Palestinian side on the results of the meeting of U.S. President Bill Clinton with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad the day before yesterday in Geneva. After the meeting Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi said that the Palestinian side stressed to the American side that any progress along the Syrian or other tracks tends to create progress in the remaining tracks. She added that the Palestinian leadership is committed to a comprehensive solution, and there must be Arab coordination and a complementary stance on this process along all the tracks. The Palestinian side told the U.S. peace team that the United States should play a more effective role in the negotiations. Dr. Sa'ib Urayqat who was present at the meeting said that long discussions took place about the negotiations in Taba and the problems which stand in their way as a result of the intransigent Israeli attitude on its method of explaining its concepts and its understanding of the American role in the peace process. Dr. Urayqat said: We have explained the suffering of the people of the occupied territories as a result of Israeli practices, also the absorption operations and the seizure of land. We stressed to the American envoy that the continuation of Israeli practices over the land has made the peace process lose its credibility. On the Palestinian side, the meeting was attended by Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, Dr. Sa'ib Urayqat, Dr. Nabil Qassis, Dr. Kamil al-'Isawi, the lawyer Ziyad Abu-Ziyad, and sister Ahlam 'Abbasi.
