Song Jian, state councillor and concurrently minister in charge of the State Science and Technology Commission, issued a statement here on the purposes and significance of the white paper and on China's basic stand on the protection of intellectual property rights [IPR]. Song Jian said: The IPR system is an important legal system for the protection of scientific, technological, cultural, and artistic achievements. It is also one of the conditions for an environment for the development of international scientific and technological, economic, and cultural cooperation and exchanges. China's Law on Scientific and Technological Progress declares "the state and society respect knowledge, trained personnel, and creative labor by scientists and technicians, and protect IPR." The information office of the State Council released the Intellectual Property Protection in China White Paper, which systematically introduces China's IPR legislation and law enforcement and expounds the Chinese Government's guiding ideology for improving IPR protection, in order to enable the international community to have a full understanding of the basic condition of IPR protection in China as well as the principled stand taken by China, the international obligations it has undertaken, and the important measures it has adopted, and in order to further foster a legal consciousness of IPR protection among the public. Its release will surely play a positive role in further improving IPR protection in China. Song Jian pointed out: China's basic stand on IPR protection may be summed up as follows. First, China treats IPR protection as an important integral part of the policy on reform and opening up and of the socialist laws and regulations; speeds up the pace of legislation on IPR; and gradually perfects the relevant legal system. Second, China takes the road of internationalization in respect to the scope and level of its protection, and strives to conform to international standards. Third, China further strengthens supervision over law enforcement to ensure that various IPR legal systems are practically implemented. Based on this stand, China has attached great importance to IPR legislation since the implementation of its reform and opening up policies in order to accelerate modernization, the establishment of a socialist market economic system, and convergence with world standards. China joined the World Intellectual Property Organization in 1980 and, after that, successively formulated a series of IPR protection laws and regulations, including the trademark law, patent law, general rule on civil law, technological contract law, copyright law, regulations on protecting computer software, law on unfair competition, and so forth. Especially after the 1990's, China revised the patent law and trademark law to keep abreast of the international IPR protection trend, and to enable China's IPR system to completely converge with international standards. With regard to copyright protection, China's copyright law and the regulations for its implementation specifically stipulate the protection for writers' copyright as well as their relevant rights and interests, and incorporate computer software in the scope of copyright protection. After China joined the relevant international conventions, the State Council promulgated the "Provisions on the Implementation of International Copyright Treaties" in September 1992 to provide specific stipulations on the protection of the rights to which foreign copyright owners are entitled in accordance with international treaties. We have every reason to say that China has basically established an IPR legal system and, furthermore, has reached the international standard in respect of the scope and level of its protection. Of course, by this we do not mean to say that China's IPR legislation is perfect. We shall further amplify laws and regulations. According to the plans drawn up by the National People's Congress Standing Committee and the State Council, we shall pay close attention to formulating a law on protecting commercial secrets, a law on turning scientific and technological achievements to production, regulations on integrated circuit protection, regulations on protecting new species of plants, and so forth in the near future. I believe China will surely become one of the countries which has established a complete IPR protection system. Song Jian said: The principles of China's legal system are "formulating enforceable laws, prosecuting cases according to law, enforcing the law strictly, and investigating and prosecuting any illegal activities." China has not only formulated an entire set of laws and regulations to protect intellectual property rights, but has also adopted a serious and impartial attitude while enforcing these laws and regulations. Moreover, China has scored marked progress in this field. In light of the professional nature of judicial work dealing with intellectual property rights, people's courts in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Hainan, and Fujian set up special courts for intellectual property rights cases in order to have high quality judicial personnel to specially try these cases. Recently, China's copyrights administrative organs cooperated with relevant administrative and judicial organs in investigating and prosecuting illegal duplication and selling of audio and video recordings in some regions, and cracking down on production of pirated audio and video recordings, thereby making great progress in this field. However, we should realize that some enterprises and individuals are still indifferent to laws concerning intellectual property rights, infringement of intellectual property rights occurs every now and then, some serious infringements of laws are still taking place in some areas, and punishment for acts in violation of intellectual property rights laws should be more severe. The Chinese Government is determined and able to solve this problem. In conclusion, Song Jian pointed out: There are no boundaries to science and technology. As China sets up and perfects its intellectual property rights system, it is becoming an important member of the international community that protects intellectual property rights. While China is establishing and perfecting its intellectual property rights laws, it will earnestly fulfill its international obligations, comply with international standards of intellectual property rights protection, and play its role in international cooperation.
