Li Zetian and Zheng Yaotang are the chief and deputy chief of the delegation. Lu Ping welcomed the visitors and expressed the hope that the federation would unify a broad range of compatriots who love their country and Hong Kong, and would continue making contributions to Hong Kong's smooth transition. On the new Hong Kong airport, he said: The Airport Committee will continue discussing the fiscal plan proposed by the Hong Kong Government. We hope this issue will be solved at an early date. After solving the fiscal arrangements, we certainly will continue paying attention to the new Hong Kong airport's cost effectiveness and construction speed in accordance with the principles of "low cost and high return" prescribed in the Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport. This is of great concern to the Hong Kong people. To exercise effective supervision, we should set up a monitoring mechanism. We hope most of the new airport projects will be completed before 1997. The visitors broached the retirement security issue, which is of great concern to the Hong Kong people. Lu Ping said: The social and security affairs panel and the economic affairs panel under the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region recently held discussions on this issue. It is the committee members' unanimous view that the Hong Kong Government should implement a full-scale retirement security system. The form which such a system will take is subject to further discussion and examination. This is because the issue affects the security of Hong Kong employees' livelihoods. We hope the Hong Kong Government will draw up a retirement security plan as quickly as possible and implement it at an early date. During the meeting, the visitors said: The federation is deeply concerned about the direction in which Hong Kong's economy is developing, as well as about the issue of labor import. In reply, Lu Ping said: "Some people in Hong Kong say that Hong Kong's industries should keep developing. I agree with this point because industry directly generates value. Without a strong industrial base, the long-term development of stock markets and tertiary industries will be affected". On the issue of labor import, he stressed that the mainland would not export a large number of workers to Hong Kong as to affect Hong Kong workers' employment and lives. Lu Ping said: These issues do affect Hong Kong's smooth transition. I hope to consult with the British Hong Kong Government in due course. During the meeting, Lu Ping also answered other questions of concern to the visitors. Wang Fengchao, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, was present during the meeting.
