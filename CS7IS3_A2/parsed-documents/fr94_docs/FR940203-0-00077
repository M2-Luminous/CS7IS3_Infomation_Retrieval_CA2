FR940203-0-00077 FR940203-0-00017 Conclusions While NMFS believes that detonation of the larger (i.e., 1,200- and 10,000-lb. (544- and 4,536-kg)) charges may affect some marine mammals, the latest abundance and distribution estimates, based on the best available scientific information, indicate that the taking will have no more than a negligible impact on the populations of marine mammals inhabiting the waters of the SCB. NMFS concurs with the Navy that impacts can be mitigated by mandating conservative safety zones for marine mammal exclusion, incorporating an active aerial survey monitoring effort in the program both prior to, and after detonation of explosives, and provided tests are not conducted whenever marine mammals are detected within the testing zone, or if weather and sea conditions preclude adequate aerial surveillance. Classification The AA has determined, based on an EA prepared by NMFS, that this action will not have a significant impact on the environment. As a result of this determination, an environmental impact statement has not been prepared. The EA is available upon request (see ADDRESSES ). NMFS has consulted with the Navy under section 7 of the ESA for this rule. The required mitigation measures, as well as monitoring tests are expected to provide adequate protection for listed species. A copy of the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement resulting from this consultation is available upon request (see ADDRESSES ). The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration, when this rule was proposed, that, if adopted, this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis was required or prepared. This rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB Control No. 0648&hyph;0151. The reporting burden for this collection is estimated to be approximately 27 hours per project, including the time for gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the National Marine Fisheries Service (F/PR), 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. (Attn: Paperwork Reduction Act Project 0648&hyph;0151.) NMFS has determined that this rule may result in an impact on living marine resources that also reside within the coastal zone of the State of California, a State with an approved coastal zone management program under the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). However, aerial monitoring and other mitigation measures that will be employed by the Navy prior to, and during, testing will result in a negligible impact on marine mammals and other marine life. The Navy will be submitting a consistency determination for this activity to the State of California's Division of Governmental Coordination for review pursuant to the CZMA section 307(c)(1) and 15 CFR part 930, subpart C. The Navy, under 15 CFR 930.40 (multiple Federal agency participation), will be the lead Federal agency for CZMA Federal consistency purposes.
