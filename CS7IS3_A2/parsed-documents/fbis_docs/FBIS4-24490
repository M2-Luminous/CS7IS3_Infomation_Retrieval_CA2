Li made the statement while meeting with Nikolay I. Ryzhkov, a former prime minister of the now defunct Soviet Union, who is currently on a week-long visit here. After more than 40 years of development, Li said, Taiwan has emerged as an economic powerhouse in East Asia. "We are willing to share our experience in economic development with other countries," Li told his guest. For years, Li said, Taiwan has also provided financial aid for many developing countries as part of its effort to return what it has received from the international community during its development process. With the demise of communism, Li said he believes civilian exchanges between Taiwan and Russia will grow steadily in the years ahead. Ryzhkov said he was impressed by the social stability and economic prosperity here. "I hope relations between our two countries can be further strengthened," he added. Ryzhkov told Li he has joined with several Taiwan and Russian politicians and businessmen to form a permanent organization to boost economic, cultural and technological cooperation between the two countries. The new body is called the Republic of China and Russia International Association for Humanitarian Dialogue. Li said he appreciates Ryzhkov's effort to help forge Taipei-Moscow ties by creating the new dialogue channel. "Increased civilian exchanges will lay a foundation for our future cooperation," he added.
