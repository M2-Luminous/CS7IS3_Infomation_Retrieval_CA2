FBIS4-10989 "drlat077_a_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Further on Castro Health Rumors Further on Castro Health Rumors PA2004232894 Paris AFP in Spanish 2218 GMT 20 Apr 94 PA2004232894 Paris AFP Spanish BFN [Text] Washington, 20 Apr (AFP) -- Reports that President Fidel Castro has been hospitalized after suffering an attack or a heart attack were reported frequently in several American capitals on Wednesday, prompting an official denial from Havana and a cautious nonconfirmation in Washington. Robert L. Fretz, the official responsible for Cuban affairs in the U.S. State Department, said that his office had also heard the rumors but did not have official reports from Havana on Castro's health, "nor any indication there was a change in the situation in Cuba." "The regime seems to continue in firm control of the police and the security forces," Fretz added, saying that the United States "continues to monitor the situation closely." Gladys Gonzalez Noy, a Cuban dissident living in Havana, told the National Cuban-American Foundation (CANF), the largest anti-Castroist organization, by telephone on Wednesday that Castro was hospitalized last week after suffering a heart attack following an attempt on his life. Acccording to Gonzalez Noy, Castro was hospitalized at the Surgical Medical Research Center (CIMEQ) in Havana last week but was transferred to another place on Tuesday, according to a recording of a conversation supplied to AFP and other media sources at CANF headquarters in Miami (Florida). Gonzalez Noy, president of the Pro-Free Art Association, said Castro was caught in the middle of a shooting, a rumor that circulated last week. Although he was not injured, according to her, the incident affected him greatly. "First, before the heart attack, Castro suffered a respiratory arrest as a result of the whole situation," she affirmed. Gonzalez Noy asserted that state security has just forbidden her to leave her house and that there is an unusual police presence in Cuba. Other well-placed sources in Washington said, however, that regarding Havana there were only reports of an increase in the security presence around the CIMEQ hospital, one of the most prestigious in the capital. In Havana, a Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry official questioned by AFP said on Wednesday that Castro is "in perfect health" and conducted as usual an "official activity" on Tuesday evening. In fact, the situation seemed normal on Wednesday in the Cuban capital, according to an AFP reporter. Most officials at the Cuban Foreign Ministry have been busy with preparations for the conference that, from Friday to next Sunday, will gather representatives of the Cuban Government with some 200 members of the Cuban exile community.
