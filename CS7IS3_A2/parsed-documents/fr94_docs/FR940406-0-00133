The definitions of §86.096&hyph;2 continue to apply to 1996 and later model year vehicles. The definitions listed in this section apply beginning with the 1998 model year. Dispensed fuel temperature means the temperature (deg.F or deg.C may be used) of the fuel being dispensed into the tank of the test vehicle during a refueling test. Evaporative/refueling emission control system means a unique combination within an evaporative/refueling family of canister adsorptive material, purge system configuration, purge strategy, and other parameters determined by the Administrator to affect evaporative and refueling emission control system durability or deterioration factors. Evaporative/refueling emission family means the basic classification unit of a manufacturers' product line used for the purpose of evaporative and refueling emissions test fleet selection and determined in accordance with §86.098&hyph;24.
