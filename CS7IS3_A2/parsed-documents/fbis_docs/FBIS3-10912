Wasmosy, accompanied by Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, will visit the Itaipu hydroelectric dam at 0700 and visit Brazilian towns until the afternoon. Peasant organization leaders say Wasmosy's attitude shows he has no vision of the real magnitude of the current conflict and that he lacks the political will to give structural solutions to the problem of land and the sale of cotton. After visiting Itaipu, Sanchez de Lozada and Wasmosy will lunch in Foz de Iguazu and then visit the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo to dedicate a sluice in a hydroelectric power plant in Tiete River. For this reason he will not see the peasant protest. Agitators in Congress? Chamber of Deputies President Francisco Jose de Vargas has said he is aware that some people have been hired to cause disturbances outside Congress during the peasant march.
