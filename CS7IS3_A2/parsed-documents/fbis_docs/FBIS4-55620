The intentions, received at BTA, fall into three stages -- May-June, July-September and October-December. The prime minister warned that the government would resign if parliament fails to pass a package of important laws by the end of June. The government will observe its agreements with the international financial institutions on anti-inflation and monetary restrictions but this would not suffice to create conditions for economic recovery. That is why the government intends to use market mechanisms in encouraging entrepreneurship while a more active investment policy for encouraging individual productions could be provided for in the draft budget for 1995. According to the prime minister, the annual inflation in 1994 will be lower than that in 1993. Adhering to the principles set forth in its programme declaration of December 30, 1992 (when it was elected), the government will continue its strict restrictive policy to curb inflation. The measures which the government will take against speculative pricing eating away the incomes of the population will include confiscation of proven speculative profit in favour of the national budget. By the end of May the government shall adopt measures to protect local producers against dumping imports from some countries as well as a stand for its tariff negotiations with Turkey, the United States, Canada and other countries. By the end of June the government shall adopt a national programme for combating crime which, however, will come into force after the passing of a Judiciary Act. At the same time the Council of Ministers will support temporary restoration of capital punishment or its alternative. The Council of Ministers will also move in parliament a simplified design of a state coat of arms strictly conforming with the respective text in the Constitution and without any monarchist symbols. Following the inflation processes, the government will continue to implement its decrees on cost of living adjustments concerning minimum wages, pensions, minimum incomes for public relief and compensation of wage funds in enterprises of majority state holding. The Council of Ministers will continue its cooperation with its social partners in the Tripartite Council. The negotiations with the European Union on the loan for financing Bulgaria's balance of payments and with the World Bank should be held by June 15. Together with the National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB) the government shall draft the foreign debt deal and a special unit shall be set up to manage the national debt. Negotiations with the IMF on additional funding of the debt deal are forthcoming. By the end of May the Finance Ministry will establish strict control over the worst loss-makers. It will introduce a system sharply increasing the amount of collected budget revenues. The Industry Ministry will adopt and assess the programmes for financial rehabilitation and restructuring of state-owned enterprises, after which they will be divided into three groups: profitable units, loss-makers and enterprises which must be put into liquidation. Thirty-four state-owned industrial enterprises will be wound up. By mid-June the cabinet will be approving the action plans of the largest enterprises, which cannot be privatized as yet, such as the Neftokhim oil refinery, the Kremikovtsi Metallurgical Works, Bulgargas, etc. The cabinet will require their managements to make progress reports. Eleven enterprises subordinated to the Council of Ministers are expected to be privatized by the end of June. By May 15 the minister of labour and social affairs will have to submit to the cabinet a report on the goals of the reform in social insurance. The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs will give priority to the drawing up of projects for adjusting incomes to inflation. The Transport Ministry will carry through a deal for the privatization of the SO MAT international road haulier according to a cabinet-approved scheme, and will continue work on the privatization of 68 more transport enterprises and 12 units. Talks will continue with potential investors in the privatization of the national air carrier Balkan Airlines. Projects will be drawn up for the border checkpoints in Vidin, Ruse, Kulata and Gyueshevo, financed by the PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] Programme and the governments of the United States and Sweden. Tenders will be organized for the construction of a tunnel under the Shipka Peak, as well as for the development of the ports of Burgas (on the Black Sea) and Ruse (on the Danube). Deals for the privatization of nine enterprises are expected to be completed. 150 km of road will be renewed between July and September and the construction of a railway link between Bulgaria and Macedonia [the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] will start. The cabinet will propose to the parliamentary groups supporting it to sign a framework agreement on the passage of urgently needed legislation. The Council of Ministers will do its best for parliament to pass, by the end of June, amendments to the Privatization Act; a Scheme of Composition Act; a Bankruptcy Act; to approve the final structure of the foreign debt deal with a view to the ratification of the signed deal and agreements on balance-of- payments financing and financing for the foreign debt deal. Unless this legislation passes by the fixed time limit, it will be impossible for the government to carry on and it will resign. The government will seek to finalize agreements on additional financing for the foreign debt deal between July and September. Budget utilization will be analyzed during this period and amendments are to be expected while the parameters of the projected budget deficit will remain unchanged, the document says. Additional funds will be appropriated to certain departments, giving priority to the army, should the collected budget revenues allow this, Prof. Berov said. A list of 500 enterprises due for mass privatization will be published upon the passage of amendments to the Privatization Act. Privatization vouchers will be printed by July 17, and subscription for them will end on August 18, the cabinet says in its programme. Between July and September the Trade Ministry should carry out its duties under the law on the settlement of non-performing loans contracted by December 31, 1990. The Industry Ministry should adopt a programme for company rehabilitation and restructuring. During that period a second group of loss-making state-owned enterprises will be proposed for liquidation. The government will be implementing the land reform by a new flexible system combining land lease and cooperatives in view of the unwillingness of many owners to cultivate the land, the document says. The government will seek ways to provide support to part of the farmers from internal bank resources and from the expected U.S. financing to the amount of $50 million. 60 percent of the land claimed by its owners has been returned in real boundaries and through land distribution plans, the document says. 300 more plans for the distribution of 430,000 hectares of land will be approved in the second quarter. Over 72 percent of the land will be returned to its owners by the year's end, the document says. The Health Ministry will have to carry through the restructuring of the network of health care establishments. The Defence Ministry is to put off until September personnel and structural changes among senior officers in view of the critical situation in the Balkans. The government attaches great importance to the performance of the Finance Ministry in the last quarter of 1994. It is assigned to draft a 1995 agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The Privatization Agency is expected to conclude 70 deals worth 5,000 million leva by the year's end. Foreign investment to the amount of 2,700 million leva is expected to be channeled into the country through joint ventures subordinated to the Industry Ministry. Twenty-six privatization deals are expected to yield some 400 million leva in proceeds. If the Industry Ministry accomplishes its programme, industrial output can be expected to rise 2-3 percentage points from 1993 at comparable prices.
