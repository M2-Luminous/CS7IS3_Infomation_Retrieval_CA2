The demonstrators resisted against the suppression by combat police with a fierce stone-pelting, shouting "We are dead set against rice market opening". They also protested against the police search into Chonnam National University and Choson University at the end of February, and strongly demanded that the puppet authorities immediately stop the repressive moves to disorganise Namchongnyon. Prior to the demonstration, the students set the struggle against the United States which forced rice market opening and the struggle for resignation of the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime as the orientation of this year's struggle.
