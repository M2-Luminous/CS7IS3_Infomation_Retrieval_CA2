Requiring Participation in the Intermarket Trading System by Third Market Makers June 29, 1994. The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;10) on March 1, 1993, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 2 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. 2 The purpose of the proposed rule change is to require third market makers registered as Consolidated Quotation System (``CQS'') market makers to register and participate in the Computer Assisted Execution System (``CAES'') and the Intermarket Trading System/Computer Assisted Execution System (``ITS/CAES'') interface. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b(1). 2 On June 10, 1993, the NASD amended the proposed rule change to clarify that only third market makers registered as Consolidated Quotation Service (``CQS'') market makers must register as ITS/CAES market makers. Letter from Robert Aber, Vice President, General Counsel/Corporate Subsidiaries, NASD, to Elizabeth MacGregor, Branch Chief, National Market System Division of Market Regulation, Commission, (June 10, 1993). 3 A CQS market marker is a dealer that, with respect to a reported security, holds itself out as being willing to buy and sell the security for its own account on a regular and continuous basis otherwise than on a national securities exchange in amounts less than block size and is registered as such. NASD Rules, Schedule D, Part I. CAES enables NASD member firms to direct agency orders in both exchange-listed and NASDAQ/NMS securities to market makers for automatic execution. ITS/CAES enables market makers in Rule 19c&hyph;3 securities to direct agency and principal orders to, and receive orders from, the floors of the participating ITS exchanges. Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on July 8, 1993. 4 The Commission received three comment letters opposing the proposal. 5 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposal. 4 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32573 (July 1, 1993), 58 FR 36726. 5 Letters from James E. Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary, New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission, (September 24, 1993); George W. Mann, Jr., Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission, (September 20, 1993); and James F. Duffy, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Legal & Regulatory Policy Division, American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission, (October 22, 1993). I. Description The third market is where off-exchange, or over-the-counter (``OTC''), transactions in listed securities take place. Third market makers, registered with the NASD as CQS market makers, disseminate quotations through the CQS and through NASDAQ pursuant to rules promulgated by the NASD. 6 CQS market makers, that are not registered as ITS/CAES market makers, account for approximately 17% of third market share volume in CQS securities. Currently, 33 registered CQS market makers are not registered as ITS/CAES market makers or as CAES market makers. Only CQS registered market makers make OTC markets in listed securities by disseminating quotations through CQS or NASDAQ. Thus, only CQS registered market makers are subject to the requirements of the proposal. 6 See NASD Rules, Schedule D. Market makers displaying quotations in both CQS and in NASDAQ must maintain identical quotations in CQS and in NASDAQ. See NASD Rules, Schedule D, Part VI, Section 2. The proposed rule change amends Schedules D and G to the NASD By-Laws and the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the ITS/CAES Automated Interface (``ITS/CAES Rules''). The proposal requires registered CQS market makers to: (1) register and participate in ITS/CAES and CAES; (2) quote minimum sizes of 200 or 500 shares (depending on trading characteristics of the securities); 7 and (3) abide by excess spread parameters established for NASDAQ securities. 8 The proposal also will enable market makers to execute principal transactions through CAES for those specific securities in which the market maker is registered. 7 NASD By-Laws, Schedule D, Part VI. See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31678 (January 8, 1993), 58 FR 3314. 8 NASD By-Laws, Schedule D, Part VI. See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32419 (June 4, 1993), 58 FR 32971. The NASD developed CAES to provide a more efficient mechanism for OTC trading in listed securities. The ITS/CAES interface commenced operation on May 17, 1982. 9 ITS is a communications network designed to facilitate intermarket trading in exchange-listed securities by linking the eight national securities exchanges and the NASDAQ market. 10 ITS enables a broker or dealer who is physically present in one market center to execute principal or agency orders in an ITS security on another market center. 9 In 1981, the Commission issued an order which required implementation of an automated interface between the ITS and CAES. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 17744 (April 21, 1981), 46 FR 23856. On May 6, 1982, the Commission adopted final amendments to the ITS Plan to provide for the inclusion of the NASD in ITS. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 18713 (May 6, 1982), 47 FR 20413. 10 Participants to the ITS Plan include the Amex, the BSE, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE''), the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE''), the NASD, the NYSE, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''), and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX''). The ITS/CAES interface permits members of participant markets to execute transactions in Rule 19c&hyph;3 securities between the exchanges and the OTC market. 11 The proposal will require registered NASD market makers that trade Rule 19c&hyph;3 securities to register and participate in ITS/CAES. For non-Rule 19c&hyph;3 securities, which are not eligible for trading through the ITS/CAES interface, registered market makers will be required to register and participate in CAES. Currently, participation in ITS/CAES and CAES by CQS market makers is voluntary. 11 The ITS Plan limits securities eligible for trading through the ITS/CAES interface to Rule 19c&hyph;3 securities. Rule 19c&hyph;3 precludes off-board trading restrictions from applying, with certain exceptions, to any reported security: (1) which was not traded on an exchange prior to April 26, 1979, or (2) which was traded on an exchange on April 26, 1979 but which ceased to be traded on an exchange for any period of time thereafter. Rule 19c&hyph;3, 17 CFR 240.19c&hyph;3.
