He stressed in an interview with Interfax that such "unreasonable decrees seem to be needed in order to lay the Russian president open to a blow." Agapov said there was an evident attempt to create confrontation between the president and the Federation Council which would have to adopt the draft decree on May 31 when the term for the state of emergency expired. Agapov emphasized that the process of territorial division between Chechnya and Ingushetia concerned these two regions which were disputed areas. The decree said that the populated centers which, as Ingushetia had agreed, would go to the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, would be included in the zone of the state of emergency, Agapov pointed out. In the context of this situation inclusion of the Sunzhen and Malgobek regions into the state of emergency zone would mean a seizure of Chechen territory. It is hard even to imagine all consequences of such a move, Agapov underlined. Agapov disapproved of this decision. He announced that when he had told the interim administration about it the administration had responded that it never knew about such serious consequences. Agapov suggested that such recommendations could have been given by some politicians from the center who occupied certain posts in the federal bodies.
