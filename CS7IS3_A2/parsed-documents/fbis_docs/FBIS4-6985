The Sumitomo bank president became chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan, replacing Tadashi Okuda, president of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, at the end of his one-year term. Morikawa told his first news conference as federation chairman that he wants a review of the "firewall" regulating the subsidiaries of banks and brokerages as they move into each other's turf. He made no specific proposals but called for development along the lines of government directives allowing the banking and securities industries to make their first tentative forays into each other's business areas. Banks are allowed into bond underwriting but are barred from dealing in bonds and remain restricted from stock trading. Asked about the economy, Morikawa said it is still too early to declare a recovery, saying, "it will take some time to confirm that the economy has hit bottom." Referring to Japan's political turmoil, he said, "I don't really understand political movements but I hope for political stability as soon as possible," noting such issues as the overdue budget for fiscal 1994, which started this month. He said that as federation head he wants to "aim for closer involvement between banks, and their customers and society." In an earlier interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Morikawa acknowledged that Sumitomo Bank has a "bad image" with the public, vowing to improve the bank's stature while "regaining public trust" in the industry itself as it battles the woes incurred through the speculative excesses of the late 1980s. Banks must continue writing off the mountain of bad debts left when loans soured as the value of land and other assets backing the loans collapsed with the bursting of the speculative "bubble," Morikawa said. Japanese banks must also go forward on the issues of risk management and disclosure, he said. "Under increased competition through the spate of financial deregulations, our industry must pin its efforts on taxing its ingenuity and as a result stimulating the economy," he told KYODO. Morikawa rejected criticism that banks are unwilling to lend to creditworthy borrowers because of the bad-loan overhang. "There's no such linkage," he said. "We are strongly willing to boost lending in connection with bad loans," he said. "Indeed, we must increase our core earnings to promote the writeoff of bad loans." Banks are not taking an "unnecessarily strict stance" in lending, Morikawa said, but are pulling back from the lax "lending conditions of the so-called bubble boom that deviated from the normal posture." Another major headache for banks is the final phase of liberalization of interest rates, pitting private banks against the huge postal savings system in the fight for depositors. Morikawa vowed to continue the federation's fight against the postal system's "unreasonable" drawing of customers through interest rates fixed at higher levels than those of banks. Rates on government-backed postal deposits should "follow the average private rate" and not become the "price leader," Morikawa said, urging renegotiation of an April 8 agreement that temporarily sets ordinary postal deposit rates about 1 percentage point above those offered by banks. As he assumed the role of the "face" of Japan's overall banking industry, Morikawa also acknowledged public dissatisfaction with Sumitomo Bank, which recently ranked third in a financial magazine's list of banks that leaving bad impressions with the public. "I regret and am taking seriously such a bad image as revealed in various surveys," said Morikawa, the first Sumitomo chief to head the federation. "We want to clear the negative image as soon as possible, but frankly, some days and months will be necessary." He told KYODO the problem stemmed from Sumitomo "traditions" of aggressively seeking the top spot in short-term profits while "neglecting our basic business principle of satisfying customers." "But we are not movie stars and are not thinking of creating an image to attract people," he added. Morikawa said he hopes his schedule will allow him to attend an October gathering in Madrid of bankers from around the world, but he lamented that his new duties will likely further cut into his few leisure pursuits -- driving to nearby spots like Hakone and taking time for his "lousy golf game."
