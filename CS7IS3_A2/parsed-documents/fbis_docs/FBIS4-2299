"I feel honored to have met with the Japanese emperor at his Tokyo palace," Ku said Thursday upon his return from a five-day visit to Japan. Ku, also an unpaid advisor to Taiwan's Executive Yuan, stressed that his visit to Japan was private. Ku said Emperor Akihito expressed his goodwill and regard for Taiwan. "Akihito was interested in Taiwan's current developments," he noted. Ku said he briefed the Japanese emperor on Taiwan's economic strength and its role in Southeast Asian economic development. "We also exchanged views on the possible impact on Asia of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the prospects for the formation of the proposed East Asia Economic Caucus and the Asian Free Trade Agreement," Ku said. Ku was the first Taiwan businessman granted a formal audience with Akihito since the emperor took the throne in October 1989. Akihito talked briefly with [passage indistinct]. Political observers said Jeffrey Ku's meeting with Akihito would boost the development of substantive ties between Taiwan and Japan, even though the Japanese emperor is just a spiritual leader and wields no political power. Japan recognizes Beijing and has been reluctant to develop any official ties with Taiwan for fear of offending communist Chinese leaders. Many countries, including the United States, France and Germany, have sent ministerial-level officials to visit Taiwan, but Japan has not followed suit.
