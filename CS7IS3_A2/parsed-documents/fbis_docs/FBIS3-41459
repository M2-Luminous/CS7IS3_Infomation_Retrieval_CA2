He is a 1960 graduate of Moscow State University's Department of Mechanics and Mathematics. He got his scientific training (in 1964-76) working at the USSR Academy of Sciences Central Institute of Economics and Mathematics, a center of ``economic dissent'' where mathematics served as the Aesopian language of market-oriented economists. In the latter half of the 1970's he was head of a laboratory at the USSR Scientific Research Institute for the Study of Systems. In the 1980's he established and headed the Department of Ecology under the USSR Council of Ministers Economic Academy. He took charge of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources in late 1991. Danilov-Danilyan is a doctor of economic sciences and a professor. He is married and has two sons. Bayduzhiy: What is your assessment of the current environmental situation in Russia? Danilov-Danilyan: It is very alarming. Ecological systems are very vulnerable, and the first steps toward destruction of our country's environment were taken back in the 1930's, when we began industrializing without the slightest regard for the environment. There was the Stalinist plan for transformation of nature, a plan that declared human beings to be nature's master. We did not renounce that concept even when in the late 1960's all the developed countries concluded that we must live in harmony with nature. The current environmental situation was almost fully defined 10-12 years ago, i.e. in the early 1980's. That applies both to Russia as a whole and to its individual regions. An additional ``contribution'' was made by the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Over the past three years our country's environmental situation has on the whole not worsened. That is due to two factors. Firstly, the decline in production has played a certain role, due to the accompanying decrease in pollutant emissions. Though for fairness' sake I must add that the decrease in industrial pollution has been smaller than the drop in production. There is nothing surprising about that: the first thing that enterprises do when they find themselves in a difficult situation is to cut corners on environmental protection. First they shut down pollution control equipment, and only after that do they shut down production operations. Nevertheless, the amount of pollutant emissions in Russia has gone down. The second factor that has prevented the state of the environment from worsening in recent years is that beginning in 1988 our country began taking steps to create an environmental protection system. 1988 was the year that a USSR environmental protection agency was established, followed by republic and local agencies. These organizational steps, accompanied by the introduction of an economic mechanism to regulate natural resource use, have definitely produced a positive effect. In December 1991 a law entitled ``On Environmental Protection'' was passed, making environmental impact assessments mandatory for all projects. Incidentally, that stipulation is being followed very strictly. In 1992 more than 55,000 project documents were prepared at the federal and regional levels, and nine percent of them were rejected in their entirety. In 1991 30 percent of all documents were rejected. That means that people have become afraid of environmental impact assessment and are no longer submitting outright nonsense for assessment. However, not all documents undergo environmental impact assessment, particularly those adopted at the highest level. For example, when the government passes a decree regarding development of a system of Black Sea ports, we cannot do an impact assessment of that document, simply because it does not outline any specific projects. Hence the conclusion that we need to expand the range of documents that undergo assessment. It will be necessary to pass several legislative acts before we can do so, and I think those acts will pass in 1994. Bayduzhiy: How is the system of pollution payments structured? Danilov-Danilyan: At the present time those payments are distributed between non-budgetary environmental funds and the budget. Overall, 90 percent of pollution payments go to non-budgetary funds at the federal level, federation component level and local level. Those three levels receive 9, 27, and 54 percent of the funds, respectively. That is to say, more than one-half of all environmental protection money remains directly at the local level and is used for specific environmental protection projects. Bayduzhiy: Currently many environmentalists are arguing over how to assess the environmental situation in Russia -- as a crisis or a full-blown disaster. Which viewpoint do you support? Danilov-Danilyan: Neither one. One can only speak of a crisis situation with regard to a number of urban agglomerations and aquatic systems. For example, a crisis situation exists along the Iset River, which flows through Yekaterinburg, and in Lake Ladoga, and thus in the Neva River as well. Even the situation on the Volga is still in a pre-crisis state, though of course that is no reason for complacency. Nor should we forget that Russia has 7 million square kilometers of land that have not been touched by commercial activity in any way whatsoever. No other country in the world has that. Excluding Antarctica, that is only a little bit less than in all the rest of the world combined. Therefore, if we were to talk in terms of a human ecological reserve, then lands in Russia would comprise the largest section of it. Essentially this includes one-third of Russia's territory. Bayduzhiy: Are you more optimistic about the prospects for improving our country's environmental situation now than you were when you became minister? Danilov-Danilyan: You know, strange as it may seem, the answer is yes. For example, when I became minister I was not certain that we would be able to collect pollution payments the way we should. Now that is happening. Of course, many enterprises simply do not have the money to pay, but that is another problem. Their debt continues to accumulate; the system itself is functioning. The problem is not the system, but rather our country's economic situation. I also had serious doubts about whether we would be able to get the environmental assessment system going. But now it is up and running. So in terms of many parameters one can view the situation in a more optimistic light than before. Bayduzhiy: What is your view of Russian Navy dumping of radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan and the events that followed? Danilov-Danilyan: The problem of how to deal with the radioactive wastes generated by nuclear submarines and icebreakers has been ignored for decades. We have accumulated a huge quantity of liquid radioactive wastes, which we have traditionally dumped at sea. All this was described in detail in a ``white book'' published in April 1993, a report containing data which even Western governments, our negotiation partners, are not eager to release. Maybe we revealed even more than we should have, but that is a different topic. It is clear that the process of liquid radioactive waste creation cannot be halted all at once, even if every nuclear reactor were to be shut down. In late summer 1993 our eastern bases experienced a critical situation, with all their storage tanks filled. Unless unloaded, one of the tankers could have literally fallen apart, and that is essentially what did happen to it a short time later. The decision was made to dump -- there was no other choice -- 900 cubic meters of polluted water with a total radioactivity of 0.38 curie into the Sea of Japan. That is an insignificant amount of radioactivity; that much is literally flying around in the air. By way of comparison, a conventional coal-fired heat-and-power station with a capacity of one million kilowatts releases at least one curie each day. Large stations release 15-20 curies into the air every day. The dumping was carried out in Russia's economic zone, 180 kilometers off shore, in a part of the sea that is more than 3,000 meters deep. In the tanker's wake followed a hydrographic vessel, which failed to discover any levels in excess of normal background radiation. Therefore it is frivolous to say that ecological damage was done to anyone. A few days ago Japan officially acknowledged that. Japan's discharges of industrial waste into the Sea of Japan do the environment incomparably greater harm. There is no way to describe the uproar over the Russian liquid radioactive waste as anything but hysteria. However, that in no way means that efforts should not be made to find a solution to the radioactive waste problem. A report has already been prepared on a whole range of pertinent issues. In the near future it will be presented to the government and to countries that have expressed a desire to provide Russia with technical and financial assistance with its radioactive waste processing. Those are the United States, Canada, Norway, Holland, Japan and South Korea. Relying on our own efforts alone, the earliest we could end dumping of radioactive wastes at sea would be after the end of 1995. Bayduzhiy: Each day Russia experiences two accidents on oil and gas pipelines, it has one train wreck a week, and it has a major industrial accident once a month. Do you have the impression that we are on the verge of another Chernobyl? Danilov-Danilyan: Actually, no, though to make any promises like that would be the purest foolhardiness -- anything is possible. However, the most dangerous industries, those where a disaster could have the most serious consequences, are closely monitored by us. Nuclear power plant operations have become much more orderly. Even the International Atomic Energy Agency just recently, to my great surprise, acknowledged that Chernobyl-type reactors, the RBMK, may continue to be operated, i.e. that they do not significantly deviate from international safety standards. That also came as a surprise to many technical specialists. Bayduzhiy: But in addition to nuclear power facilities we also have at least as many hazardous facilities in the chemical and metals industries... Danilov-Danilyan: Yes, these are indeed extremely hazardous things. For example, chemical plants in Dzerzhinsk, or Aramas-16, also located in Nizhegorod Oblast, where nuclear warheads are being disassembled under conditions that are, quite frankly, not 100 percent adequate. There are plenty of problems, but I want to reiterate that the most dangerous areas are being monitored with particular vigilance by the Russian agencies for the oversight of atomic and industrial safety and our own agencies. In contrast to 1986, when the Chernobyl disaster occurred under circumstances of completely idiotic complacency, now we are already on our guard. Bayduzhiy: What is your assessment of the current ``green'' movement in this country? Danilov-Danilyan: It is extremely weak and divided. Often there are several groups active in each local area, competing with one another, and each of them taken individually is very insignificant. I would say that the most solid environmental organization is the Volga parliament called ``Revival of the Volga'' [Vozrozhdeniye Volgi]. But once again, the committee to save the Rhine in Germany was much stronger at the time when the Rhine was in the same condition that the Volga is today. Therefore this is all relative. It is very regrettable that many ``green'' groups and movements actually have purely commercial objectives, attempting to use environmental slogans as a means of attracting sponsor aid from abroad. Worse, for some of them this has become something of a lifestyle. A significant number of environmental groups are also notable for their very nihilistic attitude toward the law. The classic example of that is Greenpeace, which has chosen provocation of the authorities as its method of action. It is deliberately oriented toward confrontation. That organization often chooses its priorities very incorrectly, making a big deal out of insignificant events while overlooking real environmental damage. Aleksey Yablokov, the president's advisor on environmental affairs, recently put forward the idea that environmental goals are not the only reason behind that, and that Greenpeace's funding does not just come from members' contributions. I became convinced of that a long time ago. Greenpeace is backed by the very specific economic interests of structures that are not at all difficult to discern if one takes a close look at its activities. Bayduzhiy: Some experts, among them the aforementioned Aleksey Yablokov, feel that the ministry you head has not proven able to withstand the bureaucratic pressure exerted on it by various other ministries and agencies. One example cited is that the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources expressed support for a nuclear power development program without requiring an environmental impact assessment... Danilov-Danilyan: Those who are of that opinion would like for the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources to behave the same way the ``greens'' do at their rallies. We are a state organ and must operate in accordance with existing laws, whether those laws be good or bad. The ministry may take the initiative in regard to changing a law, but under no circumstances may it violate the law. We cannot demand that nuclear power stations be shut down and atomic industry be eliminated merely because they are atomic. If you will take a look at the minutes of that same government session which considered the aforementioned program, you will see that it was I and I alone who insisted that the decision include a requirement that environmental impact assessments be done on future projects. I regard as unacceptable the position of complete rejection of this program as taken by Mr. Yablokov--each year we have dozens of disasters in rail transportation, so why not shut down the railroads as well? Another problem lies in the fact that, as I have noted, under the law not every document may be subjected to environmental impact assessment, and a government decree is one such document. This decree does not contain any specific projects that experts could study from an ecological standpoint. Technical oversight of nuclear power plants comes under the jurisdiction of Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, which has been very active of late. Funding for this decree was not released, only envisioned -- in the event of a positive environmental impact statement. Bayduzhiy: But have there been cases in which you have had to give in and make concessions? In other words, have you lost the fight with various ministries and agencies? Danilov-Danilyan: There has not been a single fundamental issue on which either I or the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources have yet suffered a defeat. Yes, there have been difficult situations, but we have managed to defend successfully all the most important points upon which the environmental protection system in Russia is currently based. Bayduzhiy: What is the future of the ``Komsomolets?'' Danilov-Danilyan: A plan has been created to render the submarine harmless there on the sea floor. That plan will soon be submitted for environmental impact assessment, and the assessment will be a serious one. We currently have two forms of environmental assessment -- single-stage and two-stage. In the former case all that is needed is a finding by a commission of experts. In the latter case, when a project is particularly complex and ambiguous, as was the case with the Northern Heat and Electric Power Station, for example, the plan is also reviewed by the Council for State Environmental Assessment. So before anything is done with the ``Komsomolets'' each step will be strictly checked out and planned out. Bayduzhiy: You were elected to the State Duma on the Russia's Choice slate of candidates. Why exactly did you choose that association and not, for instance, Cedar, which has made environmental demands the core of its platform? Danilov-Danilyan: My economic views coincide with the concept of Russia's Choice, which has also expressed an interest in developing its own strong environmental platform, and I decided that there would be something for me to do in that bloc... In my opinion the accusations of conflict of interest that people are so fond of repeating will not stand up to criticism. In a majority of developed countries it is the rule rather than the exception for ministers to also serve as deputies in parliament. Due to the nature of my job I have to meet with many heads of foreign environmental protection agencies. For instance, in the FRG, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, France, Finland and Italy (where there have been four different ministers of environmental protection in the past two years) the ministers of environmental protection are all members of parliament. That is quite logical: ministers, even ministers of environmental protection, are political figures, and when one of them does not get into parliament that is seen as a scandal. As for Cedar, according to my observations the backbone of that movement is comprised of businessmen who have adopted environmental slogans just to win seats in the Duma. I could only find one respected ecologist in their entire slate of candidates. It is not surprising that in the acronym for Cedar [Kedr] the word ``ecology'' [ekologiya] was transformed into ``yekologiya.'' Bayduzhiy: Which current environmental issue do you regard as the most important to Russia? Danilov-Danilyan: The prevailing opinion that our present sad environmental state is due to Russia's economic problems is only partially correct. Paradoxical as it may seem, our main environmental problems are still beyond the grasp of our public consciousness. The birth of a single child in a post-industrial country creates an environmental burden 300 times greater than the birth of a child in a developing country. When asked when India could equal Great Britain's level, Mahatma Gandhi replied: ``In order to achieve its prosperity Britain has consumed the resources of half the planet. How many planets would it take for a country like India to achieve that level?'' And so the main environmental issue is human beings' reassessment of the entire system of values by which they live. And that it is not a timely issue for Russia alone.
