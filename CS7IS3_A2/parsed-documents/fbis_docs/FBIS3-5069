The schedule for inspections by a seven-member IAEA team was based on the prospect that the United States will announce an agreement on the issue with North Korea on Thursday. The agreement will include a date for a third round of high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang, tentatively set for March 21 in Geneva. IAEA sources said, however, the team will actually be able to start inspections from Friday as the U.S. announcement is likely to be made during the night in Far Eastern time. The inspection team, which arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday, is expected to be engaged in inspections for two weeks. The U.S. and North Korea reportedly agreed last Friday at a working-level meeting in New York that Pyongyang would resume dialogue with South Korea and fully implement IAEA inspections of its seven declared nuclear plants to realize a third round of bilateral talks.
