The manager said there are agreements with Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and Canada that will allow the installation to continue receiving tourists from those countries during the month of April. Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 18 March reports that Mario Medero, director of the 10 de Octubre Power Plant in Nuevitas, described as extraordinary the efforts of plant workers to find solutions to problems and increase efficiency. Last week, workers worked 14-hour shifts to solve problems in the plant, and Unit No. 3 is being repaired to increase its productivity. Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 18 March reports that 21,000 caballerias of planted sugarcane fields were hand weeded during the first two months of the year: 8,000 caballerias in January and 12,000 caballerias in February. The objective for this month is to equal or surpass the record achieved during the same month in 1980 when approximately 20,000 caballerias of cane fields were weeded. Radio Reloj at 2034 GMT on 18 March reports that the 1993-94 potato harvest in Matanzas is going well. The province's agricultural organizations are expected to surpass 300,000 quintals by 19 March.

This second millionaire brigade is from the 19 de Abril Cooperative in Perico Municipality. ANAP has 40 mechanized canecutting groups. Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 19 March reports that Carlos Martinez Salsamendi, president of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce, and Javier Taverna, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Navarra Province, Spain, have signed in Havana an agreement for the exchange of publications of the two chambers of commerce; exchange of scientific-technical, commercial, and economic information; courses; symposia; and technical support -- as well as cooperation in projects for building buses and in the graphic arts industry. In the same newscast it is reported that under a joint management agreement between the Spanish corporation Hoteles de Espana and Cubanacan, the Camaguey Hotel in the city of Camaguey will join the Hoteles de Espana chain on 1 April. Installations in Sancti Spiritus and Holguin will also be operated under that system. Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 19 March report the following: The potato harvest has begun in Sancti Spiritus Province, which "planted close to 40 caballerias" in potatoes this time. Because better quality seed was planted this year and crops were tended better, the province expects to harvest more potatoes than last year despite the fact that a smaller area was planted. On 18 March, the provincial bureau of the Communist Party of Cuba in Pinar del Rio Province called for an intensification of effort in the tobacco harvest, "a campaign that is becoming tough because the planting plan has not been met, yet the aim of arriving at the number of quintals promised for this year is being maintained." Over 50 percent of the 1,809 caballerias planted in tobacco in Pinar del Rio is still unharvested; and at the present time, 411 caballerias are behind as regards different kinds of tending. The availability of electrical energy to dry blond tobacco has improved in the last few days. The workers of the Jose Antonio Echeverria Contingent are working intensely in order to finish the isotopes center -- the only one of its kind in Cuba -- this year. The center, located on the border of Guanabacoa and San Jose de las Lajas Munipality, will research and produce compounds for use in nuclear medicine. Radio Rebelde at 1255 on 19 March reports that the Spanish firm (Hoteles C) reached an agreement with the National Institute for Tourism to manage and market the Camaguey Hotel in Camaguey, the (Pernec) Hotel in Holguin, and the caves of Sancti Spiritus. Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 19 March reports that Cuba and Venezuela are negotiating an agreement having to do with the specialty of ecological tourism. Radio Reloj at 2047 GMT on 21 March reports that a group of 65 Uruguayan municipal-level unionists visiting Cuba donated a shipment of medicines and school supplies on 21 March. Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 21 March reports that a new cane Basic Cooperative Production Unit, La Polka, has been formed in Santa Cruz del Sur Municipality, Camaguey Province, and is showing excellent results. Close to 200 caballerias of cane were planted in Cienfuegos Province during January and February. Cienfuegos' cane planting plan for January-June calls for planting 1,000 caballerias and weeding all the fields planted. Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 22 March report that "thanks to Cubanacan S.A., Cuba has an international sky-diving center that guarantees that any international quality event can be held here." The center is located in Varadero and possesses the latest technology and constitutes a very attractive hub in every way. "At the official inauguration, a group of athletes from western Cuba performed sky-diving demonstrations. At the end of this month, 50 Brazilians will be diving as part of their preparations for the Latin American championship."
