Treasury Secretary Bentsen was assigned by Clinton to visit Beijing, which was a vigorous step to promote the normalization of Sino-American relations. As everyone knows, the Sino-American Joint Economic Commission was suspended by the U.S. side after 1989. The last session was held in 1987, and the commission has been suspended for seven years. The Sino-American Joint Economic Commission is a very important organization for economic cooperation, which gives an impetus to technological cooperation between the two countries through intergovernmental planning, coordination, and promotion. For example, in the past, cooperative plans in such fields as metallurgy, telecommunications, electronics, machinery, and building materials were signed in the Joint Economic Commission. Moreover, both sides briefed the other party on economic development strategies, monetary strategy, and foreign investment policies to allow Chinese and U.S. businessmen to make complementary investment and open up new investment fields, thus leading to huge growth in the volume of bilateral trade. The convening of the Joint Economic Commission also helped both sides understand impediments to economic and trade cooperation and to remove some obsolete legislation and administrative measures, thus leading to vigorous growth in trade. China and the United States are different in terms of their social systems, as well as in politics, culture, and history. If they are sensible enough to lay these differences aside and work according to the laws of economics, they can achieve what both sides want. Closer cooperation will not only benefit a certain party but both sides. Today, sensible figures in the United States have already noticed that U.S. economic interests are a top priority, while human rights diplomacy only comes second, and what is primary should be distinguished from what is secondary. It is not difficult for both sides to cooperate with each other as long as efforts are made to "seek common ground while reserving differences." Bentsen is influential in Congress, and he is also an important cabinet member of the Clinton administration. He has visited China to hold a dialogue with Chinese leaders and to have a concrete understanding of the real situation of China. His visit is favorable to the healthy development of Sino-American relations. Therefore, Premier Li Peng said when meeting with Bentsen, "China and the United States should seize the opportunity to do something in a down-to-earth manner to facilitate, as soon as possible, the normal development of our bilateral relations." Solid work refers to the Sino-American Joint Economic Commission co-chaired by Bentsen and the Chinese finance minister, in which both sides will study methods to expand economic cooperation and trade. The Chinese side is very much interested in introducing advanced technology and equipment from the United States and is also willing to open up its market, whereas the United States expects China to reduce tariffs and open its service sector to give U.S. businessmen more investment opportunities. Bentsen said: "The fact that President Clinton assigned me to visit China indicates that the United States attaches importance to the development of U.S.-Chinese relations and wishes to seek a way to further develop Sino-American relations, particularly economic and trade relations." Hence, in the next three days, it will be most important to know what issues the Economic Commission will discuss and what results they will achieve. The Chinese side is ready for cooperation, and the U.S. side has also indicated that "the United States should take part in the economic development process of Asia, and of China in particular." An attitude of positive cooperation between China and the United States will help, in a frank and sincere way, remove some obsolete and artificially imposed obstacles, expand the volume of bilateral trade, and reach a consensus. Both Chinese and U.S. politicians acknowledge that a strong and prosperous China is advantageous to the United States and to the world as well. This is not a formalistic gesture but an accurate analysis of current political and economic developments in the world. The outside world once tried to hasten the process of "democratization" and economic privatization of the former Soviet Union, hoping that a country with a planned economy could change into a capitalist country within a short period of time. Consequently, this gave rise to the "bombardment of the parliament" and such "democratic freaks" as Zhirinovsky and led to economic collapse, which is unfavorable to development of the global economy and to stability and security of Europe. However, only in Asia has a situation of political stability and rapid economic growth emerged, and China has become a major factor in Asia's economic development. China's economic development is beneficial to Asia as well as to the world. As huge amounts of U.S. capital come to the East, U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen's visit to China will accelerate the process of opening up the China market to U.S. investors, which will also bring about greater development in economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States.
