FR940318-2-00253 FR940318-2-00121 6. Following the reorganization, Adviser will render to the Galileo MMP Fund services substantially the same as those it has been rendering to the MMP Fund under the MMP Advisory Agreement. 7. The Reorganization will establish Galileo Company as a successor investment vehicle to MMP Company. Combining the operations of the MMP Fund with those of Galileo Company will help reduce overall expenses because of economies of scale. Directors fees, and the costs of printing shareholder reports, updating prospectuses and performing similar administrative functions will be spread across a larger asset base. Including MMP Fund in the Galileo family also will permit more cohesive marketing under a single corporate name. This in turn may help accelerate the realization of benefits from economies of scale. Moreover, the Reorganization will not result in the recognition of any gain or loss by MMP Company shareholders and will allow Galileo Fund to acquire portfolio securities without incurring brokerage or transaction expenses. 8. The Reorganization must be approved by at least a majority of the outstanding shares of MMP Company, and a special meeting of MMP Company shareholders has been called for that purpose. Unless postponed by MMP Company and Galileo Company, the Reorganization is expected to occur on or about May 15, 1994, on the basis of the net assets of MMP Fund as of the close of business on the day of the Reorganization. 9. All the expenses generated by the Reorganization will be borne by Adviser. 10. The boards of directors of MMP Company, and Galileo Company have considered the desirability of the Reorganization from the respective points of view of their companies. All the members of the two boards have approved the Reorganization and concluded that, among other things, the Reorganization is in the best interests of Galileo Company, MMP Company, and the interests of existing shareholders of both companies will not be diluted as a result of the Reorganization. These findings, and the basis upon which such findings were made, have been fully recorded in the respective minute books of Galileo Company and MMP Company. 11. The Reorganization will not be effected until each of the following conditions is satisfied: the Post-Effective Amendment to Galileo Company's Registration Statement on Form N&hyph;1A has been declared effective, the SEC has issued an order relating to the application, MMP Company shareholders have approved the Reorganization in accordance with applicable law, and Galileo Company and MMP Company have receive an opinion of counsel that the Reorganization will not require recognition of taxable income or loss by the holders of MMP Fund shares. Applicants' Legal Conclusions 1. Applicants seek an exemption under section 17(b) of the Act from section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit the Reorganization. Section 17(a) of the Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from selling to or purchasing from such registered investment company any security or other property. Section 17(b) provides for SEC approval of a proposed affiliated transaction that otherwise would be prohibited by section 17(a) if the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair, and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. 2. MMP Company may be deemed to be an affiliated person of Galileo Company because affiliates of Adviser serve in investment management capacities, with discretionary voting power, regarding several client accounts, group trusts and limited partnerships that own, in the aggregate, more than 5% of the outstanding shares of MMP Company. Thus, the Reorganization may be deemed to be prohibited under section 17(a) if the Reorganization is viewed as a principal transaction between Galileo Company and MMP Company or between Galileo Company and the aforementioned accounts, trusts and limited partnerships. 3. Applicants believe that the Reorganization is consistent with section 17(b) of the Act. The investment objectives and policies of Galileo MM Fund are identical to those of MMP Fund. Neither the MMP Fund shareholders nor Adviser will receive any financial benefit from the Reorganization, apart from the administrative convenience and potential cost savings of incorporating MMP Fund into the Galileo family of funds. Additionally, after the Reorganization, former MMP Fund shareholders will hold the same assets as Galileo Company shareholders as they had previously held as MMP Fund shareholders. In this sense, the Reorganization can be viewed as a mere change in corporate form, rather than a disposition giving rise to section 17(a) concerns. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
