Ortega: Trial Attempt To Ruin Army's Image PA2203141994 Managua Radio Nicaragua Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 22 Mar 94 PA2203141994 Managua Radio Nicaragua Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [From "This Morning" newscast] [Text] Army Chief General Humberto Ortega said he is willing to show the national and international public that the death of young Jean Paul Genie is being used in an effort to mar Ortega's image and that of the Army. Gen. Ortega said that the fact that he responded to a summons to testify at the Judge Advocate's Office shows respect for the law and an interest in the thorough clarification of the case. [Begin Ortega recording] An effort is being made to tarnish my image and that of the Army by taking this case to the OAS International Court. They are trying to see how they can do something (?adverse). On the contrary, the law is being respected in this case. We are complying with the law. The Genie case first went to the civil courts, then it was sent -- as the law stipulates in Nicaragua -- to the Judge Advocate's Office. The case was then passed on to the Supreme Court of Justice, which confirmed the civil judge's ruling that the case should be reviewed by the judge advocate. So I am here today, and my presence is evidence of the fact that we are responsibly complying with Nicaraguan law. I think that is what is most important. It has also allowed us to ratify our commitment to the Army in the public letter I signed. The letter clearly stated my position on the fact that this case has been politicized. The goals being pursued have nothing to do empathy for the Genie family. It is really an effort to use the family's sorrow to harm the Army and to mar our image. [end recording]
