Both their actual incomes as well as the level of their consumption has risen, but regional differences in people's incomes have been very large, and the range of residents with reduced incomes has broadened. Urban residents' living expenditure incomes have shown actual increases of 10 percent. According to statistics, urban households of 35 large and medium-sized cities had per capita an average of 3,227.6 yuan available for themselves, 31 percent more than in the preceding year. The per-capita living expenditure income was 2,998.3 yuan, 31.5 percent more than in the preceding year. Deducting the inflation factor for the said period, the actual increases would be 9.4 and 10 percent, respectively. Although the average per-capita increase of living expenditure incomes was 7.8 percentage points higher than in the preceding year, the actual increase was somewhat lower, if the inflation factor is taken into consideration. There are very evident changes in the structure of residents' incomes. The main characteristics of such are: 1) Incomes from salaries and wages are still in dominant position. Per-capita income of urban residents from salaries and wages in 35 large and medium-sized cities in 1993 was 2,092.6 yuan, 24.1 percent more than in the preceding year. In this increase, bonuses with allowances and subsidies had increased 41 and 38 percent, respectively; they had been the main factors for increases in salaries and wages. The proportion of income from salaries and wages in the residents' living expenditure incomes had declined to 69.8 percent from the preceding year's 73.9 percent, a decline of four percentage points. 2) Incomes other than from salaries and wages had steeply increased. Such other incomes that staff and workers received from their units had increased 40.8 percent, compared to the preceding year. Net incomes of self-employed workers had risen 48 percent; other labor incomes of residents had increased 68 percent. 3) Incomes of staff and workers in three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises and in other ownership systems had increased by a large margin; staff and workers had per capita an average of 88 percent more income available to themselves than in the preceding year. Very large increases were registered in the three cities of Ningbo, Shanghai, and Beijing, showing up the existence of large regional disparities. According to statistics, increases of per-capita living expenditure incomes in the three cities of Ningbo, Shanghai, and Beijing had been 51.2, 42.8, and 39.4 percent, respectively, compared to the preceding year. They are the highest among the 35 large and medium-sized cities surveyed. Of cities with 30 percent or higher increases in incomes there were also: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Haikou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Jinan, Wuhan, Changsha, and Nanning. Per-capita living expenditure income of the residents of Shenzhen reached 7,070.5 yuan, which places this city at the head of all the 35 large and medium-sized cities, with Guangzhou in second place with 4,984.4 yuan average per-capita living expenditure income. Average per-capita living expenditure income in the eastern coastal cities was by 26.3 percent higher than the average for all the 35 large and medium-sized cities; this ratio had further widened, as compared with the preceding year. Consumption expenditure of the urban residents is continuously rising, while the consumption structure is essentially remaining stable. According to statistics, average per-capita consumption expenditure in the 35 large and medium-sized cities during 1993 was 2,746.3 yuan, 30.4 percent more than in the preceding year. Deducting the inflation factor, the actual increase was 9 percent. Conditions of the various expenditure items in this category were: 1) Consumption of foodstuffs increased steadily, but consumption volume of some declined. Average per-capita expenditure for foodstuffs was 1,397.4 yuan, 22.9 percent more than in the preceding year, but deducting the inflation factor, the actual level of consumption had risen only 3.1 percent. Expenditure for foodstuffs accounted for 50.9 percent of total expenditure, a decline of three percentage points, as compared with the preceding year. 2) Clothing expenditure had increased, and more of the higher quality clothing was bought. The residents' average per-capita expenditure for clothing was 376.2 yuan, and after deducting the inflation factor this was 19.1 percent more than in the preceding year. 3) Expenditure for household equipment and appliances, and expenditure for cultural and recreational purposes, showed a fairly strong rising trend. In the 35 large and medium-sized cities during 1993, the average per-capita expenditure by the citizens on such equipment, household goods, and services was 240.2 yuan, an increase of 33 percent over that of the preceding year. The average per-capita expenditure for articles for cultural and recreational purposes was 244.7 yuan, an increase of 36.5 percent. Average per-capita increases were registered in the following durable consumer goods purchases: purchases of washing machines increased 36.5 percent; purchases of air conditioners increased 1.5 times over; purchases of composite audio sets [zu he yin xiang 4809 0678 7299 0742] increased 14.3 percent; and purchases of color TV sets increased 1.3 percent. Up to the end of 1993, among the possessions in every 100 households in the 35 large and medium-sized cities were: 91.1 sets of color TV sets, 82.4 electric refrigerators, 90.1 washing machines, 44 photo cameras, 8.5 sets of composite audio sets, 25.6 tape recorders [lu fang xiang ji 6922 2397 4161 2623]. 4) Housing expenses had rapidly increased, while housing conditions had continuously improved. Since 1993, the nationwide housing reform had been forcefully pushed forward, and housing conditions for residents have gradually improved. According to statistics, per-capita expenditure for the purchase or construction of housing has increased 2.2-fold, compared to the preceding year. Per-capita expenditure on furniture and fittings of houses was 15.8 yuan, an increase of 287.3 percent over the preceding year. Because measures of the housing reform have gradually been implemented, housing expenditure of the residents has increased. Per-capita rent, with water, electricity, and fuel added, amounted to 148 yuan, an increase of 36.6 percent over the preceding year and accounting for 5.4 percent of the residents' consumption expenditure. 5) Individual expenditure for sundry commodities and services has increased at a large margin, and the quality of life has been improved. Because the quality of life of urban residents has continuously been improved, expenditure used by the individual resident has continuously increased. Average per-capita individual expenditure in the 35 large and medium-sized cities in 1993 was [number indistinct] yuan, an increase of 30 percent over the preceding year. In this expenditure an average of 26 percent more was spent on gold, silver, and other jewelry, and 44 percent more on cosmetics. In Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Xiamen average individual expenditure was more than [number indistinct] yuan, which was the most among all the 35 cities surveyed. Statistic data also reveal that the income levels of urban households have gone up. Considering the effects of commodity price inflation, unemployment, and population increases, actual incomes of some parts of the population have declined. The extent of declining incomes reached 30 percent, which is 5 percentage points more than in the preceding year.
