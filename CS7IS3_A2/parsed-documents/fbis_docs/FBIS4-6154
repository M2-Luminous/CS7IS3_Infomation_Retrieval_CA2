They noted that individual consumption is picking up and that industrial output increased in the two-month period starting in January 1994. On the other hand, most of them termed the recent confusion on the political scene and the appreciation of the yen as negative factors for an economic recovery, adding that the economic situation may become even worse after April if the enactment of the fiscal year 1994 budget is drastically delayed. NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN sent questionnaires to 10 private-sector economists working with major research institutes and obtained responses by 11 April. The recession started in May 1991. If the Japanese economy is still turned downward this April, the length of this recession would rank with the nation's longest recession following the second oil shock (36 months from March 1980 to February 1983). However, 50 percent of the surveyed economists said they disagree with the view that "the economy hit bottom after April, and the recession will break the record of the 1980 recession." Optimists Pay Attention to Expanding Consumption Among the five economists who answered that economic growth has already begun, Yuji Shimanaka, Sanwa Research Institute chief analyst, demonstrated the most optimistic view, saying that the economic upturn started in October 1993. He noted that some important economic indices, such as industrial output and factory capacity rates, "reached turning points in October." The other four economists who also said that the recession had ended by March noted: 1) Positive moves are seen in individual consumption; 2) public works spending and investment in housing are at adequate levels; and 3) the private sector is promoting business restructuring. However, they said that upward movement of the economy is still very weak and that the business sector's investment in equipment will remain low until the end of this year. They added that "economic recovery is unlikely to be evident in business statistics in the first half of this year" (as noted by Masao Yokomizo, Nikko Research Center deputy director general). Pessimists Focus on Yen Rate Hike, Overemployment On the other hand, all five economists who said that the recession is still continuing termed the appreciation of the yen as the main reason for the delay in Japan's economic recovery. Market trends have again been pushing up the yen rate since the end of March, when the United States expressed dissatisfaction with the Japanese Government's economic reform package. Masaru Takagi, Fuji Research Institute chief analyst, said that "the yen will strengthen if the political turmoil is prolonged and Japan fails to work out tangible measures for expanding the domestic market by the time of the Group of Seven summit." He said in that case, favorable trends in some export industries would not result in a full-fledged economic recovery. Director Yoshikazu Takao of the Nomura Research Institute Economic Research Department noted that "the business sector is still troubled by overemployment, and this will delay an upturn in business profits." As for the recent recovery in individual consumption, Koichi Masugata, Nissei Research Institute deputy chief analyst, said that "a consumer-led economic recovery is unlikely because an increase in income has not yet been observed among consumers." Impact of Political Turmoil Most respondents, including those who answered that the recession had already hit bottom, said that political turmoil since Prime Minister Hosokawa's announcement of his resignation is a "negative factor for an economic recovery." Yukio Yamaya, managing director of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Research Institute, stated that he "may have to revise his view that the bottom of the recession occurred in the last quarter of 1993" if the enactment of the fiscal year 1994 budget is drastically delayed by confusion in selection of Hosokawa's successor. A political vacuum cools down the economic actions of the business sector and individual consumers, and the delay in budget deliberations may temporarily stop the enactment of public work projects. However, the Sanwa Research Institute's Shimanaka said that "upward movement is being observed in economic trends, and confusion on the political scene will not fully affect the economy."
