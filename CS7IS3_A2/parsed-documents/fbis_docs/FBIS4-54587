The sanctions against Libya and Iraq, however, demonstrated that neighboring countries of the isolated states that suffered most did not receive any compensation. For Romania this means that, in a time of transition, which is difficult in itself, it has to cope with the loss of one of the most important and most developed trading partners and the blockade of many transit routes by itself, Iliescu said in an interview with this newspaper. The future integration into the military and political alliances of the West remains an important foreign policy goal for Romania. Iliescu hopes that the association agreement between Romania and the European Union [EU] will be ratified by all EU member states by the end of this year. Bringing Romania close to the EU as an associated member is an important step for his country on the path toward full EU membership. In restructuring, Romania expects "economic partnership" with the developed Western countries. In the West much is being said about economic aid. Romania does not need charity but "normal, equal conditions for access to loans and modern technology" to stimulate the dynamism of economic growth in the East, Iliescu said. "We will be able to solve the problems here and in the West only together," the Romanian president stated. Asked about the thinking in terms of so-called spheres of influence, which has become popular again recently, above all in Russia, Iliescu answered that the view, gained from historical experience, that there are big powers that determine politics and economy must be eliminated from the mentality of international politics. "We need a new democratic climate also at the international level, at the level of relations between the states, be they big or small," Iliescu demanded. Regarding Romania's relations with Moldova, one must distinguish between historical ties and a new political reality, Iliescu said. At a "referendum" in March in the former Soviet Republic of Moldova, where two-thirds of its 4.5 million inhabitants are Russians, a majority voted for independence and closer ties with the CIS. Even though there are common roots, a common history, and a common language between Moldova and Romania, the existence of an independent Republic of Moldova, which owes its independence to the collapse of the Soviet Empire, is "a definite reality." From the very beginning Romania has supported the independence of "this second Romanian state." Iliescu expresses understanding for the efforts of the government in Chisinau to cultivate and expand the developed economic relations between Moldova and the former Soviet area as well as to establish normal political relations with its eastern neighbors. In the Romanian president's view, it has been possible to stop the negative economic development in the country. For the first time in years of production decline, one can expect zero growth in 1994, Iliescu assumes. Last year all negative processes of structural change from the planned economy to the market economy accumulated: Today Romanian industry is working at about half- capacity. In contrast to the general assumption, Ceausescu's ambition to repay all of Romania's foreign debts did not bring the country any advantages but only disadvantages on the path toward a market economy. First, because the country and its infrastructure were impoverished as a result and, second, because as an unknown debtor Romania has greater problems getting foreign loans than its competitors on the money market. Combating inflation, which was about 300 percent last year, and unemployment, which is 11 percent, is still the top priority of economic reforms. The "internal convertibility" of the leu, which was introduced a few weeks ago, has managed to make its exchange rate vis a vis Western currencies relatively stable, so that now there are hardly any differences between the official exchange rate and the black market rate. In addition, further "fiscal policy discipline measures" have meanwhile contained the inflation-promoting consequences of the introduction of value-added tax and the raising of the energy prices. According to Iliescu, the monthly inflation rate is now between 6 and 8 percent; the 1994 annual rate might be between 70 and 80 percent, according to the forecasts. The year 1994 will be a difficult one for the people and individual companies. Two periods of drought did great harm to agriculture so that in 1993 Romania was forced to import even wheat. Iliescu expects a slight improvement in the microeconomic situation at the end of 1994 at the earliest. Asked about the problems of the former Romanian King Mihai from the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in connection with entering the country, Iliescu tersely answered that Mihai may enter the country as a private person at any time. The former king had planned to travel to Romania for the orthodox Easter celebrations. Any trip by Mihai to Romania is a problem only if it serves as an excuse for social unrest. In the Romanian president's view, relations between Romania and Germany are good. The signing of the German-Romanian treaty of friendship and cooperation by then Foreign Minister Genscher in Bucharest in April 1992 is the clearest sign of that. Germany supports Romania in its desire to become a member of the EU and NATO. At the same time, however, Iliescu hopes for additional economic and political signals from Germany. In Bucharest government circles one hears surprisingly often words of disappointment about the fact that high-ranking German politicians seem to ignore Romania on their trips to reforming countries in Central Europe. Bucharest has in vain waited for a visit by the chancellor since the revolution in December 1989. The last German chancellor to visit Romania was Kohl's predecessor Schmidt, who traveled to this country in 1978.
