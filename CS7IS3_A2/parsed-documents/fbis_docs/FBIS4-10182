He asserted it was time for people "to decide on whether to be hot or cold, as God will spew forth those who are lukewarm." Yesterday, similar to what happened in Cordoba Province, the head of state once again called on citizens to turn out in massive number at the polls to elect Constituent Assembly members. Menem defended the advantages of the constitutional reform during a political tour he made of Frias, La Banda, and the city of Santiago del Estero to prop up the electoral possibilities for the Justicialist Party [PJ] in the provinces. The president arrived in Santiago del Estero this morning from Cordoba, accompanied by Education Minister Jorge Rodriguez, Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega, and National Mortgage Bank President Adelina Dalesio de Viola. He was welcomed at the airport by Santiago del Estero federal trustee Juan Schiaretti. He then flew to the city of Frias, which is located 175 km from here, where he later presided over a party rally. Menem delivered a speech at this rally, which was held in the 25 de Mayo Square in front of the town hall, after Schiaretti. Menem sharply reprimanded those who are campaigning for the blank vote. Once again, he exhorted citizens to turn out in massive numbers to vote on 10 April because "now is the time to take a firm stand" to keep abreast of our country's transformation process. During his address, the head of state stressed that "the time has come to turn to the Biblical expression: As you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, God will spew you forth. Lukewarmness is not a viable choice. This is why I do not understand how some politicians can be campaigning in favor of the blank vote," he stressed before asking "what is the value of a blank vote at a time when one has to stake everything on our homeland?" Menem harshly reprimanded those who criticize the agreement signed with the Radical Civic Union [UCR]. He stated: "More than 70 percent of Argentines are included in the pact," as they are represented by the two leading political parties in the country, the PJ and the UCR. He recalled that "six constitutional amendments were made in the past without there ever being a consensus by the majority parties." He deemed that "it is of paramount importance to reformulate the current legislation in this transformation process Argentina is undergoing." The president then conceded that "these are not easy times." He nonetheless warned that "there was no other way but to apply the model and the proposal that is under way in order to lift Argentina out of its stagnation." He noted that "40, 50 years ago, the Argentine Republic was counted as one of the 10 best countries in the world. We are now rated as No. 16. I intend to once again occupy the position we used to have," he remarked. He also insisted that with regard to GDP, Argentina "is the country that has registered the greatest growth in the western world over the last three years, and comes in third within the world context after the PRC and Thailand." Menem then devoted several minutes to the particular question of Frias in alluding to the building of sewage lines, the possible establishment of a free trade zone, the building of the Federal Channel which will provide water to three northwestern provinces, and the canalization of the Bermejo River. After the rally, the head of state returned to this capital and got on a bus to travel to La Banda. There, at the Olimpia Club, he participated in a ceremony to dedicate 122 homes in the Ramon Taboada neighborhood. During the evening, Menem attended a ceremony at the Juventud Club where he made several announcements of strictly local interest. Later, he presided over a political rally to close the PJ's election campaign at the intersection of Belgrano and Leon Gallo Streets. Menem's visit to Santiago del Estero Province coincided with a strike of physicians, teachers, and civil servants united in ATE [Association of State Workers], which the previous day had declared him "persona non grata." Today, ATE Chairperson Alba Luna de Castillo stated Menem was given "an icy welcome." She emphasized that "there was nobody at the airport because today is a day of mourning for Santiago del Estero residents." Moreover, she engaged in a vitriolic attack on Schiaretti, saying that "he spends province funds on political rallies" and "has done nothing to solve the problems affecting our public administration."
