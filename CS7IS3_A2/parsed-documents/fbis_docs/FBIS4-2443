Chen Jinhua pointed out: While various important reforms of the economic structure are taking big strides forward, the national economy has kept up satisfactory operations since early this year. A conspicuous problem in our current economic life is the further escalation of inflation and the excessively rapid increase of commodity prices on the market. The retail price index of commodities posted a monthly growth rate in excess of 3 percent this January and February; it is a phenomenon rarely seen since our implementation of reform. In particular, the prices of basic daily necessities, basic service items, and basic means of production which most greatly affect the masses' livelihood and national economic development have increased too much. All trades and professions have found it hard to bear the price increases. Stabilizing commodity prices on the market and bringing inflation under control have become a crucial link in our current endeavor to properly handle the relationships between reform, development, and stability and have become the most urgent task of our economic work. Chen Jinhua said: The issue of the increase in commodity prices has caught the close attention of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. The State Council recently adopted a series of measures to stabilize commodity prices. They are mainly: 1) Strictly exercising "two controls," namely, bringing under control the excessive growth of the scale of investment in fixed assets and the excessive expansion of funds for consumption; 2) successfully promoting in real earnest agricultural production as well as the implementation of the "vegetable basket" project to increase the supply of essential goods; 3) strengthening governments' regulation, control, and management of commodity prices on the market, including the establishment of a fund to cover the risks of the prices of grain and nonstaple foods; stepping up supervision over the prices of 20 categories of basic daily necessities and service items, implementing the marking of prices for commodities and services, and conducting general inspections of commodity prices nationwide; and 4) resolutely taking a number of economic measures to stabilize commodity prices and to improve the allocation, redistribution, and transportation of goods and materials so as to guarantee market supply. The people's governments and commodity price departments at all levels have adopted a series of measures to stabilize commodity prices, too. He stated the requirement that commodity price departments at all levels resolutely implement the relevant measures drawn up by the State Council; that they focus attention on stabilizing the prices of grain, edible oil, nonstaple food, important means of production, and particularly means of agricultural production as well as the fees collected for basic services; and that they persist in conducting inspections and making corrections while propagandizing and handling the task. In particular, he required them to tackle typical cases among the hot issues of concern to the masses, to make timely corrections, and to sternly investigate and deal with them so as to bring into full play the deterrent role of commodity price inspections. Chen Jinhua pointed out: Governments must exercise regulation, control, and management of commodity prices on the market under the conditions of a socialist market economy. This is a common experience gained by the countries that adopt a market economy. The decontrol of prices does not mean the fulfillment of reform tasks. We cannot let market prices go up and down unchecked or let enterprises set prices without standardization. As the prices of the overwhelming majority of commodities have taken shape on the market, the establishment of a perfect system for the regulation and control of prices has become an urgent task for us in our endeavor to deepen reform under the circumstances. However, we must meanwhile pay attention to adopting new thinking and methods for exercising regulation, control, and management in light of the requirements of a market economy. We must standardize the market, bring the excessive increase in commodity prices under control, and prevent drastic price fluctuations; meanwhile, we must avoid rigid controls over prices and a slip back into the old rut of planned prices. Chen Jinhua stressed: At present, the work of [stabilizing] commodity prices is very great and difficult. The establishment of a new price mechanism is an important integral part of the framework for the building of a socialist market economic system; price regulation and control constitute an important link of the state's macroeconomic regulation and control; and the work of [stabilizing] commodity prices is an indispensable, important task facing governments at all levels in exercising economic management. In compliance with the requirements set by the State Council, we must maintain the stability of the organizations of commodity price departments as well as the contingents of their personnel, and we must beef up the necessary forces for inspections. Commodity price departments at all levels must be bold in exploring, must carry out their tasks in a down-to-earth manner, must give full play to their functions, must stabilize the overall situation, and must promote sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development [cu jin guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang di fa zhan 0191 6651 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 0966 4099 1455].
