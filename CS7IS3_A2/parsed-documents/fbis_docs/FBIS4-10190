The prosecutors were quite impressed by the volume of transactions maintained by numbers game operators with some South American countries, such as the ties numbers game kingpin Rodomiro Garcia maintained with one of the most notorious Paraguayan smugglers, [Governor of Alto Parana Department] Carlos Barreto Sarubbi.
