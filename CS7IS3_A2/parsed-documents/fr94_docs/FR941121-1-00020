FR941121-1-00020 FR941121-1-00008 50 CFR Part 677 [Docket No. 940412&hyph;4310; I.D. 102094A] RIN 0648&hyph;AD80 North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS issues a proposed rule to clarify and make minor changes to regulations implementing the North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan (Research Plan). The proposed rule would clarify 1995 observer coverage requirements, revise the definition of the term ``processor,'' specify who is and is not included in the definition of processor, and exempt certain processors included in the definition from the requirement to have a Federal Processor Permit. These clarifications will be incorporated as minor revisions to the instructions accompanying the Federal Processor Permit Application. In addition, the definition of ``round weight'' will be revised to conform it to recent regulatory changes. This proposed rule is consistent with the intent of the final rule implementing the Research Plan and is intended to reduce confusion during the first year of the fee-collection program authorized under the Research Plan. NMFS expects these changes to be effective by January 1, 1995. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received by December 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on this proposed rule may be sent to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, 709 West 9th Street, Juneau, AK 99801, or P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802&hyph;1668, Attn: Lori J. Gravel. Copies of the Research Plan and the environmental assessment/regulatory impact review prepared for the Research Plan may be obtained from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, AK 99510. Copies of the Observer Plan may be obtained from NMFS at the address noted above. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan Salveson, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Regulations implementing the Research Plan became effective October 6, 1994 (59 FR 46126, September 6, 1994). A correction subsequently was published in the Federal Register that delayed specified parts of the implementing rule until January 1, 1995 (59 FR 51874, October 13, 1994). The purpose for, and description of, the Research Plan are contained in the preamble to that final rule. NMFS has identified five areas of ambiguity and inconsistency in the final rule implementing the Research Plan. Consequently, the following changes are proposed: 1. The 1995 observer coverage requirements set out at ยง677.10(a)(1)(i)(C) are clarified to continue to exempt from observer coverage any vessel that delivers unsorted codends to a processor. 2. The definition of ``processor'' under the Research Plan is amended to make clear NMFS' interpretation that tender vessels are not considered processors for purposes of the Research Plan, and that fishermen who transfer fish to persons outside of the United States are included in the definition. 3. The requirement for a Federal Processor Permit is also revised. Certain persons, although considered processors under the definition of that term, are not required to obtain this permit. Fishermen who sell fish directly to a restaurant or to another individual for use as bait or personal consumption or fishermen who transfer fish to a person outside the United States are not required to have a processor permit.
