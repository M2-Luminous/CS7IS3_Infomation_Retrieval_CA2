"The Cold War is over," Ouellet said as he announced the resumption of official assistance to Cuba. Canada stopped aiding Cuba in 1978 after Cuba decided to give military aid to Angola in light of South African aggression. Ouellet's announcement came at a time when Christine Stewart, Canadian minister of state for Latin America and Africa, was in Havana attending an economic conference on Cuba sponsored by the British publication THE ECONOMIST. Official sources in this capital confirmed to the media that Stewart had planned to formally announce in Havana the resumption of Canadian aid to Cuba.
