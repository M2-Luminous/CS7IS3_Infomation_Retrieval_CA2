Calling on Hosokawa at his official residence, Juppe confirmed French concerns about Pyongyang's refusal of full international inspections of its nuclear sites, suspected of being used to produce nuclear weapons, the official said. Juppe, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday for a four-day stay, did not touch on Japan's aspirations to win a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, the official said. The French foreign minister voiced support on Thursday for Tokyo's bid to enter the council as a permanent member when meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Tsutomu Hata. Juppe's visit is his third since assuming his post in April 1993. He visited Japan last April to attend a Group of Seven (G-7) joint ministerial meeting and in July to attend the summit meeting of leaders of the seven major economic powers. The visiting minister reportedly sought further expansion of bilateral political, economic and cultural exchanges and beefed-up two-way visits of political leaders between the two countries. Juppe also conveyed to Hosokawa French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's invitation for him to visit France. Hosokawa did not make any particular response, the official said. But government sources said that Hosokawa is likely to visit three European nations -- Italy, France and Germany -- in early May. Kazuo Aichi, director general of the Defense Agency, told Juppe in a separate meeting that Japan will continue to observe the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), denying it intends to become a nuclear power. "Japan will stick to its three non-nuclear principles in the future and will oppose to an emergence of a new nuclear power," Aichi said, according to Defense Agency officials. Aichi made the remarks in response to an international concern that Japan might go ahead with a program to develop nuclear weapons if North Korea possesses nuclear bombs. In reply to another question from Juppe, Aichi said Japan has no intention to build up defense capability to cope with the tense situation on the Korean peninsula. "Functioning effectively with the present self-defense capability and the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is the basis," for the stance, Aichi said.
