Such is the opinion of RF Deputy Minister of Health Aleksey Moskvichev, director of the diphtheria control headquarters established under the Russian Ministry of Health. Microbiologists believe, he said, that a new strain of disease has appeared, making the situation so acute: Just between August and September the incidence of disease tripled. Today the number of persons hospitalized is nearing 8,000, and 270 persons have died. In the opinion of specialists the serious situation will last into January, and it will not be normalized completely for another 2-4 years. Aleksey Moskvichev communicated that anti-diphtheria serum producers were given help in increasing their production of the preparation back in August. But the preparation cycle lasts half a year, and there's no time to wait. Consequently the Ministry of Health opted for major purchases for hard currency: Thirty thousand vials of serum were purchased abroad, and they will be placed at the disposal of public health agencies within a week. Doctors will receive a second such lot before 1 January 1994.
