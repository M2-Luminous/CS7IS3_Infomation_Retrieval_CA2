Provincial party and government leaders (Luo Haifan), Wu Xiangdong, Zhu Dongyang, and Zhou Shichang attended the meeting. Secretary Wang Maolin said: Only if they study in depth and implement well the guideline laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, do a good job in studying and publicizing Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and persist in arming the armed police force fighters and officers with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and in applying this theory to the operation and development of the armed police force, will our armed police units -- as an armed force defending our cause of socialist modernization -- be able to uphold unswervingly the principle of absolute party leadership over the Army and thus more efficiently undertake the historical mission entrusted by the 14th party congress of defending reform and opening up, and of safeguarding economic construction. Secretary Wang Maolin asserted in particular that the general situation in the province is good at present. Last year, the province achieved great successes in all aspects, he said. However, there are still quite a few unstable factors in the community. Therefore, armed police units at all levels are expected to firmly bear in mind that their essential duties are to perform routine duties and to carry out emergency operations, constantly heighten their sense of police duty, step up the reform of the official duty system, and improve their efficiency in performing duties. The armed police force must carry forward the fine tradition of the Army; vigorously support and play an active part in the province's reform, opening up, and economic construction; and take action to contribute to the development and prosperity of Hunan Province.
