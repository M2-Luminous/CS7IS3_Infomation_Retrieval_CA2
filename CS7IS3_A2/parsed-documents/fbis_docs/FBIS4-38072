Sources in the Sudanese capital claimed over the weekend that Mohammad Zein left his post after the Sudanese Government recalled him to Khartoum, but the ambassador said today he had no intention of resigning. Sudanese sources said Mr. Zein had held office under the former government of Sadeq al-Mahdi, who was arrested last week on conspiracy charges.
