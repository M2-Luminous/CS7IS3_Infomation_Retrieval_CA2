This was announced by Ramon Aguila, chief of the Ministry's finance department. In order to attain this goal, a number of measures are being adopted. These include allocating higher amounts of fuel to those tasks directly tied to production, such as soil preparation, planting, and sugarcane irrigation. Likewise, the scarce resources available will be invested in those enterprises and Basic Cooperative Production Units where they will yield the most. The Ministry has also adopted a new policy on investment in new projects. These will not be undertaken without a preliminary financial study.
