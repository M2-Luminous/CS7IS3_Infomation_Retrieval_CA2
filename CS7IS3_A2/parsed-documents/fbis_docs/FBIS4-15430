The motion would also and endanger the implementation of U.N. General Assembly's resolution on the complete and immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states, he said. Certain ruling political forces in Russia dislike the anticipated agreement with Latvia because they hope to make an advantage of the present situation when there is no formal agreement to keep Russian troops in Latvia, Berzins said. Latvia, however, should not sign the initialed agreements on troop withdrawal before additional talks between authorized state delegations, Berzins added. Berzins claims that the information about "the technical mistake" in the text of Yeltsin's resolution "does not and will not enhance confidence" unless the Russian president himself issues an official statement.
