FR940526-2-00072 FR940526-2-00049 [Release No. 34&hyph;34089; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;92&hyph;41] Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Priority of Agency Orders to Cross Blocks of 25,000 Shares or More Under Rule 126(g), Commentary .01 and .02. May 19, 1994. I. Introduction On November 23, 1992, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend Amex Rule 126(g) relating to the priority and precedence of bids and offers. The proposed rule specifies that agency block cross transactions, 3 where both buy and sell orders are for accounts other than that of a member or member organization, can be effected without interference at the proposed cross price. The proposal, however, would allow the cross to be broken up at a price that is better than the proposed cross price for one side or the other. The proposed rule change is known as the ``clean cross'' proposal. On March 30, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to increase the minimum size of agency crosses that would be entitled to priority under the proposal from 10,000 to 25,000 shares. 4 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 In a cross transaction, a member who has an order to buy and an order to sell an equivalent amount of the same stock wishes to execute the orders against each other. Because the member already has both sides of the trade, the member does not wish to interact with other market interest. The member, however, must comply with the provisions of Amex Rule 151 and make a public bid and offer on behalf of both sides of the cross before effecting the transaction. The offer must be made at a price which is higher than the bid by the minimum fractional change permitted in the security. See Amex Rule 127. 4 See letter from Geraldine M. Brindisi, Corporate Secretary, Amex, to Diana Luka-Hopson, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated March 28, 1994. The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33835 (March 30, 1994), 59 FR 16247 (April 6, 1994). The Commission received no comment letters. This order approves the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1. II. Background The Exchange's auction market procedures are codified in Amex Rule 126, which provides for the manner in which bids and offers at the same price will be sequenced for execution. A member who makes the first bid or offer at a particular price has ``priority'' at that price, which means that the member is the first one in the market entitled to receive an execution at that price. 5 If no member can claim priority, all members who are bidding or offering at a particular price are deemed to be on ``parity'' with each other, or equivalent in status. 6 When members are on parity, a member with orders to cross blocks of 25,000 shares or more may claim ``precedence based on size'' and thereby be entitled to the next execution at that price. 7 5 See Amex Rule 126(e)(1). 6 See Amex Rule 126(e)(2)&hyph;(4). Members are on parity with each other when two or more bids or offers are announced simultaneously, or after a trade takes place leaving several bids or offers unfilled at the same price as the executed trade. 7 See Amex Rule 126(g), Commentary .01. Currently, members attempting to effect a ``cross'' transaction may be required to yield either some or all of one side of their cross in accordance with these rules. More specifically, a cross transaction may be ``broken up'' ( i.e., participated in by another member) if that other member trades with either the bid or the offer side of the transaction. The Amex states that the proposed amendments to Rule 126 would facilitate the ability of members to execute certain types of cross transactions on the Exchange at the cross price, while still providing the opportunity in the auction market for another member to offer price improvement to the buyer or seller, as the case may be. III. Description of the Proposal The Amex proposes to amend its priority rules to allow a member who has an order to buy and an order to sell 25,000 shares or more of the same security, 8 where neither order is for the account of a member or a member organization, to cross those orders at a price that is at or within the prevailing quotation without being broken up at the cross price, irrespective of pre-existing bids and offers at that price. 9 The proposal will allow another member to trade with either the bid or offer side of the cross transaction to provide a price that is better than the proposed cross price, but the other member could not trade with the cross bid or offer at a price which is the same as the cross price. Moreover, the proposal will require that the member who is providing a better price to one side of the cross transaction must trade with all other market interest having priority at that price before trading with any part of the cross transaction. 10 8 Amendment No. 1, supra note 4, increased the minimum size of a ``clean cross'' to 25,000 shares. 9 The Amex will continue to require that the member follow the crossing procedures of Amex Rule 151 and make a public bid and offer on behalf of both sides of the cross. See supra , note 3. Unlike existing block cross procedures under Rule 126(g), Commentary .01, See infra note 11, orders to be crossed under proposed Rule 126(g), Commentary .02 will not be required to be on parity with other orders on the floor; that is it will not be required that the priority of earlier bids and offers first be removed, by means of a sale, before effecting the cross. 10 The proposal also will require that transactions effected at the cross price in reliance on Commentary .02 be printed as ``stopped stock.''
