Moreover, if the election were held now, Fischer said, the four liberal parties in the field taken together would "have a decisive lead." Asked why Gallup's forecasts "depart" from those of other well-known polling organizations in Hungary, like Szonda Ipsos--which reported recently that the former reform communists' Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) has "caught up" with Fidesz and that "the public sees greater chances for an MSZP victory than a Fidesz victory" (NEPSZABDSAG, 13 December)--Fischer said that the "seeming differences" result from the fact that other polling organizations "interpret their data differently." If the elections were held now, according to the Gallup data accompanying the interview, of those who have chosen a party, 29 percent would vote for Fidesz and 22 percent for the MSZP. The other parties would get the following percentages: the currently ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum, 10; the Christian Democratic People's Party, 9; the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), 9; the Independent Smallholders Party, 6; and other parties, a total of 15. Fischer did not dispute the finding of Szonda Ipsos and other polling agencies that the MSZP has become considerably more popular since last year and that Fidesz has lost popularity. He maintained, however, that the MSZP has reached its limit while the liberal parties have reserves of potential support. "The MSZP's ascendance has stopped" in the past four months, he argued, "and in fact, we can see a 2-3 percent decrease" in its vote-getting ability. Thus, although Gallup data show the MSZP running neck and neck with Fidesz, each with 24 percent of those who consider themselves "certain voters," Fischer declared that the data do not support predictions "of a landslide victory of the left" in the next election. "The MSZP has no place to grow," Fischer asserted, "because it has already won over everyone who was a potential supporter. It seems to have come up against a brick wall that it is not likely to break through." In contrast, Fischer said, "many" people cite Fidesz and its main liberal partner, SZDSZ, as their second choice. "It is important that few people consider the liberal parties to be ones that they would not vote for under any circumstances." A table included with the interview compares the accuracy of the 1990 election predictions made by three prominent polling organizations: Gallup, Median, and the Hungarian Public Opinion Research Institute. (A footnote indicates that the government disbanded the latter in 1990 and that "most of its leading workers now work in the leadership of Szonda Ipsos.") According to the table, Gallup came closest to calling the election, coming within 1.7 percent of the overall result and not erring by more than 2.0 percent in its prediction for any individual party. The overall error rate of the Hungarian Public Opinion Research Institute was 2.2 percent and of Median 2.8 percent.
