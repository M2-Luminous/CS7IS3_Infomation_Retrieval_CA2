At the moment of its enforcement on 1 March, the URV will be worth 647.50 real cruzeiros. The decision to implement the URV as an index currency seeks to avoid judicial pleas at the time of converting salaries and other prices to the new index. The MP also creates a "Stabilization Council," which will be comprised of the Central Bank president and directors and three people with demonstrated knowledge about monetary policies. They will be in charge of suggesting a new monetary system and the way of backing its currency. The government wants the currency to be backed by exchange reserves. In other words, the amount of real to be issued must have its equivalent in reserves, otherwise it will not be issued. This is how the economic team plans to make the real a strong currency: any attempt to increase prices will not be sanctioned by an equivalent increase in the amount of circulating currency. More demand for currency will make the cost of money -- the interests -- go up, thus discouraging consumption and forcing businessmen to reduce prices. Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso plans to launch the real before May. Cardoso's advisers believe that the URV should be in force for, at least, three months. This period already is a compromise to Cardoso's political considerations. According to the economic team, the Stabilization Council will also guide the government on how to end the use of the URV and to convert contracts in real cruzeiros to the new currency.
