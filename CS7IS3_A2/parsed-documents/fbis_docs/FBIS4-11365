A special election poll contracted by LA PRENSA with the Dichter and Neira/Lou Harris consulting firm shows Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) has lost 6 percent, while Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement has gained 7.5 percent. The previous poll conducted by the same firm, which was published on 15 April, showed Perez Balladres with 34.5 percent and Blades with 17.3 percent. Now, Perez Balladares has 28.4 percent and Blades has 24.8 percent. Blades is 3.6 percent short of catching up with Perez Balladares. At the end of March, Perez Balladares had 39.5 percent of the vote, while Blades had 14.4 percent, much less than Ruben Dario Carles, who at that time registered 20.5 percent. The new poll was conducted between Friday, 22 April and Saturday, 23 April. The poll, which was conducted on an random social cross-section with the participation of 1,209 people who displayed a willingness to vote, surveyed residents living in national territory by way of face-to-face interviews. Of the 1,209 people polled, 696 live in urban areas while 513 live in rural areas. The specific question asked was: "If the presidential elections were held today, who would you vote for?" The total results in order of preference are as follows: Perez Balladares, 28.4 percent; Blades, 24.8 percent; Carles, 16.2 percent; Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, 14.3 percent; Eduardo Vallarino, 2.3 percent; Samuel Lewis Galindo, 1.4 percent; and Jose Salvador Munoz, 0.2 percent. Meanwhile, the answers of "do not know," "no one," and "no answer" total 12.2 percent. Another trend observed in the last Dichter & Neira poll is Carles' decline. At the end of March he registered 20.5 percent; in the middle of April, 18.6 percent; and now 16.2 percent. Meanwhile, Moscoso de Gruber, like Blades, is gaining in the polls, albeit at a lower level. At the end of March, she had 10.5 percent, in the middle of April 11.3 percent, and now 14.3 percent. It can be noted that in Panama Province, Blades has greater acceptance (28.8 percent) than in the rest of the nation (20.1 percent). Meanwhile, Perez Balladares in Panama Province registers 30.5 percent, while in the countryside he registers 26 percent. Another difference can be seen among the various age groups. Among the younger generation between the ages of 18 and 29, Blades registers 36 percent while Perez Balladares registers 30.2 percent. After the Video It should be noted that this is the first LA PRENSA poll after the release of the "presidential secret," a videotape in which the previous regime's "confessions" of corruption appear. In the video, Tomas Altamirano Duque, first vice presidential candidate on the PRD ticket, is shown saying that because there was no money, nationalism had to be touted. Nationalism was the core of the PRD and the military's propaganda machine in the 1989 elections. In recent days, Altamirano Duque has publicly declared that all governments rob and that he had not participated in business deals with former dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, not because he did not want to but, rather, because Noriega had not asked him to. Carles' and Moscoso de Gruber's campaigns have concentrated on attacking the PRD. Meanwhile, Blades has been calling on the people to vote for Papa Egoro in an effort not to continue "this war of insults and accusations over the next five years." In another turn of events, although the PRD has not changed the substance of its campaign, it has devoted a good portion of its television adds to attacking the president's position. Meanwhile, nearly all of the PRD members who appears in the video have felt compelled to "explain," in one way or another, their participation in the previous regime. President Guillermo Endara was questioned by various sectors that felt the release of the video comprised direct meddling in partisan politics. Other sectors, however, contend the president acted correctly because, otherwise, he would have become "an accessory after the fact." After the video was aired, some sectors who opposed the previous military regime called for civic unity aimed at defeating the PRD in the 8 May elections. Nevertheless, up until yesterday, Sunday, nothing specific had been achieved. Meanwhile, the PRD has said the 1994 elections cannot be won with the same arguments used in the 1989 elections. Taking into account the possibility of an alliance among the civic groups, the last poll posed the following question: "If there were an alliance, and if the only candidates were Blades, Vallarino, Lewis Galindo, and Munoz, who would you vote for?" [sentence as published] The following is the result: Blades, 38.5 percent; Perez Balladares, 29.8 percent; Vallarino, 7.3 percent; Lewis Galindo, 4.2 percent; Munoz 0.05 percent; do not know, 6.6 percent; no reply, 1.9 percent; and none of them, 11.1 percent. Now, assuming Ruben Carles and Eduardo Vallarino were not included, when asked the same question, the following results were achieved: Blades, 31.8 percent; Perez Balladares, 29.2 percent; Moscoso de Gruber, 21.4 percent; Lewis Galindo, 3.2 percent; Munoz, 0.3 percent; do not know, 6.2 percent; no reply, 2 percent; and none of them, 5.9 percent. Struggle Among the Minorities What all of the polls conducted in the past few days show is that there is a struggle among the four minorities: those who support Ernesto Perez Balladares (United People alliance), those who support Ruben Blades (Papa Egoro), those who support Ruben Dario Carles (Change '94), and those who support Mireya Moscoso de Gruber (Democratic Alliance). The other large group of respondents comprises those who are undecided ("do not know," "no reply," and "none of them"), which totals 12.2 percent. Over the past weekend, all of the candidates' campaigns staged caravans, rallies, and street celebrations. In light of the statistics, the 8 May 1994 elections will have two candidates with real chances: Ruben Blades, the composer-singer, and Ernesto Perez Balladares, the businessman.
