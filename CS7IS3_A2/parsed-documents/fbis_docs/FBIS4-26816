In an interview with XINHUA, Kravchanka said that it was very important for Belarus to further promote its relations with China. He said his government was grateful for China's support particularly over its backing of the question of Minsk's joining the UN Security Council. "We hope our bilateral relations will always be filled with constructiveness and the spirit of mutual understanding and benefit," said the Belarusian foreign minister. Speaking of Belarusian-Chinese economic and trade cooperation, Kravchanka noted that Belarus' trucks and tractors sold well on the Chinese market, and its military and space technology are very advanced, on a par with the rest of the world. Meanwhile, Chinese garments and other commodities were welcomed by Belarusian consumers and the minister said that the two countries should raise their existing barter trade to the level of trading by foreign currency. On Belarus' relations with Russia and western countries, Kravchanka said about 70 percent of Belarus' industrial products are sold to Russia, while the latter provided Minsk with 96 percent of its energy. It's necessary for Belarus to establish an economic alliance with Russia, "and we are going to restore economic ties with the east," said the minister. "However, such links are built on the basis of market relations, instead of on the old mandatory orders and state planning model" he stressed. He said conditions will become ripe for Belarus to develop ties with Western countries as the market relations between Belarus and Eastern states progress steadily and grow better. The foreign minister added that Belarus pursues a neutral position in international affairs and maintains itself as a nuclear-free state.
