Party Chairman Ivan Petoe made a submission on the list of deputies and Gabor Kuncze, leader of the party's parliamentary group and the party's candidate for prime minister, on the coalition guidelines. Our staff member Peter Obersovszky spoke to Gabor Kuncze. [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Obersovszky] In recent days the SZDSZ signed the liberal election agreement. [passage omitted] Many people feel that the most problematic situation would be if the Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP] got about 30 percent and would then be in a position to choose its coalition partners or to start forming a government. What would happen then? The SZDSZ has very many times been accused, explicitly or implicitly, that it is potentially willing to form a coalition with the HSP. [Kuncze] It is worth repeating what we said at the SZDSZ's last delegates' assembly, that whereas on the one hand we strive to see the present coalition replaced, on the other hand we would not even dream of helping the HSP to victory. I also doubt whether it could get 30 percent. But there is another viewpoint here, the viewpoint of the country's governability. It would not be a good thing if it turned out to be impossible to form a coalition after May and new elections had to be called. That is why we laid down our coalition guidelines. On the basis of these we are open to negotiations. The electorate can also see what kind of coalition the SZDSZ is willing to enter into, and we will be accountable on these points. However, at this stage it is not worth saying any more than this with regard to the HSP, or any other parties. For the time being there exists but one agreement: this is at the center, the agreement of the liberal parties. [passage omitted] [end recording]
