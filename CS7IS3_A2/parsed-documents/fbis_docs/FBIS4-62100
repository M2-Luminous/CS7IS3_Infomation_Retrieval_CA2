An NTV camera team was able to visit the Baltiyskiy Zavod shipyard in St. Petersburg where the nuclear cruiser Petr Velikiy is being built -- the biggest surface ship currently under construction in Russia. Until now no TV company has managed to visit this ship, although interest remains high. The building of the cruiser Petr Velikiy -- a giant ship and a unique technological creation -- began in 1988. After the unfinished ship was launched, difficulties with funding set in. For some 18 months the cruiser and its builders waited for their fate to be decided. In his day, [Tsar] Peter I encouraged merchants to form guilds which then built ships with their own resources. The Ministry of Defense cannot resort to such simple solutions. Major banks were invited to furnish the funds for the ship which is to become the pride of the Russian Navy. But the present-day financiers showed no interest in this project. The money was nonetheless found, and construction and finishing operations are to be completed by the fall of next year. The Defense Ministry leadership regards the Petr Velikiy as a priority project. [Andrey Kokoshin, Russian Federation first deputy defense minister] The Armed Forces need this ship, and so does the country, despite the difficult situation it is in. Even in this difficult situation the country cannot permit such unique creations to remain unfinished. [Unidentified correspondent] The Petr Velikiy is the latest modification in a series of four similar ships. The cruiser is nuclear-powered. And these are the tubes for launching cruise missiles. Apart from them the cruiser will be armed with large-caliber guns, torpedoes, and anti-aircraft guns and will be able to carry two helicopters. The cruiser will have a crew of 780, most of whom are already taking part in building the ship. The workers, who have carried on working even after their pay was no longer forthcoming, are promising that the St. Andrew's flag will be hoisted on the Petr Velikiy in September of next year in time for the celebrations of the 300th anniversary of the Russian Navy. It is envisaged that the cruiser will serve in the Pacific. Apart from Russia, only the United States has ships of this kind.
