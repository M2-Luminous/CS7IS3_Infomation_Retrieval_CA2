FR940826-0-00067 FR940826-0-00016 20. We find advertising of auctions desirable and in the public interest, even if, because of lack of mutual exclusivity, no auction takes place for some licenses. Among its other beneficial effects, advertising of auctions may be essential for making potential licensees, and in particular designated entities, aware of the opportunities available to them. In order to make service available as rapidly and efficiently as possible, we must ensure that those who value the license most highly, and will offer the services most valued by the public, have an opportunity to bid on them. Mutual exclusivity cannot be established until applications have been received, and at that point advertising will no longer be useful because the purpose of advertising is to inform potential licensees of the opportunity to file applications. Consequently, we retain our existing filing procedures and continue to permit our contractor to advertise auctions even before mutual exclusivity has been established. 41 41 In this regard we also note that since we find that advertising auctions is in the public interest, no conflict of interest exists between Tradewinds' interests and the Commission's. F. Application-Processing Rules 21. In the NPRM in this proceeding, the Commission stated: In order to avoid needless duplication, we propose that the following general filing and processing rules apply to all PCS: Sections 22.3&hyph;22.45 and 22.917(f), and 22.918&hyph;22.945, 47 CFR §§22.3&hyph;22.45, 22.917(f), and 22.918&hyph;22.945. For those PCS applicants who file on Form 574, we believe that §§90.113&hyph;90.159 of our rules, 47 CFR §§90.113&hyph;90.159, could be used to process those applications with appropriate modifications. 42 42 NPRM, 58 FR 53489 (Oct. 15, 1993) at ¶128. 22. Petition. AIDE asserts in its petition for reconsideration of the Second Report and Order that the Commission acted improperly in proposing substantive PCS application-processing rules in the NPRM because, it argues, such rules are outside the scope of this rulemaking, which is limited to implementation of the competitive bidding requirements of §309(j) of the Communications Act. 43 AIDE argues that the Commission's proposal of application-processing rules is legally insufficient to constitute a valid notice of proposed rules, and that some of the rules cited have no immediate applicability to PCS service. AIDE asserts that in the Second Report and Order the Commission failed to respond to the merits of the arguments concerning filing and processing rules in AIDE's comments on the NPRM. AIDE concludes that the Commission needs to issue a supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to adopt license-processing rules for PCS. PacBell states, however, that the Administrative Procedure Act does not prohibit the Commission from issuing more than one order based on a notice and comment period. 44 PacBell also states that there is an exception to the Administrative Procedure Act's notice and comment requirements ``when the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding *␣*␣* in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' 45 43 AIDE Petition at 20&hyph;21. 44 PacBell Opposition at 10. 45 Id. at 11, citing 5 U.S.C. §553(c). 23. Discussion. The Commission adopted few filing or processing rules in the Second Report and Order. Those rules that the Commission did adopt pertaining to the filing and processing of applications and certifications were clearly proposed in the NPRM. 46 In the Second Memorandum Opinion and Order we stated that we would address AIDE's concerns in the reconsiderations of the service-specific Orders in which the application processing rules were adopted. In the Third Report and Order, we adopted the service-specific narrowband PCS application processing rules to which AIDE's petition refers and thus, we address the substance of AIDE's arguments below. 46 See Second Report and Order at ¶¶164&hyph;168, NPRM at ¶¶96&hyph;101. 24. The competitive bidding process is a means of assigning licenses, and rules and procedures for processing of license applications are an integral and necessary part of that process. By citing in the NPRM the specific Part 22 and Part 90 application processing rules that we would use as the basis for adopting PCS rules, we provided commenters with exceptionally clear notice and an opportunity to comment on the rules we contemplated adopting for narrowband PCS. The few changes that we made from the proposed rules were necessary to adapt them to auctioning narrowband PCS licenses. For example, we adopted certain technical requirements such as restrictions on station antenna structures. 47 We also deleted any procedures that were related to grants by random selection. 48 The resulting rules are clearly a logical outgrowth of the rules proposed in the NPRM, applied in the context of the use of competitive bidding to assign narrowband PCS licenses. Rules adopted as a logical outgrowth comply with all Administrative Procedure Act requirements. 49 47 47 CFR 24.416. 48 47 CFR 22.33. 49 Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia v.
