Andre Maniani has the details: [Maniani] The Beninese security forces made every effort to disperse the demonstrators, therefore the huge general assembly planned by the students at the Cotonou Trade Fair Center could not be held. Nonetheless, thousands of students circulated throughout Cotonou in buses chanting (?antigovernment) slogans. The Beninese students are protesting the new decree whose contents fix the conditions for obtaining scholarships and allowances. According to Article 12 of the decree, scholarships are awarded to the most deserving students, to those who qualify, and to those who have the right connections. Students are demonstrating against the decree. According to the students, a close reading of the decree leaves one frustrated at the fact that Nicephore Soglo's regime is trying to block the way of knowledge to the most destitute. Scholarships that were automatically awarded to students in the third year of the university first cycle can no longer be awarded if one's average grade falls below 11.51. The other motives for this abortive general assembly include working conditions, student residences, the quality of lectures, and the longstanding problem of public transportation. Despite the intervention of the security forces, thousands of students went to the venue of the general assembly at the Cotonou Trade Fair Center and swore to plan another meeting in the coming days. In any case, Nicephore Soglo's regime is far from being out of the woods.
