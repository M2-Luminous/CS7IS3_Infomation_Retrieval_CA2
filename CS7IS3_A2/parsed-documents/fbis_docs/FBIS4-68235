Thirty-eight of the cadets have already begun their tours in the initial positions of deputy commanders of ships 3rd rank with VSPR and officers in the battalions and companies of the Ministry of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, while their colleagues (more than 30 of them) who had concluded contracts with the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation have not gone to the Black Sea Fleet. The Commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Eduard Baltin, rejected the cadets for tours of duty owing to the fact that the fleet has no money. This is even though advance agreement was reached between the command of the KVVMU and the command of the Black Sea Fleet on the tours for the cadets, which was confirmed by telegram of the Commander of the Russian Navy, Admiral Feliks Gromov. The next telegram from the same Gromov prohibited doing this. Why? This is not known. The cadets from the KVVMU thus still do not have anything to do. While the commanding officer of their tours, Captain 2nd Rank Oleksandr Aksonov, tries to find a contact from the command of the Black Sea Fleet, the Chief of Staff of the Ukrainian Navy, Rear-Admiral Oleksiy Ryzhenko, has decided to accommodate the Kievans on the grounds of the Sevastopol Naval Institute.
