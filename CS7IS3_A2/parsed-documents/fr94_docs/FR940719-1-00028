FR940719-1-00028 FR940719-1-00009 Another approach recommended general permits for discharges into specific types of wetlands_black spruce bog, heath tundra, and alpine tundra_with size and slope restrictions. One comment further suggested retaining the avoidance requirement, but not acre-for-acre compensation, for wet sedge tundra, riverine, lacustrine, and palustrine emergent wetlands; however, coastal and other wetlands would be accorded the full mitigation sequence. Other comments listed characteristics or criteria of what respondents indicated help define high-value wetlands. These comments focused primarily on the habitat values that certain wetlands provide for wildlife and fisheries, as well as a number of non-habitat functional characteristics. In addition to wildlife habitat characteristics, comments listed as valuable, wetlands that supported sport, commercial, and subsistence fisheries for native and rural non-native Alaskans, as well as tourism, hunting, and bird watching. Also included were wetlands performing hydrologic functions such as retention of sediments, nutrients, and toxicants or moderation of surface runoff. After reviewing these comments, EPA has concluded that the proposed rule would have resulted in adverse impacts to wetlands, including those of high value. We were particularly concerned about the impact the proposed rule would have had on coastal wetlands in the State. According to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), substantial marine wetlands, which are of particularly great value, have already been lost in Alaska. NMFS noted that coastal wetlands ``are critical to *␣*␣* Alaska's salmon and other valuable species *␣*␣*'' and that ``disproportionately high development pressures historically have been focused on this small but critical percentage.'' EPA also agreed with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) concern that the proposed rule would hinder management efforts for several federally listed or proposed threatened and endangered species that utilize Alaska's wetlands, as well as hasten the listing of additional candidate species. Moreover, EPA has concluded that modifying the rule so that it did not apply to high-value wetlands was not practicable. At this time there is no scientifically defensible method to categorize wetlands by value on an a priori basis for an area as large as the State of Alaska. However, we realize that categorization on a case-by-case basis may be practicable, and that the Section 404 regulatory program has appropriate regulatory mechanisms to address such cases where determination of alternatives and compensatory mitigation are either not required or their evaluation is limited. For example, general permits allow actions with minimal impacts to proceed with little or no administrative requirements, most with no requirement for analyzing alternatives or performing compensatory mitigation. Fully two-thirds of all Section 404 activities in Alaska are conducted under general permits. In addition, the Section 404 regulatory program already allows flexibility in how requirements for analysis of alternatives and compensatory mitigation are achieved. EPA and the Corps issued Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines Flexibility Guidance to field staff to clarify and standardize the flexibility afforded in the Guidelines regarding the analysis of project alternatives, based on the severity of environmental impacts of the proposed discharge. That guidance recognizes that all wetlands are not of equal value and clarifies that small projects with minor impacts are subject to less rigorous permit review than for larger ones with potentially greater impact. In addition, planning mechanisms such as watershed plans, advance identification, special area management plans, and State coastal zone management plans, provide the opportunity to incorporate consideration of the mitigation sequence. The mitigation sequence is considered satisfied when proposed mitigation is in accordance with specific provisions of a Corps-EPA approved comprehensive plan that ensures compliance with the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Such plans can result in a priori decisions on the suitability of development in specific areas and the issuance of general permits in others. Finally, as discussed above, not only do existing regulations allow a Section 404 permit applicant to have the avoidance and/or the compensatory mitigation components of the mitigation sequence considered satisfied where these requirements are not practicable, but this flexibility is being implemented in the State of Alaska. Alaska's Wetland Regulatory Approach In 1992, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation received a grant from EPA to develop a Statewide wetlands management and conservation strategy. The principal objective of this study is to develop a hydrogeomorphic wetlands classification methodology specifically applicable to Alaska's wetlands. This functional assessment, combined with local experience and expert knowledge, is intended eventually to evaluate and rank Alaska's wetlands according to their value and to develop corresponding regulatory responses.
