Bishop Nguyen Van Thuan, a nephew of former South Vietnamese president Ngo Dinh Diem, is to be assigned to a Vatican post instead of being appointed deputy to the ailing archbishop in the southern city, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan said. If confirmed by the Vatican, the agreement with Hanoi would mark a backing down by the Roman Catholic Church over its freedom to appoint senior church officials in Vietnam, by granting the government here a veto over the selection of clergy. During talks here last week between Vietnamese officials and Monsignor Claudio Celli, the Vatican's deputy secretary of state, the Holy See agreed to consult Hanoi over the selection of clergy, a source of tension between the church and Vietnam for some time. The Vatican has so far refused to comment on statements by the Vietnamese government, saying it was waiting for Celli's return to Rome. "As far as the case of Bishop Nguyen Van Thuan is concerned we were informed that the Holy Father will assign Bishop Thuan to a post in the Vatican and the Vietnamese side agreed to that arrangement," Lan told a news briefing. The spokeswoman said they had agreed "that the Holy See will keep the government informed of all matters concerning the Vietnamese Catholic Church and will not make any decision in this connection unless the Vietnamese government gives its approval." Thuan was originally appointed deputy archbishop before the communists took over the then Saigon in 1975. He was not allowed to take up the post and has been in exile in Rome since 1992. Vietnamese authorities have been trying to engineer the appointment of Huynh Van Nghi, recently described by Vietnamese Premier Vo Van Kiet as having "a positive attitude," as deputy to Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, who is over 80 years old and in poor health. The Vatican had appointed Nghi as a "supervising bishop" in Ho Chi Minh City but this was rejected by government authorities here, who said it was part of a "plot" to sideline the bishop and eventually appoint Thuan as archbishop. The church's development here under French colonial rule and the strong connections between Catholicism and the former South Vietnamese regime have fueled government suspicions of Catholics, who number around seven million people, or 10 percent of the population. Vatican officials have accused Vietnam of trying to turn Asia's second largest Catholic community after the Philippines into a state-sponsored church outside of the control of the normal religious hierachy. At a meeting in August with Vietnamese living in the United States, the pope called on the congregation "not to forget your brothers and sisters ... in the difficult situation of their country." Kiet told a Catholic newspaper earlier this month that as the issue was one of "national sovereignty," Vietnam had ruled out a compromise on who had the right to control religious activities. Tensions have eased in recent years with visits here by Vatican envoys but the dispute over appointments has left several top posts unfilled, including the head of the archdiocese of Hanoi.
