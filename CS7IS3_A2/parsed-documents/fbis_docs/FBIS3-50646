The communique stated that the Central American presidents' visit was agreed upon in early December and that the trilateral agenda does not include "the topic of the situation in Los Altos de Chiapas," where an armed Indian rebellion has been taking place since 1 January. The communique also stated that on the night of 3 January Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio spoke with Salinas to discuss several topics, including the situation in Chiapas. The communique explained that the Guatemalan president proposed to the Mexican president "an exchange of information." The guerrilla outbreak by the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN] is taking place in southern Chiapas State, on the border with Guatemala. Guatemalan Army sources have reported the possibility of a link between the EZLN and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, which has rejected that charge. Mexican Government sources told AFP that the idea that there are Central Americans in the EZLN ranks is being confirmed, and they even said that "there is a Guatemalan" in the leadership of that guerrilla organization.
