The callers had "heard" or "read" somewhere about a new version of a Kremlin coup actively being discussed in Moscow this week. Evidently, while the capital was discussing whether or not "version No. 1" bore any relation to reality, the provinces had managed to "enrich" the scheme with obligatory elements which it lacked with, for examaple, the storming of "Ostankino" and General Makashov leading the assault. Personally, having always respected the reader, I even now consider these telephone questions no more naive than the claims of professional politicians that peace and accord will come about in Russia as a result of the amnesty applied to the recent prisoners of Lefortovo. Terrible though it may be, everything or almost everything, set forth in "version 1," which revealed the mechanism of a possible coup, could in my view perfectly well have happened in reality. I go along with my readers in not ruling out in principle the possibility that Mr. "A" and Mr. "B" in the president's close or broader entourage had arranged to remove him from power by pleading the head of state's poor state of health (was this not exactly what Gorbachev's closest entourage did in August 1991?). Nor do I see anything remarkable in the fact that some Mr. "C," expelled from the political Olympus for lack of talent, grayness, and idleness, is not averse to mounting a white steed and riding into the Kremlin.... However much the president's aides and counterintelligence officials may go on about the absurd and nonsensical nature of the false report that was disseminated, I know along with my readers that it created such a ballyhoo because it too closely resembles our actual life. Alas, political coups or attempts to carry them out are becoming almost the norm -- people are starting to get accustomed to them, as to snow in winter and green leaves when summer comes. Hence, the mistrust of attempts by the "opposing" sides to confirm priority for the principles of civil peace and accord in our harassed society. The political plot as a means of resolving contradictions in society is evidently characteristic of our life even now. Secret or hush-hush decisions by cabinet and apparatus are another old standard in our political practice. Somehow I cannot recall a broad discussion in the press and on television of the consequences of increasing the customs tariffs on imported food before that decision was adopted, and yet it affects literally every Russian. It is a question, above all, of food prices. Is quiet cabinet lobbying in the government by supporters of Vice Premier Zaveryukha not a small "economic plot" to resolve the problems of Russian agricultural producers this year? Oh why does it not occur to anyone to organize a "plot" or to carry out a "coup" IN YOUR INTERESTS AND MINE [uppercase as published]? Why is it that, after all these cataclysms perpetrated "in the name of the people," things are no easier for the people themselves...? The political coup is the natural offspring of communist ideology. On 7 November 1994 that grandfather will be 77 years old. In October 1993 his lively grandchildren -- let us consider them so -- got up to mischief again. Well, where there are grandchildren there will also be fun, while there is this blood kinship, while this genealogical tree with its roots back in October 1917 has not withered....
