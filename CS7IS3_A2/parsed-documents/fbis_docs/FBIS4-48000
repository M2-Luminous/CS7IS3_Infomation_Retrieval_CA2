Mr. van Heerden has been implicated in third force activities and the supply of arms to KwaZulu. Mr. van Heerden was named by Goldstone Commission's informant Q as the alleged middle man in arms deliveries to the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. ABSA chief executive, Danie Cronje, said Mr. van Heerden had been dismissed two weeks ago following the completion of an internal investigation. Regarding ABSA security head Dougie Crewe, who Q claimed had assisted Mr. van Heerden, Dr. Cronje said no evidence was found implicating him in third force activities. Dr. Cronje said although the internal investigation was completed some time ago, the bank had been advised by the Goldstone Commission and the Transvaal attorney general, Dr. Jan d'Oliveira, not to release any information earlier. However, following the arrest of the former Vlakplaas chief, Lieutenant Colonel Eugene de Kock, in connection with the Goldstone allegations, Dr. d'Oliveira gave ABSA permission to make the findings public. Dr. Cronje said the suspension of maintenance employees, Victor and James Ndlovu, would remain in force on the advice of the attorney general. They have been implicated in train violence and investigations are continuing.
