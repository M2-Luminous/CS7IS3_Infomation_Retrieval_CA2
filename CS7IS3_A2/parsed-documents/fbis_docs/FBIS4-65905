Five cabinet members are believed to belong to the extreme right-wing camp; three of them come from the Italian Social Movement [MSI], a party that has never abandoned fascism. [Martino] Concerns abroad were predictable and are understandable. The change in Italy was so radical that there were bound to be problems with its interpretation. But basically, the five ministers are members of the Alleanza Nazionale, which is different from the MSI, and the MSI is not the Fascist Party of the past. For me, the most important thing is that this alliance has signed our joint program, and this is not a program of the right-wing, but a program of the liberal-center. [DER SPIEGEL] Nonetheless, for the first time since the end of the war, there are fascists in a West European government. That was inconceivable until recently. Hasn't a taboo been broken now? [Martino] If these people were really neofascists, I would not be in a government with them. [DER SPIEGEL] The Alleanza Nazionale clearly represents revanchist positions in its election program. It wants to revise the Peace Treaty of 1947 and the Treaty of Osimo, which confirmed the secession of the Eastern Adriatic region to Yugoslavia. We quote: "Following German reunification, Italy must be reunited, too, with Istria, Fiume, and Dalmatia being returned to Italy." [Martino] Our foreign political government program has nothing to do with such ideas. This means, first, that borders will not be called into question, and, second, treaties will not be discarded. [DER SPIEGEL] Is all this really that harmless? On the very day the government statement was made, news broke that the MSI moved a draft law calling for the abolition of the ban on Mussolini's fascist party. [Martino] That was an unfortunate initiative, but Gianfranco Fini promptly dissociated himself from it. [DER SPIEGEL] But he also signed it. [Martino] Why don't you ask him; there was talk about an error. For a better understanding of the new political situation in Italy, the world should know that we have amended our election law. The former system of proportional representation allowed political parties with extreme positions to acquire a strong image and thus fill niches. However, the system of majority representation creates overlapping alliances, in which radical positions are smoothed and are even punished to a certain extent. [DER SPIEGEL] This hardly mitigates the European neighbors' concerns. They fear that the apparently more gentle Italian version of right-wing extremism could encourage aggressive neofascism in their own countries. [Martino] Let me be very specific. In the local elections in December, MSI chairman Gianfranco Fini won 47 percent of the votes in Rome, his fellow party member Alessandra Mussolini won 44 percent in Naples. If we as Forza Italia had not appeared in this situation, these right-wing groups would have offered themselves as the only alternative to the left-wing parties. In this way, we not only prevented the victory of the left, but also that of the extreme right wing. [DER SPIEGEL] Forza Italia as the savior of the fatherland? [Martino] There are also positive elements of this dramatic change for us. I wish they were noted abroad and in particular in Germany. [DER SPIEGEL] The new government in Rome is currently causing different concerns among its European partners. Italy has traditionally always been very pro-European. Will the EC founding member now join those who intend to put a brake on European unification? [Martino] I can hardly have conveyed this impression. I was less than three days in office, and the government had not even been confirmed by Parliament, when I took part in the Council meeting in Brussels and met with European Commission President Jacques Delors, whom I assured of the continuity of Italy's European policy. [DER SPIEGEL] But you are known as a Euroskeptic. For instance, you took part in the meeting of the Brugge group, which backs Margaret Thatcher's negative attitude toward European unity. [Martino] I admire Mrs. Thatcher for what she has done for the British economy. She introduced the dynamism of the free market economy into the antiquated economic system. I took part in the meetings of this Brugge group twice. At the first meeting in Brugge in 1989, I said amid general applause that exaggerated regimentation only creates discord instead of accord. In London, I was booed for my views on monetary policy. [DER SPIEGEL] Does this mean that you advocate monetary union? [Martino] Yes, I think a common currency is desirable for psychological and economic reasons and as an alternative to the U.S. dollar on the world market. I doubt, however, that a common currency can be achieved step by step. For certain problems, there are no gradual solutions. It is, for instance, impossible to abolish left-hand traffic in Britain by introducing right-hand traffic for trucks on the first day, cars on the second day, and mopeds on the third day. [DER SPIEGEL] Gradual development has so far been the basic principle of European integration. [Martino] Being for Europe does not mean approving every technical option or strategy. Even though there may be differences of opinion with European partners on individual issues, our government possibly is even more European than its predecessors on the great objectives. By the way, the conference of Messina in 1955, at which European integration was initiated, was chaired by a foreign minister called Martino. He was my father, one of the signatories of the Treaties of Rome. [DER SPIEGEL] Times have since changed considerably. Today, problems of the economy, the environment, or traffic can only be solved internationally. At the same time, national egoism is growing in all member states. How do you intend to resolve this contradiction? [Martino] Experience has shown that trade unites, whereas policy divides. That is why we should not try to intervene in the markets by means of too many regulations. [DER SPIEGEL] But environmental problems today cannot be solved without European regulations. [Martino] These are noble ecological views. However, often enough, environmental protection is a pretext for protectionist measures. [DER SPIEGEL] For countries like Spain and Portugal, the European environmental standards constitute progress. They received billions from the EU coffers for the modernization of old industries that are now supposed to emit fewer pollutants. [Martino] European policy should be focused on the common great goals and go back to European values. I do not want the cynical characterization of an American friend to apply to us; he said Europe is nothing but a collection of valuable old property. I think rather that Europe should have a voice and weight in the world. [DER SPIEGEL] Could that be achieved with a common foreign and security policy? [Martino] When my father was foreign minister 40 years ago, the attempt failed to found a European defense community; it failed because the French parliament refused to ratify the project. I still consider a common foreign and security policy indispensable. [DER SPIEGEL] Membership of Austria and three Scandinavian countries within the European Union [EU] is for Germany the first step of an EU enlargement to the East. What is your position? [Martino] Very positive, even though such an enlargement will slow down the process of integration. Just as we talked about West Germany until recently and speak about Germany now, we will also speak about the EU. We will then no longer speak about West Europe, but about Europe as a whole. [DER SPIEGEL] Are you anticipating a certain German predominance in Europe, as the French do? [Martino] Personally I do not have any problems with it. As for the rest, my motto is that he who predicts catastrophes will suffer twice -- once when he predicts them, and then when they take place. [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Minister, we thank you for this interview.
