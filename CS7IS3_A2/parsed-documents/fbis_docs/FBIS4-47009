Attachment No. 1: System of Criteria for Determining That the Structure of the Balance Sheet of Insolvent Enterprises Is Unsatisfactory 1. The following indicators shall be used to evaluate the satisfactoriness of the structure of the balance sheet of an enterprise: the current liquidity ratio; the internal liquidity ratio; the solvency recovery (loss) ratio. 2. The current liquidity ratio shall characterize the overall availability of working capital to the enterprise for economic activity and for timely repayment of the enterprise's accrued liabilities. The current liquidity ratio shall be defined as the ratio of the actual value of working capital in the possession of the enterprise in the form of production reserves, finished products, monetary resources, accounts receivable, and other working assets (the sum of the totals of sections II and III of balance sheet assets), to the shortest-term liabilities of the enterprise, taking the form of short-term bank credit, short-term loans, and various accounts payable (the total of section II of balance sheet liabilities, less lines 500, 510, 730, 735, 740). 3. The internal liquidity ratio shall characterize presence of the enterprise's own working capital necessary for its financial stability. The internal liquidity ratio shall be defined as the ratio of the difference between the volumes of working capital sources (the total of section I of balance sheet liabilities) and the actual value of fixed capital and other fixed assets (the total of section I of balance sheet assets), to the actual value of fixed capital in the enterprise's possession in the form of production reserves, unfinished products, finished products, monetary resources, accounts receivable, and other working assets (the sum of the totals of sections II and III of balance sheet assets). 4. The solvency recovery (loss) ratio shall characterize the presence of a real possibility for the enterprise to recover or lose its solvency over the course of a certain period of time. The solvency recovery (loss) ratio shall be defined as the ratio of the calculated current liquidity ratio to its ascertained value. The calculated current liquidity ratio shall be defined as the sum of the actual value of the current liquidity ratio at the end of the reporting period, and change in the value of this ratio between the end and the beginning of the reporting period, expressed in terms of the established period of solvency recovery (loss). 5. Fulfillment of one of the following conditions shall be grounds for recognizing the structure of the balance sheet of an enterprise to be unsatisfactory, and the enterprise to be insolvent: the current liquidity ratio at the end of the reporting period is less than 2; the internal liquidity ratio at the end of the reporting period is less than 0.1. 6. When grounds established in item 5 of this attachment for recognizing the structure of the balance sheet to be unsatisfactory exist, and if the solvency recovery (loss) ratio, determined on the basis of a solvency recovery period equal to six months and an ascertained current liquidity ratio equal to 2, is a value greater than unity, the decision that a real possibility for the enterprise to recover its solvency exists may be made. When grounds established in item 5 of this attachment for recognizing the structure of the balance sheet to be unsatisfactory are absent, and if the solvency recovery (loss) ratio, determined on the basis of a solvency loss period equal to three months and an ascertained current liquidity ratio equal to 2, is a value less than unity, the decision that the enterprise will not be able to meet its obligations to creditors (a decision that the enterprise has lost its solvency) may be made. 7. A decision recognizing the structure of the balance sheet to be unsatisfactory based on grounds established by item 5 of this attachment may be postponed for a time determined by the Federal Administration for Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Affairs under the Russian State Committee for the Administration of State Property, if presence of a real possibility for the enterprise to recover its solvency has been established by the procedure determined by paragraph 1, item 6 of this attachment. 8. The balance sheet of an enterprise shall be analyzed on the basis of: the balance sheet for the last reporting period, and the balance sheet as of the first of the current month (if the date on which this balance sheet is filled out does not coincide with the last day of the last accounting period), submitted by the enterprise management and notarized according to the established procedure; the enterprise's balance sheet for the last reporting period, submitted to tax authorities in the case of failure of the enterprise management to submit the corresponding documents by the deadline. Information contained in documents received according to the indicated procedure shall be sufficient to make a decision regarding determination of the unsatisfactoriness of the structure of an enterprise's balance sheet.

Nonreimbursable allocations of state funds shall be reflected on the liability side of the enterprise's balance sheet as specific-purpose financial receipts, and they may not incur changes in the share of the state, as well as its intermediaries (agent organizations), in the enterprise's authorized capital. 4. Measures indicated in item 2 of this Statute shall be financed in accordance with an agreement signed between the body of executive government providing the financing and the Federal Administration for Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Affairs under the Russian State Committee for the Administration of State Property (henceforth the Federal Administration), which shall ensure that the resources are used for their intended purpose and that these resources are repayable (in the event that financing is on a credit basis), on one hand, and an authorized organization (agent) of the Government of the Russian Federation (of a subject of the Russian Federation) on the other. 5.

The following may act as a body (as bodies) financing rehabilitation measures in the name of the state, depending on the sources of financing: the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance or an authorized financial agency of a subject of the Russian Federation, if the federal budget or the budget of a subject of the Russian Federation is the source of financing of rehabilitation measures; a federal body (bodies) of executive government, a body (bodies) of a subject of the Russian Federation, and bodies of local self-management authorized to dispose of resources of sector and intersector nonbudgetary funds, if the indicated funds are the indicated funds are the financing source.
