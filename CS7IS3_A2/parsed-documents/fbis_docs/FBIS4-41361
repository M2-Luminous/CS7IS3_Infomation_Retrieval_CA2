The bill put on the agenda of a parliamentary session in Simferopol on Thursday [23 June] follows a resolution of 14 June stating that many of the president's decrees were out of line with Crimean legislation. Speaking in parliament, Meshkov said the Supreme Soviet was out for a stand off with the president under the mask of demands for compliance with the Constitution and laws. He said the current situation was far too serious to raise the question of stripping him of presidential powers. Meshkov sees the parliament's action as an attempt to try to put itself above the people of Crimea who elected him as head of state in keeping with the Constitution. However, the deputies are most likely to pass the law, albeit in a softer form, leader of the Crimean Tatars' faction in parliament Refat Chubarov told INTERFAX-Ukraine. He described what was happening as an attempt by the Russia faction which backed up Meshkov during the presidential election to put him in his place. As discussion continues, a conciliatory group was elected to work out a final resolution.
