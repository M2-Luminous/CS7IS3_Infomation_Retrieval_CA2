FR941128-1-00024 FR941128-1-00005 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Parts 51 and 52 [AH&hyph;FRL&hyph;5107&hyph;1; Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;65] Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: EPA is issuing this proposal to augment the final rule that was published on July 20, 1993. Today's notice proposes to make several additions and changes as supplement C to the ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)''. Supplement C does the following: incorporates improved algorithms for treatment of area sources and dry deposition in the Industrial Source Complex (ISC2) model, adopts a solar radiation/delta-T (SRDT) method for estimating atmospheric stability categories, adopts a new screening approach for assessing annual NO 2 impacts, and adds SLAB and HGSYSTEM as alternative models. The Guideline sets forth air quality models and guidance for estimating the air quality impacts of sources and for specifying emission limits for them. The purpose of the proposed changes is to enhance the guidance in response to a substantial number of public comments urging the Agency to do so. For the purposes of this document, EPA is soliciting public comments only on the four proposed changes associated with supplement C and will not respond to any comments that are outside the scope of this document. This limiting of EPA's responses to comments within the scope of this document allows the Agency to focus on the issues, data, and information relevant to this rulemaking. DATES: The period for comment on these proposed changes closes January 12, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments: Written comments should be submitted (in duplicate if possible) to: Air Docket (6102), Room M&hyph;1500, Waterside Mall, Attention: Docket A&hyph;92&hyph;65, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460. Copies of supplement C (draft) to the ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)'' may be obtained by writing or calling Joseph A. Tikvart, Source Receptor Analysis Branch, MD&hyph;14, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, phone (919) 541&hyph;5561. Supplement C (draft) is also available to registered users of the Support Center for Regulatory Air Models Bulletin Board System (SCRAM BBS) by downloading the appropriate file. To register or access this electronic bulletin board, users with a personal computer should dial (919) 541&hyph;5742. Docket: Copies of reports referenced herein (unless otherwise noted) and public comments made on this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) are maintained in Docket A&hyph;92&hyph;65. The docket is available for public inspection and copying between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, at the address above. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph A. Tikvart, Chief, Source Receptor Analysis Branch, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711; telephone (919) 541&hyph;5561 or C. Thomas Coulter, telephone (919) 541&hyph;0832. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background 1 The purpose of the Guideline 2 is to promote consistency in the use of modeling within the air management process. The Guideline provides model users with a common basis for estimating pollution concentrations, assessing control strategies and specifying emission limits; these activities are regulated at 40 CFR 51.46, 51.63, 51.112, 51.117, 51.150, 51,160, 51.166, and 51.21. The Guideline was originally published in April 1978. It was incorporated by reference in the regulations for the Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality in June 1978 (43 FR 26380). The Guideline was subsequently revised in 1986 (51 FR 32176), and later updated with the addition of supplement A in 1987 (53 FR 393). The last such revision was supplement B, issued on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38816). The revisions in supplement B included techniques and guidance for situations where specific procedures had not previously been available, and also improved several previously adopted techniques. 1 In reviewing this preamble, note the distinction between the terms ``supplement'' and ``appendix''. Supplements A, B and C contain the replacement pages to effect Guideline revisions; appendix A to the Guideline is the repository for preferred models, while appendix B is the repository for alternate models justified for use on a case-by-case basis. 2 ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)'' (1986) [EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;027R], with supplement A (1987) and supplement B (1993), hereinafter, the ``Guideline''. The Guideline is published as appendix W of 40 CFR Part 51. The text of appendix W will be appropriately modified to effect the revisions proposed for supplement C.
