FR941117-0-00222 FR941117-0-00014 While information concerning prepayment assumptions and pricing of CMOs and other asset-backed securities may be contained in disclosure documents at the offering stage, this type of detailed information has not been as readily available in the secondary market for some asset-backed securities and to some investors. 98 Under the Rule, as adopted, such information would be required to be sent to customers upon written request. In addition, if in fact a CMO or other asset-back security is sold solely on the basis of one yield amount, the yield and underlying assumptions should be disclosed on the confirmation, as well as the legend stating that these items may vary. 99 This is consistent with those commenters that noted that they disclose yield information in CMO transactions as a matter of course. 100 The antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws would require that any information provided upon request reflect changes or developments in the characteristics of the asset-backed security. 98 The Commission recognizes the positive efforts made to educate and provide information to investors in the CMO market. For example, the PSA developed a brochure entitled, ``Investors Guide to Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (REMICs),'' which is approved by the NASD as an investor education tool. In addition, one commenter stated that prepayment information and interest rate information are available to dealers and investors in the secondary market through various vendors and proprietary services. This commenter also indicated that for those market participants that do not have access to this information, they should be able to obtain it from the selling broker-dealer. See Letter from Mitchell Delk, Vice President/Government and Industry Relations, Freddie Mac, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 15, 1994). 99 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(a)(5)(i). See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19687 (Apr. 18, 1983), 48 FR 17583. The Commission is concerned that in some cases asset-backed securities may be sold to retail investors on the basis of a single yield figure, without adequate disclosure that this yield can vary based upon prepayment speeds. This inadequate disclosure would potentially violate self-regulatory organization and Commission antifraud rules. In addition, to make this disclosure complete, a broker-dealer would need to disclose that the single yield may vary. 100 See supra note 92. III. Effects on Competition and Regulatory Flexibility Act Considerations Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act 101 requires that the Commission, when adopting rules under the Exchange Act, consider the anticompetitive effects of those rules, if any, and balance any anticompetitive impact against the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission believes that adoption of the amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 will not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 101 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2). The Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (``FRFA'') regarding the amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 604. The FRFA notes the potential initial costs of operational and procedural changes that may be necessary to comply with the amendments. In addition, the FRFA notes the benefits to investors of increased disclosure that will result from these amendments. The Commission believes that the benefits of added disclosure outweigh the costs that will be incurred by industry participants in complying with these amendments. A copy of the FRFA will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.
