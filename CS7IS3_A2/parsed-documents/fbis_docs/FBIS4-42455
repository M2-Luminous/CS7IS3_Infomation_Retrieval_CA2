Our correspondent has the following report: [Unidentified Correspondent] Twenty-five new AIDS cases were discovered in Greece during the last three months, raising the total number of cases since 1984 to 916. At the same time, the carriers of the AIDS virus are estimated to number from 13,000 to 15,000. Of the 916 cases, 801 are men, 55 women, and 20 children. Already 354 of those infected with the virus have died. Health Minister Dhimitrios Kremastinos, who held a news conference in the framework of an AIDS seminar organized by the Center for the Control of Special Infections at PARTET [not further identified] Institute, stressed that Greece still has the fewest cases in Europe. However, this does not justify relaxation, since the disease is progressing in other countries and preventive measures should be intensified. [passage omitted]
