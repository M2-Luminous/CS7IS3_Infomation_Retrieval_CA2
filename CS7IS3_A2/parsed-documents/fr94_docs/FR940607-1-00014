FR940607-1-00014 FR940607-1-00003 B. Other Noncontroversial Rule Filings After Prior Notice to the Commission The Commission also proposes to amend Rule 19b&hyph;4 and the instructions to Form 19b&hyph;4, pursuant to authority in Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Exchange Act, to expand the scope of proposed rule changes that may become effective under Section 19(b)(3)(A) to include certain noncontroversial filings, if the proposed rule change, by its terms, does not become operative for 30 days after the date of publication of the notice of filing or such shorter time as the Commission may designate. 17 For these filings, SROs also would be required to provide written notice to the Commission five business days prior to the filing. 18 Filing this type of proposed rule change under Section 19(b)(3)(A) should allow SROs to implement these rule changes more quickly than if they were filed under Section 19(b)(2). 17 This 30 day provision resembles a 1979 proposal by the Commission that featured a 60 day post-filing operation date which was never adopted. SROs objected primarily because the 60 day provision, when combined with a 30 day pre-filing circulation period among members, did not provide sufficient incentive to forego filing the proposed rule change under Section 19(b)(2). The Commission believes that today's proposal addresses these concerns. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 15838 (May 18, 1979), 44 FR 30924; Securities Exchange Act Release No. 17258 (October 30, 1980), 45 FR 73906. 18 For every clearing agency for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency, this notice also would be filed with the appropriate regulatory agency for the clearing agency as required by Section 17(c)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78q(c)(1). Consistent with the requirements of that section, the Commission also would expect the MSRB to file such notices with each agency enumerated in Section 3(a)(34)(A) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(34)(A). This new provision only would apply to those proposed rule changes that are properly designated by the SRO as not significantly affecting the protection of investors and not imposing any significant burden on competition. For purposes of meeting this requirement, the impact or burden of a proposed rule change would be significant if, in the view of the Commission staff or industry participants, the change would require more than a cursory analysis to determine whether the impact or burden was necessary or appropriate under the Exchange Act. Proposed rule changes meeting these criteria generally are less likely to engender adverse comments or require the degree of review attendant with more controversial filings. For example, a proposed rule change that adds an existing rule to an SRO's minor rule violation plan, that is objective in nature, such as a reporting obligation, and that does not involve a violation of the federal securities laws or the rules thereunder, could be properly filed under this provision. Another example would be a proposed rule change permitting the transmission of data to or from the SRO by computer interface or other electronic means. A proposed rule change, however, that would reduce public representation in the administration of the affairs of an SRO or that would amend the procedures for arbitration or disciplinary proceedings would not be a proper candidate to become effective under Section 19(b)(3)(A). These types of filings implicate basic policy considerations with respect to the protection of investors, and should be filed under Section 19(b)(2) to allow for more careful scrutiny. Under this new provision, the SRO would have to provide the Commission with written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along with a brief description and the text of the proposed rule change, at least five business days prior to the filing date. 19 The Commission expects that such notices will be brief and informal and often will be transmitted by facsimile. This prior notice would give Commission staff an opportunity to discuss with the SRO whether there exists an adequate basis upon which the proposed rule change may properly qualify under this provision. Furthermore, the notice could elicit guidance from Commission staff to help the SRO identify those aspects of a proposed rule change that the Commission deems important. This should help the SRO articulate in its subsequent filing the purpose and effects of the proposed rule change, which in turn should further facilitate and expedite the filing process. 20 19 This notice would be directed to the appropriate Division staff responsible for reviewing that SRO's filings of proposed rule changes. The Commission intends to place this notice in a public file. See Exchange Act Section 23(a)(3), 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(3). 20 The Commission emphasizes that SROs should take extreme care in assuring that all filings express the information necessary for the Commission's review. Any filings that fail to comply with the requirements of Form 19b&hyph;4 may be returned to the SRO and will be deemed not to have been filed with the Commission. The requirement that a proposed rule change filed in this manner cannot, by its terms, become operative prior to 30 days after the date of publication of the notice of filing would provide a meaningful opportunity for public comment prior to the rule's operation. This would allow the Commission, if necessary, to abrogate the rule change before it became operative in the least disruptive manner possible, if the proposed rule change was determined to be inconsistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. This 30-day requirement, however, could be shortened or waived by the Commission if consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Commission notes that it presently has the authority under Section 19(b)(3)(C) 21 of the Act to abrogate summarily within sixty days of filing any proposed rule change that becomes effective under Section 19(b)(3)(A). If the proposals to expand the scope of proposed rule changes that may become effective under Section 19(b)(3)(A) are adopted, however, the Commission intends to revise its rules to delegate this abrogation authority to the Director of the Division. This would be necessary to facilitate an expected increase in the volume of proposed rule changes that would be filed under Section 19(b)(3)(A). 21 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(C). C. Submission of Form 19b&hyph;4 on Paper and on Computer Diskette During the past five years, the staff of the Commission has acted on over 2,000 SRO rule filings. In addition to submitting a proposed rule change on Form 19b&hyph;4, the SRO is responsible for preparing and attaching an exhibit to the form containing the complete notice of the proposed rule change for publication in the Federal Register . Staff of the Commission may amend or supplement this notice in preparing it for publication. If and when the proposed rule change is approved, staff also prepares an approval order for similar publication. Thus significant staff resources are devoted to processing these filings and preparing them for publication. The Commission therefore is encouraging SROs to submit certain portions of all filings on computer diskette in an appropriate wordprocessing format. This only would apply to Form 19b&hyph;4 and the notice for publication (Exhibit 1 to Form 19b&hyph;4). The paper version of these documents would continue to be required, but the electronic version would provide a more efficient way for Commission staff to review and prepare the initial notice for publication in the Federal Register . D. Miscellaneous Amendments to Form 19b&hyph;4 The Commission also is proposing to reduce the number of copies of Form 19b&hyph;4 and Exhibit 1 that SROs must submit, from twelve to eight, including the manually signed original. The Commission also is correcting miscellaneous outdated references contained in Form 19b&hyph;4 with respect to the Commission's address and appropriate offices within the Division to which filings of proposed rule changes should be directed.
