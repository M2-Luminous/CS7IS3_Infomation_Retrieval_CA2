He managed to wrest a great deal from the U.S. Administration in return for only a few things which the Syrian leadership considers important but not of a priority nature. The Syrian president carried with him to Geneva three main files, one on Syria's regional role, another on the Syrian role in Lebanon, and a third on the Golan Heights. Contrary to the U.S. Administration's expectations, the file of the Golan and Israel's withdrawal from it was the last and not the first to be carried by President al-Asad to his Geneva meeting last Sunday [16 January]. Excluding what the Arab and foreign newspapers published, AL-BILAD managed to obtain the most important points discussed by the two sides--points which were kept secret pending their publication at a time appropriate for both the Americans and Syrians. These points are: -- A secret American approval of giving the Syrians a free hand in Lebanon after obtaining a pledge from President al-Asad to guarantee the security of Israel's northern borders and to silence the katyushas forever. -- Reactivation of the Syrian role in the region and giving Syria a larger regional role after most of the Egyptian cards have been exhausted. -- Removal of Syria from the terrorist list following Syrian-American talks to be held in Washington for this purpose, including a Syrian pledge to liquidate and silence the Palestinian factions opposing the peace process forever, renounce terrorism, restrict Hizballah movement, and liquidate the remnants of the Kurdish Workers Party revolutionaries in Syria. -- A clear and explicit Syrian declaration of its acceptance of full peace and full normalization and the establishment of normal relations with Israel. This will be followed by an Israeli recognition of Syrian sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Negotiations will then be held on the territory the Israelis will hand over to the Syrians in the Golan, along with security arrangements appropriate for the Israelis. -- Resumption of the next round of talks in Washington on 24 January, to be followed by a meeting between the U.S. secretary of state and the Syrian foreign minister. A U.S.-sponsored meeting between Peres and al-Shar' might be held to sign the agenda in the middle of next month. -- Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese border strip in accordance with the UN resolutions after obtaining a written Syrian commitment to guarantee the security of northern Israel and provide total security for total peace. These are the most important points that were kept secret about al-Asad-Clinton summit. The coming days may reveal more.
