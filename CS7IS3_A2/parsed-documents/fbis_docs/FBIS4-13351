FBIS4-13351 "drnes076_j_94007" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Iraqi Minister Holds News Conference Iraqi Minister Holds News Conference JN1604180094 Baghdad INA in Arabic 1635 GMT 16 Apr 94 JN1604180094 Baghdad INA Arabic BFN [Text] Sanaa, 16 Apr (INA) -- Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, minister of culture and information, has said Iraq has proven to the Security Council, by concrete evidence, that it has fulfilled Section C of Security Council Resolution 687. He stressed that the Security Council should now implement Paragraph 22 of the resolution by immediately lifting the unjust embargo imposed on Iraq. At a news conference in Sanaa today, attended by correspondents of Arab and foreign press and news agencies in Yemen, Hammadi said the UN Special Commission has been monitoring Iraq's weapons of mass destruction for over two years. Therefore, U.S. and British allegations that Iraq has not complied with the monitoring regime are baseless. The minister of culture and information also spoke about Iraq's calls for a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction, the last of which was President Saddam Husayn's speech on 2 April 1990. He stressed that the presence of weapons of mass destruction in the region is not in the interest of its peoples because of what these weapons cause in terms of terrorism and threats to peace and security in the region. The minister said Iraq's agreement to implement Section C of Security Council Resolution 687 is part of the general framework asserted by Paragraph 14 of the same resolution which calls on the Security Council to make the Middle East a region free of those weapons. Hamid Yusuf Hammadi said this demand reflects Iraq's policy that had been adopted long before the aggression. On the next Security Council review of the Iraq embargo, Hamid Yusuf Hammdi said after Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations, the Security Council is asked to fulfill its own obligations by lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq. He pointed out that Iraq's diplomatic drive is based on explaining facts objectively. This has convinced some major nations that Iraq has indeed fulfilled its obligations. He underlined, in this regard, the objective stance of France, Russia, and China and other countries during the recent Security Council session on the Iraq embargo. The minister of culture and information added that the position of these countries reflected their conviction that Iraq has indeed fulfilled its obligations and that the Security Council should now lift the embargo. He said the fact that the Security Council has not issued its traditional statement in its recent meeting is evidence that there is a split within the council between the majority, which supports lifting the embargo, and the U.S. and British minority. He said a considerable number of countries are now siding with Iraq and seek lifting the embargo and resuming economic relations with it. He said the Special Commission's procrastination by not fixing a date for starting the monitoring means there will be no specific date for lifting the embargo. Asked about the aim of his visit to Yemen, Hammadi said he communicated a message from President Saddam Husayn to his brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih outlining the Iraqi leadership's perspective on coordination with Arab and friendly nations to lift the sanctions decreed by the UN Security Council. The minister compared the starving and destructive impact of the sanctions to that of weapons of mass destruction. On the Kurdish issue, the minister said the U.S. Administration applies double standards in dealing with the Iraqi Kurds, citing the plight of Kurds in neighboring countries who are being killed every day. Hammadi dismissed as groundless Kuwait's claims that Iraq detains Kuwaiti prisoners. Iraq is not holding a single Kuwaiti, the minister emphasized. This issue has now been referred to the Arab League and Red Cross, said the minister. He noted that Iraq had proposed that a committee chaired by a Moroccan and including deputies from the Kuwaiti National Assembly and representatives of the Gulf Cooperation Council visit Iraq to pursue the case of the people Kuwait contends are missing. Hammadi said it was a distortion to link the sanctions to the issue of Kuwait. Section C of UN Security Council Resolution 687, he explained, shows the two are unrelated. Linkage is being promoted by the United States to keep the sanctions. Keeping the sanctions in place, he said, is causing considerable detriment to the economies of many countries. He cited the case of Turkey, which has sustained a $20 billion-loss in income due to its suspended trade with Iraq and the cutoff of Iraqi oil transiting Turkish territory. The minister disclosed that Iraq has access to valuable information related to the World Trade Center bombing in New York. Iraq stands ready to cooperate with the United States on the matter, preferably under the auspices of the American Congress, he indicated. On Iraq's effort to repair the damage wrought by the aggression, Hammadi said our success in rebuilding 80 percent of our facilities within the span of 11 months has thwarted the plans of the United States and its allies. Numerous countries, like France, have shown an interest in reestablishing commercial and diplomatic ties with Iraq, after they became convinced that Iraq has fulfilled the obligations stipulated by UN Security Council resolutions, said Hammadi.
