Spero, a top State Department official in charge of economic affairs, is likely to arrive in Japan before or around March 9, when U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher is also due in Japan, the official said. She is likely to hold talks with Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura, a top negotiator in the bilateral trade "framework" talks, he said. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton met on February 11 in Washington but failed to reach accord on the framework talks. Christopher is scheduled to visit Japan between March 9 and 11 on his three-nation Asia-Pacific trip. It is not yet clear whether Spero will accompany Christopher to Japan or will make the trip separately, the official said.
