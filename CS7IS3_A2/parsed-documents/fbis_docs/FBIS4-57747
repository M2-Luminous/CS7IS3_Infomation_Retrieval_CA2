Chapman, Jr. will be President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares' planning and economic policy minister. In exclusive statements to EL PANAMA AMERICA, Chapman explained what his first actions will be as planning minister. First he will "draw up a current account budget with work programs and investments that reflect the priorities of the new government. This is an essential instrument for governing, " he stressed. Law No.32 of 31 December 1993 established the State General Budget at 3.9034 billion balboas, 1.9286 billion balboas of which correspond to the central government's budget. "I believe the budget policy must be guided by the objective of generating savings in the current account -- in other words, more revenue than operational expenses -- so we can use the savings to finance the investment program," Chapman said. The central government's 1994 budget plans for 1.4158 billion balboas in current revenue and 512.8 million balboas in capital. Of these, 324.3 million balboas will come from external credits (IFI's [International Financial Institutions], credits, donations from governments and other institutions). Chapman admitted that the reality of this country and of all countries is that governments do not have the capacity to finance investment programs themselves. "If we want to undertake the ambitious investment program that the country requires, we need foreign financing. That is inevitable," he added. "From a basic standpoint, the country needs to draft its own economic plan that emphasizes national priorities based on the new government's viewpoint," he said. According to Chapman, "the economic program must serve as a guide for the implementation of subsequent budgets and for Panama's relations with the IFI." "My intention, and I have spoken about this in detail with the president-elect, is to invert the traditional relationship that Panama has had with the IFI. Throughout this relationship, we have responded to their initiatives rather than to our own," the economist added. The new economic plan will bear in mind the positive aspects of the current Strategy for the Modernization of the Economy. The economist indicated that "perhaps due to the political structure of the Endara government, it is an incomplete strategy. It lacks some key elements for improving the economy's productivity." "For a program to be successful domestically, it must be gradual and coordinated. This tells us that so-called shock treatments make no sense. I do not believe in that," the president of the Investigation and Development Company (INDESA) said. A third priority for the future planning minister "is to develop, simultaneously with the two previous priorities, a social action program organized on a scientific basis with clear national objectives. The main ills affecting Panamanians are unemployment and poverty. According to official figures, unemployment is at 14 percent and poverty and extreme poverty affects 50 percent of the country. According to Chapman, the initiatives to fight poverty must be directed at the poorest sectors while achieving economic growth. In the last four years, the Panamanian economy has registered growth rates of 3.4, 5, 8, and 5.9 percent. Nevertheless, this behavior is due to special situations related to the economic and political crisis of 1988 and 1989. The future planning minister said "this high growth will not be maintained." Nevertheless, the country is sustained by strong foreign exchange stemming from mature industries that are condemned to slow growth while others will disappear, such as the military bases. [sentence as published] "The objective of the economic plan is to achieve competitiveness to attract the foreign investments that have not come to Panama over the past 10 years. This will generate more jobs and improve purchasing power," Chapman said. Asked about the populist and producer-state theories promoted by the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) in the 1970's, Chapman said: "Only God and rocks do not change. Ideas and people change." Chapman indicated that privatization is not a panacea. If it is not done well, it could create serious problems. Privatization is justified when it produces social benefits or accomplishes objectives that could not be reached otherwise." A serious obstacle the new administration will face beginning 1 September is the servicing of the commercial debt, which in December 1993 reached $1,978,200,725, not including interest, which amounts to more than $1.2 billion. "This is a serious problem that must be handled carefully," Chapman said. Meanwhile, the negotiating team of the current administration is trying to reach an agreement that will benefit the country. The economist said educating Panamanians to meet today's demands is another priority task. "There is no reason why Panamanians cannot have the same productivity as the Japanese, Koreans, and Chileans." Chapman told EL PANAMA AMERICA that "there are great expectations in the private sector about the opening of specific opportunities for investment." "I am very optimistic about Panama's future, even though we have such serious problems as the commercial debt, poverty, and unemployment. I have accepted the post because I want those opportunities to materialize," Guillermo Chapman said.
