Peter Juhasz reports: [Juhasz] Not long after 2100, Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP], who was on his way home after his end of campaign mass rally in Miskolc, has been in an accident. Details are not known thus far. All I managed to find out a few minutes ago was that Gyula Horn's car crashed into a truck that did not have its lights on while passing on the No. 3 main trunk road between Nyekladhaza and Emoed. Three people were injured in the crash, including the party chairman. How and to what extent are not yet known. Anyway, preparations have already been made at the trauma department of the Miskolc Iron Works Hospital to receive the injured.
