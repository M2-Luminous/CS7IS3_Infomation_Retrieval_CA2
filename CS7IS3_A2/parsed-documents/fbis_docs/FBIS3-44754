To achieve success in the reform and building up of the people's air defense work, we must make great efforts to suit the need of the high technology war, the need of economic construction, and the need of urban construction. We should also make great efforts to enable the people's air defense facilities to truly play the dual functions of facilitating economic construction and social development in peacetime and facilitating air defense in wartime. In addition, we should put the people's air defense work in a due social position to ensure its long-range and steady development.
