Charles Redman, the special US envoy for ex-Yugoslavia, arrived in Sarajevo Friday to try to help efforts to reach an overall ceasefire agreement, a UN spokesman said. The 24-hour truce was to have started Thursday evening and cover all remaining battlefronts in Bosnia. But "there has been no real ceasefire in Gorazde, the shelling has continued," said UN spoksman Major Rob Annink Friday, as both Sarajevo radio and the TANJUG news agency in Belgrade reported new fighting there Friday. Redman immediately held talks with General Michael Rose, who was to meet again Friday with Bosnian and Serb military leaders to present them with a new ceasefire proposal, according to a UN spokesman who would not give any details on its contents. Rose spent Thursday trying to get the Bosnian and Serb generals, Rasim Delic and Ratko Mladic, to the negotiating table, notably to stop the Serb offensive around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia that has left 67 dead and 325 injured among the population in nine days. After shuttling back and forth between Sarajevo and Serb-controlled Lukavica, Rose had announced the two sides agreed in principle to a 24-hour cooling-off period that was to have started at 6:00 p.m. Thursday. But the truce was immediately violated and the sitaution in Gorazde "remains tense," according to the UN Protection Force which since Thursday has 13 military observers and liaison officers in Gorazde. Redman meanwhile was due to meet Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic later Friday, a Bosnian Government source said. The U.S. envoy would then head on to the Serb stronghold of Pale just west [as received] of Sarajevo before returning to Belgrade. Annink, the UN spokesman, said Friday that Serb forces were about five or six kilometers (three to four miles) from the center of Gorazde and were using smokescreens to camouflage their movements. [passage omitted] Annink, meanwhile, said that Serb forces had captures "less territory than we thought" around Gorazde and now controlled about five percent of the enclave, in its southeastern sector. He said they had penetrated an area about three kilometers (1.8 miles) deep and about 10 kilometers (six miles) wide into the enclave. This differed with a report, seen by journalists, by military observers in Gorazde dated last Tuesday saying the mainly Moslem Bosnian Army had lost 10 percent of the enclave and that the front line was only three kilometers from the center of Gorazde.
