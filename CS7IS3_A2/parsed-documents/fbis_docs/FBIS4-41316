All in all, 26 agreements were signed, providing for the development of Russo-American cooperation in various fields. In Washington, he said, agreements were signed that were essentially contracts that would help to support our industries that are currently in a difficult position. First and foremost, the prime minister noted, there is the space industry and the industries that back it up. Like the "Sakhalin-2" agreement, they mean the creation of many jobs and a solution to the financial problems. Beyond this, I am also keeping an eye on the social issues; in other words, we shall not let any agreements through unless there is provision in them for resolving social issues. Take the agreements in the field of ecology and power engineering -- here too the social sphere is discernible. Touching on his meeting with the U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed that during it a very good and positive assessment had been given of relations between the two countries. The ITAR-TASS correspondent asked to what extent the coming meeting in September between the Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton had been discussed during his stay in Washington. These matters, Viktor Chernomyrdin said, had been touched on, but a number of them can be decided only at presidential level and not at government level. In addition it needs to be seen how the agreements already signed will develop and be implemented.
