The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned about the contents of the message in the Black Sea fleet press center today. The officers voice their concern over allowance payments being two months in arrears, in view of increases in inflation. The document also draws attention to the fact that children of servicemen in the fleet cannot go to Ukraine's civilian higher education colleges, because they do not speak Ukrainian. The Coordinating Council is also concerned, the letter says, that the proposal by the officers' assemblies for the Black Sea fleet to be granted the status of the Russian Federation fleet has not yet been considered at the state level.
