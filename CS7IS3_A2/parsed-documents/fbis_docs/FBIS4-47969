FBIS4-47969 "drafr089_e_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-089 Daily Report 8 May 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Renewed Factional Fighting Reported Renewed Factional Fighting Reported AB0805194994 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 8 May 94 AB0805194994 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] The cease-fire in Liberia's ethnic conflict between two factions of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] has apparently failed to take hold. Frontline commanders of Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn soldiers and Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo forces signed a deal late on Friday [6 May] to cease hostilities and allow African peacekeepers to move into the battle area. But there seems to be some doubt about whether the signatories had the authority to agree to a cease-fire, and clashes have continued. Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report from Monrovia: Troops of the African peacekeeping force deployed along the Tubmanburg highway confirmed today that four fighters have been badly wounded there in renewed fighting. They said two fighters, one from the Krahn and one from the Mandingo side, were badly wounded, one with fragments of grenade in his right thigh, another with his wrist chopped off. They confirmed that units of the African peacekeeping force were prevented on Saturday from going into the area by the fighting. Frontline commanders of the opposing sides signed a cease-fire agreement on Friday and pledged to allow a free flow of traffic to all people residing in the area. They also pledged to give troops of the African force free passage in and out of western Liberia, which is controlled by ULIMO, which has for the past two months been beset by ethnic clashes. However, Thomas Ziah, a die-hard supporter of the Krahn faction leader Roosevelt Johnson, told me at his residence, with Johnson by his side, that Krahn frontline commanders who signed the agreement on Friday had done so without their authority. It seems likely that the current round of fighting will further narrow prospects to any breakthrough in talks on Monday between the two ULIMO faction leaders, Roosevelt Johnson and Alhaji Koromah.
