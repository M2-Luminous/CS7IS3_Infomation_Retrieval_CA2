This was confirmed by the series of meetings held by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and Ministers Ivan Kocarnik and Karel Dyba at the end of last week, during the international economic forum in the Swiss town of Crans-Montana. Economy Minister Karel Dyba described his exchange of views with Vietnamese representatives as very friendly. "Vietnam, which will obviously be the next `tiger' in Southeast Asia, with a market of almost 100 million inhabitants, is an enormously interesting country for all industrially advanced states. There is an uninterrupted flow of Taiwanese and Japanese businessmen who are making their way there. The Vietnamese officials emphasized our longstanding cooperation, and I had the feeling from our talks that they would be happy for it to continue," he told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. In reply to a question from HOSPODARSKE NOVINY on whether the Czech Republic has a chance of asserting itself there, in a situation where various advanced states are now investing heavily in his country, the secretary general of the Vietnamese Council for Foreign Trade, Nguyen Trung [name as published], said: "Absolutely certainly. Our economic relations have a good tradition, and the prospects for our cooperation, even after the recent turbulent years, are promising. Our two countries have distinct comparative advantages. We have a very cheap labor force, and your technology, because of its low cost compared with Western states, is capable of competing solidly. Together we can produce high quality products, and, given our lower overheads, we can assert ourselves well on world markets." Following his talks with his Croatian counterpart, Nikica Valentic, V. Klaus said that Croatia is immensely interested in expanding economic relations with the Czech Republic, especially in increasing the exchange of goods. "This country returns a number of positive results, which, irrespective of the state of war in the region, indicate that the situation there is consolidating," he added. Prime Minister Nikica Valentic expressed his conviction that this year's anticipated invasion of Czech tourists in Croatia will certainly have a favorable influence on the development of economic relations with the Czech Republic. Apropos his talks with Ukrainian Economy Minister Roman Shpek, Minister K. Dyba told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that they mainly discussed the possibilities for capitalizing our outstanding claims and for our entry into the privatization process in Ukraine. The Ukrainian representative promised to provide our government with a data base of the enterprises that are open as shareholding companies for the entry of foreign investors. "This could be an interesting offer for some of our large companies, although there are certain risks there that anyone interested in investing must weigh. There was obvious interest from the Ukrainian side," he stated. In an interview for HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Shpek expressed his hope that our economic and commercial relations will flourish and that their volume will increase. According to him, "it is true, obviously, of all countries transferring to a market economy that, during the first phase, they break off their economic relations with their former partners and strive to assert themselves on Western markets. We are also seeking good fortune in the West, but, even so, during the course of reform, we should take advantage of the fact that there used to be traditional cooperation between us on various levels, including the enterprise level, and we should base it on mutual advantageousness and productivity. Ukraine and the Czech Republic, for example, cooperated well in engineering and the metallurgical industry. Your technology for the consumer industry had a large market in our country. I think that words like `East' and `West' should not be decisive in trade; after all, the important thing is its advantageousness." Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus held meetings in Crans-Montana with leading representatives from some of the countries of the former Soviet Union--Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and Belarus. He said: "It is remarkable that these countries see a model for themselves in the reform path along which the Czech Republic is going. We even reached a firm agreement on sending to Moldova and Georgia a mission of our experts who will give advice there on the whole logic of the transformation process." He added that he received an official request for this from the Moldovan president and the Georgian prime minister. "I think it can only be in our interest to make use of it," said V. Klaus.
