Speaking at the ongoing session of the CPPCC National Committee, Li Yongchang, vice-chairman of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Jiu San Society, said that grain crops should account for 70 percent of the total acreage and at least for 65 percent so as to ensure growth of grain output. Zhu Xiangyuan, director of the Beijing Nutrition Research Institute, suggested that the government readjust the grain purchasing price, protect interests of grain farmers, support and adopt preferential tax policies for commodity grain counties. "It is of vital importance for China to maintain the per capita grain output at a high level while the population continues to increase," he said. Sun Han, vice-chairman of the CPPCC Jiangsu Provincial Committee, suggested that China accelerate establishment of community economic cooperatives in rural areas and finally set up a national network of economic cooperatives. Economically developed areas should organize specialized cooperatives to meet needs of a market economy. Some CPPCC members said that China should build up a grain supply guarantee system to stabilize grain prices. Zhu Xiangyuan proposed that the new system consist of three sectors: first, establishment of central and local grain reserve centers and risk funds; second, supervising grain prices throughout China, setting ceiling and bottom prices and stabilizing the prices with grain reserve or risk fund when fierce fluctuation occurs; and third, assigning relevant institutions to regulate grain supply with rational subsidies and rules.
