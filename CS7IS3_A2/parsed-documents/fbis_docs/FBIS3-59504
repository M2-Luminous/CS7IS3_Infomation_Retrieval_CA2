The SKD's activities are mainly in the field of facilities management (FM) and system integration. The deal had been under discussion for some time. It was felt as early as the end of August that the Sema Group would be the only remaining suitor. It appears that reasons of state were the only thing holding up the transaction, since the SKD was still under the control of the Swedish Government, which is involved in a privatization process. There was a year of negotiations during which Swedish authorities first rejected Cap Gemini Sogeti, whose vague impulses in the direction of external growth had a cooling effect on the government. Then they turned down the EDS, which did not provide sufficient guarantees that it would retain the SKD's existing structures. For the final six months, the Sema Group was the only company still in the running, and the Swedish Ministry of Finance eventually gave its approval. Besides its FM activities and its services as a consultant on system integration, which account for 57 percent and 29 percent respectively of the Swedish firm's turnover (1.126 billion kronor [as published; possibly ECU's intended] in 1992, or 7.96 billion francs), the Sema Group is also taking over the information services division (14 percent of turnover). Not to mention a customer list that includes such multinationals as ABB and Volvo and even the Swedish Government. As far as the French-British software house is concerned, a direct consequence of this operation is that FM will now account for over 20 percent of its turnover, compared to 15.5 percent previously. Based on the SKD's performance last year, that will increase the Sema Group's business by approximately 90 million pounds. Last year the Sema Group's turnover was 416 million pounds, or about 3.88 billion francs. The Swedish market for information services, which now becomes the Sema Group's third-largest geographic area after Great Britain and France, is dominated essentially by outsourcing and system integration. Those two sectors account for over half the turnover, which this year is estimated at 1.27 billion ECU's (about 8.4 billion francs), according to the Ovom market study firm, which is forecasting a growth rate of 10 percent until 1996. There will be no turning to the market or calling on stockholders to finance this transaction, whose "modest" cost is therefore being financed by the Sema Group directly. But an unanswered question is the fate of the remaining 25 percent of the SKD's stock, one notable owner of which is Transpac Scandinavia, an SKD subsidiary in which France Telecom has a 40 percent stake. This might be a good opportunity for the state-owned firm as part of its joint venture with the Sema Group.
