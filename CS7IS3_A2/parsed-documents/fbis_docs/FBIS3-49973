Popovic: "Three Candidates for Prime Minister"] [Excerpt] The new People's Assembly of Serbia will be inaugurated on Monday, 24 January. This will also mark the beginning of the process of electing the new republican government. As this date approaches, more and more candidates for this post are being mentioned. Those who consider themselves to be well informed say that there are three candidates for the head of the Serbian Government on 11 Nemanjina Street. Milomir Minic, secretary general of the SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia] and director general of a big Serbian firm, ZTP (Rail-Transportation Enterprise), stands a good chance to form a new government. Zoran Arandjelovic, chairman of the previous Serbian Assembly and deputy prime minister before that, does not have any fewer chances of becoming prime minister either. His chances are even greater if one bears in mind that he was the head of the SPS' election campaign team at the last elections -- the party that convincingly won more seats than any other party, 123. Milorad Vucelic, director general of the biggest and the most influential media in Serbia, the Radio and Television of Serbia, has recently been mentioned as the third candidate for prime minister. Regarding other people who were mentioned as candidates from time to time, it appears that they do not stand a chance at all to become the next prime minister of Serbia. [passage omitted]
