FR940128-2-00034 FR940128-2-00013 [Docket No. 931241&hyph;3341] National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology, Commerce. ACTION: Request for comments on need for establishing a laboratory accreditation program. SUMMARY: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has received a request to establish a laboratory accreditation program. In a letter dated September 16, 1993, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, Washington, DC requested that NIST establish an accreditation program for testing electric motors for energy efficiency (but not for safety). A copy of the request letter is set out as an appendix to this notice. Announcement of this request by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), and of the NIST request for comments with respect thereto, are being made under the procedures of the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) (15 CFR part 7, subpart B, ยง7.11(d)) of the referenced Procedures. DATES: Comments may be submitted on or before March 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Persons desiring to comment on the need for such an accreditation program are invited to submit their comments in writing within the 60 day period to Albert Tholen, Chief, National Voluntary Accreditation Program, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Building 411, room A162, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. Copies of comments received will be available for inspection and copying at the Department of Commerce Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, room 6020, Hoover Building, Washington, DC 20230. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lawrence Galowin, Deputy to Chief, Laboratory Accreditation Program, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Building 411, room A162, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Telephone (301) 975&hyph;4022, FAX (301) 926&hyph;2884. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Scope of Laboratory Accreditation The request letter called for accreditation of test laboratories based on standard test methods for performance of energy efficient electric motors for the proposed program. The accreditation program will assist the efforts of industry to meet the requirements of the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992 regarding electric motors. The test methods for accreditation discussed at NEMA and DoE meetings with industry will be for IEEE Standard 112 Test Method B, and NEMA Standards Publication MG1&hyph;1987, as set forth in the EPACT legislation and other standards when and if the Secretary (DoE) amends the test procedures. NVLAP Procedures have recently been modified to be fully in accord with ISO Guide 25 that extends ISO 9002 recognition; such criteria will beneficially impact on the qualified applicants granted accreditation if approval is made to proceed with the program. As a normal extension of support by NVLAP to other agencies the applicable requirements of DoE to be established under the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) would be made an integral part of the program for accreditation of laboratories. Procedure Following Receipt of Comments After the 60 days comment period, NIST will thoroughly evaluate all comments pertaining to the proposed accreditation program. Notification to all interested persons will be made by copy of a FR notice of the decision by the director of NIST regarding development of this program. Interested persons are the submitters of comments, or those requesting copy by placement on a NVLAP mailing distribution list. Approval of the program will call for technical assistance and input from interested and qualified parties and for comments to be made on the program handbook, test methods, and criteria applied in the program. NVLAP Procedures provide for public comment prior to final publication of the accreditation requirements. Dated: January 11, 1994. Arati Prabhakar, Director. Appendix September 16, 1993 Director, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 Dear Dr. Prabhakar: This letter is written on behalf of the Motor and Generator Section of NEMA to request that the National Institute of Standards and Technology establish a laboratory accreditation program (LAP) for electric motors through the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program. The purpose of the program will be to accredit testing laboratories to certify that standard test methods for product performance (and not safety) are properly followed in testing electric motors. Standard test methods and related performance standards will be those developed through such accredited standards-making organizations as NEMA and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. The development of a NVLAP program on energy efficient motors will be beneficial to industry in meeting the requirements of the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992 regarding electric motors. The EPACT requires that certain types and sizes of electric motors meet minimum efficiency standards and that a program be established to verify the efficiencies. A NVLAP program will assure that data used to verify motor efficiencies are measured in competent testing laboratories. The NVLAP program on energy efficient lighting, developed in response to a previous request by NEMA, will serve as a model for a program on electric motors. The NEMA Motor and Generator Section is willing to assist the National Institute of Standards and Technology in identifying and obtaining the necessary technical resources to establish the accreditation program. Please give this request your immediate attention. Sincerely, Frank Kitzantides, (Vice President, Engineering). Dated: January 24, 1994.
