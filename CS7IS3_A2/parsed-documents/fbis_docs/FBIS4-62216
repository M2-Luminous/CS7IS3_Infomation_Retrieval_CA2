Zhirinovskiy announced that at his meeting with Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin on May 12 he demanded that the interior and foreign policy of Russia be altered and the government's composition be changed. "Currently, the government consists of people who either did not participate in the December elections or failed at them," Zhirinovskiy pointed out. He added that Russia must be ruled by a winning party meaning the LDPR. "I said all this to Chernomyrdin. Now we only demand that representatives of our party be included in the government," he stated. Zhirinovskiy promised that as soon as he became president he would primarily eliminate the national republics in Russia, establish a East European union and order the power structures to fight crime within three months. He said Moscow could show how to tackle crime. Zhirinovskiy proposed that Moscow be made a closed city for a six-month period in order to get rid of all criminal groups. He believes that such measures could be carried out in other Russian cities as well so that criminals be forced from Russia to the Caucuses and Middle Asia. "After this we will close the borders and here is the problem of crime solved," he reassured. Zhirinovskiy suggested that Russia must take measures in order to lift sanctions against Iraq and Yugoslavia stating that they "need arms and we need food they could give to us." He stressed with regret that the present Russian foreign minister was working for the U.S.A. which was willing to make Russia a feeble country. Zhirinovskiy said young people needed an idol and urged students to make the author of the book "The Last Breakthrough to the South" (ie. Zhirinovskiy) their idol . He emphasized that rock was the means used by the West in order to make fools of young people. Zhirinovskiy called on the students to be against any revolutions, perestroykas and reforms since they did nothing but harm and were destroying the state. He found about 600 listeners among students of the Moscow State University.
