As could be expected in an early preelection phase, over one-third of the respondents have not made up their minds with respect to their voting ballot preferences at this time. It should be noted that only general sympathies have been polled, and every political power will have representatives in each electoral district. It is obvious that the personalities appearing on the ballots will play a major role. The results of the study also confirm a degree of inertia with respect to public opinion -- to a large extent, the positions held by the various political powers are similar to those in the Saeima election. It is true that the situation could be fundamentally changed by the creation of new political unions, and in particular -- on the basis of coalition formation, and, of course, by increased campaign activities. In any case, the results of this poll should only be considered as a first survey of public opinion, and the prediction of the possible election outcome on the basis of these is overly risky. A truer indication of this or some other outcome with respect to how the voters will express their sympathies can only come after the lists of candidates are published.
