PS Attacks on Rocard Noted The new element in the 20-year quarrel between Mitterrand and Rocard is Tapie, who has consistently benefited from presidential favors, Patrick Jarreau writes in the 29 April Paris daily LE MONDE. At the beginning of the month, Tapie was received at the presidential office, where polls on voting intentions are carefully analyzed. Socialist Party (PS) officials such as Jack Lang and Segolene Royal publicly stated that if Rocard's European Parliament list gets less than 23 percent of the vote, the former prime minister ought not to represent the Left in the presidential elections. According to a commentary by Agathe Logeart in the same issue of LE MONDE, this demand is likely to trouble Rocard, who had so far been content that the party which he took over about a year ago appeared "pacified," with the cantonal elections producing "rather encouraging" results for the party and with the PS Euroelections list "headache" over. However, Rocard "does not take into account the cactuses that spring up almost spontaneously on the path of the PS secretary general," Logeart commented. At Mitterrand's instigation, Rocard was prevented from attending the ceremony commemorating the death of former Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy after his widow publicly alleged that the party and its leaders abandoned her after turning their back on her late husband. Tapie, however, was at Mitterrand's side. In addition, PS luminary Catherine Lalumiere joined Tapie's list, probably after discussing it with Mitterrand, Logeart contends. Finally, on 27 April, a group of PS supporters of former secretary general Laurent Fabius issued a statement against the enlargement of the European Union (EU), which Rocard favors. While these incidents point to a "real attempt to destabilize Rocard and his team," the secretary general and his friends have thus far ignored the attacks, Logeart writes. More on Anti-Rocard Moves The anti-Rocard "destabilization" attempt "behind which one can see Mitterrand's hand" was also discussed in Jacques Patoz's article in the 29 April Paris daily LE OUOTIDIEN. Contending that the most dangerous attacks against Rocard come from fellow socialists, Patoz writes that it would be "naive" on Rocard's part to be surprised, since he knows that many in the party hold no affection for him. The Euroelections, Patoz continues, are only a pretext, the essential issue being that many Socialists cannot "resign" themselves to a Rocard presidency. They are therefore counting on a leftist defeat in the 12 June elections, with blame going to chief campaigner Rocard, who would lose his position as the PS' "natural candidate" for the presidency. This "underhanded" fight against Rocard is led by those who insist that the PS can gather more than 22 percent of the vote in the Euroelections, despite Socialist luminary Lionel Jospin's statement that anyone who thinks the PS can get more than 20 percent "either knows nothing or is dishonest." President Mitterrand himself is engaged in "barring the way" for his former prime minister by supporting Tapie, "a good way to succeed given that the Tapie list will obtain most of its support from the Socialist electorate," Patoz contends. Faced with Mitterrand's "resentment," he continues, Rocard is "defenseless," for he cannot accuse Mitterrand of attacking him. Mitterrand remains the "master of the game," Patoz concludes. In addition, "it is no secret" that EU Commission President Jacques Delors' supporters "ardently wish" for a PS defeat in June, which would allow them to provoke "more or less spontaneous" calls from the party's grassroots for a Delors presidential candidacy. Mitterrand Support For Tapie Viewed In an article in the 28 April-4 May Paris weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR, Francois Bazin discusses Tapie's rise in politics, which he terms the "Tapie mystery." Repeatedly questioned on his activities and expelled from the French soccer association, Tapie remains popular, Bazin maintains. A billionaire who uses "brutal" methods, he is encouraged by Mitterrand. Although a candidate of France's oldest party, he "cultivates the image of a political sniper." Bazin cites an unconcerned" Mitterrand replying to a former Socialist minister worried about eventual presidential support for Tapie that "there are multiple Lefts" and that "partisan rivalries are not his concern." Bazin interprets the president's reply to mean that, while Mitterrand has thus far not granted his "seal of approval" to any candidate, Tapie benefits from an "authorization to proceed." The president, he wrote, is experienced in the type of "furtive campaign where nothing is said but everything is suggested." Beyond some technical advice, the presidential contribution to Tapie's "new adventures" is to remind the party that Tapie "is not an intruder." By "opening the doors of the family," Mitterrand is saying that Tapie must not be "demonized" or become the victim of "ostracism," Bazin contends. Tapie is now implicated in an electoral adventure that serves Mitterrand's designs and opposes those of Rocard. However, Bazin argues, only the Euroelections will determine Tapie's real place in the Left--whether he will be a "shooting star," a "minor actor," or a "cumbersome ally." Tapie Personality Analyzed Laurent Joffrin comments on Tapie's personality in the 28 April-4 May LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. Tapie's real vocation, he writes, is that of an "actor or producer." Such professionals know that "taking a strong personality, good or bad, and confronting him with successive obstacles will lead him to quickly conquer the public's sympathies." Tapie's is a "marvelous scenario," Joffrin continues, which dovetails perfectly with the "concerns of Mitterrandian France." "In a country where elites are powerless to heal the main diseases of society, where justice is uncertain and scandals discredit the political class, where trade unions, parties, and parliament have been weakened, a handsome sniper benefits from an automatic bonus. In a country subjected, like all democracies, to the inexorable progression of individualism, the public figure who talks about his misfortunes, ostentatiously enjoys his wealth but returns blow for blow in adversity, who goes from euphoria to depression, confesses his anguish and spits out his disdain, is more alive than all the mannequins of the leading class. Of him the people will say: `He, at least, has lived.'" Of course, all this is "fake," Joffrin continues. Tapie's struggle against the powerful is "all eyewash" and his past as an entrepreneur is a "myth," since he sold most of his companies to turn a quick profit. According to Joffrin, Tapie, who has created nothing, saved nothing, solved nothing" is only interested in his own good for he "knows how to convince, seduce, and dupe by fascinating the simple-minded."
