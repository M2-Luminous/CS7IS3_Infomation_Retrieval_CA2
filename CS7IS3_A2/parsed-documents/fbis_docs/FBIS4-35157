The group of 17 former Nicaraguan "contras" who on Tuesday occupied the headquarters of the International Commission of Support and Verification of the OAS (CIAV-OAS) and six others who requested political asylum at the Colombian Embassy in this capital made that decision to protect their lives. Leonardo Zeledon, alias "Chispero," told ACAN-EFE that "we were forced to promote this action because after four years the CIAV-OAS has been the only organization that has tried to protect our lives." "Unfortunately, in four years the CIAV-OAS has been unable to guarantee our lives because the government does not establish conditions for that," added "Chispero," a crippled individual who directs the occupation from a wheelchair. "The North Americans armed us for war and later disarmed us for peace, but now that we are persecuted, jailed, and murdered and are jobless, nobody does anything for us," the crippled leader explained. "The United States must demand that our lives be respected," he insisted. "Chispero" asserted that clearly the former Nicaraguan Resistance "cannot offer more lives" and urged the U.S. Government to protect their lives. The Managua Government has remained silent on the CIAV-OAS occupation, although it was learned Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta talked over the telephone with CIAV Coordinator Sergio Camarena. Details of the conversation between the minister and the CIAV official are not known. The former contra leader, who during the civil war was personnel chief of the "San Jacinto" Task Force," one of the battalions of the defunct "contras," warned that the occupation is "peaceful but indefinite." "Before, the CIAV-OAS was a shadow protecting the demobilized, but now it only overshadows the dead," the crippled leader stated. "Chispero" said the government pledged to support the return of the demobilized to civilian life and it has not complied. He added it cannot guarantee recontras the means to support themselves with land to produce, work, and education. He admitted that the six demobilized individuals who sought refuge at the Colombian Embassy are part of a "struggle and liberty" plan that will be implemented day after day nationally, with progressive actions he did not detail. "Chispero" reported he is a member of the Nicaraguan Resistance Superior Council, which is also trying to unite all former "contra" trends and protect the demobilized. In addition, the Nicaraguan Resistance Superior Council follows up on the agreements the government has allegedly failed to comply with on the delivery of land, work, and education for the former contras' return to civilian productive, social, and political life. According to "Chispero," approximately 50 men who took up arms under Jose Angel Talavera, alias "Chacal," and who had demobilized, returned to the mountains in northern Nicaragua bearing their weapons to protect their lives. "The 184,000 families that the CIAV-OAS repatriated are not doing anything, and it is best that they be removed from here and sent wherever they want so they cannot be hunted down like dogs," said "Chispero" in one of the hallways of the CIAV-OAS headquarters. Meanwhile, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal called on the six former "contras" occupying the Colombian Embassy to leave that mission and "make use of legal procedures to demand their claims." "In our country there are no persons who are persecuted, nor will there be, for political reasons by the administration of Violeta Chamorro," the foreign minister declared. The facilities of the Embassies of Venezuela and Italy, the United Nations, as well as the cathedrals in Managua and Esteli, were also occupied weeks ago by groups of former Sandinist soldiers pressuring for solutions to their problems.
