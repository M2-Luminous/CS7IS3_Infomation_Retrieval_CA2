RIA has learnt these figures from Irshad Aliyev, chairman of the State Committee of Azerbaijan on Refugees and Forced Re-settlers, who is now attending the Moscow international conference on refugees on the territory of the former USSR. "There have never been calls in Baku to drive away Russians from our republic," stressed Irshad Aliyev. He referred to the problem of refugees and forced resettlers as "the most tragic consequence" of the 6-year-long war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. At the beginning of 1994, Azerbaijan registered over a million migrants, including more than 200,000 Azeris and Muslim Kurds evicted from Armenia. Refugees in Azerbaijan receive help not only from the Azeri Government but also from other countries, including Russia, as well as the UN, noted Irshad Aliyev.
