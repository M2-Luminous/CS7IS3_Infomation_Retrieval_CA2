(2) Remove the plastic bearing seal using a blunt scribe. (3) Using an inspection mirror, visually inspect the bearings for grease lubricant and any evidence of corrosion. Rotate the bearings and housing to reposition balls and race for complete inspection. For bearings found free of corrosion or defects, repack them with Exxon ANDOK&hyph;B grease or any MIL&hyph;G&hyph;18709A grease, and reinstall them in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. (b) Replace any unairworthy bearing with an airworthy bearing in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. (c) Before further flight, after the effective date of this AD, remove all upper and lower swashplate bearings having 1,200 hours' or more TIS, and replace them with airworthy bearings. For bearings with less than 1,200 hours' TIS on the effective date of this AD, replace the bearings on or before attaining 1,200 hours' TIS. (d) The owner may elect to install revised upper swashplate bearing housing, P/N 28&hyph;16108&hyph;2, and lower swashplate bearing housing, P/N 28&hyph;16361&hyph;1, that are equipped with grease fittings and integral bearing shields as described in The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Information Letter No. 0110, Revision B, dated March 18, 1993.
