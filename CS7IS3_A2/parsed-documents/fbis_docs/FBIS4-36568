The talks in Moscow would concentrate on the future in terms of bilateral cooperation regarding our attitudes towards international issues and what the two countries can do together in Asia and in the world. At the summit level the leaders will naturally not discuss minor matters of detail. Elaborating further, he said that it was very clear even before the actual break up of the erstwhile Soviet Union that our relationship with Russia would be qualitatively different. One of the major tasks of our diplomatic efforts accordingly was to establish friendly and cooperative relations with the Russian Government. Since the emergence of the Russian Federation and our recognition that it was a successor state of the erstwhile USSR, bilateral ties were undergoing a process of consolidation and adjustment to the new realities. In this phase, right upto the visit of President Boris Yeltsin to New Delhi, various political and economic issues and parameters of trade and commerce were defined. The next logical phase is to raise the relationship to a qualitatively new level.
