FR940203-1-00057 FR940203-1-00012 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Parts 2 and 68 [CC Docket No. 93&hyph;268, RM&hyph;7815, RM&hyph;6147; FCC 93&hyph;484] Connection of Customer-Provided Terminal Equipment to the Telephone Network agency: Federal Communications Commission. action: Proposed rules. summary: This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes to amend rules which regulate the terms and conditions under which customer-provided terminal equipment may be connected to the telephone network. The proceeding was initiated by petitions for rulemaking filed by Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (SWB) and Ameritech Operating Companies (Ameritech) who ask that regulations governing switched digital services be added. The effect of the proposed rules would be to promote rapid exploitation of switched digital technology. We propose also to provide for a registration revocation procedure which should greatly enhance our ability to enforce applicable rules as well as the Telecommunications Trade Act of 1988; and we take this opportunity to propose clarifications to other rules. dates: Comments were to be submitted on or before January 13, 1994, and replies by January 28, 1994; however, those dates have been extended to February 10, 1994 for comments and February 25, 1994 for replies. addresses: Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554, with copy to William H. von Alven, FCC, Mail Stop 1600B2, Washington, DC 20554. for further information contact: William H. von Alven, Domestic Services Branch, Domestic Facilities Division, Common Carrier Bureau, (202) 634&hyph;1833. supplementary information: This summarizes the NPRM in CC Docket 93&hyph;268, RM&hyph;7815, and RM&hyph;6147 (FCC 93&hyph;484) adopted October 22, 1993 and released November 22, 1993, supplemented by an Errata, and Order Extending Comment Period released January 12, 1994 (DA 94&hyph;46). Persons affected by part 68 practice and procedure are urged to review the full texts of both the NPRM and Errata, and the supporting file, which are available for inspection and copying during the weekday hours of 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the FCC Reference Center, room 239, 1919 M St., NW., Washington, DC. Copies may be purchased from the Commission's duplicating contractor, ITS, Inc., 2100 M St., NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800. Paperwork Reduction Act Reporting and recordkeeping activities needed to comply with the proposed rules are usual and customary. Analysis of Proceeding 1. By this NPRM we contemplate amending parts 2 and 68 of the rules, 47 CFR parts 2 and 68. A purpose of part 68 is to maintain uniform standards for the protection of the telephone network from harms caused by the connection of terminal equipment and associated wiring. This proceeding was initiated by two petitions for rulemaking, one filed by SWB (RM&hyph;7815) and the other by Ameritech (RM&hyph;6147). 2. SWB requests that part 68 be amended to include the regulation of terminal equipment connected to the two-wire Basic Rate Access (BRA) interface and to the Primary Rate Access (PRA) interface provided by Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) access technology. BRA consists of one or two 64 Kbps information channels with a 16 Kbps channel for dialing and network access information. The 1.544 Mbps PRA consists of 23 64 Kbps information channels and the 64 Kbps dialing and network access channel. ISDN is in a developmental phase, being deployed these last few years in an experimental mode. The Public Notice of SWB's petition elicited comments from eight parties and reply comments from three. There was overwhelming support for including this service in part 68 in order to promote, on a nationwide and worldwide basis, rapid exploitation of this technology with minimum mandatory criteria for connection of CPE (customer premises equipment). Thus, we propose for comment technical standards for including this service in part 68 in supplement to the existing standards for non-switched leased-line digital services which were added in 1985. 3. Commenting on SWB's petition, AT&T recommends (a) that part 68 rules covering PRA not be limited to the two-wire ISDN BRA service but also authorize terminal equipment connected to the 4-wire ISDN PRA (1.544 Mbps) interface pursuant to performance and compatibility standards adopted by ANSI (American National Standards Institute); (b) that amendments to part 68 provide equipment specifications for both PRA and BRA interfaces; (c) that ยง68.308(h)(2) be amended to apply its limitations on encoded analog content to PRA terminal equipment comparable to the limitations suggested by SWB for BRA terminal equipment; and (d) that the signaling interference requirements in ยง68.314(d)(2) apply also to ISDN terminal equipment. The rules we present for comment reflect those recommendations. 4. AT&T observes also that SWB's petition would add a new ยง68.310(m) to introduce a ``longitudinal-to-metallic'' (L&hyph;M) balance requirement for equipment connected to the ISDN interface. AT&T notes that the L&hyph;M balance concept was rejected by the Commission in previous rulemakings in favor of the ``metallic-to-longitudinal'' (M&hyph;L) balance methodology currently in the rules. The L&hyph;M methodology is considered to be a performance measure which is not a primary concern of part 68, whereas the M&hyph;L balance requirement squarely addresses crosstalk interference that terminal equipment may induce in cables running to the central office, which is a harm to the network and thus within part 68's purview. Thus, we propose adding to part 68 limitations on encoded analog content for equipment connected to the ISDN interface.
