As he told INTERFAX on Thursday, the talks between the Russian prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, held in Moscow recently "cannot be qualified as useless." "The premiers and the two delegations did a lot of work and resolved virtually all the questions relating to the implementation of instructions issued by the presidents of Russia and Ukraine on April 15. A resolution has been drafted. There are only a few elements that need to be additionally studied and settled," he said. The diplomat refrained from divulging the essence of the "elements that still need to be settled" and the agreements already reached. "We agreed with our Ukrainian partners that none of us will reveal the details of our future accords or allow `leakages'," he said. Nevertheless Dubinin said that only a few issues remain to be settled. 10 to 12 days were allotted for this, he confirmed. "We hope that after that an agreement will be signed," he noted. According to Dubinin, the proposed agreement will be signed by the two countries' prime ministers. "This might take place in Moscow. After all the site of the next meeting is not of paramount importance," he said. When asked whether the latest frictions between Ukraine and the Crimea were under discussion in Moscow, Dubinin said: "I heard not a single word about those problems."
