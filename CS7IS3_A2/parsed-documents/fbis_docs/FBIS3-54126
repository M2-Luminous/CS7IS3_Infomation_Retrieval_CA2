At present, both these tasks are performed by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops. No one thinks the United States should send divisions to defend us on the Golan, because that would be against the whole Zionist ethos which speaks of national Jewish revival and of a Jewish rather than an alien force defending the Jewish state. Second, the idea that U.S. soldiers should be deployed in intelligence positions on the Golan is also inapplicable, because the Golan case differs from the Sinai. By handing the forewarning function over to the Americans, we would be creating unnecessary tension and severely trying the U.S.-Israeli relationship needlessly. [Golan] You do not entirely trust the Americans in this matter? [Netanyahu] On the contrary, I have great regard for the United States' amity, and I appreciate its willingness to assist Israel, but I do not want to put the United States to tough tests such as that which faced its troops in Beirut, where they were attacked by terrorists, or what is happening to the U.S. troops in Somalia. I see no need or reason for U.S. soldiers to defend Israel.
