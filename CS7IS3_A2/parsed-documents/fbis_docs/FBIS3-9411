FBIS3-9411 "dreeu057_s_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-057 Document Type:Daily Report 24 Mar 1994 SLOVENIA Ministry Allegedly Planned To Bug MLADINA AU2403104994 AU2403104994 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Ljubljana MLADINA in Slovene in its 22 March edition publishes several articles about the work of the military intelligence service VOMO -- the Defense Ministry Security Organ -- and the alleged overstepping of its authority. On pages 2 and 3 the weekly publishes a report by Miha Dj. Stamcar and Jani Sever, which also includes photographs of Defense Ministry documents that support the claims made in the article. Even though the authors do not specify the manner in which they obtained the two documents, they claim that the documents are "originals, according to our research," and allegedly "connected to Operation Ljubljana, which the Defense Ministry initiated because of an increasing number of politicians and media in Slovenia who were pointing out the irregularities in the Defense Ministry, VOMO, and the special brigade Moris. However, the leadership of the Defense Ministry did not like this. In the opinion of the Defense Ministry these people should be supervised and information should be collected about them in order to act more effectively against them." MLADINA continues: "It seems that VOMO was not directly engaged in this activity, but only its section connected to the special brigade Moris. The core of this parallel organization, which won the nickname `Paravomo,' consists of former and present operatives in individual elite combat units under the leadership of Jansa's most faithful men from the time of the formation of the maneuver structure. Beside this, there is supposedly also a higher level of informers, which is mostly comprised of the minister's friends and sympathizers from all over Slovenia. In Operation Ljubljana, however, it was mostly the operatives who took part in it and who were subsequently joined by experts for telephone and other types of bugging and private detective agencies." The article adds that "some information implies that the Slovene police already have proof about the buggings and surveillance" but doubt a speedy and smooth investigation of the case because, "as the well-informed sources claim, the VOMO supposedly holds information about some dubious business allegedly involving the police which it could use for blackmail." The first document entitled "Report No. 2/1" is typed on a paper bearing the heading of the Defense Ministry and dated 16 June 1993. It is labeled State Secret, signed by Darko Njavro "for the special brigade Moris" and addressed "personally" to Mr. Andrej Lovsin, former VOMO chief, who resigned in January 1994. The document generally summarizes the results of the observation of persons suspected of being involved in illegal arms deals, but in the fourth paragraph says: "It is evident from the reports of my informers that public opinion, thanks primarily to MLADINA reporters, is very negative toward the employees of the Defense Ministry and the minister himself. Because of this the minister is demanding control over the media, as it was agreed at the last meeting. I request the approval of the technical means for the realization of this task." The second document of 16 October 1993, also labeled State Secret, signed by Darko Njavro and addressed to Andrej Lovsin personally, reports on purchase of arms in Villach and their transport. The last sentence of the article says: "I request the approval for the telephone bugging of the following numbers: 325-982, 321-954, 318-981 and 329-669" which according to MLADINA's footnote are all telephone numbers of MLADINA's editorial office.
