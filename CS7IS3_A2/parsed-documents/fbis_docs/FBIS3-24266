However, it has not been refined what specifically they propose to regulate. Is it the entire economy or just certain sectors and groups of commodities? Which specific methods do they propose to use to this end? As the experience of past years testifies, state regulation of the operation of monopoly enterprises has turned out to be inefficient. Hopes for privatization have been dashed. Sectoral lobbies have again reconstituted monopoly enterprises behind the facade of various joint-stock companies. It is necessary to influence this process by civilized methods rather than by a straightforward fight by the state against such enterprises. The developers of the draft Law "On Natural and State Monopolies" from the Antimonopoly Committee and the Russian Privatization Center of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property are convinced of this. Within several days the federal government of the Russian Federation will review the draft of this law. Last week it already gained approval at a conference of the Ministry of the Economy. In a word, the government has made the first attempt to restrict state regulation of enterprises to a legal framework. The objective of legal provisions in the draft law is to strike a balance between the interests of consumers and monopoly producers, as well as to standardize relations between sectoral committees and enterprises. The latter may make it possible to reduce the influence of subjective factors on economic policy as a whole. At the request of a DELOVOY MIR commentator, Natalya Tsukanova, economic expert of the Russian Privatization Center, State Committee on the Administration of State Property, and one of the authors of the draft law, comments on it. In any economy there are spheres in which the setting of prices by the market is not optimal. Natural monopolies, i.e., sectors in which the development of competition is impossible or ineffective, are the foremost of such areas. The task of the state with regard to a small number of these sectors is not to put an end to monopoly operations but rather to provide conditions for the regulation of their operation on a permanent basis. What are natural monopolies? These are sectors or spheres of operation of which two main features are characteristic. First, the manufacturing of products in such sectors is more effective in an environment of absence of competition. This is associated with the fact that, due to certain technological peculiarities, production in these sectors exhibits a substantial reduction in specific cost as the volume of production grows. This is, as a rule, a result of considerable economies on the scale of production and high fixed costs which makes monopoly production more effective. Pipeline transportation, water supply systems, and railroads are among such sectors. Indeed, it does not occur to anyone to build two sets of water mains or two sewer systems. Fixed costs entailed by building such structures are so high that a parallel system which performs the same functions would hardly pay for itself. The more people who use one and the same water supply system, the lower the outlays are for serving each one of them. In the same way, the more people travel by railway, the lower the outlays on carrying one passenger by rail. Second, the demand for products or services generated by natural monopoly entities is less dependent on changes in prices than the demand for other types of products (services), because products (services) generated by natural monopoly entities cannot be replaced with other goods to be consumed. The products in question meet the most significant needs of the population or are irreplaceable for other industries. Such products include, for example, electricity, telephone communication services, and railway transportation. Let us assume that an increase in car prices forces many consumers to give up the purchase of their own cars and to use public transit or, at least, postpone the purchase, whereas even a significant increase in the price of electricity will hardly bring about discontinuation of its use--we are not used to living without light; besides, refrigerators, TV sets, and washing machines are operated in many apartments. It is quite difficult to substitute for the consumption of electricity. Under the circumstances, an enterprise generating such products (services), that is, a "natural monopoly," gets an opportunity to set prices well above the actual cost of production. This is precisely why in all countries "natural monopoly" enterprises are either owned by the state or regulated by the state on a permanent basis. As a rule, "natural monopolies" are regulated by special independent agencies whose operation is governed by relevant legislative acts. For example, telephone communications enterprises are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, by the Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL) in Great Britain, and by the Canadian Television and Telecommunications Commission in Canada. What methods are used to regulate natural monopolies? Since natural monopoly entities have an opportunity to dictate their prices to customers, as well as to deny services to them, the regulatory organs obligate the natural monopoly entities to supply the goods produced by them to certain groups of consumers and resort to price regulation methods, i.e., they specify the level and structure of prices for groups of consumers or the profit margin, and control the structure and composition of costs. Since natural monopoly entities may try to overstate their actual costs by allocating too much funding to develop their main line of production, as well as to develop the manufacturing of products for which prices are not regulated, the regulatory organs approve investment plans with a view to developing the production of natural monopoly goods, authorize the natural monopoly entities to issue stock and bonds and to attract borrowed funds, and also authorize investment to develop the production of goods on which there is no monopoly. Finally, effective regulation is only possible on the condition that complete and authentic information is available to the regulatory organs. For this reason, the natural monopoly entities have the obligation to provide information on financial and production operations in a format developed by the regulatory organ and inform consumers about changes in prices for products. The regulatory organs approve rules for accounting and statistical reporting. Such careful control over natural monopolies is due to the fact that a conflict is unavoidable in this area between the interests of "natural monopoly" producers and consumers, with the market mechanism being "inadequate" to resolve it. This is precisely why the need emerges for an "arbiter," or an independent regulatory organ which, having taken into account the interests and information provided by both parties, makes decisions on the basis of a professional expert review. Therefore, the natural monopolies amount to the areas of operation in which the attention of the state should indeed be focused on the development of a regulatory system using methods that are unacceptable in other sectors, in particular, the regulation of prices. As we see it, it is precisely the direction on which to concentrate the efforts to create a system of active state regulation that is adequate in a market environment. In the process of the application of specific regulatory methods (the setting of maximum profit margins or prices, the consideration of the issue of a merger between a natural monopoly entity and another enterprise, and so on), the organs which it is proposed to charge with regulating the natural monopolies must take into account information and views of all interested parties, that is, the natural monopoly entities, the Russian Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures and its territorial administrations, consumers, sectoral ministries, and other organs of power and government. The regulatory organs must inform the public through the mass media about their decisions with regard to the methods used to regulate the operation of natural monopoly entities, as well as about specific indicators and requirements for the natural monopoly entities. At the same time, the law grants considerable independence and freedom to the regulatory organs. They do not report to any state structure and make their decisions on the basis of a professional expert review of the situation in a sector. If a regulatory organ exceeds its authority or fails to perform the functions assigned to it, the natural monopoly entities, consumers (personally or through a public organization of consumers), as well as the Committee for Antimonopoly Policy, may appeal to the Court of Arbitration, which may cancel the unlawful decision.
