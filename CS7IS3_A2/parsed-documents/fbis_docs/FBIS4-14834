President Geydar Aliyev, I have received your letter of 14 January 1994. You focused significant attention on bilateral relations and the perspectives and opportunities for cooperation between our two countries in various fields to benefit our peoples. Our people have been bound together by historic and cultural ties, which have helped [words indistinct] flourish. Egypt contributes toward the effort made to establish a just and durable peace in the Middle East. It also contributes to the effort made to establish peace in the Caucasus. We regard as our guidelines the principles that the occupation of territories through the use of force is inadmissible, that territorial integrity must be respected, and that international relations must be maintained in a peaceful way and in accordance with the UN Charter's principles and objectives. Egypt has closely followed the dispute in Daghlyk Karabakh. It has condemned the occupation of Azerbaijan's territory through the use of force and called for the complete withdrawal of Armenia's occupying forces. Egypt has outlined on various platforms that it approves of the international effort aimed at ending the dispute and supports the CSCE Minsk Group's initiatives, which are in line with the UN Security Council resolutions. Egypt hopes that the destructive war will end and financial resources will be channeled toward maintaining the effort to realize economic reform. That complies with the region's interests. Mr. President, I am truly very happy to have been invited to visit Azerbaijan. I am pleased to invite you to visit Egypt. The date of the visit will be established through diplomatic channels. I conclude by wishing progress and happiness to Azerbaijan's peaceful people. I also wish you sound health and happiness.
