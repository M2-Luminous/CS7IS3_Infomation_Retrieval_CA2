FBIS4-30169 "dreas122_c_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-122 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 North Korea KCNA Denounces `Suppression' of Residents KCNA Denounces `Suppression' of Residents SK2306054794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0506 GMT 23 Jun 94 SK2306054794 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Sinister Intention To Suppress Chongnyon"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Minister of Justice, Hiroshi Nakai, at a meeting on June 21 issued "an order" to keep a closer watch on the movements of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), saying "this is demanded by the situation" surrounding the "nuclear issue" of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, according to a media report from Tokyo. Shigetaki Ogata, general director of the public security investigation agency, told the meeting "it is necessary to take more perfect measures for the investigation into the movements of Chongnyon than ever before." Their remarks fully revealed the criminal intention of the Japanese reactionaries to intensify the on-going suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan on a wholesale scale under the command of the authorities. The Japanese authorities' suppression of Chongnyon, an authoritative organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK, and Japan-resident Koreans is the worst violation of human rights, an illegal political crackdown and a typical model of the national chauvinist crimes. The Korean people can hardly repress bitter national resentment at Japan, which occupied Korea for nearly half a century and imposed immeasurable misfortunes and sufferings on the Korean people and is now continuing to persecute those taken to Japan forcibly from Korea and their descendants, instead of repenting of its past crimes through generations. It is only too clear that the suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan is part of the premeditated and deliberate anti- DPRK moves launched by the Japanese authorities, availing themselves of the U.S. scheme to isolate and stifle the DPRK under the pretext of its "nuclear issue." Such a wholesale suppression and the preparation of legislative arrangements for the establishment of a wartime system such as the "emergency security law" in Japan, which is designed to stage a comeback to Korea, indicate that "sanctions" against the DPRK by the Japanese reactionaries have reached a practical stage. If they dare take "sanctions" against the DPRK, ignoring our repeated warnings, they will meet a severe punishment. They must clearly see our determination and promptly stop the suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.
