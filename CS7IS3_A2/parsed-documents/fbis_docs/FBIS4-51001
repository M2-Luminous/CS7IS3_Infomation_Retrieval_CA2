Tang, who led a four-man group here Saturday, said that the main purpose of his trip was to learn more about Grumman, meet its suppliers, introduce the aviation and space development projects in Taiwan, and seek technology transfers from Grumman. Tang said that he met with two Grumman suppliers in Long Island in the afternoon. The two suppliers showed keen interest in proposed cooperation between Taiwan and Grumman. Tang and his group will meet again with Grumman officials Tuesday. Taiwan is reportedly most concerned about getting technology transfers from the company if any deals are made. They are also working to allow Taiwan companies to sell parts and components to Grumman. Tang and his group will travel to California later this week before going home in early June.
