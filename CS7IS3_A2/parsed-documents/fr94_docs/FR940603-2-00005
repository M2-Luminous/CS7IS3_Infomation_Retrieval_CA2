FR940603-2-00005 FR940603-2-00004 Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: 1995 Census Test &hyph; Prelist. Form Number(s): DG&hyph;101A, DG&hyph;101B, DG&hyph;169. Agency Approval Number: None. Type of Request: New collection. Burden: 1,340 hours. Number of Respondents: 52,000. Avg Hours Per Response: 1.5 minutes. Needs and Uses: The Census Bureau is planning to test various methods for address list compilation and update in conjunction with the 1995 Census Test. The Census Bureau uses two primary methods to create and update its address files: precanvass and prelist. In the urban test areas, the Census Bureau will create a Master Address File (MAF) by extracting addresses from the Census Bureau's 1990 Address Control File (ACF) and updating the extract using the United States Postal Service Delivery Sequence File. Then the Census Bureau will update the address list during the precanvass operation. For the rural test sites, the Census Bureau will create an address file through a prelist operation; the address list will be used in the subsequent update/leave operation to deliver the census questionnaires. During prelist, census enumerators canvass an area and list all housing units within the assigned area. The prelist operation is designed to identify and collect complete physical location address, mailing address, and name of householder for all living quarters. This will enable an enumerator to return to the living quarters to update the address and to deliver a questionnaire during the update/leave operation. It will also provide the information needed to conduct the local government review of the census address list. Affected Public: Individuals or households. Frequency: One&hyph;time only. Respondent's Obligation: Mandatory. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313. Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Edward Michals, DOC Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482&hyph;3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230. Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information collection should be sent to Maria Gonzalez, OMB Desk Officer, room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Dated: May 27, 1994. Edward Michals, Departmental Forms Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Organization.
