The statement was signed by 256 of the 441 members of the 19 district boards, including the chairmen of 18 district boards. The signatories said in the statement, "we sincerely ask the governor to take back his political bill already tabled to the Legislative Council so that the Sino-British talks can be resumed." As a result of the termination of the Sino-British talks, they said, the membership of the three-tier councils can not straddle 1997. "This would harm Hong Kong's stable transition and the smooth transfer of power in 1997, we are deeply concerned about that," they said. "For the sake of stability and prosperity of Hong Kong in the future," the DB members said, "we hope for an early resumption of Sino-British talks to reach an agreement." The origin of the statement is to be presented to Governor Chris Patten, while its copies will be submitted to Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his British counterpart Douglas Richard HUrd as well as other Chinese and British officials concerned.
