During the audience his majesty expressed again to the ambassador his profound sentiments and condemnation of the terrible massacre which was committed by the criminals at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque [in Hebron]. He reaffirmed to the ambassador that this massacre, despite its ugliness and severity, will be an incentive for the international community to understand more the sufferings of the Palestinian people, and for the awareness of the international community of the need for the withdrawal of the Israeli forces [from the occupied territories] as soon as possible, as these painful events have shown beyond any shadow of a doubt that the fanatics have no regard for the sanctity of God's houses which are holy places for both Muslims and Jews. His majesty the king has graciously decided to adopt the families of the martyrs of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque -- widows, and orphans -- and reaffirmed that the Moroccan Kingdom will undertake to meet the needs of these widows and look after their children and ensure that they will receive their education until they become of age. In view of the aggravation of these events his majesty the king phoned the Palestinian president [Yasir 'Arafat] to exchange views regarding the steps which ought to be taken to confront these situations and their consequences. He expressed to him the royal will to look after the families of the martyrs -- widows and orphans -- as a gesture of sympathy toward them and to share their grief. The ambassador expressed to his majesty the gratitude and thanks of the Palestinian people and officials for the wise counsel which his majesty continues to provide for the Palestinian issue, and for his majesty's continuous attention for Holy Jerusalem and the righteous strugglers. He implored God Almighty to keep His Majesty as a strong support for his homeland and nation. [passage omitted]
