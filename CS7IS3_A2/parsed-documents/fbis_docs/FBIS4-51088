The number of deputies who were supposed to attend the meeting was 448; 36 requested a leave of absence due to sickness or other reasons. The number of attending deputies was 362, enough to qualify for a quorum. Attending the meeting as observers were the secretary general of the autonomous regional people's government; deputy secretaries general of the autonomous regional people's congress standing committee; comrades in charge of various autonomous regional departments, bureaus, commissions, institutions of higher learning, Tibet-based offices from other inland provinces and municipalities, and units under the party Central Committee; and comrades in charge of various prefectures, cities, and counties. Voting with a show of hands at the meeting, the deputies adopted a resolution on the government work report. After careful deliberation, the meeting held: With joint efforts of governments at various levels, Tibet remarkably accelerated its pace of reform and opening up in 1993. Tibet has further developed its economy, has further enhanced its political stability, has further fostered unity among nationalities, and has accomplished new achievements in various construction projects. The meeting urged: Governments at various levels should earnestly study socialist market economic theories, liberate the mind, change their functions, improve workstyles, comprehensively perform practical work, immerse themselves among the masses, industriously and practically administer their work, and handle and carry out concrete tasks. They should conscientiously implement and enforce laws and regulations; administer their work according to law; and continually improve their capability and competence to lead the drive for reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. The meeting urged: Rallying around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, Tibet's people of various nationalities should closely unite. Under the leadership of the regional party committee, we should be of one heart and one mind; be united and forge ahead; greet the autonomous regional 30th founding anniversary with outstanding accomplishments; work hard; and wage arduous struggles to facilitate a healthy, rapid, and sustained development [jian kang kuai su chi xu fa zhan] of Tibet's economy and bring about all-round social progress. The meeting also unanimously adopted a resolution on the implementation of Tibet's economic and social development plans in 1993 and on the plans of Tibet's economic and social development in 1994; adopted a resolution on Tibet's final financial accounts in 1993 and on Tibet's budget in 1994; adopted a resolution on a Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress Standing Committee work report; adopted a resolution on an autonomous regional higher people's court work report; and adopted a resolution on an autonomous regional people's procuratorate work report. Raidi, executive chairman of the session and chairman of the autonomous regional people's congress, delivered an important speech at the meeting. He said: The Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress has strictly stressed the central topics regarding stability, reform, and development; has paid close attention to the overall situation of seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, enhancing development, and maintaining stability; and has fully promoted the spirit of democracy, unity, motivational atmosphere, and realism [min zhu tuan jie gu jin qiu shi]. All the deputies have liberated their minds, sought truth from facts, freely expressed their views, pooled the masses' wisdom, and earnestly deliberated and adopted a government work report delivered by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu and various other items of the session's agenda. The meeting has further specified the guiding ideologies, basic guiding principles, and major missions for us to perform Tibet's work in 1994. Comrade Raidi pointed out: The key to implementing the session's guidelines is to correctly handle relations among stability, reform, and development. While maintaining stability, we should strive to enhance reform and development; and should, in turn, promote social stability with enhanced reform and development. Stability is the prerequisite, reform is the driving force, and development is the foundation. All three are supplementary and complimentary to one another. We definitely cannot pay more attention to one while neglecting the others. He said: The year 1994 is crucial for Tibet to conduct comprehensive reform, to advance forward in an all-around manner, to make major breakthroughs in certain aspects, and to accelerate its pace of establishing a socialist market economy. We should unwaveringly uphold the basic line of one central task and two basic points, earnestly implement various session resolutions, seize favorable opportunities, deepen reform, accelerate development, and maintain stability. At present, Tibet has political stability, stable popular support, social stability, unity among nationalities, and a solid border defense. However, many unstable factors still exist. Particularly, domestic and foreign splittist elements have ganged up with international hostile forces. They are intensifying, in every possible way, their splittist and sabotaging activities. We must thoroughly launch antisplittist struggles; must sternly crack down on various splittist activities; and must make vigorous efforts to safeguard the motherland's unification, to strengthen unity among nationalities, to protect Tibet's political stability, and to ensure smooth progress in Tibet's economic construction, reform, and opening up. Raidi pointed out: At present, the principal tasks for people's congresses at various levels in Tibet are to earnestly implement the session's guidelines, to take into account Tibet's realities while continually keeping close contacts with the realities of life and conducting investigations and studies, to rally efforts to establish a socialist market economy, to develop Tibet's economy, to launch antisplittist struggles, to maintain political stability, to strengthen legislative work, to publicize general legal knowledge, to upgrade law-enforcement, to further improve the system of people's congress, and to fully protect the democratic rights of people who are masters of their own affairs and destiny. Leading cadres at various levels must further improve their understanding, change their workstyles, and perform realistic tasks. Comrade Raidi eventually expressed his hope: After returning to their respective posts, all the deputies should continually publicize the session's guidelines; implement the session's resolutions; and accomplish new results in enhancing reform, opening up, economic construction, social stability, democracy, and the legal system in Tibet. At 1640 [0840 GMT], the Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress closed victoriously amidst the rousing national anthem.
