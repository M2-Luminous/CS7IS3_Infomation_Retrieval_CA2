Our foreign minister told the deputies that a program was already being worked on by a joint working party of the Defense and Foreign Affairs Ministries. National Defense Minister Kolodziejdzyk emphasized that sending a Polish mission to NATO Headquarters was a matter of urgency. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Koziol] Does the Defense Ministry have the money to send a mission to NATO headquarters? [Kolodziejdzyk] Right now we do not. Right now we do not have money for anything because the budget has not been adopted. Of course, we are going to look for it because we cannot completely put this initiative aside. Well, we are going to look for reserves, perhaps cut something back from training, perhaps call up fewer soldiers for military service. There are no good solutions here, but we have to have a sense of vision as to what is right now the most important thing for Poland's security and what can be left to one side for another five minutes. We have to talk about actually entering NATO structures, about actual presence, participation in exercises, in missions, in symposia, in meetings. Unfortunately this cannot be done without money. That today is our great problem. [Koziol] The Polish Government has to prepare a document.... [Kolodziejdzyk, interrupting] A presentation document, that is what it is called. [Koziol] So, could you tell me, today we heard that there are no dates set for this. So how do you, Minister, see this in real terms? When should this (?happen)? [Kolodziejdzyk] Well, I see this in very real terms. I would not like this government in which I participate to make any spectacular, hurried, badly prepared moves. We said today that the government still has to work on this document, consult with the Sejm National Defense Commission about it, discuss it among ourselves, calmly, and with full awareness of how much this is going to cost, whether can we afford it, and so on. So, rushing things here would not be a good idea. I think that in March we will be ready for talks with NATO HQ, for the so-called bilateral negotiations from which it will transpire how we are going to move along the road, not so much toward partnership but toward security structures. [end recording] [Announcer] Journalists asked both ministers to comment on yesterday's WASHINGTON POST report that, in the 1980's, Poland allegedly sold weapons to the United States for $2 million. According to Minister Kolodziejdzyk, these reports are fiction. [Begin Kolodziejdzyk recording] THE WASHINGTON POST, using its outstanding journalism, has written an article that smacks of a horror story. Why doesn't our press summon up enough courage to ponder and analyze what the purpose could be of publishing such phenomenal, even fantasy, stories? So far, the Pentagon has refused to comment on these facts. I see no reason to rush ahead of the Pentagon right now because, after all, it is their work, and they are also a suspect, seeing as allegedly, all in all, it was two parties who were involved in this underhand dealing. [end recording] [Announcer] Minister Olechowski would not give an unambiguous reply. [Begin Olechowski recording] It says--if it is true, of course, because I have no reason to maintain that it either is or is not--that, over several years, several million dollars' worth of equipment was sold, and no one knows what the bottom line was, how much of this went toward some sort of bribes or middlemen, well, I do not know, they must have been selling braces because it seems that it was very cheap equipment, so, perhaps in general it was a very good move because perhaps Polish weapon components were being sold. [sentence as heard] I do not know. For me this is such a mystery that, until I have read about it and learned something, I am not going to know. [end recording]
