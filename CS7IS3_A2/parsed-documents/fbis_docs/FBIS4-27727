During the signing ceremony, which was attended by visiting Turkmenistan President Saparmurad Niyazov, Indonesia's coordinating Minister for Political Affairs and Security Susilo Sudarman and Indonesia's Ambassador to CIS countries Rachmat Witular, the chamber of commerce and industry from both countries also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to encourage economic relations between their entrepreneurs. In his welcoming speech, President Niyazov said that the MOU and the trade contract constitute the basis for closer bilateral economic cooperation as well as an official framework for business activities conducted by the two countries' entrepreneurs. He also said that Indonesia may find it attractive to invest in the raw material processing industry now being developed in Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan, he explained, has oil deposits of some 13 trillion cubic metres but huge investments are needed for processing and transportation. Niyazov also hoped that cooperation might be established with Indonesia in developing a textile industry in view of Turkmenistan's annual production of one million tons of cotton and Indonesia's established textile industry. In the meantime, general chairman of Indonesia's Chamber of Commerce and Industry Aburizal Bakrie said that the newly signed MOU will provide opportunities to Indonesia's and Turkmenistan's businessmen to develop opportunities in trade, industry and investment. President Director of PT Prima Comexindo Hashim S. Jojohadikusumo meanwhile said that bilateral economic relations have great potential given that, at 511 thousand tons annually, Indonesia is the world's largest cotton importer. According to Jojohadikusumo, in addition to textiles, cooperation in investment and trade between Indonesia and Turkmenistan could also be established in cement, oil and gas. He added that Indonesia will likely export frying oil, tea, aircrafts and railway coaches to Turkmenistan.
