The Cuban diplomat said the matter is an internal affair and that his government agrees with the Mexican Government's efforts to find a peaceful solution in the region along the Guatemalan border. Commenting on the 1 January operations of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), Fernandez de Cossio said armed conflict and many other means used to solve problems are not the ultimate solution. He said the factors that necessitate such actions do not seem to be present in Mexico, where there is open dialogue. Regarding certain accusations made by interested parties stating that Cuba was supplying weapons to the Chiapas rebels, the ambassador said they were mere fabrications of ill-intentioned people. "They want to create turbulence in relations between Mexico and Cuba," Fernandez de Cossio said. "For a long time now, those relations have been founded on total respect for the principle of nonintervention." Speaking of the meeting between President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the head of the local diplomatic community said that the president "seemed to be in control of the situation, well-informed, calm, and determined that negotiations and dialogue will lead the way to a solution." The Cuban ambassador added that his country is highly concerned about the problem in southeastern Mexico. "We are reassured in knowing that the Mexican Government has taken steps to find a peaceful solution to this internal conflict. Mexico's friends must leave Mexicans to solve their own problems within a framework of peace and lawfulness," he stated.
