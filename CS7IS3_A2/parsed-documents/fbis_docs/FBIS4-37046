FBIS4-37046 "drnes116_r_94003" FBIS-NES-94-116 Daily Report 12 Jun 1994 India BJP Reaffirms Economic Development Policy BJP Reaffirms Economic Development Policy BK1606082594 Delhi INDIAN EXPRESS in English 12 Jun 94 p 6 BK1606082594 Delhi INDIAN EXPRESS English BFN [Text] Baroda -- The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has reaffirmed that the swadeshi [national] approach to development is the bedrock of its economic policy, rejecting what the party has called the Rao-Manmohan Singh model. The economic resolution adopted by BJP's national council on Saturday demanded that the present economic policy be replaced with a swadeshi model based on Mahatma Gandhi's Ram Rajya and Deen Dayal Upadhya's Integral Humanism. The resolution was moved by Satish Agarwal, former Union Minister of State for Finance and a member of BJP's economic cell, and seconded by the party general secretary M. Venkaia Naidu. Concerned over the sugar muddle which hit the country recently, BJP demanded the resignation of Union Minister of State for Food Kalpanath Rai and expeditious completion of the enquiry by Public Accounts Committee into the scandal. At Baroda, BJP took special care to see that the confusion prevailing inside and outside the party over the swadeshi approach was clarified once and for all to set at rest all speculation about the party being divided on the GATT versus swadeshi issue. The party had failed to put these issues in the right perspective at the Hyderabad national executive less than three months ago. Party leaders had no hesitation in admitting that their failure to clarify the concept of swadeshi had led to confusion among the rank and file. That was sought to be corrected as BJP president L. K. Advani put it in his speech. Swadeshi is not merely an issue of goods produced in India versus foreign goods. It was an all-embracing philosophy which has "civilisational, political and economic dimensions, " he said. The economic policy pursued by Congress which was contrary to the spirit of swadeshi in effect meant "wholesale and shameless capitulation before foreign vested interests, the lowest point of which was the signing of the GATT treaty at Marrakesh," the economic resolution noted. The Rao-Manmohan Singh model of development was based on three legs: Fiscal stabilisation, economic re-structuring, foreign investment and globalisation. BJP felt the government had placed "misplaced faith" in foreign investment and globalisation as a "panacea for all our ills." BJP accused the government of subserving the needs of foreign vested interests in order to attract foreign investment. The government had made "shoddy compromises" affecting economic sovereignty and security interests of the country in relentless pursuit of globalisation. The resolution clarified that the BJP was not against the entry of foreign capital and technology in hi-tech areas. But it cautioned that even here it should not be to the exclusion of Indian companies. The net result of Rao Government's economic policy was that prices of essential commodities had risen by 50 per cent in the last three years, unemployment was on the rise, there was stagnation in agriculture and recession in industrial growth, the country had fallen into a debt trap and corruption and scandals had become the order of the day. The resolution said the performance of the government on the economic front was "dismal".
