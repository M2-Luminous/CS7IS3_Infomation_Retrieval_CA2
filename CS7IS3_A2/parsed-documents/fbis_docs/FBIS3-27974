The Musan mining complex, a leading production base of iron headings, has lifted production to a high mark in February after topping the January plan. The complex hit the January target of iron headings three days ahead of schedule. In the period, it removed overburden more than double the amount in the same period toward the end of last year and secured 1.2 million more tons of crude ore. The Tokchon district coal mining complex surpassed the first day's quota by far entering the new month. The complex overfulfilled the plan for last month 2.4 percent in capital tunelling, 20.9 percent in preparatory tunelling and 1.2 percent in coal production. The Sunchon district coal mining complex, the Pyongyang thermal power complex, the Nakwon machine complex, the combined general bureau of shoemaking industry and the Korea silk association are boosting production from the first day of February after surpassing their January targets. The Pyongyang silk mill topped the January plan for silk yarn 50 percent, strongly backing the silk textile producers in increasing production.
