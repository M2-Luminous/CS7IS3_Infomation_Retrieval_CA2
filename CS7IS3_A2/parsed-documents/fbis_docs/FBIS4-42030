Semenov by correspondent O. Sigacheva; place and date not given: "...Is Not Moscow on Our Side? The Sevastopol-Russia Common Economic Space Is Already Taking Shape"] [Text] At the time of Moscow's May Day anniversary festivities Moscow City Hall allocated for the social needs of Sevastopol a tidy sum--R500 million. This was the result of a trip to the Russian capital by V. Semenov, chairman of the city council. The polemic over this fact continues. Some people consider the Russian money a gift (handout) for the Ukrainian city, others, an important event in the history of Sevastopol and the start of the real integration of the capital of the Russian fleet in Russia. [Sigacheva] Viktor Mikhaylovich, who is right? And how, generally, did this idea arise? [Semenov] Life itself dictates the need to create a common union of Slav states since the latter-day sovereign borders run primarily through the fate of ordinary people. I began to think that the prototype of a future common economic space and the first component of revival could be a union of hero-cities for they are located only in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The idea of a union of hero-cities arose at public organization level last year, and an executive committee of the union headed by Admiral A. Kalinin, former commander of the Black Sea Fleet, was created. But I wanted to expand the framework of military-patriotic education and to raise the concord to a higher, practical level. My proposal concerning the organization of economic ties found a response with A. Sobchak, mayor of St. Petersburg, when, in January, I was there for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the city. I negotiated on economic collaboration specifically with Krasnogvardeyskiy Rayon, which has "defense" enterprises related to ours. E. Shatberger, first deputy chief of the rayon administration, and his deputy, A. Kushchak (a native Sevastopolian, incidentally), have already been to Sevastopol to conclude a more specific agreement. Moscow Mayor Yu. Luzhkov came on 23 February, visited the cruiser Moskva, and "blessed" the laying of the foundation stone of a home for families of the crew, and we had a chance to talk only in the Officers' House, in the interval at the concert. He liked the idea, and I received an invitation to Moscow for future negotiations. [Sigacheva] But you did not go immediately.... [Semenov] What can you do if Sevastopol has become the most "political" city in the CIS: 20 planning sessions, and there was, in addition, a special, emergency, session in connection with the aggravated economic situation. It was this that commissioned me to meet with the Russian and Ukrainian leadership. Whereas last year the immense budget deficit was closed within the framework of the stabilization program, this time L. Kravchuk was unable to say anything reassuring, and when the conversation came around to the funding of the fleet, he said, approximately: This is your problem, go to Moscow, and resolve it there.... It was this "instruction" together with the decision of the session and Luzhkov's invitation that compelled my trip to Moscow. [Sigacheva] As a suppliant? [Semenov] No. The main purpose was to show at all levels (in the State Duma, the Federation Council, and the presidential structures) the need for the partial funding of the infrastructure and social sphere of city. Some 35,500 of our inhabitants are the families of servicemen, and the families of workers and employees of naval enterprises constitute more than 75,000--this is just under one-fourth of the population of the city. I had attempted to raise this matter last year during my hour-long interview with B. Yeltsin, but the Mukhalatka accords on the division of the Black Sea Fleet were all the rage at that time, and Boris Nikolayevich believed that economic matters should be decided simultaneously with political matters. But time was on our side, and the Massandra Protocol was signed, and a consensus of the branches of power had, in addition, begun to emerge in Russia. And I decided to initiate a decision on the question of the inclusion of the funding of Sevastopol in the Russian budget. [Sigacheva] The president agreed with you on this occasion? [Semenov] On the basis of my letter containing calculations he wrote out a resolution: "To Chernomyrdin, Shumeyko, Rybkin. I request consideration of Semenov's appeal in the work on the 1994 budget." This showed once again that Russia is being true to the protocol of the Massandra meeting. [Sigacheva] You met with the same understanding among other Russian leaders also? [Semenov] And what I remember particularly is that all of them, despite the pressure of work, were able to find the time for a comprehensive conversation. The Federal Assembly was at that time considering the important question of the Russian procurator general, and in the break (from 1400 to 1600 hours) Vladimir Filippovich Shumeyko, snatching a bite to eat literally on the run, spent the whole of the rest of the time talking with me. The conversation with Ivan Petrovich Rybkin was held immediately following a sitting of the Duma. And at what time do you think I met with Konstantin Fedorovich Zatulin? At nine in the evening, immediately following his return from Sochi from negotiations with Ardzinba. I also met with important entrepreneurs and enterprise leaders, and I had a useful conversation (it is already bearing fruit) with the chairman of the board of directors of a Russian bank. [Sigacheva] You did not forget about Luzhkov? [Semenov] It was hardest of all for him to find the time, and we met almost on the eve of my departure, late in the evening. He issued a command to his deputies immediately, evidently, because it turned out the next day that many questions had already been decided: concerning prescription drugs, textbooks in Russian, gifts for war veterans (and there are in Sevastopol 8,500 who took part in the defense and liberation of the city alone). In the afternoon a session of the Moscow government decided to allocate Sevastopol those same R500 million. In addition, at my request Luzhkov gave instructions for the preparation of a directive that Sevastopolians coming to Moscow not be required to register as "foreigners" and that they pay in the hotels the same as Russian citizens. I negotiated on specific economic cooperation with V. Shantsev, leader of a prefecture of the Yuzhnyy Administrative District. This district has many "defense" enterprises and the ZIL, Dinamo, and Ilich plant giants (an assassination attempt on the leader of the revolution was made at the last named). As we were driving past this plant, I remembered familiar words from the school history textbook: "We will go another way." And thought: In our time this "other way" can only be that of direct, interbusiness ties--at enterprise level--and the creation of joint works without a backward glance at both the republic and local authorities. It would then be immaterial whether this leader or the other remained in office--an agreement would not lapse with his departure. And the strengthening ties would afford people an opportunity to live better--as they deserve. Many candidates for mayor of Sevastopol have now taken up the idea of a union of Slav states. Viktor Mikhaylovich Semenov is already doing everything to ensure that the formation of a common economic space already begins....
