Special Services Reach Agreement"] [Text] The Russian president's Security Service and the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] signed an agreement on cooperation 20 April. To all appearances, the agreement is a provisional measure. Cooperation between Russian secret services has always been based on oral agreements between "cloak and dagger knights," which has often caused conflicts over trifles. Despite all reorganizations, the FCS, which was proclaimed the legal successor to the Russian Security Ministry, still has the most extensive logistic base, which any former KGB department would be eager to use. As a matter of fact, the FCS budget includes money for logistic support, medical service, and training for all other special services. First of all, the Security Service and the FCS agreed to cooperate and to exchange information on terrorism "instigated and carried out by foreign special services" and "aimed against the Russian Federation president and the state's security." And also on "unconventional forms of operations...by foreign special services" (the conventional forms include recruitment and technical intelligence, while the unconventional ones are exemplified by the hullabaloo over "red mercury"). To this end, the Security Service and the FCS undertook certain obligations. The FCS will help the presidential security service to screen those suspected of conspiring to carry out terrorist acts and to organize certain operational-technical (bugging, hidden video filming) and operational-search measures. In addition, the FCS will take part in the search for "means of technical penetration into Security Service facilities" and help the Security Service train its personnel in its educational and training institutions. The Security Service will be able to use the FCS library and computerized data bases free of charge. The Security Service's obligations are much more modest -- first of all it must inform the FCS about persons who are reported to harbor "criminal intentions." A separate paragraph stipulates that when receiving compromising information about any FCS member the Security Service is obliged to pass this information to Lubyanka. The FCS, however, does not have to hand over to the Security Service information about presidential bodyguards suspected of committing a crime, because the Chekists deal with corrupt officials ex officio. The agreement is not limited in time, but any of the contracting parties may abrogate it by sending a written notice. This confirms that the creation of a community of Russian special services under the president's aegis is still possible. For the time being, however, the special services prefer to conclude agreements between themselves. A week ago, the FCS signed a similar agreement on cooperation with the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service.
