Today we are going to talk about the embezzlement and theft of agricultural products in Havana Province. Eloy, I recently read a commentary you had written in the TRABAJADORES newspaper in which you talked about this topic, and you pointed out some interesting facts. You said that approximately 30 percent of Havana Province's agricultural production was stolen or embezzled. I am thinking of last year's production and that must be equivalent to 1 quintal of agricultural products per citizen in Havana City. That means that the average four-person family did not receive approximately 400 pounds per capita. That is for a four-person family nucleus. Most likely, many of them had to buy these products from these same thieves and unscrupulous speculators on the black market and at the black market prices. If to this we add the fact that last year approximately 1 million people from Havana participated in agricultural tasks in Havana, we can say that they have stolen twice from us, because besides stealing the product that corresponds to us they stole the work we did. Eloy, I would like to hear your opinion on this matter. [Concepcion] Yes, this is a situation that besides being caused through theft is caused through embezzlement and misappropriation. It is a spider web and a complex network that has a present effect, which affects the people and the country's economy. It has a future effect in that it creates an atmosphere of social indiscipline, it undermines values that correspond to our society and, therefore, it has a double negative effect. With regard to agriculture and the problems of theft, embezzlement, and misappropriation of agricultural products in Havana, we reached a point at which we needed to stop it dead in its tracks -- to use words that are understandable. We had to take measures that were a bit drastic and which have not been accepted by the perpetrators of those crimes or by those who allowed or have been allowing these immoral acts to happen. In contrast, from information I have gathered during visits I made in the last few days, there is general acceptance among the population in the two provinces: in Havana and Havana City. [Santana] Nevertheless, you pointed out in your report that for some irresponsible and undisciplined people the measures taken have been bothersome. [Concepcion] Yes, logically. What was happening here was the following -- let me see if I can paint a picture for you so that the listeners can understand where the problem lies. The problem begins with the lack of control and demand by the administrative leaders of the enterprises. Some of these have been accustomed to being very generous with state resources. There is a key element here -- and later on I will talk more about the theft of products -- which is an exchange between enterprises and organizations from Havana Province and Havana City Province, which has created the philosophy of you scratch my back and I will scratch yours. In other words, one enterprise has welding rods and other resources that the agricultural enterprise, the farm, or the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] lacks. In exchange for these products that belong to the state which are diverted from the capital to that enterprise, that enterprise, which produces tubers and vegetables, gives this enterprise, which provided those resources, agricultural products. [Santana] Eloy, you were talking about a very interesting subject, the small-time peddler relationship among companies, a relationship which basically is that policy of you scratch my back and I will scratch yours. I think this emerged some time ago during those big meetings among businessmen in Havana Province and in Havana City. This is a sort of a barter, a sort of liberty adopted by some directors, which if they did this for their companies' benefit, they would be more efficient, but by doing this they are only showing that they are small-time peddlers [mercachifles], and not businessmen, and much less socialist businessmen. [Concepcion] Yes, and you know that over the past few years there has been a process of change in the treatment of man. All companies and organizations have been worried -- and they are right -- about giving better service to their workers in their cafeterias, and I think they have been classified as quality cafeterias, and there are organizations which are examples nationwide. But we must say the following: Most of these organizations and companies from the capital and nationwide have been given some self-consumption plots. And many of the self-consumption ploys of those organizations are a bit abandoned. What happens is that one organization or company asks another agricultural company to provide a truck load of tubers for its cafeterias -- and this is good -- but in practice what is happening is that the truck load of tubers is not used just to feed the workers, but many of those products are sent elsewhere to feed the pigs, because it is easier to raise pigs than to produce vegetables and tubers in those self-consumption plots they have, it is easier than working, I would say. [Santana] Is this the embezzlement you were talking about? [Concepcion] Yes. Then they give better service to the workers at the cost of others. That is, you will probably find cafeterias giving good service but when you eat there you will realize that what is consumed there is not produced by that company or organization. So, good service is given to the men at the cost of other workers who produce, or at the cost of a product that should have been sent to the people and was not sent because of that unauthorized appropriation. [Santana] I think this is very interesting because people always talk about theft, and those who steal or swipe those agricultural products are always condemned. But you are mentioning something new that has not yet been publicly mentioned, or at least I have not heard it yet. This is an interesting element because state companies obviously have an influence on the fact that not enough food is reaching the neighborhood markets. Of course the worker is happy when in his cafeteria he can receive all those products, but of course the businessmen and the people who are involved in this type of embezzlement must be punished and sentenced severely. [Concepcion] The problem is that we have developed a bad habit, and we have had this bad habit not only during the revolutionary process but long before that, when people used to violate the country's rules and laws. There are rules about what companies, what organizations, and what cafeterias should receive these products on a priority basis, but through the established channels, that is, through the official channels. But what happens is that this has become a regular practice, that everyone is going to the fields to look for products for their cafeterias, and they do this together. Thus, a false relationship of partnership and friendship has been created -- a false concept of interentrepreneurial or interorganizational relations that violates the government-established regulations -- and therefore rules must be established. [Santana] The people will undoubtedly agree -- the workers in charge of production who see this type of misappropriation which Eloi mentioned. You were going to speak of theft. I believe this is also something very important and irritating. [Concepcion] Yes. That is a situation we had and still have in certain cases in Havana and towns of the two provinces, as well as nationwide. I do not want to limit it to Havana. This is a national problem, not a problem of Havana City and Havana Province alone. It is annoying not being able to get a product in your local market, for example plantains, garlic, or agricultural products in general, and have a neighbor sell it to you at elevated prices -- a head of garlic for eight pesos, etc. This exhausts the resources of the people who have to endure this problem. The state and government have the responsibility of stopping this dead in its tracks, to take measures which might seem drastic but are nothing more than what is necessary to put an end to the romp and social indiscipline that has been corrupting en masse the people who directly or indirectly had no choice but to participate in it due to the situation we are experiencing. There are people who, logically, disagree with these measures. When you can establish order, those who prefer disorder are not pleased. Certain organizations and enterprises which were involved in this romp do not support the measures. This is also the case with transportation drivers who have directly or indirectly participated in this romp. Therefore, the blatant theft....[pauses] There is the case of the 4,000 heads of garlic on (Moscovits) cars in Matanzas, as a matter of the fact, one of the actions taken was the confiscation of those cars. This was creating an unbearable situation, and the people have been demanding that drastic measures be taken to put an end to it. This does not mean that this is going to solve the problem. These measures are being taken because in the next two months at least 3 million quintals of potatoes and other crops will be harvested in Havana Province. The goal of these measures during these two months is to avoid and halt the theft and ensure that the products reach the people and the cold storage facilities and that the truck does not drive around leaving sacks of products on the way, stealing and supporting a black market that is impoverishing the people. The state has the responsibility to take whatever measures are needed to solve this. [Santana] I believe that we also have to stress that there cannot be extremes because we usually either fall short or overshoot the mark. We have to avoid extremes with relatives or friends of farmers returning home, not because they went to buy from the farmer, and bring back home a small amount of agricultural goods. [Concepcion] The problem does not lie with the bicycle riders or friends who go to the farm to get a bag of products. This is not a problem of small bags or bicycle riders. Many of them might be involved in this as a business, but these measures are not for these people. There might be certain injustices as is logical. These measures are aimed at the agricultural profiteers who have inundated Havana with products in an undertaking which is already an unbearable problem. [Concepcion] They do this on a large scale. I believe that what you say is true. This is not aimed at people getting a bag of products. It is aimed at large-scale profiteers.
