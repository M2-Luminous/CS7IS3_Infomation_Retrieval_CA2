[Berlusconi] I will tell you right away: The government acted immediately to gather all the information it needs to judge what happened and to report to Parliament. So much for the immediate, technical level. But I perceive a certain tendency toward the old game of buck passing and of artificial polemics. I will tell you equally frankly that these are matters that do not concern us and to which we, as a government, refuse to attach any importance. [LA STAMPA] But the impact on public opinion does have an undeniable influence, and you will agree that this influence is important. [Berlusconi] That is very true. Indeed, I would like to tell the public that, while we are not concerned with polemics, results for the benefit of the community are this government's prime objective. So I will say that dragnet of the 'Ndrangheta in the North is a specific fact and provides reassurance about the law and order forces' capacity to act, which is something about which I have no doubts, moreover. [LA STAMPA] Not even after such a brazen act? [Berlusconi] The fact is that there are a couple of things that need to be analyzed and understood properly, dispassionately. We must discover how it is possible for someone who turned state's evidence to go walkabout, as happened with Santino Di Matteo, and also how it is possible for a commando of experts to arm themselves and to draw up such a skilful plan to enter a prison and achieve their purpose. [LA STAMPA] These are the very questions that everyone is asking.... [Berlusconi] I can assure you that my government wants to secure precise answers and to act accordingly. This is our method. [LA STAMPA] Prime Minister, you have nurtured your image as a winner, and you have won in the European elections too. But it seemed more like a plebiscite than a victory. Of course you are pleased. But can you also see the overwhelming nature of the Forza Italia phenomenon? [Berlusconi] Plebiscite? Pardon me, but your question rests entirely on this word, which suggests inappropriate parallels. There was no plebiscite here; people were not asked to vote "yes" or "no." If I may say so, it was a much broader choice, because it was in fact carried out in accordance with the old method, the proportional one. [LA STAMPA] Very well, not a plebiscite, but a massive shift in the vote. Did you expect it? [Berlusconi] I am reassured by the fact that, with the proportional system, the government commands the support of the absolute majority of voters. So above all, it was a political victory for the government. Did I expect it? No, frankly, I did not expect it. [LA STAMPA] What do you think was the reason for it? People experience great crushes and tend to throng round a leader.... [Berlusconi] No, I do not think so. I am very thoroughly acquainted with the voters' wishes and aspirations. They acted clearly, with a very acute political awareness. They saw that there is a government, they have witnessed some pigeon shooting which could turn into obstacles to the government, and issued a vote which means: We want the government to govern. Pigeon shooting is a disappointing sport; it does not fire people's enthusiasm. [LA STAMPA] Your answer prompts me to ask right away whether the clarification that you requested from [League Secretary] Bossi will be a sharp one. But first I would like to know why progovernment voters rewarded your movement in particular. [Berlusconi] I think the basic factor is an investment of confidence in us, a placing of trust which is not at all unconditional. I think that people like calm but still resolute language. A style of government which consists of producing achievements. Our declaration of war on all that is tangled, devious, and complex, and our ability to conduct this operation of simplification without in the least impoverishing the significance of the social battle. You see, I am convinced that Forza Italia succeeded in communicating this attitude successfully, and it is partly because of these characteristics that it was not established as a party but takes the form of a government class, the promise of a government of the institutions. The Italian people are very well aware that this is a strong and credible proposal, after the period of the parties' invasion of the apparatuses. And that is the reason for the vote and for its dimension. [LA STAMPA] You are either very clever or very modest to talk always about a collective and reassuring plurality. But if it was not a plebiscite, let us say that it was a referendum, and that you personally were the subject of that referendum... [Berlusconi] Pardon me, but if it was not a plebiscite, I must tell you that it was not a referendum either. Would you like me to conceal the fact that I am pleased? Of course, I am pleased with my results. I was a candidate, and people voted for me generously, for which I am grateful to the voters, but this success has nothing to do with any referendum. Decisions about a single individual happen when the voters grant their support directly to the prime minister. If and when this happens in Italy, it will be possible to talk in terms of a personal result. Sunday [12 June] was a reward for a leadership and a program. As for my personal responsibility, I am fully aware of it. [LA STAMPA] Since they were European elections, here is a European question: Where will you sit in that Parliament? With the Liberals, as [Foreign] Minister Martino would like, or with the popular group, as you say you would prefer? [Berlusconi] Giscard d'Estaing -- and nobody could deny that he is both a liberal and a democrat -- has joined the European People's Group. God willing, there are no barriers in Strasbourg, or they are less rigid, less bound to ideological roots. I believe that Italian liberalism is historically fragile because it did not come together with liberal Catholicism. As you are well aware, if Sturzo and Giolitti had come together, our country would have been spared splits which proved to be of the most lamentable kind. Be that as it may, the Forza Italia movement has deep roots in the Catholic world, which I personally intend to cultivate -- an increasingly open world, often comprising different languages and cultures, a world in which major problems of our time are clearly perceived -- issues so close to [Pope] John Paul II's heart, such as the family, the imbalance between wealthy countries and poor countries, and a freedom that can be true to itself without losing contact with human and social solidarity. [LA STAMPA] In other words, you will join the popular group in Strasbourg. What about in Italy? Let us discuss the current feelings that prevail between you and the League or, rather, Bossi. For instance, in Milan your movement has swept away the League. How do you explain this reversal? [Berlusconi] I explain it by the fact that the inhabitants of Lombardy and Milan have been searching for years for someone who can represent their problems in the spirit of their own feelings, traditions, and history. And at times they have done so in an excited manner. Now I think they decided to reward values that are closer to their own approach -- an attitude of calmness, seriousness, rigorousness, sobriety, which is characteristic of the people of Lombardy, as well as us. And we are also accustomed to entirely rejecting rough brawls. I think this is the explanation. [LA STAMPA] Your answer was very calm and balanced, but the result was basically a sharp defeat for Bossi by Berlusconi. You are devouring the League's representatives one by one. I would like to ask you whether you intend to occupy their political space too. [Berlusconi] Listen, nobody is devouring anyone here. I do not devour anyone, and it is enough to consider the National Alliance's result to realize that. Of course, I was struck by the citizen who greeted me and said, now you are worth a Bossi and a half, referring to the results. But these are mere anecdotes. I have no resentment toward Umberto Bossi, who is still railing every day against "that fellow there," though he never explains who it is. So I merely hope that he manages to evade the temptation of neurosis, instability, and self-consumption. [LA STAMPA] Prime Minister, would try to answer me honestly: Are you urging the League to replace Bossi? [Berlusconi] I do not concern myself with other people's leaders. This too is my custom, my style. [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] Mr. Occhetto publicly acknowledged this, when he thanked me the day he resigned. [LA STAMPA] Let us consider it from another angle: As early as last Sunday you mentioned the possibility of another election. Is this not a threat to the League? [Berlusconi] Look, it is the chief of state who decides on elections, while a coalition's future is determined by its progress. Obviously the European elections prompt us to proceed even more vigorously. And now we must see whether or not we are obstructed. By obstructions, of course, I am referring not to the exercise of the opposition's rights, but to filibustering. We shall see what happens, and we will draw the necessary conclusions on that basis. [LA STAMPA] Are you surprised by the PPI's [Italian Popular Party] result? Do you expect it to disappear? [Berlusconi] On the contrary. I wish the PPI a recovery of its support and of its political role -- but in the right direction: the government of society, within a moderate center political area, with a liberal program. I am working to this end, legitimately, within respect for their autonomous analysis. I believe that a coming together is inevitable, without winners or losers. [LA STAMPA] What do you think the PPI should do now? Are you in favor of its splitting? To which individuals and what environment do you feel closest? And what line should that party officially adopt? [Berlusconi] I will not dictate other parties' lines, nor will I choose my favorite friends. I will confine myself to expressing an opinion, which is this: The first-past-the-post system makes desirable, and perhaps inevitable, a polarization -- not forcible, but free and deliberate, within the Catholic world too. In other words, I neither want nor foresee a split, but I do believe it senseless for a Catholic who sees things the same way as a left-wing opposition to remain in a forcible union with a Catholic who inclines more toward the values and programs of the government area which I believe I represent. [LA STAMPA] Is it true that, as [National Alliance, AN, leader] Fini said, Forza Italia and the AN could establish a single movement in the near future? [Berlusconi] With the AN, the Center Union, the Christian Democrats, and the Reformers, we must work within the context of a coalition political cartel, the context of the pole for freedoms and good government which prevailed in the general election and gave the country a government. Very loyal cooperation is under way with the AN and Fini within this context. [LA STAMPA] [Former President] Cossiga has urged you to initiate a number of constitutional reforms. Do you agree? Could you indicate the principal ones? [Berlusconi] The new electoral law, which has worked despite its obvious imperfections, is the nucleus for any future constitutional reform. The ideas about federalism and presidentialism that people have been talking about for years make sense now only if we make both the letter and the spirit of the first-past-the-post system effective -- the direct choice of those who govern and supervisory powers for the opposition forces, who will plan an alternative. This is the democracy of rotation to which the country aspires, and which is now taking its first steps. [LA STAMPA] After the victory in the European elections, will the desire for a reckoning which was apparent within the ranks of the majority increase, or do you intend to control it? [Berlusconi] There is no such desire. To govern means to have the instruments to intervene effectively in the fields of the economy, security, public order, and foreign policy. Efficiently and discreetly, since I am talking sincerely about a liberal government. What does any reckoning have to do with this? These are tribal concerns, which are alien to us. [LA STAMPA] More specifically, will the offensive against RAI [state broadcasting corporation] and the press (which you too accuse of having failed to support you) continue? [Berlusconi] I know of only one RAI offensive -- that on the part of RAI itself against a balanced budget and rational management. Its new management board has made some effort to remedy a situation of great indebtedness. But I wonder whether it is enough. We will disentangle the knots with a sense of balance. As for the newspapers, I have no issue with them; on the contrary. I confine myself to the normal dialogue that a democratic politician builds with whoever criticizes him legitimately. Sometimes you have the right to reply, do you not? [LA STAMPA] How do you envisage the future of Forza Italia? [Berlusconi] A splendid future, with a movement of opinion that will shape attitudes, engage in political organization, and forge links with its elected representatives and the country in order to build the right kind of social establishment within the institutions, instead of an apparatus, a filter, or a dividing wall between institutions and society. [LA STAMPA] What do you think of Occhetto, who thanked you on the day he resigned? Who do you hope will become PDS secretary? [Berlusconi] I have said several times that Mr. Occhetto is a very likable person. His resignation was a well-balanced and politically correct gesture, which I will leave it to the members and leaders of his party to judge. I have no favorite candidates within the PDS. I neither sanctify nor diabolize any of my adversaries, and still hope that they will treat me and my allies in the same way.
