FBIS3-34634 "drnes030_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-030 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Feb 1994 SYRIA Press Reacts to Israeli-PLO Cairo Agreement TISHRIN: `New Gain' for Israel JN1202101494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0545 GMT 12 Feb 94 JN1202101494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [From the press review] [Text] Under the headline "Israel Refuses To Return the Occupied Territories," the newspaper TISHRIN discusses the outcome of the Cairo agreement recently signed between the PLO and Israel. The paper explains that Israel has once again confirmed that it does not want a just and comprehensive peace, nor does it want to return the occupied Arab territories to their owners. TISHRIN says: What was accomplished in Oslo and what happened in Cairo clearly shows that Israel is focusing on separate deals and partial procedures designed to guarantee its security and tighten its control of the situation in the occupied territories. Moreover, Israel wants a partner to join it in protecting its security under the slogan of repressing terrorism. Rabin pointed to this issue in statements, carried on Israeli radio, during a meeting held by the Labor Party in Tel Aviv after the Cairo agreement was signed. Rabin said this agreement will allow Israel to repress terrorism. Rabin added: We can only do so if we have a partner who realizes that he cannot achieve his objectives if our security is not guaranteed. It is in our interest that this partner should take our security concerns into consideration. TISHRIN asserts that Rabin's remarks do not need any comment. It adds: These remarks, however, show that Israel still adheres to all its pretexts and delusions, and places the Cairo agreement in its real context; namely, this agreement is a new gain for Israel. The paper continues: All the Israeli statements that welcomed this agreement apparently indicate that the Rabin government will continue its policy of shirking the requirements of a just and comprehensive peace, that it will continue its subversive efforts to undermine the formula of the Madrid conference, and that Israel will keep pursuing a policy in conflict with the bases of a just and comprehensive peace. Otherwise, what is the meaning of the Israeli insistence that this agreement is a precedent for separate deals? What is the meaning of Israel's refusal to seriously deal with the bases of the Madrid conference and the resolutions of international legitimacy? These resolutions call for full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and for returning the territories in exchange for peace. TISHRIN adds: We pose all these questions in order to emphasize that peace cannot be achieved or maintained unless there is a just, comprehensive, and balanced solution whose approaches and objectives take into account the regaining of all Arab territories and rights. Israel is fully aware that partial settlements and separate deals cannot make peace. Concluding, TISHRIN says: Thus, these agreements cannot be an alternative to a real, just, and comprehensive peace. Both the world and the international community's will were unanimous in demanding, with clear and unequivocal resolutions, a peace that cannot be subjected to procrastination. Based on these resolutions, the Madrid conference was held, and the principles and elements of peace were crystallized. Also based on these resolutions, the terms of reference and objectives of such a peace were determined; namely, Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories first and foremost.
