The Security Service has been entrusted with the counterespionage protection of the Armed Forces and other military units. The document specifies that the military counterespionage services shall effectively address defense problems, disclose and prevent espionage and sabotage activities in military units, as well as work out and implement measures to protect state secrets. This way, the well-known special units, which were first introduced in the Russian Army on the eve of World War I, have outlived the Soviet Army, and have been transplanted into the reinstated military units of Ukraine. No matter where you go -- the fight against spies is always a current issue of any authorities.
