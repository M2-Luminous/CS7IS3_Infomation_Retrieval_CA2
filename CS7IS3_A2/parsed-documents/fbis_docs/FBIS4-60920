"We have quite often discussed our problems with Interregional Bloc of Reforms [MBR] representatves -- and Volodymyr Hrynyov in particular. He tends to view Crimean Tatars as a Crimean ethnic minority. So if the choice is to be made between Leonid Kuchma and Leonid Kravchuk, we would prefer the latter. As for Ivan Plyushch, we have a bone to pick with him, too." Forecasting the activity of the Crimean Tatar group in the Crimean Supreme Council, Mustafa Dzhemilev said they were offered cooperation by Rossiya bloc group members but that it was unacceptable. As for the Communists, the Majlis leader said, "we can hear their secretary, Leonid Hrach, making a lot of proposals that are not too bad. The Communists, however, have always been saying one thing and, once in power, doing another." Mustafa Dzhemilev said that Yuriy Meshkov had suggested they should back Serhiy Tsekov, former Ukrainian people's deputy and supporter of the Rossiya bloc, as an appointee to the post of Crimean parliamentary speaker, with a Crimean Tatar representative then to be offered the post of deputy Supreme Council chairman. The Majlis chairman said: "We find such compromises deplorable and shall not accept them." The most fair thing to do, in his words, would be to elect Refat Chubarov, head of the Crimean Tatar deputies group, to the post of Crimean parliamentary speaker. However, his candidacy will not be put forward as he will stand no chance of winning. The Crimean Tatars are most likely not to back anyone to this post. Mustafa Dzhemilev expressed the hope that the Crimean Tatars would succeed in appealing against the 14-seat quota granted to them by the previous Crimean Supreme Council. Yuriy Meshkov's statement that "the granting of even this quota was [former Crimean parliamentary speaker] Mykola Bahrov's error," was described by Mustafa Dzhemilev as nonpopulist and as an attempt to exert pressure on the Crimean Tatars. He added that the Crimean president's tactics might become the beginning of the end of his presidency."
