It is an important day for our country as it marks the culmination of a long process in our people's participation to make a new constitution, a constitution that will lay a firm foundation for a democratic governance and ensure a stable future for our country. You started this process when you presented your views in your constitutional memoranda to the Constituent Assembly commission. Now the time has come to elect those who will represent your views in the Constituent Assembly. I, therefore, appeal to you fellow Ugandans who registered to vote to turn out in large numbers and vote. By turning out to vote in big numbers, you will ensure that the right people get elected to represent your views in the Constituent Assembly. The NRM [National Resistance Movement] government is committed to ensuring that we have successful Constituent Assembly elections. As you know, part of the turmoil our country has gone through has been on account of rigged elections. Rigging elections means robbing the will of the people to chart out their own future and to determine their own destiny. Therefore, the NRM government is determined to ensure that no rigging takes place in these elections. We passed the Constituent Assembly statute in the NRC [National Resistance Council] with this in mind. Where, for example, there used to be a number of ballot boxes, we have provided for one. Where casting a ballot would be done in a voting booth where all types of electoral mischiefs could be committed, we have provided that voting be done in full view of the people but far enough to ensure secrecy for the voter. Where ballot papers would be ferried to be counted at one central point, we have provided that counting of votes must be done at the polling station and on the same day. In an effort to prevent gerrymandering of constituencies, we have provided that the county should be the best constituency unit. All this and more is evidence of our resolve to put to an end the bad habit of rigging elections. I am informed, however, that a good number of our people are already addicted to election rigging, that it is almost impossible, according to these people, to conduct free elections. Complaints about partisan returning officers and presiding officers who violate every requirement for impartiality have reached me. I am appealing to these people and also warning them to change their ways and act in an impartial manner as is expected of them and as the law provides; otherwise, the full force of the law will be brought down on any electoral official who misconducts himself or herself in the performance of his or her duties. I also call upon the RC's [Resistance Councils] to document every malpractice they may witness in the performance of duties by the returning officers or presiding officers so that they make it available to the legal machinery after the elections or even during the elections. We shall not condone or give quarter to anyone who engages in electoral malpractices. I have been assured that sufficient preparations have been made to ensure the smooth holding of these elections. In a society such as ours, where technological and communications problems prevail, it may not be possible to rule out possible last-minute hitches here and there. Where such unforeseen problems arise, the commissioner of the Constituent Assembly will no doubt put in place practical measures consistent with the CA statute. I have heard that there are fears in some quarters that some people may disrupt these elections. I wish to assure the whole country that security measures are well in place and no one will be able to disrupt these elections. Anyone who harbors the idea of disrupting these elections and tries to do so will be dealt with decisively. Please take no heed of anybody spreading this kind of rumor, but instead go to the polling station and vote for the candidate of your choice. To the CA candidates: (?Put) an end your long and hard struggle to win the hearts of the people for your election. All of you cannot win and inevitably, many of you are bound to lose. Therefore, those of you who lose should know that it is the verdict of the people and should respect it. And those of you who win should appreciate the responsibility that the people have entrusted to you and the challenge that this entails. I wish you all successful CA elections. Thank you very much.
