Green Light From Brussels"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] [Text] Brussels 10 Mar (ATS) -- On Thursday, the European Commission authorized the creation of a joint venture between Asea Brown Boveri [ABB] and Renault Automation in the field of robotics and systems for the automobile industry. The operation does not create or reinforce a dominant position in the common market, according to the executive of the Twelve. The operation contemplated by ABB and Renault is of a two-fold nature. On the one hand it comprises the creation of a new joint venture, Newco, equally controlled by both companies. On the other hand, ABB Robotics obtains the entire control of the robotics division of Renault. The investigation by the European Commission only related to the joint venture. The other part [of the deal] has no communal dimension, since the turnover does not reach the threshold [40 million Swiss francs] from which the EU starts controlling mergers.
