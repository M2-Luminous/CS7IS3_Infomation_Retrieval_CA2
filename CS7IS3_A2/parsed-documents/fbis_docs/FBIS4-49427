He said the spirit of reform should be displayed in finding a way to make the festival a success, to promote culture and art, and to expedite economic development and social progress in all fields. Chairing a meeting held on 21 March to study and coordinate preparations for the fourth Chinese art festival, Li Tieying was briefed by the Ministry of Culture and the Gansu Provincial People's Government on the preparations for the festival. Li Tieying said: Each and every art festival must have its special characteristics, otherwise it will be dull. While we have national sports meets, we also should have art festivals. Both are important, and the two are similar in terms of sizes and the ways they are held. While proceeding with economic modernization, we must also expedite cultural and art development. We must attach importance to achieving a unity between artistic effects and economic results, making sure that the festival will help local economic development. While there should be performances staged by professional artists, there should also be cultural and art activities of the masses, as well as popular shows, so that the involvement of the masses will inspire them and boost their morale. While emphasizing Chinese culture, the festival should also pay attention to promoting international exchange so that the festival will become an arena for promoting friendship and contacts between China and the rest of the world, and so that the festival will reflect its objectives of promoting prosperity, solidarity, and progress. Li Tieying stressed: We should sum up our previous experiences in holding festivals and sports meets, such as the good experiences which Guangxi and Yunnan have respectively gained in holding the sports meet of minority people and the third Chinese art festival. We can also follow the experiences of foreign countries. Anything we do today needs money, but we cannot count on the state to take care of everything. Thrift is one principle we must follow in carrying any public projects. We cannot afford not to economize when holding nationwide projects. We cannot go on to launch these projects if they have become increasingly expensive. We must encourage people to work as volunteers. Only when more people are involved will there be greater social results. Li Tieying hoped the art festival will be held more successfully on the basis of summing up previous experiences. Li Tieying urged relevant departments of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to work with greater coordination, support all festival projects, and help solve problems so that the art festival not only will be a success itself, but will also expedite reforms and development in Gansu and northwest China. The fourth Chinese art festival, which is scheduled to take place in Lanzhou, capital of Gansu, from 18 to 28 August 1994, will be sponsored by the Ministry of Culture with support from the Gansu Provincial People's Government and the Foundation for Chinese Art Festival. The theme of the forthcoming art festival is: Solidarity, Reform, Prosperity; Bringing Together the Best of Art, and Fostering the National Culture. The general guideline for the art festival and its specific projects have been basically determined, and all preparations have started. Chen Changben, vice minister of culture; Sun Ying, deputy secretary of the Gansu Provinciall Party Committee; and Chen Yiling, vice governor of Gansu, briefed Li Tieying on the preparations for the fourth Chinese art festival. Comrades in charge of relevant departments under central and state organs were present at the meeting. The meeting also studed the problems encountered during the preparations and came up with some solutions.
