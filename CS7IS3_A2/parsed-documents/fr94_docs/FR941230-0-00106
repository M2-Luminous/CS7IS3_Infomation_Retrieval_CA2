FR941230-0-00106 FR941230-0-00019 •Care must be taken to use <TEST> and <CONFIRMING-COPY> tags correctly; submissions with these tags are not official Commission filings. •Filing fees in connection with good-money filings must be paid to the lockbox before or at the time the filing is made. Filers should allow time for wire transfers prior to filing. •Filers should be prepared to file early to avoid last-minute filing problems, especially in connection with time-sensitive filings. •Filers have an obligation to confirm the status of their filings after transmitting them to the Commission. Filing date adjustments 112 will be made, as warranted, for Exchange Act reports, but generally will not be granted to backdate a filing over an extended period of time. It is not staff policy to grant filing date adjustments for Securities Act registration statements or other transactional filings, since shareholder rights may be affected. 112 Rule 13(b) of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.13(b)]. IV. Cost-Benefit Analysis The costs and benefits associated with mandated electronic filing generally were addressed in earlier releases associated with the adoption of the EDGAR interim rules, which today are being made final. In summary, the Commission stated that while some costs attend the implementation of an electronic filing system, for the Commission, filers and users, the benefits far outweigh the costs. Filers avoid uncertainty and delays that may occur with courier delivery or other modes of transportation used in connection with paper filings. Filing hours are extended for electronic submissions and acceptance processing is immediate, giving filers greater flexibility and control over when filings are made. Filers may avoid multiple submission of the same information by transmitting once a modular submission for inclusion in multiple documents. Filers will enjoy further facilitation in satisfying their filing obligations once one-stop filing with self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') and the states is fully implemented. 113 Users and disseminators benefit even more from the EDGAR system's capabilities to identify, sort and broadcast time-sensitive information to the nation and the world in a matter of minutes. Investors and financial markets benefit from the immediate access to information the system provides. 113 Frequently, documents filed with the Commission are used to satisfy SRO and state blue sky law requirements with respect to securities offerings. The Commission has been working with the SROs, including the securities exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, and the states through the North American Securities Administrators Association (``NASAA'') to develop a system in which EDGAR filings could be used to satisfy the requirements of the various parties. Although one-stop filing is not currently available, it is contemplated that EDGAR will provide the states, via NASAA, and various SROs with the state and SRO required public filings that are designated for such treatment by an electronic filer. Under the contemplated system, the SROs and the states would furnish the connection with EDGAR and maintain facilities to receive filings directed to them. The states and SROs would be able to obtain other public filings through access to the public EDGAR database. One commenter, responding to the Commission's general request for comments on the EDGAR system, asserts that the Commission never considered the potential burdens imposed on small businesses by the EDGAR system, as currently designed. To the contrary, in the release adopting the interim rules it was noted specifically that the EDGAR rule proposals elicited comment relating to the costs of: purchasing electronic equipment; hiring financial printers to file Forms 10&hyph;K because of their complexity; training employees to prepare and file electronic documents in an unfamiliar format; and preparation and review of paper documents in addition to electronic versions of those documents. The Commission recognized that registrants (including all those defined as small entities) and others who are required to file on the EDGAR system would incur additional compliance costs. It was anticipated, however, that those filing electronically also would enjoy the benefits related to electronic filing, as set forth above. In the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, the impact electronic filing would have on small entities was explicitly considered and several alternative approaches were addressed. It was determined to be in the public interest to have a complete database available through the system. Furthermore, small entities themselves would benefit from the broad and immediate dissemination of their disclosure documents into the marketplace. Finally, a delayed implementation schedule for the smallest companies was adopted to allow more than ample time for these entities to acquire the necessary equipment (most of which is basic to today's modern workplace, absent EDGAR) and training as modest resources permit. The views expressed in the foregoing documents have been supported by the experience gained in the nearly 20 months since mandated electronic filing began. No commenter addressed the costs and benefits of the amendments to the general EDGAR rules that were proposed in July 1994. Given the technical and minor nature of the amendments, they are not expected to affect significantly the costs and burdens associated with filing requirements generally, or specifically with respect to electronic filing.
