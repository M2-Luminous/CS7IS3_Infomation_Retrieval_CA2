FR940511-2-00064 FR940511-2-00045 Office of Policy, Planning and Program Evaluation DOE Headquarters Washington DC Chicago Operations Office AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Acceptance of unsolicited application. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Policy, Planning and Program Evaluation, through the Chicago Operations Office, announces that it intends to award a grant to the Western Interstate Energy Board (WINB) of Denver, Colorado. The proposed award meets the criteria in 10 CFR 600.14 (d) and 10 CFR 600.14 (e). The financial assistance is for support of the Western Interstate Energy Board workshop on the Linkage Between Western Utility Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) and Regional Transmission Planning in a Competitive Environment. The workshop will be hosted at WINB facilities, and is scheduled for the May 30, 1994 thru December 31, 1994 timeframe. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The workshop will be attended by Western State representatives, and 2 Canadian provinces from western public utility commissions. The workshop will consist of state facility siting agencies, governors' energy agencies; and will address important issues relating to the Energy Policy Act of 1992, particularly Title VII. The objectives of the conference are: a. Improve the understanding of the types of linkages (or lack of linkages) between utility-specific IRP, state facility siting, and regional transmission planning given (1) the current level of competition, (2) increased wholesale competition and (3) retail competition. b. Identifying opportunities to enhance coordination of utility-specific IRP and state facility siting with regional transmission planning. c. Improving the understanding of the influence of competition on utility-specific IRP in terms of planning objectives, planning processes, plan outputs and plan implementations, and identify potential changes to utility-specific IRP to allow IRP to meet planning objectives in a competitive environment. Results of this workshop will assist the western utilities and consumers in the area by fostering utility cooperation. The proposed project will improve the understanding of the types of linkages between utility and specific IRP, state facility siting, and regional transmission planning, identify the opportunities to better coordinate utility specific IRP and improve the understanding of the effect of competition on utility-specific IRP and the changes in IRP required by a more competitive environment. Results will favorably impact the cost for producing and transmission of electricity, and the general public should gain with lower costs to electric utilities. The DOE will provide funds in the amount of $25,000.00, and the Western Interstate Energy Board will provide $25,636.00 for the 7 months project period.
