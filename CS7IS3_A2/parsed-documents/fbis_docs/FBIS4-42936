At the same time, Turkey manages--despite all its problems--to be strengthened both strategically and politically by Washington. The Clinton Administration is showing already, with very clear moves, that it is determined to continue arming Turkey excessively and even ignore its own concerns over the imbalance being created in the Aegean and the danger of a Greek-Turkish conflict. It is interesting that at such a time, when many U.S. analysts are concerned about the possibility of a "hot summer" in Greek-Turkish relations, that Washington is making new efforts to strengthen the Turkish war machine. U.S. officials revealed to I KATHIMERINI that the White House has decided to approve granting five or six KC-135 aircraft-tankers to Turkey. These are aircraft that can refuel fighter planes of the Turkish Air Force and will extend their range of action considerably. The decision was made by the White House interagency committee before Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's visit to the U.S. capital, but was not announced to prevent it from spoiling the climate of Greek-U.S. relations. This decision has already been conveyed to Congress. While it is not certain how many of these aircraft are involved, a Pentagon official said that the number may be 10. The Turkish Government will also have to pay a considerable amount of money to modernize the aircraft, as some of them were built in the 1960's. Another important development is President Clinton's decision to approve the transfer to Turkey of part of the money that was collected by former President George Bush to strengthen the Turkish armed forces. Mr. Bush had promised Turgut Ozal that he would collect $3.5 billion from the Arab countries (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates) and the United States to finance the program to build 100 additional F-16 planes for the Turkish Air Force as well as for manufacturing F-16's for the Egyptian Air Force. This sum was what Ozal collected for Turkey's stance during the Persian Gulf war. The United States contributed $500 million, but it is not yet clear what budget it came from or whether it has been approved by Congress. It is certain that President Clinton approved the transfer of $1.2 billion for the strengthening of the Turkish war industry, apparently acting under the commitment of his predecessor. Undoubtedly, we have to face a de facto disassociation of Washington's policy toward Ankara from the Athens-Washington relations. The U.S. Government is exploiting the Greek-American lobby's activity and the Greek foreign policy on the Skopje issue to promote the long-term plans for the strengthening of Ankara. As Senator Paul Sarbanes recently pointed out very correctly, the Greek foreign policy's expanding fronts have "tired" Congress and Washington in general. However, Washington also shows "fatigue" on the Cyprus issue, which unfortunately has disappeared from the White House's list of priorities. The Americans exerted pressure on UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali to delay the release of his report because they wanted to give Rauf Denktas every opportunity to accept the confidence-building measures [CBM]. State Department officials insist--in briefings to Congress and during discussions with Turkish counterparts--that the Greek Cypriot leaders also do not really want the CBM's. Consequently, the State Department leadership believes that pressure on the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot side alone is unfavorable and even... [ellipsis as published] unjust. Some analysts go one step further and for the first time begin to discuss a "final" scenario, which is based on the idea of recognizing the "pseudostate" and giving an official status to partition as quid pro quos for the return of all the Famagusta area to the Greek Cypriot community. This scenario is even being discussed at closed seminars and is the subject of confidential reports, while the U.S. agencies are again promoting the formula of a quadripartite conference to hold negotiations on all aspects of the Cyprus issue. It is a fact that Washington rules out the adoption of measures against Turkey or the Turkish Cypriot community, particularly at a time when it believes that Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller is facing serious domestic problems. It is always noteworthy that the mechanism of Turkey's supporters converts every development or problem into a reason for the support of Turkey. The inability to solve the Kurdish problem and the upsurge of Islamism make it necessary--according to this logic--for even more political, economic, and strategic strengthening of Turkey. The theory, which is being heard more often in closed seminars, that "Turkey will be the next Iran" concerns the Americans and urges them--in a rather strange manner--to adopt even more pro-Turkish directions. There should be no doubt that Washington takes its relationship with Turkey very seriously. There is also no doubt that the most important U.S. promises for the strategic strengthening of Turkey were given during the Mitsotakis-Bush idyll and that these promises "were cashed in" during the Papandreou-Clinton idyll.
