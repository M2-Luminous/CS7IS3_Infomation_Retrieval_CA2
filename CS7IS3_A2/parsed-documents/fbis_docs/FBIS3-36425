The strategic goals are consolidation of independence and transformation of Belarus into a neutral state. In his words, the republic attaches great importance to a recent visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton which laid down the basis of further bilateral cooperation in the political and economic spheres. He also praised negotiations of Vyacheslav Kebich and Stanislav Shushkevich with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The speaker said further Russian-Belarusian integration with the future unification of their monetary systems is a vital necessity without which Belarus will collapse. The formation of Russian-Belarusian economic union will take several months due to the need to sign 40 agreements.
