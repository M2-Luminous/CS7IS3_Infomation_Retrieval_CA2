Deputy Director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control Mr. Xu Bin said that there had been no dramatic fluctuation of the exchange rate of the renminbi since the second half of last year and he is optimistic about the maintenance of relative stability of the currency because the overall economy has since the beginning of this year proceeded at a well-coordinated pace. The exchange rate for the renminbi against the U.S. dollar has remained at RMB 870 against U.S.$ 100 during the period between early this year up until now, Mr. Xu said. The renminbi showed a slight gain against the U.S. dollar in recent times, representing success in the restructuring of the foreign exchange system and unification of the exchange rate of the renminbi. Mr. Xu said he was convinced that the present exchange rate for the renminbi was reasonable, reflecting the level of cost and profit resulting from exports as well as endurance capability for imports. The rate also showed supply and demand for foreign exchange resulting from the flow of capital. Mr. Xu said that the exchange rate of one U.S. dollar against 8.7 yuan was based on the market regulation and the foreign exchange control administration played no part in the maintenance of the exchange rate nor did other departments play a dominant role in maintaining the exchange rate. He was convinced that the current rate showed the real market supply and demand and considered it the true market exchange rate. The so-called floating exchange rate system under administration set out in a statement issued by the People's Bank of China, according to Mr. Xu, mainly put the emphasis on the formulation of a programme for the foreign exchange market and on the ensuring of orderly operation of the market. It will in no way disrupt trading in the foreign exchange market. China will employ economic means in accordance with law to govern the foreign exchange market. It is a must, Mr. Xu said, for enterprises to have analysis and projection on the trend of the exchange rate. The rate itself is not an independent factor showing the overall level and demand for the economy but it is closely related to macroeconomic and monetary policy. The exchange rate which has remained at the current level for a relative long period indicated that it was acceptable to the market. The main policy on the exchange rate of the renminbi, Mr. Xu said, was to maintain relative stability of the rate of the currency.
