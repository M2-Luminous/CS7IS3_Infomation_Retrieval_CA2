The AD SR, headed by former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko, former aide of Premier Vladimir Meciar and currently his radical opponent, called on the opposition to make another attempt to pass the constitutional law on early elections. Two recent attempts failed as it was not able to obtain the 90 votes necessary for this. "The political crisis in Slovakia is intensifying, while the latest steps by the governing forces are jeopardising the long-term economic and political interests of the country," says the appeal by the leadership of the AD SR which has eight deputies in the 150-member Slovak Parliament. The AD SR considers the referendum on the the loss of mandates of the deputies who left their parties during the electoral term to be unconstitutional. The AD SR call assured that if the current government is dismissed, it would support a broad coalition government which would lead Slovakia to the early elections which should be held, according to the AD SR, in autumn.
