He went on to say that the experience we have accumulated and the economic initiatives that are being implemented will allow us to confront challenges in all senses. During the meeting, which was held on 13 January, Lezcano advised that conditions have been established to improve the transportation situation of the province. Lezcano added that more than 200 donated buses will arrive and the same number of so-called bus trains will be built for urban service. He added that they hope to increase the volumes of agricultural products with the development of the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's] that have been created, and with the harvests of the people's organically grown gardens, which have already begun selling vegetables. Lezcano highlighted the improvements in working conditions at work centers. Such is the case of the Port of Havana where they have achieved positive results in comparison with previous periods. [Begin Lezcano recording] We are not talking about results that double the productivity of the worker. I do not know by how much their productivity has multiplied. Just yesterday and the day before yesterday, at the plenum of the party in Habana Vieja and Regla, we were analyzing this. The results have been extraordinary. They have been able to increase the number of tons per man; they have increased the number of containers per hour. Havana, for example, had previously produced two containers per hour. Nowadays, they are speaking of 38 containers. That is truly amazing. Production fluctuation has considerably decreased. Before, the port had between 5,000 and 6,000 workers, and it was not enough. [word indistinct] was tremendous. We had to constantly mobilize volunteer workers. Today, with approximately 3,500, there are people waiting in line to work at the port. The other day, someone explained to us the work they did on the 30th, the 31st, and the 1st. It was like clockwork. During the last months of 1993, of 40 ships, 38 were dispatched rapidly. It seems that they have found an interesting formula with many perspectives. [end recording] Jorge Lezcano also briefed the professionals of the national media on the principal accomplishments of 1993, highlighting achievements in such areas as education, construction, public health, and tourism. Furthermore, he praised the workers parliament process, which began on 12 January at the work centers of Havana City. [Begin Lezcano recording] This process achieves two important things. One is that it considers the opinion of the people. Many important ideas can be obtained this way. With millions of people providing their ideas and suggestions, it is possible to receive ideas that some economists and officials may not have thought about, on the one hand. On the other hand, it is possible to see where they coincide. You can see that there will be greater acceptance of those measures that coincide. People participating and giving ideas. people recognizing that they are being consulted on the measures that are going to be implemented. This involves a very important political factor, the second aspect: The people understand and support the measures. When the people participate, they have the capacity and a higher likelihood of being able to participate in the implementation of those measures. [end recording] Lezcano reiterated that 1994 will be a difficult year, but very different from 1993. He added: We have a greater awareness of the problems and how to solve them with increased efficiency and at lower material and human cost.
