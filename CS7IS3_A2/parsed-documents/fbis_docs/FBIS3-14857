Another reason for this is the intention by certain circles in the USA to impose a "time-out" in its relations with Russia and watch the developments in Moscow. As is the established procedure, Russia's competent bodies do not intend to comment whether the Ameses worked for Russia. This is explained by the fact that Moscow would not like to influence the trial which will be soon held. Moscow believes that the court will have to toil enough, because there is no substantial evidence against the Ameses, according to the US press. The Russian competent bodies categorically disagree with the point of view widely shared in the USA that America has "special powers" and may carry out intelligence activities against Russia, while Russia cannot do so. Moscow and Washington have never signed an agreement to give up intelligence activities against each other. Moreover, the CIA does not even try to hide the fact that Russia remains one of its priorities. Interfax also learned that the Russian competent bodies were amazed at the deportation of a Russian diplomat, Aleksandr Lysenko, who had been introduced to the American side as a representative of the Russian intelligence, according to an agreement between the Russian secret service and the CIA. Lysenko arrived in the USA last June and, as a matter of fact, was only being put in the know of developments. If the CIA delegation composed of two persons tried to represent the deportation as "a forced victim" with the aim to "loosen the situation," then Moscow believes that Lysenko was made a "scapegoat." Regarding this action by the US Department of State as purely political, Moscow decided to declare the advisor of the US embassy in Moscow, James L. Morris, persona non grata as a measure of "mutual payment." The decision was made on the level of the Russian president. Moscow believes that the deportation of J. Morris will be a full stop in the disagreement, and the staff of the Russian embassy in Washington will not be reduced by a single person. Otherwise, Moscow's reaction would be prompt. However, the escalation of this issue was not a choice of Russia. According to Interfax information, the decision by the US Department of State followed the arrival in Moscow of a CIA delegation composed of two persons. The CIA officials tried to force the Russian secret services to recognize their involvement in the Ameses' case by voluntarily recalling the Russian diplomat who allegedly worked with the Ameses couple. The American officials also insisted on Moscow's taking no measures in response and making no comments to the press. This was made condition to continuing the mutually profitable cooperation between the Russian and US secret services. All these demands were regarded as unacceptable in Moscow. At the same time, the Russian competent bodies were not in the least interested in fanning "spy mania." They have evidence of several dozens attempts to recruit Russian citizens by the US secret service. In a number of cases, Americans used "illicit methods" such as blackmail which is not in use by the Russian intelligence. However, Moscow did not make a fuss using this as a pretext, like the USA did it with the Ameses' case. Nor the Russian secret service put emphasis on other cases when Russian citizens collaborating with the CIA and the FBI were arrested and brought to trial. The Russian secret service understands that the Ameses' case was a serious psychological blow to the CIA, but it does not want to gloat at it. Moscow believes that the CIA internal security should not be made issue of interstate relations, and the further developments will entirely depend on the American side.
