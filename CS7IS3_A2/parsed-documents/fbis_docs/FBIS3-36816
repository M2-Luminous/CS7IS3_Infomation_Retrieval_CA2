This unanimity can easily be explained because throughout his career Perry has been closely associated with the Pentagon and has been widely recognized as an effective leader of major corporations in the military industry, and he is an eminent mathematical scientist and arms control specialist. [passage omitted] The new defense secretary believes that the department he heads "must play an important role in strengthening democracy," because the U.S. military complex "can help peoples to appreciate more fully the principles and advantages of civilian control over the military department" by means of direct programs of cooperation with various countries' defense ministries. As we know, such a program is now being implemented together with Russia. In his recent speeches Perry has stressed that democracy "has bided its time and has proved stronger than the most powerful armies." The advantages of democracy "are appreciated by everyone who believes in peace and freedom," but at the same time it must be borne in mind that "the collapse of Soviet communism has by no means removed the sources of the threat to our security." Judging from these statements the new secretary intends to stick to the traditional U.S. defense policy of "keeping its powder dry," even in a favorable international climate, by maintaining a level of combat capability ensuring its national security interests whatever turn events in the world may take. This is evidenced by the Pentagon's draft budget for the next fiscal year, which Perry has just submitted to Congress, for $263.7 billion -- this is $2.4 billion more than last year. This draft provides for the appropriation of large sums for the development and production of high-technology armaments, including a new aircraft carrier, the F-22 fighter, the V-22 combat helicopter, and a new generation of submarines.
