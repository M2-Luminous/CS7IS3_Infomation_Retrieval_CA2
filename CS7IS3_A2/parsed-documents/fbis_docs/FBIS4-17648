This was stated in an ITAR-TASS interview today by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, who is here on an official visit. We would like peace and tranquility to return to that region as quickly as possible, he said. If good will is shown and the warring parties and all interested states display a willingness to cooperate, a political solution to the Bosnian question can be found. A cease-fire is, unquestionably, the key to this. This must be followed by the continuation of peace talks involving international organizations, the Ukrainian foreign minister said. We will do our best to facilitate a political settlement of the Bosnian problem at the United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and other international organizations, Zlenko stressed. Ukraine is also prepared to do its utmost to promote an international meeting on a Bosnian settlement. We believe that the Bosnian problem poses a threat not only to the peoples of the Balkans.
