Russia has curled up into itself with its own enormous problems. Like the rest of the world, in Finland we have stopped to look at how Russia's economic reforms are progressing and in which direction the power relations between the different factions are developing in that country. The talk about a special relationship between Finland and Russia has died down. The world has changed so much that talk about a new period of transition in relations between Finland and Russia sounds like a hackneyed phrase. However, with the end of Mauno Koivisto's term in office, the time when the special relationship between Finland and Russia was founded on the maintenance of high-level personal contacts is apparently finally at an end. It is unlikely that Martti Ahtisaari can continue to operate on the same basis. The world has changed, Russia has changed, and the relationship between Russia and Finland has changed too. There is no reason to yearn for the old days. We have to quickly learn to live in keeping with the new circumstances without losing any opportunities to make use of those advantages and assets that we may have had for a long time in the past. Getting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to visit Finland had been put off for a regrettably long time. The damage has now been repaired. Today, Chernomyrdin is more and more clearly Russia's day-to-day strong man. We must, however, take care not to lapse into the old pattern of thinking that Chernomyrdin could become the key man in economic relations between Finland and Russia. We must in the future be able to develop relations, above all, directly with business firms. The slowdown in Russia's market economy reforms does not change this basic fact in any way, let alone Chernomyrdin's promise to revive the former Economic Commission. The Economic Commission may be of help in dealing with various financial arrangements, guarantees, and countersecurities. But under the new circumstances the commission will no longer be the cooperation engine and problem resolver of the good old days. The agreement between Neste [state oil company] and Gazprom [gas industry], the world's biggest producer of natural gas, on setting up a joint company is one model indicative of the direction in which development should be oriented. The Russian company is paying for its share in hard currency, markkas. At the present time natural gas is probably one of the riskiest fields for joint ventures. Hopefully, through it we will gain momentum for Finland, too, in the important plans for a West European natural gas network and for linking up both networks. The Imatra Power Company's general agreement on overhauling Russia's power plants is also a valuable new field. Chernomyrdin's official visit as prime minister was devoted solely to economic issues. President Martti Ahtisaari still played a secondary role. Political relations and talk of a special relationship between Finland and Russia may acquire new significance if Finland becomes a member of the European Union. In that case Russia will gain through Finland both a political and an economic EU neighbor on its border.
