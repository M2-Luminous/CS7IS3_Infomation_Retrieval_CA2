FR941011-2-00020 FR941011-2-00005 Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 189 Announcing the Standard for Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part 2: Shell and Utilities Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111 (d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235. Name of Standard. Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part 2: Shell and Utilities (FIPS PUB 189). Category of Standard. Software Standard, Operating Systems. Explanation. This publication announces the adoption of International Standard ISO/IEC 9945&hyph;2:1993, Information Technology_Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part 2: Shell and Utilities as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). ISO/IEC 9945&hyph;2:1993 defines a command language interpreter (shell) and a set of utility programs. This standard is for use by computing professionals involved in system and application software development and implementation and is part of a series of specifications needed for application portability. This standard addresses the Applications Portability Profile functional area that deals with methods by which a person interacts with the operating systems. Approving Authority.

Information on the NIST POSIX Testing Program is available on an electronic mail (email) file server system. Documents available are: registers of validated products, general information on NIST POSIX testing policy, and information on requirements for certificates of validation. To access the system: You must be able to send and receive email via the Internet. For most email systems, send an email message to posix@nist.gov. When the email system prompts you for the ``subject'' of the message, you may type anything. The body of the email message should consist of one or more basic commands to the email server, with each command on a separate line. For example, to request the email server to send you a listing of all available files, enter the command: send index. To request a brief description of all valid commands, enter the command: help. To receive a more detailed explanation on how to use the mail server, enter: send help. After you enter the command(s), indicate that your email message is complete as required by your email system. The NIST mail server program will read the message and send the requested document(s) and/or information to your email address.
