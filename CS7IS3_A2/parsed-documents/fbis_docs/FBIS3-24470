Luminescent methods are normally used to detect contamination from petroleum products. The visible fluorescence of petroleum and petroleum products results from the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic compounds absorbed in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. However, it bears noting that modern spectrofluorometric methods for detecting traces of petroleum products in water are encumbered with lengthy sample preparation (extraction, sorption) in order to separate the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAU). In natural waters, PAU fluorescence is recorded against a background of dissolved organic substances (ROV) and a spontaneous Raman spectrum of excited illumination on the water molecules, thus making it impossible to determine trace quantities of PAU directly without their preliminary separation. Synchronous spectrofluorometric methods are an exception, although they require costly equipment and specially trained personnel. Thus the problem of an express method for detecting and assaying the degree of contamination remains in essence the as the isolation of a fluorescence signal of PAU against a background of ROV illumination. In the present work an express laser-luminescent technique was developed which makes it possible to conduct spectral fractionation of PAU contamination without supplemental treatment of the water sample. The use of periodic pulsed excitation in conjunction with signal gathering enables determination of PAU within the range 5 X 10[.sup]-10[/] - 1 X 10[.sup]-7[/] g/ml.
