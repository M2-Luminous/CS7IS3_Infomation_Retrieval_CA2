Beside the increase in the GDP to 4.5 percent -- 10 percent of which corresponds to the industrial sector -- the trade balance hit record levels. Although the final figure will remain a little below the $15.5 billion registered last year, exports and imports continued to increase, generating a trade volume of over $60 billion. This is a record figure never before achieved in our trade balance. Thanks to exports, the unemployment rate is diminishing in Brazil. Acting Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Minister Ailton Barcellos Fernandes has said that for every billion dollars worth of goods Brazil exports, 80,000 jobs are generated. Given that exports have remained above an average of $3 billion since last March, one can calculate the job openings generated by our foreign trade. The increase in imports, compared with $20.6 billion last year, is not worrisome because a lot of machinery and equipment has been purchased to make Brazilian industries more competitive in the internationalization of the economy: Brazil is preparing to face the greatest trade liberation in history, which is scheduled for 1995 through the GATT agreement. President Itamar Franco thus has something to celebrate: The trade balance surplus increased by 10 percent. This is fantastic if compared with the average 4-5 percent increase in the rest of the world during 1993. Our exchange balance is one of the four highest in the world, to which we may add our enviable $26 billion exchange reserves, placing Brazil among the top 10 hard currency reserves in the world.
