In this, he was reacting to the Fatah-Tunis announcement that its autonomy elections campaign will focus on the struggle to preserve East Jerusalem's Arab character. Minister Yosi Sarid noted that Jerusalem is not included in the autonomy and, as agreed, the discussions on its status will be conducted only during the permanent status talks. Minister Sarid, Major General Dani Rothschild, and Nabil Sha'th met this morning at the joint command near the Erez checkpoint. Our correspondent Moti Amir adds that Minister Nabil Sha'th is now in a meeting with Maj. Gen. Dani Rothschild. The meeting marks the start of the negotiations on the second stage of the autonomy agreements. As for Yasir 'Arafat's visit to the self-rule territory, Nabil Sha'th said the visit will take place after the Palestinian Authority imposes its control on all spheres of life. Minister Sarid added that the date of the visit will apparently be coordinated at the Rabin-Peres-'Arafat meeting in Paris.
