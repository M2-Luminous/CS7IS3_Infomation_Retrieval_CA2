We realize that our parliament is not the final level of authority, that this matter has to be settled at the United Nations and that its settlement will be bound up with many difficulties, but Russia is duty-bound to press for this. Our whole delegation, which represents the majority of parliamentary factions, is unanimous on that, Nikolay Bosborodov, deputy chairman of the defense committee and head of the parliamentary delegation of the Russian State Duma, said in an interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondent. The issue of sanctions, he continued, is closely bound up with an overall political settlement of the conflict. The Duma has already adopted a decision on holding hearings on this matter, and representatives of all the republics of former Yugoslavia are invited. Undoubtedly serious preparations need to be made for such hearings and many issues need to be worked through, but the discussion could represent very promising assistance in unravelling the Yugoslav knot. The head of the Russian parliamentary delegation voiced his distress and surprise at recent statements made by various Russian diplomats during the delegation's visit. "We do not understand their consent to NATO ultimatums to the Bosnian Serbs. It is obvious that NATO's intervention in the Bosnian conflict can only exacerbate the ferocity of the warring sides and expand the war area, and that it threatens to draw Yugoslavia into the war. On this matter we support the stance of the Russian defense minister," the head of the Russian delegation said. Moreover, Bosborodov said, when we were talking to the commander of the Russian blue helmets battalion and asked him what help was needed above all, the commander asked for one thing only: "for the Foreign Ministry not to change its stance every day."
