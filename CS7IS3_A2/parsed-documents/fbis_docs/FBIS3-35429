The noteworthy point in Mr. Hamilton's article is that he has expressed concern over the reduced U.S. influence in Pakistan and increased influence of the Islamic Republic of Iran and China in that country. Besides, he has also mentioned the often repeated claim that Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons. The article is worth pondering from two aspects. First, as has been confirmed by the world bodies, including the exports of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, Iran has no plan whatsoever to use nuclear energy for military purposes. And second, what the U.S. official has described as the so-called increasing influence of Iran and China in Pakistan are actually the joint efforts of the three countries, coupled with their good will, to expand regional cooperation. In the political lexicon of the White House the word influence actually means to be forerunner of domination whereas the foundation of Iran's ties with Pakistan, by being away from any political ups and downs, is based on the principle of good neighborly ties and nonintervention in each other's affairs and is set on the track of making these ties evermore stronger. Meanwhile China considers Iran as a very important country in west Asia, specially in the Persian Gulf, which has a strategic role in maintaining peace and stability in the region. Iran and China have had very high trade exchanges during the recent years and in addition to Pakistan's stability and the recent visit to Iran by the prime minister of that country, Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, have depicted a very bright prospect for the future of the Pakistan-Iran ties. If we also take into account China's serious inclination of expanding ties with the Economic Cooperation Organization, ECO, we can understand the very roots of the U.S. fear from closeness between Iran and Pakistan. Trade exchanges in the region, which spreads from South Asia to Caucasia and Central Asia, with China being next door, means the creation of a strong and independent economic pole in the world; the world over which the United States wants to establish its economic domination under the cover of the new world order. This, and nothing else, is the main cause of concern for the head of the foreign relations committee in the U.S. House of Representatives.
