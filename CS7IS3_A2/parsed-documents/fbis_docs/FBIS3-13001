The 'Arafat-Mubarak talks are taking place under circumstances when the head of the Egyptian regime, in contacts in the past few days with American and Israeli officials, has endeavored to reduce the current crisis in the Arab-Israeli dispute following the onslaught against worshipers in Hebron. The PLO has also dispatched envoys to Washington. The PLO has subjected the resumption of peace talks with Israel to the presence of international force in the occupied areas to protect the lives of Palestinians, to disarm the Jews in the region and to destroy some of the Jewish populated townships in Gaza and West Bank of Jordan river. The Zionist regime, meanwhile, has rejected as a precondition the presence of international force in the occupied lands to secure safety for Palestinians. Yitzhak Rabin has agreed to hold talks about presence of these forces in the occupied areas in the next round provided they are not military forces. To this end, yesterday, Norway said that it would dispatch forces to the usurped lands within an international force. Political experts believe the presence of an international force in the occupied lands cannot serve favorable to the Zionist regime in light of the fact that the issue of Palestine and Israel will spread from the region to a vaster level and the Zionist regime will not welcome its consequences. However, it seems that in view of the pressure Israel feels at the moment from the public opinion, the plan on dispatch of international force to the occupied areas is brought about and pursued this time by the West and America with objectives in an entity which contradicts the ideals of Palestinians, and aims to reduce pressures exerted on Israel. Therefore, in the light of reflection of the Hebron massacre and the sensitive public opinion towards the crime, the Zionist regime has been placed in defensive position; and what is tangible in the midst is the efforts the West and America make to rid the Zionists of the current unfavorable situation. These efforts, once again, indicate the dual policy of the United States vis-a-vis the issues related to Israel and Arabs.
