The experts prepared their report on the results of the recent missions of ASSET (groups for appraising events at atomic power stations from the standpoint of their safety) which carefully studied the work of four of the five stations with the RBMK-type fast reactors: The Kursk, Leningrad, Smolensk (Russia) and Ignalina (Lithuania) stations. The experts' field of vision did not include the Chernobyl Atomic Power Station inasmuch as Ukraine planned to bring it to a final halt (in October the Ukrainian parliament decided nevertheless to keep the ChAPS alive). The experts also took a look into the March incident at the Leningrad APS (destruction of the gating valve in the third unit). As a result, such valves at all the stations with RBMK reactors were replaced with the mechanisms of the latest design, and the methods for detecting defects were improved. The IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] experts stated: the steam coefficient of reactivity (a parameter determining the reactor's inner safety not dependent on personnel) had been lowered tenfold since 1986. They spoke highly of the work of operators, saying that the culture on most safety was growing. An appraisal which is not only flattering but even most unexpected (considering the destructive processes in industry and power engineering), yet its objectivity is beyond all doubt. Their conclusion--there is no need to stop the RBMK reactors (given, of course, the timely implementation of ASSET's recommendations for ensuring the safety of each APS). In parallel with the work of ASSET's missions revising primarily the reactors' safe operation, an effort is currently underway to implement the international project of the Commission of the European Communities whose participants investigate the dependability of the RBMK's design solutions. With this aim in view a consortium of Western countries was set up with the participation of Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Britain (who were later joined by Canada and Spain). As many as nine joint subject groups were formed and have carried out active since the spring of 1993. By the end of the year they must prepare a report containing an appraisal of the existing APS with RBMK reactors and recommendations for enhancing their safety. But already now John Tyror, chairman of the committee in charge of the project, has found it possible to say that "the experts have found nothing serious which would prevent people from sleeping quietly." This statement by one of Britain's leading nuclear scientists sounds all the more meaningfully since previously Mr Tyror believed that the RBMK reactors were not consistent with European safety standards. A more detailed acquaintance with these reactors made him change his mind, whereas the generally positive and sufficiently optimistic appraisal of the RBMK by two independent international groups of experts makes it possible to hope that the accident, provoked by the gross mistakes of the personnel of the Chernobyl Atomic Power Station, has not finally discredited the idea of channel reactors.
