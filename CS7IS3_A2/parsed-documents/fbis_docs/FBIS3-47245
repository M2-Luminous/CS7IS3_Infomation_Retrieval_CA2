Han promised visiting UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata wider assistance for the commission, said Ham Myong-chol, director-general of international organizations. Seoul's contribution to the United Nations as a member state accounts for 0.69 percent of the U.N. budget, but its voluntary donations to other international bodies such as the commission is 0.04 percent. Korea gave 150,000 U.S. dollars to the commission last year, when it joined the convention on better protection and welfare of the refugees. This ranks 28th among the 48 contributor nations. While increasing the amount of monetary donations, Han said, the government could send medical and other emergency aid teams to troubled areas. These teams may be sent as part of youth volunteer programs at the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), a Foreign Ministry umbrella institution, he said.
