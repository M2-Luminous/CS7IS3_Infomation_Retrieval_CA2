PRN President Daniel Tourinho told FOLHA DE SAO PAULO on 14 February that he is forging a coalition with PRONA [Party for the Redefinition of the National Order], Eneas' party. Tourinho stressed: "He is the physical antithesis of [former President] Fernando Collor and he is a good candidate." [passage omitted] Confirming that he will contend in the presidential elections, Eneas said: "I already have been a candidate for five years." According to Eneas, the PRN would be one of the alternatives to make his candidacy viable. According to the new electoral legislation, PRONA cannot field a candidate of its own. In general elections like those for choosing a president, only those parties with 3 percent of the total number of deputies may field a candidate. The PRONA barely has one representative in the Chamber of Deputies, Deputy Regina Gordilho (RJ [Rio de Janeiro State]). The PRN, with a bloc of four deputies, may, as established by law, field a candidate of its own because it received the support of more than 3 percent of the constituency in nine states in the 1990 elections.
