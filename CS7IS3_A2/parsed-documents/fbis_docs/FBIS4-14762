Replying to an ITAR-TASS question during a press conference in the State Duma here today, he said that in their future programme, entitled "From Crisis to Stable Development," which is now being discussed, the Russian Communists renounce all "revolutionary leaps and forcible methods for settling problems," and also the exclusiveness of state-owned property. "We believe that domination of only state-owned property had produced stagnation and paralysis," Zyuganov said, noting that the theses of the Russian Communist Party recognise multiple forms of economy as a reality. The communist leader mentioned "popular state patriotism" and social fairness among the bedrock principles of his party. Asked about the work that is now being done by masterminds of the "Concord for the Sake of Russia" movement, Zyuganov said that they were daily holding consultations and have already met many scientists, heads of major enterprises of the military-industrial complex, and leaders of many parties. He did not rule out the possibility of the movement's constituent congress being held already this may. Zyuganov said that the organisational group maintained regular contact with Aleksandr Rutskoy and representatives of his party, was actively working on the movement's programme. The communist leader spoke much more cooly about the memorandum on civil peace and concord, which is now being drawn up. Zyuganov said that the Communist Party on the whole backed the idea of achieving civil concord in the Russian society, but said he doubted that the given draft (about which he could judge only from press reports) would contribute to this end. The movement towards this goal, according to Zyuganov, should proceed "from both sides." If the drawn up draft memorandum really stipulates that the Constitution "should not be touched," the Russian Communist Party will hardly be able to sign such a document, Zyuganov stated.
