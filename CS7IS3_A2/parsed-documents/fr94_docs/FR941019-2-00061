($2,941.35); and, W.R. Grace ($211.84). By the terms of the proposed AOC, these PRPs will together pay $1,340,584.26 to the Hazardous Substance Superfund. This payment represents approximately 13% of the total anticipated costs for the Site upon which this settlement is based. In exchange for payment, EPA will provide the settling parties with a limited covenant not to sue for liability under sections 106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, including liability for EPA's past costs, the cost of the remedy, and future EPA oversight costs, and under section 7003 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended (also known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act). The amount that each individual PRP will pay, as shown above, depends upon whether they contributed radioactive hazardous substances or non-radioactive hazardous substances to the Site. The price per pound cost for non-radioactive hazardous substances is $1.9798857. The price per pound for radioactive hazardous substances is $3.9597714. Settlement amounts are calculated by multiplying these per pound costs by the number of pounds of hazardous substances a party sent to the Site (Base Amount), adding a premium payment of either 30% or 130% of the Base Amount, as specified by each Respondent PRP in the AOC, and adding a $200 administrative fee. For parties paying a 30% premium, there is an exception to the covenant not to sue if total response costs at the Site exceed $10,000,000. For parties paying a 130% premium, there is an exception to the covenant not to sue if total response costs at the Site exceed $20,000,000. For a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, the public may submit comments to EPA relating to the proposed de minimus settlement. A copy of the proposed AOC may be obtained from Louise Gunderson (8HWM&hyph;ER), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405, (303) 293&hyph;1868.
