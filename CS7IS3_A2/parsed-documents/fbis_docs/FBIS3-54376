The key to peace is not only in the hands of the Palestinian element. This fact should not be absent from the minds of the Palestinian leadership, which signed an agreement with Israel before the others. This signing does not mean that we should ignore the importance of coordination with the Arab side's other elements, foremost of all Amman and Damascus. Enhanced coordination with Jordan and Syria must continue and proceed on the highest levels. Any rift with this or that side should be avoided and no issue or stance should outweigh the importance of coordination with the Jordanian and Syrian sides. True, the Palestinian side's decisionmaking is independent, but this does not mean that the Palestinian leadership should "turn its back" on fraternal Syria and Jordan. A rift with them or sufficing with a fragile and pretentious coordination harms the Palestinian cause and position and gives Israel an additional opportunity to pursue positions rejected by the Palestinian side. Moreover, rifts and lack of coordination constitute an element of pressure in Israel's hands against the Palestinian side. Beware of hostility with Damascus and beware of lack of strong and serious coordination with Amman.
