FBIS4-27912 "dreas109__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-109-A Daily Report 30 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Bank Subsidiaries Authorized To Act in Auctions Bank Subsidiaries Authorized To Act in Auctions 942A0292A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 30 May 94 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0292A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] has made a decision to approve the establishment of "winning-bid companies" [jiko kyoraku gaisha] which are 100-percent-owned subsidiaries of banks designed to purchase collateralized real estate offered by such banks in an auction and to allow such subsidiaries to engage in real estate operations. The formula allowing the subsidiaries to purchase such real estate under a winning-bid process will ensure the preservation of fairness in transfer prices, and the ability to purchase adjacent lots will enhance the value of the collateralized property. Having concluded that such arrangements would promote the liquidity of collateralized real estate and lead to restoring soundness in bank assets, the MOF will issue a bulletin authorizing the establishment of real estate subsidiaries effective in June for a duration of 10 years. As a way to recover principal, banks have auctioned off through court proceedings real estate used as collateral by debtors who have failed to pay off loans. Procedures exist for the disposition of real estate without resorting to court proceedings, but auctions ensure fair pricing and eliminate the risk of being eyed by the tax authorities for potential tax evasion. Further, there is less risk of the sale being opposed by lower-ranking creditors and the ability to avoid disputes among interested parties. Auctions have many such advantages, but the severe recession in the real estate market has created many cases in which buyers cannot be found even at the minimum acceptable auction price. Accordingly, the situation gave birth to the idea of establishing winning-bid companies that are 100-percent-owned subsidiaries and submission of a winning bid by such subsidiaries when other buyers could not be found. The MOF will also approve such winning-bid company real estate firms to operate as home builders. Banking laws prohibit subsidiaries to engage in other businesses, but an exception will be given with the proviso that the properties to be handled will be limited to the collateralized properties and adjacent lots.
