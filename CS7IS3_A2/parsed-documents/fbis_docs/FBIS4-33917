FBIS4-33917 "drlat114_g_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-114 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 Guatemala Police Negotiating Arms Deal With Israel Police Negotiating Arms Deal With Israel PA1106022194 Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1956 GMT 8 Jun 94 PA1106022194 Panama City ACAN Spanish BFN [Text] Guatemala City, 8 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The U.S. Government's influence over other arms manufacturing nations is making it difficult for Guatemala to equip the National Police properly, government sources reported today. Deputy Government Minister Luis Augusto Merida told ACAN-EFE it is difficult for the government to obtain arms following the U.S. State Department's decision to ban the sale of arms to Guatemala because of the human rights violations in the country. He said, "we cannot deny the U.S. Government's influence over the rest of the world," because several countries, including Belgium and Germany, which had offered to equip the National Police, later changed their minds and refused. Germany also has endorsed the travel warning the U.S. State Department issued against visiting Guatemala because of attacks on foreigners. President de Leon Carpio had earlier complained about certain governments, which he did not identify, for demanding that Guatemala keep crime in check while refusing to sell arms to civilian security forces because of human rights violations. Merida said that, for the time being, the government is negotiating with Israeli manufacturers who can "provide a minimum of equipment." Merida expects a counteroffer to a proposal presented last week. The government intends to spend approximately 20 million quetzals (some $3.48 million) for semi-automatic weapons and another 15 million quetzals (some $2.61 million) for vehicles for the National Police. Merida, a former head of the Army's intelligence section, said: "We need semi-automatic, carbine-type rifles. We just cannot go on using six-shot revolvers" while criminals are better equipped. He estimates each rifle will cost $1,000. The expense will be higher than anticipated, however, because "it is more expensive to import arms from Israel than from the United States." Merida said the State Department's ban is heeded by U.S. suppliers who fill orders from local Guatemalan dealers, who in turn sell the arms to civilians, not the Army. "Some local stores have stopped selling ammunition to the military," who purchased it for their personal arms, the source said. He added that he cannot buy arms for the police through local corporations because the owners refuse to deal with the Army, "either out of fear of losing their visas or their import permits." The National Police, founded 113 years ago with a regulation enacted in 1955, has been in the sights of the international community, which has reported human rights violations.
