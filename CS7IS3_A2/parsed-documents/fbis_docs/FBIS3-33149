The military prosecutor requested jail sentences of 20 and 15 years for the soldiers who committed the crime -- two majors and four subofficers -- while only five officers were included in the proceedings and charged with negligence. Jurists, congressmen, and other prominent people linked to human rights organizations have described the sentences requested by the military prosecutor for the 11 soldiers being tried in the La Cantuta case as mild. [Begin unidentified priest recording] In my opinion, the sentences are too mild, because it was a very serious crime. [end recording] The most drastic sentences were requested for Majors Santiago Martin Rivas and Carlos Pichilingue, for whom the military prosecutor requested 20 years each. In descending order, 15 years were requested for subofficers Jesus Antonio Sossa, Nelson Carvajal Garcia, and Pedro Guillermo Supo; five years for General Juan Rivero Lasso; four years for Colonel Federico Navarro Perez; two years for Captain Jose Velarado Astete; and 30 days for Colonel Manuel Guzman Calderon. In view of the situation, relatives of the slain civilians announced via their lawyer that they will not participate in the trial to be held in a military court. [Begin Attorney Saul Cuadros recording] The civilian side -- the relatives and three others -- today agreed not to participate in the military trial. Previously, in May and October, we acted on behalf of the civilian side in written documents, but we never received approval to do so. By participating on behalf of the civilian side, we would be endorsing many irregularities committed by the military court -- irregularities with which we totally disagree. [end recording] Meanwhile, Congressman Cesar Larrabure criticized U.S. meddling in Peruvian affairs by commenting on the so-called La Cantuta law. He said the autonomy and sovereignty of countries must be respected, adding that the United States cannot treat Peru as a colony. In this regard, he said the U.S. State Department's statement with regard to the so-called La Cantuta law is unacceptable. He also expressed his confidence that soldiers implicated in this case will receive a fair trial.
