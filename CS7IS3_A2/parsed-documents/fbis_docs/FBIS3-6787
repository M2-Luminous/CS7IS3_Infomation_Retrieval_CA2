Spokesman General Pruoch Bunthol said around 250 government soldiers had been dispatched as reinforcements to help in what he called "mopping up" operations around Pailin, located on the Thai border 350 kilometers (210 miles) from Phnom Penh. "About 30" of the rebel faction have been killed since the offensive was launched on Friday, he said. One of them was executed on Saturday for having refused to reveal where mines and traps had been laid, he said. "There is still fighting, but not much," the general, who is the headquarters' spokesman, said, adding that he was still awaiting a detailed report from the front that would give precise casualty figures. Khmer Rouge radio, monitored in Bangkok, also went off the air, an apparent sign that the guerrillas had decided to abandon the jungle-clad transmission site rather than risk losing its equipment to government attacks from the air. But western experts were skeptical about the government's ability to maintain position long-term in Pailin, a timber and mining centre whose rubies have provided the Khmer Rouge with a fat war chest. "The battle for Pailin is far from over," one expert said, speaking on condition he was not identified. He drew a parallel with the combat earlier this year for Anlung Veng, a Khmer Rouge base in the north of Cambodia, where the guerrillas melted away into the jungle in order to avoid a pitched battle. Government leaders said at the time they had inflicted a major blow on the rebels -- but were then staggered, three weeks later, when the Khmer Rouge counter-attacked and routed the government troops. The expert noted that "Pailin is in a basin, and the government's men do not control either the heights, to the north, or access from the south." The heights, 1,000 metres (3,250 feet) high, give a massive strategic advantage. If they fell into the guerrillas' hands, "that would put the Cambodian troops in an untenable position." In addition, by digging in, the government's forces would be increasing their logistical problems, "which are already their weak point," the expert said. The spokesman said that between 6,000 and 10,000 troops had been deployed in the battle for Pailin, out of the army's total complement of 140,000 men. But 60 percent of the armed forces comprises officers, leaving a "core" of fighters of only 60,000. The command structure is generally considered to be poor. "The Khmer Rouge have a far sharper sense of tactics, and it's sure that they haven't said their final word," an expert said. Phnom Penh has named the capture of Pailin as a body blow to the guerrillas, depriving them of their last bastion, as well as vital revenue from ruby mining and timber. The Khmer Rouge became notorious for their four-year tenure in power in the 1970s, when they engaged in an orgy of killing, slaughtering anyone deemed contrary to their ultra-left, ultra- nationalist cause. More than a million were left dead in the so-called "killing fields." The guerrillas refused to take part in UN-organised elections last year, and have maintained armed combat against the government that emerged. At least 10,000 people, mainly Khmer Rouge families, have fled into Thailand to escape the fighting.
