FR940927-1-00030 FR940927-1-00010 Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), the Coast Guard must consider whether this action will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). The Coast Guard will accept comments on the economic impact on small entities, in connection with this proposal for a permanent change to the regulations where indicated under Addresses. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). Federalism This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this rule does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a federal assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g(5) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination Statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
