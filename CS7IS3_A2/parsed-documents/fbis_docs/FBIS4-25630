They said they would try to request a meeting with President Li and Premier Lien Chan in the next few days to appeal to the government for a clear and definite answer to the proper handling of the case. The following is a report filed by (Huang Mei-ting): [Begin recording] [(Huang]) After Communist China's Hangchou City Intermediate People's Court announced the death sentence for the three accused in the Chientao Lake incident, family members of some victims said that though the verdict was no surprise to them, the death sentence for the three could not replace the life of the 24 victims from Taiwan. Meanwhile, as the trial was conducted not in public and without the presence of the families of the victims, they have refused to recognize whatsoever the verdict before the whole truth comes out, even though the accused have been sentenced to die. [Unidentified voice] The trial was conducted without the presence of the bereaved families. What has angered us most is that the trial was not open. Therefore, despite the death sentence, we cannot recognize the verdict. [(Huang)] As far as compensation is concerned, the bereaved families regard it as secondary because they believe that the way Communist China handles the case can absolutely not satisfy the demand of the families in dire financial need. They indicate that should the government fail to make a demand on Communist China, the families can only pressure the government for a proper settlement. Therefore, the victims' families will (?meet with) Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-fan this Wednesday [15 June] to study the possibility of requesting a meeting with President Li and Premier Lien Chan, and will then decide the next move. We think of our dear ones on festive occasions more than ever. To the families of the 20-odd victims of the Chientao Lake incident, this year's Dragon Boat Festival will be a sad occasion. They said what they want to know is just the truth. But judging from the current situation, Communist China is persistently trying to cover up the facts. The truth will probably never come out.
