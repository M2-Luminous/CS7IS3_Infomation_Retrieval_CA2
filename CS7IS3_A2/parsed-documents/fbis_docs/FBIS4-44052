That is what emerges from the goals and main points of the EU presidency that were approved by the cabinet in Bonn on Wednesday [22 June]. Speaking at the meeting, Chancellor Kohl said that he wanted the Germans to exercise "a normal and good presidency" over the next six months, one that should not seek superficial achievements, but continuity in cooperation with partners, especially with France and Spain. Foreign Minister Kinkel said that Germany will show that it is committed to close and enduring cooperation in "solidly implementing the Maastricht Treaty" and make a particular effort to provide the European Parliament with additional powers. Discussing the Strasbourg EU Parliament, Kinkel drew attention to difficulties connected with personnel decisions. The European Parliament must vote on the composition of the future EU Commission in Brussels. According to Bonn, the most important question that the European Council has to answer in Corfu on Friday is who will succeed Delors. There is substantial annoyance in Bonn that Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers is conducting "an election campaign with all possible means" to become president of the EU Commission, despite his defeat in the parliamentary elections. There is particular irritation in Bonn about personal attacks on Kohl. It is being said that in the case of a secret ballot in Corfu on Friday evening, Belgian Prime Minister [Jean-Luc] Dehaene can count on a majority of 10 votes to two among the EU member states. If Holland does not block a decision in favor of Dehaene and Great Britain receives compensation in the form of another post, the European Council will propose a new president at the Corfu meeting. Great Britain is currently still promoting its candidate [Trade Commissioner Sir Leon] Brittan and has raised objections to Dehaene, saying that the Belgian is a "federalist." In Bonn, it is being said that Great Britain is considering convoking a special meeting of the European Council at the end of July or the beginning of September, because of a lack of consensus. The German EU presidency would then have to "conjure up" another candidate: The three current contenders -- Dehaene, Lubbers, and Brittan -- would have to drop out in such a case. That would be inconvenient for the German Government. Bonn sees that as making the presidency more difficult. [passage omitted] A European Council action program for combating unemployment is to be launched during the German presidency, which begins after the meeting on Corfu, and the Federal Government wants to press for adherence to free market principles during its implementation. Kinkel and Economics Minister Rexrodt said that the currency union should not be postponed, but should only come into effect once the convergence criteria have been satisfied. Rexrodt announced that the German presidency would institute a technical procedure in Brussels for monitoring the budgetary situation in individual member states. Industrial policy should not be allowed to amount to no more than employment programs, but should also bolster private investment. Bonn will appoint a commission composed of representatives of business, science, public administration, and trade unions in the member countries. The commission should establish which central regulations can be done away with. The European Union should conduct a critical assessment of restrictions on trade with East Europe. Various Brussels subsidy programs should be examined "so that there should not be a flood of such programs, for which Germany pays every third German mark." Kinkel summed up Germany's intentions for the next six months as follows: "The German presidency will not make any promises that it cannot keep."
