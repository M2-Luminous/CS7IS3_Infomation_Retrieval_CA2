FBIS4-51820 "dreas085_d_94063" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 South Korea * Firms Increased Aid to Universities in 1993 * Firms Increased Aid to Universities in 1993 942C0092A Seoul CHUGAN MAEGYONG in Korean 9 Feb 94 pp 51-53 942C0092A Seoul CHUGAN MAEGYONG Korean CSO [By reporter Mun Hyong-nam: "Corporate Aid to Universities on the Increase; Grants of 30 Major Groups Reached 100 Billion Won in 1993"] [Text] As they say, "universities and businesses are interdependent." Universities' role for business communities is to provide them with fresh blood--human resources and theoretical bases for Research and Development [R&D]. Korean business communities, preoccupied with the immediate, day-to-day developments, indeed had been somewhat negligent of their obligations to help universities, but lately they have become increasingly conscious of the importance of the role of universities and have stepped up various types of assistance to further industry-university cooperation, including financial aid to research programs and expansion of facilities as well as scholarships. It was found that the total amount of aid to universities by the nation's 30 major business groups, including scholarships, research and facility funds, and other endowments, last year reached 100 billion won [W]. A survey conducted by CHUGAN MAEGYONG indicates that l7 of them disbursed a total of W91.87 billion in aid to universities in 1993. Considering all other firms, however minor, and cases of inadvertent omission, the total amount is estimated at W100 billion. The Daewoo Group topped the list with W30.4 billion, followed by Hyundai, W22.3 billion; Hanjin, W19.6 billion; Kumho, W5.78 billion; Lucky-Goldstar, W3.03 billion; Samsung, W2.1 billion; Sunkyong, W2.09 billion; Kia, 1.63 billion; and Lotte W1.25 billion. Of the total aid, W30.98 billion went to facilities and W25.62 billion to research, while W22.08 billion went to endowments and contributions and W13.19 billion to scholarships. In the past, corporate aid mainly took the form of scholarships; nowadays, however, long-term support--that is, building of facilities, research funds for professors, endowments, and scholarships in that order--forms the mainstream. The survey found scholarships the lowest of all in weight. Also, industry-university cooperation such as joint research programs is moving ahead vigorously and in full swing. Daewoo at Top With W30.4 Billion The survey clearly indicates that such corporate aid is concentrated on a limited number of universities including those linked with business groups, Seoul National University [SNU] and a few others. Of Daewoo's W25.9 billion from its group fund, W16 billion went to Aju University, while in Hanjin's case, of the W19.56 billion in aid to facilities funds, W16.43 billion went to Inha University Hospital and the Inha school system. Except for universities linked to particular business firms, SNU received the largest support, including W2 billion from Lucky-Goldstar, W1 billion from Hyundai and Kia respectively, W120 million from Kumho, and W90 million from Sunkyong--all as funds for school development or additional building projects. Of all the business groups, Daewoo runs the largest university aid program. At the group level, it has, since 1991, disbursed more than W20 billion in annual aid, increasing the amount every year. The grants last year totalled W25.9 billion, and a 12-percent or W29 billion increase is planned for this year. Separate from Daewoo Group, Daewoo Foundation distributes W4-W5 billion every year in scholarship and research funds. So, the total Daewoo grants are expected to increase from W30.4 billion in 1993 to W33 billion in 1994. Aid Focused on Certain Universities Including SNU Affiliated firms of the Hanjin Group disbursed W19.6 billion last year--W40 million in scholarships and W19.56 billion in contributions to facilities funds. Hanjin scholarship grants are concentrated on group-related universities such as the Aviation College, Inha University, and Inha Engineering College. Of the W19.56 billion grants to facilities funds, W14.9 billion went to Inha University Hospital and W1.53 billion to the Inha school system. The group is planning a 68-percent increase in its aid this year, bringing the total to W32.87 billion. Of the planned grants, W26 billion will be to the Inha University Hospital building fund. The Kumho Group last year contributed W140 million to scholarship programs, W120 million to the SNU development fund, and W20 million to the Hanguk General Arts School development fund. Also noteworthy is W5.5 billion it appropriated in aid to the 1993 operations of the Kwangju Institute of Science and Technology. Group Chairman Pak Song-yong has been promoting Kumho's positive aid to the institute as chairman of the preparatory committee for its founding in the past and as its board member now. The Lucky-Goldstar Group scholarship program is for 150 selected students every year, paying their registration fees in full and giving each W300,000 to pay for training aids. The expenses come to approximately W300 million per annum. Also, under an overseas training program, the group selects 25 professors every year providing them with $20,000 each. The annual cost of this program is approximately W400 million. In particular, the group has been vigorously promoting industry-university cooperation. For example, it granted research funds to Kyongsang and Inha universities which participated in the development of a refrigerator for Korean pickle jars. Also, it added the Industry-University Cooperation division to the Group's R&D awards to honor professors of the two universities. The Samsung Group spent W4.2 billion in 1990 to build the Hoam Hall for use by the SNU faculty as living quarters and for research purposes. In 1992, it built for SNU a W3.5 billion joint research center for new computer technology. But it made no major contributions last year, except for a W1 billion grant to Kyongbuk and Chonnam universities each as the local university development fund. The Sunkyong Group gave the "SNU Yukong Laboratory" of the SNU chemical engineering school W86 million every year for 10 years through 1993 to promote joint research between industry and the university. The group also decided to grant the Hanyang University engineering school a total of W6 billion to help expand its facilities, delivering the second installment of W2 billion last year. In the Kia Group, Kia Motors Corp. pays the full registration fees for 40 to 50 students every year and, in addition, provides them with tuition subsidies under industry-university scholarship programs. As industry-university cooperation funds, it gave Hanyang and Sogang universities W300 million each last year. It also contributed W1 billion to the extension work of the SNU engineering school, and W30 million to the support fund for Tongguk University. Kia plans to gradually increase its aid in both the number of recipients and the amount of money they receive. The Lotte Group, which had decided to grant the Pusan University engineering school W3 billion for its development, delivered W1 billion of it to the university last year. Also, the Samnam Scholarship Association of the Group last year distributed W100 million for scholarships for university students and W150 million to support professors' research activities.
