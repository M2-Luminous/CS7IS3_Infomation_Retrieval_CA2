FBIS4-58663 "drnes088_n_94004" FBIS-NES-94-088 Daily Report 5 May 1994 LEBANON Minister on Media Law, Christopher Visit Minister on Media Law, Christopher Visit NC0505190494 Beirut Radio Lebanon in Arabic 1530 GMT 5 May 94 NC0505190494 Beirut Radio Lebanon Arabic BFN [Excerpt] Information Minister Michel Samahah has said that the media law will be passed in the next few weeks. In a wide-ranging interview with the United Arab Emirates newspaper AL-KHALIJ, which will appear tomorrow, Samahah discussed the upcoming regional tour by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, security issues and government concerns in Lebanon, and various other issues. Samahah said that Christopher's tour is neither a positive nor a negative development insofar as negotiations are concerned. What matters to us, Samahah added, is UN Security Council Resolution 425, the implementation of which would pave the way for our wider participation in the general Arab talks involving Resolutions 242 and 338. The information minister added that Lebanon will see Christopher's tour as significant if the latter were to bring with him something new that calls for direct communication with the Lebanese Government, such as information concerning Resolution 425, its mechanism, and the timetable for its implementation. Otherwise, Lebanon will see nothing new in Christopher's tour. Samahah said that once Israel commits itself to withdrawal beyond the international borders, Lebanon will be ready to discuss arrangements concerning the withdrawal phase, deployment of the Lebanese Army, and control of the occupied territories. The information minister added that the illegitimate presence in the south will have to withdraw with the Israeli withdrawal. Concerning the media, Samahah said that the television and radio law will not be late in coming and is expected to be passed within the next few weeks. He said that the law will guarantee freedom of thought and expression and the public's access to information. In return for which, there are obligations that the law will address. The media should not be used to foment sectarian hatred or undermine the unity of homeland and its national symbols. Samahah called on the media to return to being the Fourth Estate. The media, he said, should be free from political and financial manipulation. [passage omitted]
