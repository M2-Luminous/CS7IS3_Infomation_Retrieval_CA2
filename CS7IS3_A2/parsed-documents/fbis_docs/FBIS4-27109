He babbled that an impregnable guard posture against North Korea should be assumed. This warmonger, wearing a mask of civilian politics, also raved that now is a very dangerous time, one should have strength, and so forth. He had fighters stage an emergency mobilization training, and inspected the guard posture of the puppet army units against North Korea in the frontline area. Thus, he frantically ran amok to instigate war fever. Traitor Kim Yong-sam's tour of frontline areas this time was a thoroughgoing war junket aimed at confirming the posture of readiness of the puppet army for a northward aggression and at provoking a war against us at any time.
