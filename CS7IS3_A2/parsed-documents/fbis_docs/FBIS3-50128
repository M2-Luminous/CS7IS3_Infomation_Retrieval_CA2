It is believed in Brussels that the affected countries are in quite a rush. Lithuania, for example, would like to sign the document within days, and its prime minister himself will go to Brussels to sign. Our guest is Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky, who, according to reports last weekend, will sign the accord personally. However, last weekend there also appeared rather different assessments about the accord. Increasingly more people believe that this agreement is really a success for Russia and not for the Central European or, if you like, the Visegrad Group of countries. [Jeszenszky] I do not agree with the view which holds that it is not our success. Last October, when Warren Christopher presented this program to Hungary and the world for the first time, it was much more modest than the current one. It did not contain -- or did only very hazily -- the promise of NATO membership, whereas now the door is open. For Hungary, NATO membership is not the only possible way of legally joining Western structures but perhaps the fastest and safest one. [passage omitted: benefits, chances of membership] [Announcer] Has a concrete date been fixed for you to go Brussels and sign the accord? [Jeszenszky] This is not a horse race. I do not consider it important as to who overtakes whom. In any case, Hungary -- which has played quite a significant role in working out the draft -- will surely be among the first. I do not mind signing simultaneously with others. [passage omitted] I do not know the concrete date, but I think that the signing will take place within a good couple of weeks. [Announcer] You visit Belgrade this week. What will you take with you, for, after all, Hungary's relations with Serbia, or to be more precise, rump Yugoslavia are, to put it mildly, not very good. [passage omitted] [Jeszenszky] [passage omitted] For Hungary, the end of the conflict is very important. [passage omitted] The Danube, as a free waterway, is of vital importance, and then there are the Hungarians in Vojvodina, who are under threat. Really, the aim of this visit is to demonstrate again that our objective -- ever since the formation of this government -- is to carry out a balanced policy toward all our neighbors, including the Yugoslavs. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Is there a thawing in the Belgrade-Budapest relationship? [Jeszenszky] I can say that the outbursts which could be described as regular, have ceased -- quietened down -- in the Belgrade press. These were the most impossible tales: That there are training camps in Hungary; that Hungary, in cooperation with Croatia, is arming the neighbors. [passage omitted] These reports, which were manufactured for domestic consumption, have now ceased. It is also important that the most innocent victim of the embargo, the civil population -- and even within this group, those who have nothing to do with the policy which provoked the embargo, such as the Vojvodina Hungarians, for example -- should survive this period. [passage omitted on Hungarian humanitarian aid deliveries]. The first task is to ensure the survival of, and the second task is the achievement of the political recognition of, the Vojvodina Hungarians. We have some hopes in respect of the latter and I would like to investigate this. [Announcer] What do you mean by political recognition? [Jeszenszky] Recently, several contacts have taken place between the Democratic Community of the Hungarians in Vojvodina [VMDK] and the Serb leadership. I think that the VMDK does not wish to make use of this difficult situation -- i.e., that the Hungarians can tip the scales between the Serbian Socialist Party and the enemy [ellenseg] -- either by entering the government or to form a coalition with a very heterogenous opposition which includes, inter alia, extremist radicals. However, in any case, the VMDK's responsible behavior will perhaps slowly achieve certain results and the political plans of the Hungarian population -- the various autonomy concepts, i.e., that it is a political factor [szubjektum] whose affairs must be sorted out -- have a certain chance of succeeding. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Last week the Slovak Foreign Ministry attacked you for saying in an interview in a Polish newspaper that there is no border question between Hungary and Slovakia. [passage omitted] [Jeszenszky] I do not think that it was for this sentence that I was attacked -- only very bigoted people could attack me for it. However, what I said was very much in line with, e.g., the stand of the Hungarian grand assembly [nagygyueles], the government assembly [kormanyzati assembly] in Komarno [Komarom], too. This attack is an artificial incitment to hysteria, or serves domestic political purposes. [passage omitted] The long interview contained but a mere half-sentence reference to the fact that certain of our neighbors, Slovakia and Romania, do not fulfil the expectations of the Council of Europe, their own promises. [Slovak] Foreign Minister Moravcik knows very well that this is a fact. The fact that he comments in an elaborate way on my statement shows precisely that Slovakia would like to divert attention to what is taking place there. [Announcer] In Hungary, several political forces are calling for a referendum to be held regarding Partnership for Peace, since it is such an important issue that it cannot be decided without asking the people. What is your view on this? [Jeszenszky] I believe no referendum is planned regarding the Partnership for Peace program in its narrow sense. Parliamentary ratification will only become necessary if Hungarian troops were sent abroad or foreigners took part in Hungarian military exercises. If the agreement includes such details then we will submit it to parliament. Consultation is continuous with the parliamentary parties regarding these issues. NATO membership is a different matter. [passage omitted] NATO provides absolute security, since it represents a force which can deter small and large aggressor from making an attack. Therefore I believe that the closest possible relationship with NATO is in Hungary's unequivocal interest. I do not believe that a referendum is justified from this point of view. It is also very expensive. [passage omitted] I believe there will be no need for a referendum after the forthcoming elections, but each party should state clearly before the elections what their stand is regarding NATO. The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] advocates NATO membership, so those who want NATO membership in Hungary should vote for the MDF, and those who are afraid of NATO membership should vote for other parties.
