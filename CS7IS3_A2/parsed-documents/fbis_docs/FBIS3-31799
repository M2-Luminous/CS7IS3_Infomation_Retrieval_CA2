What will your first move as prime minister elect be? [Marjanovic] My first step will be to form a government of national unity, as the president clearly said. In order to do that, we have to conduct consultations with the party leaders to find the experts who will bear the burden of the entire program for the recovery of Serbia. It is also well known that several strategic moments have been envisaged earlier, and we will keep them in mind in the implementation of this program. These are the struggle for peace, the struggle for the economic recovery of the country, and the struggle for a stable and legal state, within which we will also keep in mind the fight against crime. As for the program itself, I believe that it has been accepted in a way in the country, by the public, and I think that this program has been devised by our best experts. It is not a one-party program, it is not marked by any color. Everything that has been done so far on the realization of the program has yielded positive results. There are some problems but we will deal with those. So, when all is said and done, I will face the assembly as the prime minister elect with a clear program and measures for the implementation of this program. [Petrovic] The government of national unity will be comprised of experts, expert economists. [Marjanovic] Yes, we will try and find the people who are the best in their line of work.
