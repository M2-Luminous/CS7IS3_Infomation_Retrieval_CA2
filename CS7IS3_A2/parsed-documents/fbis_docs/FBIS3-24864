Magistrates, who were present at courts throughout the entire country, displayed the February program for court hearings, the radio stated. All cases slated for trial in January will be dealt with in February, in accordance with the recommendations of the national follow-up committee on magistrates' demands, which has asked the judicial corps to work "without interruption." In a statement on national radio, the committee chairman, Ferdinand Tchianga, announced the creation of "a solidarity fund" by the judicial staff to support their colleagues whose salaries have been suspended. The salaries of 56 magistrates and more than 200 court workers have been suspended for irregular attendance at work. In addition, a "free association of moderate teachers," created in Douala, has decided to dissociate itself from the strike called on 24 January by the autonomous public high school teachers union, also in demand for salary payment. According to the national radio, this association appealed on 29 January "to teachers who have a sense of responsibility and who care for the future of their children" to resume classes.
