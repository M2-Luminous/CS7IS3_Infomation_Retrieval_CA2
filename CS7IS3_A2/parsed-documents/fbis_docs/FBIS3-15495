He pointed out the role played by the LDP in the adoption of the resolution on amnesty and regretted the continuing confrontation between the White and the Red. He proposed that this period be completed and everyone be forgiven. "The best victory is the one at the elections than on barricades," Zhirinovsky believes. Commenting on the alteration of the Russian foreign policy, he remarked that the crisis in Sarajevo had been resolved due to the LDP position in the State Duma. The LDP had stated that "bombardment of Serb positions would mean a war against Russia." "Thousands of Serbs were saved from inevitable death thanks to me and our party," Zhirinovskiy affirmed. However, the LDP leader continues to insist on resignation of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev saying that Kozyrev could not "radically change the foreign policy." Zhirinovskiy demanded once again that the economic sanctions against Serbia be lifted. "They can dress and feed us. Russia can station there its servicemen withdrawn from Germany. Our soldiers and officers will not leave [as received] in camps like now," he suggested. Speaking on the enlarged meeting of the government on Friday, Zhirinovskiy pointed out that Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin had shown that he intended to alter the policy and was against "those ministers who hampered the move forward." According to the LDP leader, there are 4 such ministers in the present government -- Vice Premiers Aleksandr Shokhin and Anatoliy Chubays, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policies Sergey Shakhray. Zhirinovskiy also demanded that the military industrial complex be completely restored since military production sold abroad could ensure "years of good life for Russians." He said Philippines had been ready to acquire the MIG-29 military planes and officials had concealed the documents and were waiting for bribes. About 1000 people were listening to Zhirinovskiy at the rally near the metro.
