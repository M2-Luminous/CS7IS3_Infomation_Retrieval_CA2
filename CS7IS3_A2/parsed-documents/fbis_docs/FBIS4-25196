The deadline has angered Chinese officials who said they would not tolerate any suggestion of a British ultimatum. "We think we have been too lenient towards all sorts of British requirements in this regard," a mainland official said last night. "In principle, Britain should hand over all the sites to us." British sources said that unless an accord was endorsed by the next full meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group [JLG], likely to be held by the end of this month, many of the military facilities to be built for the People's Liberation Army would not be completed by 1997. There are fears that without an agreement on the military land, construction projects, in particular the Central-Wan Chai reclamation, might have to be put on hold. Britain is aiming for a settlement before the Legislative Council's summer recess next month. Officials say this is dictated by "practical considerations", such as the finance committee having to approve any funds required to build a new naval base for China. Negotiations are scheduled to start this week between experts from China and Britain. Talks have been under way for seven years. A party of Chinese experts arrived in the territory last night to prepare for the meeting expected to be held this afternoon at the venue for the JLG meetings. The dozen delegates will hold a meeting this morning to discuss whether there is a need to meet their British counterparts this afternoon. A British JLG official refused to confirm the meeting but said informal contacts between the two countries had been going on. An agreement seemed likely last month but the British said China changed its position by making further demands. China, in turn, has accused Britain of playing "propaganda tricks". "Nothing was settled after last month's meeting," a Chinese official said. "We have never given Britain a definite yes to their offer. We only said we needed to report back to a higher authority. Then, when we finally responded to the British, they said we were making new demands. What a trick. They probably just want us to accept whatever is on the list. As to which sites and how many of them should be passed to the Hong Kong government for redevelopment, it is purely a matter between the People's Liberation Army [PLA] and Hong Kong's future government. Look at how many sites the British army has occupied and look at how many the Chinese PLA will be able to get." He complained that Britain was willing to give China only 30 per cent of the residential blocks available. "This is also despite the fact that all expenditure for the PLA garrison to be stationed in Hong Kong will be borne by the Chinese Government," he said. He then criticised Britain for making public some unresolved matters in a bid to create a false impression that the two countries were close to a deal. It is already known that the PLA will take over The Prince of Wales Building and the land to the west of it but Britain needs agreement from China to redevelop the naval base which forms part of the reclamation project. China was furious when the government unilaterally announced that it was relocating the British naval base to Stonecutters Island. It would be almost impossible to persuade private developers to build on the site, even if it was filled in, without an agreement with Beijing. In all, it is estimated the Government would stand to lose more than $1bn from the military sites it is hoping to sell off.
