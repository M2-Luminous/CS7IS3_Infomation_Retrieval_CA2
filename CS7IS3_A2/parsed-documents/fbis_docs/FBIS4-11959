The encampment was a protest against what they termed a deterioration in the state of security. "We do not intend to return to Dugit any more. We fear for our lives. If they cannot protect us, they should compensate us and let us leave," two settlers, Tova Goren and Orit Qariti, said last night. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the police placed guards at the encampment and declared the new settlement a closed military zone, permitting the settlers to stay on the site till morning.
