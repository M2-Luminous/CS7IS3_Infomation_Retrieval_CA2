"The French mission has humanitarian characteristics and for that reason it is supported by Argentina," Cardenas said after a UN Security Council consultation meeting. The ambassador did not rule out, however, his country's participation with a logistics contribution. Cardenas explained that Argentina could not send troops because it has reached the "practical ceiling" with its participation in UN peacekeeping operations. Regarding the logistics support, "the only thing we can do is move the hospital operating in Mozambique with the commitment that it will stay in Rwanda only after 15 November. We could consider moving the hospital to Rwanda, but only after that date," Cardenas added. [passage omitted]
