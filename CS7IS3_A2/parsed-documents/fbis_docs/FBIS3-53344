[Malluh] We have from the very beginning, since the Madrid conference, opposed the proposed settlement. We opposed it while Syria was involved in it. Therefore, our opposition was not directed against the Palestinian party alone, and it did not start with the signing of the Oslo agreement. Of course, as a Palestinian faction, our role and action should concentrate on the Palestinian arena. At the same time, we believe that the current negotiations will yield certain results between Syria and Israel and between Jordan and Israel. We in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine believe it is unfair to view us from the perspective of our presence in Syria. The front is not hostage to this or that place. We are present where the Palestinian people are. I would not be revealing a secret when I say that our organizational presence in Syria is the weakest link of our presence as far as we are concerned. This is due to the size of the Palestinian presence in Syria. So our opposition is not linked to this or that Arab party. True, we may face some difficulties if the Syrian-Israeli negotiations achieve results in the near future, but this will not change our position on the settlement and its threats to the [Palestinian] cause. When we believe in a political stand, we will not allow the geography factor to influence us. You remember our position in the unity experience of 1987, the war of the camps, and other events. We are interested in finding positions for ourselves. It is our right to do so in order to move freely and say what we believe in. Our search for contradictions in the settlement equation in order to benefit from it is one thing, but our position on the Oslo agreement and its liquidationst results is another. [passage omitted]
