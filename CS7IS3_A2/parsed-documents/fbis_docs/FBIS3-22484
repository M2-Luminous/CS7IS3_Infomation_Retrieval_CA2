The latest number of cases was announced by the Deputy Minister of Health and Child Welfare, Cde. Tsingirirai Hungwe, at the launching ceremony of a book on workplace-based initiatives on combating AIDS in Harare on Monday. Cde. Hungwe, however, said because of the extensive under-reporting, the NACP estimated that the real total was likely to be three times higher, that is, about 70,000 cases. "But AIDS is the only terminal stage of HIV infection, and it is the number of new infections that is of most concern. Surveillance of ante-natal mothers at a number of clinics around the country indicates a continuing rise in new infections," she said. Cde. Hungwe said at several sites, infection levels of more than 30 percent had been recorded. More than a third of the women tested had HIV infection and would almost certainly progress to AIDS within a few years. In Zimbabwe the incubation period was estimated at about seven years. "For every woman reported with HIV, there is likely to be an infected man. Total AIDS cases in men are slightly higher than reported cases in women, which may reflect a bias of more men gaining access to medical treatment and testing," she said. What made HIV infection and AIDS critical concerns, apart from the numbers of cases and the rate of increase, was the age range of those infected and dying. The majority occurred in adults of working age. The AIDS epidemic had resulted in demoralisation as colleagues and workmates became sick and die. Coupled to that was absenteeism as workers took time off to attend funerals or nurse sick relatives. "In the long run, productivity will suffer and companies will experience increasing difficulty in coping with labour shortage and turnover," she said. The World Health Organisation estimated that there were around 13 million HIV infections in adults by mid-1993 and about one million babies had contracted the virus, many of whom had already died.
