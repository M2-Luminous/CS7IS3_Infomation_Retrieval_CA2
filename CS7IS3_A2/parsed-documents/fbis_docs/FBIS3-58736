The latest figure, which Bundeswehr leaders did not expect to be so high, was part of the savings package the government and coalition want to use to bridge a budget deficit of DM5 billion. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (CDU) and other ministers affected by the cuts will meet Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on 17 January. The Bundestag group leadership is to hold discussions on 18 January, and on 19 January the budget committee is to discuss the necessary cuts, the paper adds. The Defense Ministry leadership and defense experts in the government coalition were planning to absorb most of the latest cuts within the existing structures and with a planned Bundeswehr size of 370,000 men. The Defense Ministry hoped that these would be the last cuts and that the Bundeswehr would have a budget of DM47.5 billion at its disposal from 1995, as agreed between the chancellor and the finance and defense ministers.
