Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk issued a decree late on Tuesday [15 March] to ban the Crimean poll because of its being out of line with the Ukrainian Constitution and laws. The Crimean referendum ordered by Meshkov is designed to elicit an answer to two questions. One is on relations between Simferopol and Kiev and the other on dual citizenship. Meshkov said that such questions "are to be decided locally and not by Kiev" warning against attempts to try to deprive the public of its right to freedom of expression. He said that an administrative ban was an on-off affair because the referendum issue might resurface within a week or a month again. "There is a body of opinion which Kiev may find more useful to know of than Simferopol", Meshkov said adding that he saw no reason for further discussion on that score.
