The commitment was reiterated today by Luigi Amaduzzi, diplomatic advisor to Italian Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, in a reply to a letter received on the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the Human Rights Charter, from the president of the Italy-Kuwait Association, Pierandrea Vanni. The association's letter sought to bring to the attention of the head of state the problem of around 800 Kuwaiti prisoners still held illegally in Iraqi territory despite the fact the war in the area is over. The Italian government has closely followed the evolution of this "tragic inheritance" of the Gulf War and has worked, in all opportune forums, to find a solution to the problem, according to Amaduzzi in his reply. He went on to say that Iraqi officials must understand the compelling need to respect basic human rights. The Italy-Kuwait Association was formed in Florence two years ago.
