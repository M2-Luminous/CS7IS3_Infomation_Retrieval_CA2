As a member and especially as a leader of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] my ethical responsibility and personal convictions have forced me to make the following statement: It is the fundamental responsibility of the president of the PRI-CEN to maintain the PRI's unity and guide its forces in accordance with the fundamental principles and values that we have always maintained. Under such circumstances, any conduct motivated by personal ambitions could cause divisions within the party. To allow this would be very serious and irresponsible, to encourage it would betray the party's traditional order. The death of our friend and comrade, Luis Donaldo Colosio, has generated unprecedented conditions for the party. Luis Donaldo was an exemplary member of the PRI; his pledges will continue to be ours. His proposals of change with security and responsibility will continue to be our political undertaking. Nothing better than this undertaking to keep his democratic example and his guiding presence alive. Thus, I consider it my unavoidable duty to say that as the PRI national leader I do not aspire to be nominated as a candidate to the presidency of the Republic. To aspire to such a nomination from the position I hold within the party would be disloyal to the political institution to which I owe unwavering adherence and fidelity. To do that would be to take advantage of a situation and it would thus be unacceptable. Such an aspiration would also violate my personal convictions and the pledge I made when I took the oath as president of the party's CEN. No action is minor in the effort to strengthen and fortify our party. The PRI's traditional roots and basic elements demand that each of its members and leaders zealously fulfill their duty to keep the party solid and strong. Any dispersion of the PRI's forces will constitute a serious risk to the party's unity and stability, especially now, when it is absolutely necessary for us to close ranks around our principles, loyalties, institutions, laws, and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Nothing is more important for a member of the PRI -- and more so for the president of the PRI -- than to preserve and strengthen the value that the party's unity has always held for us. The president of the PRI must not lean in anyone's favor, let alone in his own favor. That is all, gentlemen. Thank you very much.
