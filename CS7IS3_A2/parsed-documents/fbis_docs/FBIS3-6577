We are also ready to react [taehang]. However, Mr. Song, your side has to deeply consider the dear price of the war. Seoul is not far from here. If a war breaks out, it will be a sea of fire. Mr. Song, it will probably be difficult for you to survive. [Song Yong-tae] What are you talking about? [Pak] Wait, therefore... [Song] Then, do you think we will just sit back?

Respond to war with war? [Pak] That's right. Clearly. [Song] Why do you talk about war at the place of talks? [Pak] Because your side declared a war. [end recording]
