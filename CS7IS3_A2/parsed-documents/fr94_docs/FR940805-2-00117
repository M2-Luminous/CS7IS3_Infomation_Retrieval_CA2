FR940805-2-00117 FR940805-2-00059 [Release No. 34&hyph;34465; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;30] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Stopping of Option Orders by Market-Makers and Designated Primary Market-Makers July 29, 1994. I. Introduction On June 24, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposal that establishes procedures for permitting market makers and designated primary market makers to grant stops to option orders. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 When a market maker of DPM agrees to a floor broker's request to ``stop'' a market order, the market maker of DPM is obligated to execute the order at the best bid or offer, or better if obtainable. The stopped order then becomes the new inside bid or offer. Notice of the proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33013 (Oct. 4, 1993), 58 FR 53005. No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the CBOE proposal. II. Description of the Proposal The Exchange states that the purpose of the Rule is to implement a comprehensive method for executing ``stopped'' options transactions on the Exchange, comparable to stopping rules that are in operation at other exchanges. The proposed rule change provides that an Exchange market-maker (``market-maker'') or designated primary market-maker (``DPM'') is authorized, though not required, to grant a stop on an option transaction and that a floor broker is authorized, but not required, to accept a stop. In addition, the proposed rule change sets forth the conditions which attach to a market-maker's or DPM's granting of a stop. A ``stop'' is defined as a guarantee that an option order will be executed at the stop price or better. The Exchange believes that the practice of stopping an option order provides many benefits for marketplace participants, market-makers or DPMs, floor brokers, and customers alike. The Exchange also believes a stop benefits the customer by providing an opportunity for the floor broker to try to obtain a better price for that customer without risk. According to the Exchange, a stop provides one means whereby a floor broker may satisfy the ``due diligence'' standard which he or she is required to meet under Exchange rules and enables the floor broker to lock in a desirable price while attempting to better that price. Additionally, the Exchange believes that a stop also provides the market-maker or DPM with an opportunity to compete for order flow by better meeting the needs of floor brokers, and it provides additional price discovery for the trading crowd. The conditions under which an Exchange market-maker or DPM may grant, and a floor broker may accept, a stop are set forth in paragraph (b) of the proposed rule. First, a market-maker or DPM granting a stop on a straight order or on only the option portion of a buy-write transaction must make the trading crowd and the Order Book Official aware of the terms, price, and size of the stop. Second, all stopped orders must be time-stamped by the floor broker at the time the stop is granted. Third, a market-maker or DPM must be prepared to execute, if requested, one or more additional orders up to, but not to exceed in aggregate, the total quantity of contracts executed in the original stopped transaction at the same stop price or better. Fourth, floor brokers are required to either execute the stopped order at the stop price and size at the time a transaction occurs in the crowd at the stop price, or to release the market-maker or DPM from his or her guarantee. Finally, proposed Exchange Rule 8.17(b)(5) describes how a floor broker must bid or offer to improve on the stop price guarantee: ``In improving on the stop price once a floor broker has accepted a stop, a floor broker must bid no more than one fractional trading increment less than the stop and must offer no more than one fractional trading increment greater than the stop. A fractional trading increment is the minimum fractional change allowed for bids and offers consistent with [Exchange] Rule 6.42.'' When attempting to better the stop price, any bid or offer that improves the established market for a particular option series would be reflected on the screen. 4 4 Telephone conversation between Barbara Casey, CBOE, and Stephen M. Youhn, Derivative Products Regulations, SEC (July 14, 1994). Paragraph (c) of the Rule establishes priority for ``stopped'' orders over new crowd orders, excluding the public limit order book, when the stop order is properly granted, accepted, and time-stamped by the floor broker at the time the stop is granted and accepted. Paragraph (d) of the Rule requires notice be given to a customer by the floor broker or member organization within a reasonably practicable time after that customer's order has been stopped. Paragraph (e) of the Rule details the reporting requirements applicable to the execution of stopped orders on the tape and on cards used for reporting Exchange transactions. Paragraph (f) of the Rule addresses the effect of a trading halt on the priority and pricing of a stopped order. This aspect of the Rule, which the Exchange asserts is substantially the same as an American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'') provision covering the same subject, establishes procedures for the benefit of customers by requiring the floor broker to use due diligence to obtain any better price at which an option might re-open after a halt, while maintaining priority at the stop price if the reopening is at that price or an inferior price. Finally, paragraph (g) of the Rule explicitly states that the market-maker granting the stop is held to that guarantee by placing the liability for correcting an erroneous or inaccurate price on the market-maker or DPM that granted the stop. III. Discussion The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest. 5 In addition, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirement under Section 11(b) of the Act and the rules thereunder that require specialist transactions to be consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. 6 5 15 U.S.C 78f(b)(5) (1982). 6 15 U.S.C. 78k (1982) and 17 CFR 240.11b&hyph;1. The Commission notes that CBOE Rule 8.1 provides that ``[R]egistered Market-Makers are designated as specialists on the Exchange for all purposes under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Rules and Regulations thereunder.'' Accordingly, market-makers are considered specialists for the purposes herein. Historically, the Commission has been concerned about the practice of granting stopped orders. In the 1963 Report of the Special Study of Securities Markets, 7 the Commission commented that in many instances ``[t]he practice of stopping stock against orders on the specialist's book *␣*␣* involves too great a compromise of the specialist's fiduciary obligation for personal profit without any offsetting gain to his market making function.'' 8 The Special Study's concern with stopping stock was that unexecuted customer limit orders on the specialist's book would be bypassed by the stopped order. The Commission, nevertheless, has allowed the practice of stopping stock in markets where the spread is twice the minimum variation because the possible harm to orders in the book would be offset by the possibility of price improvement when the spread between the bid and offer is reduced. 9 7 SEC, Report of the Special Study of Securities Markets of the Securities and Exchange Commission, H.R. Doc. No. 95, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., Pt. 2 (1963). 8 Id. at 166. 9 See Amex Rule 109(c); New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') Rule 116.30. The Commission has also approved, on a pilot program basis, proposals by the NYSE and Amex that permit stopping stock in minimum variation markets under certain limited circumstances where there is an imbalance on the opposite side from the order being stopped, and the imbalance is of sufficient size, given the characteristics of the security, to suggest the likelihood of price improvement. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28999 (March 21, 1991). 56 FR 12964 (March 28, 1991). The Commission believes that the same concerns attendant to the practice of stopping stock are equally applicable to the stopping of options orders. However, the Commission believes the CBOE proposal addresses adequately these concerns by adopting sufficently stringent safeguards. For example, the proposal requires a market-maker or DPM to alert the trading crowd and Order Book Official of the terms, price and size of the stop on a straight order or on the option portion of a buy-write. Second, the proposal also requires a market-maker or DPM to be ready to execute additional orders equal to the total quantity of contracts executed in the original stopped transaction at the stopped price. The Commission believes these conditions will serve to enhance market depth and liquidity by increasing the trading opportunities available to the crowd by apprising them of the order and allowing them to better the current market, and by giving other orders the opportunity to receive the stopped price.
