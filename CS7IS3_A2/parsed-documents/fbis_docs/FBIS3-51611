In a communique published in Guadalajara, the bishops condemned violence and announced a National Drive for Peace and Justice in Chiapas to be held on Sunday to collect money and other contributions for people affected by the armed conflict. The document says the Chiapas conflict "should serve as a warning of the inherent danger of abandoning the poor lower classes," and that "the misuse of riches can be an insult to the poverty of others. In this case, extreme poverty is caused by abuse of power and unjust structures that must be corrected," states the eight-point report prepared today. This report is based on a meeting held by the Catholic Church hierarchy on 10 January to analyze the Indian rebellion unleashed in southern Mexico 20 days ago. "We know, above all, that the extreme poverty, abandonment, and scorn under which the peasants and Indians of Chiapas and other areas live are the roots of the violence that has erupted" says the CEM. In this sense, "we believe the economic system rising from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) must keep in mind the needs of the peasants and the Indians and promote a more humane economy", the bishops added. The bishops deny church involvement in the rebellion, which according to initial government reports had the support of "priests and catechists" in the area, including Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas. Ruiz immediately denied the charges and condemned the methods used by the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN). "We cannot allow any suspicion to fall upon our clergymen, priests, or the bishop himself. We know he has always condemned violence," stressed the episcopal communique. After pronouncing itself in favor of a negotiated solution to the armed conflict, the CEM said it would be "reprehensible if the Mexican Army were to transgress while in pursuit of its duties," and asked that the "civilian population be respected, arbitrary acts not be committed when searching for the guilty, and that prisoners be treated" according to international rules. The bishops also appealed to "businessmen, landowners, cattlemen, and all those who influence life in Chiapas," asking them for "actions to alleviate the poor," since extreme poverty is "completely opposed to God's plan."
