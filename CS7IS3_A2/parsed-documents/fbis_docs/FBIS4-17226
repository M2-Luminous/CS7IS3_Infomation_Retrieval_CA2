As it turned out, however, the delegates ended up turning the meeting into the fourth extraordinary congress; this was the only way they could nominate their candidate for president. From the very beginning, the candidacy of Aleksandr Moroz did not raise any doubts. The SPU leader is, of course, one of the most influential politicians in the state and the most authoritative person in the party. [passage omitted] Active work with youth, raising the status of the SPU newspaper TOVARISHCH, stepping up organizational work, and looking for sponsors were listed among the current and most urgent goals of the party. In the opinion of A. Moroz, it was due to the lack of organizational work and finances that only a few SPU members became Supreme Council deputies. Many of the deputies, who delivered reports at this congress, also spoke of the need to work on creating a party image, which remains far too vague: An ordinary person on the street is hardly likely to be able to intelligently answer a question regarding differences between the SPU and the Communist Party of Ukraine [KPU]. The delegates discussed the issue of holding theoretical conferences under the SPU umbrella, as well as the need to establish closer contacts with the mass media (especially going into the elections). An opinion was formulated that the Socialists should use the tactics of social-democrats, which could help increase their membership. [passage omitted] KPU representatives gathered at their plenum on the same day in Kiev to discuss KPU participation in the presidential elections. According to the wish of party lawyers, the plenum was transformed into a conference: In the opinion of KPU lawyers, this made the KPU a subject of the upcoming elections. As one of the KPU leaders, Yriy Solomatin said, there were many deputies (out of some 350 deputies) who opposed party participation in the election campaign. According to KPU platform documents, the existence of presidential power in our state is ill-advised. After a lively discussion, a decision was adopted to draft a statement declaring that the KPU will continue to regard the presidency in our state as not compatible with the national mentality, however, KPU will participate in the elections nonetheless because the voting will take place irrespective of the Communists' attitude toward them. According to Yu. Solomatin, "given the current sociopolitical situation," the KPU has to participate in the election campaign. The KPU will use this campaign to propagate its ideas. [passage omitted] As a result, the conference decided to nominate its leader, Petr Simonenko, as a candidate for president. Petr Simonenko, who already knew that the SPU congress had nominated Aleksandr Moroz as a candidate, proposed that his party colleagues support Moroz's candidacy. However, the KPU did not alter its decision. [passage omitted]
