Now living in Prague, this Vienna-educated prince is one of the most committed spokesmen voicing the hopes and frustrations of Central Europe with regard to Brussels' partial opening up to the new democracies. [Gautier] What are your views on the Conference on Stability that opens today in Paris and that will attempt to solve the problems of good-neighborliness between the countries of Central Europe? [Schwarzenberg] Can you imagine a roundtable organized in Biscay, in the French Basque country, organized so that France, Spain, Ireland, and Britain could discuss the Basque and Irish problems under the benevolent supervision of the Czechs and the Americans? No? Neither can I. [Gautier] But doesn't the "Balladur plan" provide the new democracies with a forum to talk about their problems? [Schwarzenberg] All this reminds me of the story concerning my great grandfather, a very wise man who lived in the last century. One day he was introduced to some very pretty girls with the aim of getting him to marry one of them. "She is superb," he said, "she will be perfect for my best friend." Well, Mr. Balladur's plan is doubtless superb, but it is solely suited to his best friend. [Gautier] Seen from Prague, does this conference appear destined to fail? [Schwarzenberg] Let me return to my hypothetical "Biscay" roundtable. If it were a roundtable, we would have had to prepare for the Conference on Stability in Europe to get down to some long-term work, especially because by exposing our intimate problems for all the world to see we risk opening a new Pandora's box. The founding fathers of the "Stability Pact" do not have solid experience of the problems in our part of Europe. [Gautier] France and its European neighbors have not, however, spared any efforts to understand the situation in Central Europe. [Schwarzenberg] Karl Kraus, the Austrian author of Last Days of Humanity, once wrote: "Good intentions are the opposite of good politics."[.sup]1[/] I think that this conference was put together by bureaucrats who had plenty of good intentions but whose spirit was too Cartesian. The Europeans will soon run up against prejudices that are deeply rooted in the spirits of their interlocutors. In our part of the world, resentment goes way back in history. [Gautier] In this connection, the Czech Republic, the United States, and even Moscow have been asked to play a mediating role at this conference. Is that not the beginning of a good idea? [Schwarzenberg] In a pinch, the Baltic problem could be compared to the Basque problem. However, if the Russian Federation sits down at the negotiating table as a mediator--and what other role could it play?--it will run into opposition from the Baltic countries, which is understandable. [Gautier] Is not your pessimism out of place when one observes the way in which Europe successfully offered a status to South Tyrol, which is disputed by Austria and Italy? [Schwarzenberg] Of course, but the issue of South Tyrol was limited. It demanded the commitment of two neighbors, both members of the European Community [as published]. [Gautier] What do you think the chances are of saving the Paris Conference? [Schwarzenberg] The kind of problem the conference is studying cannot be resolved with great pomp. France cites the example of the Madrid conference on the Middle East, but Madrid did not yield anything. Only the Oslo negotiations, which were held in secret and spread out over two years, resulted in the agreements on Jericho and Gaza. [Gautier] Speaking of your Slovak neighbor, the problem of the Hungarian minority seemed like a riddle a month ago. Yet, Jozef Moravcik, the new prime minister, has just submitted a bill protecting minority rights, without the help of the Europeans. What does Prague think about that? [Schwarzenberg] The new government in Bratislava has, thank God, taken the exact opposite course of its predecessor's policies. It has decided to tackle the problems of minorities in a pragmatic way. The Slovak Government now needs support not just from its neighbors, but also from Europe as a whole. Footnote 1. Karl Kraus was one of the journalists most feared by the Austro-Hungarian government early in this century.
