The Tanaka cabinet dealt with the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and the Takeshita cabinet with consumption taxes. The Hosokawa cabinet has accomplished its mission of political reform. It will naturally have to change its character and set its next goal. Depending on what the goal will be, the question of whether the present framework is good enough may arise." He indicated that in order to facilitate the implementation of tax reform, which is expected to follow the passage of the fiscal 1994 budget, there may be changes in the composition of the coalition. Among the ruling coalition parties, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa has proposed a "council on basic issues" for the ruling parties to discuss policies, while the Social Democratic Party of Japan and Sakigake [Harbinger] are suspicious of this proposal. Under the circumstances, Aichi's remark is expected to create a stir.
