According to the same sources, this conviction is based on the fact that the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] has only two choices when it comes to attempting to win a new term in power, in view of the fact that the current government has shown itself in just six months' existence to be "incapable of facing up to its minimum responsibilities." These choices would be to hold the general election before the successive timetable of municipal and European elections -- both of which are scheduled for this year -- or else to postpone it "in order not to acknowledge this government's failure so obviously by dissolving it after less than a year's existence," according to People's Party leadership members. Madrid Test The People's Party strategists see this second option as more feasible, so the general election would be held when the echoes of the autonomous community elections are still ringing in political offices. In this connection, particular importance is attached to the results in the Madrid community. "Leguina will not be running, because he himself has said so, and it is for him to say," Alberto Ruiz Gallardon, People's Party spokesman in the Senate, recently assured this newspaper. In the People's Party leadership's opinion, the candidates for the succession to the current Madrid premier are Jose Barrionuevo and, to a lesser extent, Juan Barranco. Barrionuevo worries the People's Party because he is regarded as "a worthy man with an image, and very popular in Madrid." This is not the case with Barranco, "who is always playing a double game" -- referring to his "calculated" fence-sitting between the renewalists and Guerraists -- "in order not to miss any boat," according to the sources. The People's Party believes that the next autonomous community elections are its big chance to govern the Madrid community as an essential step toward reaching the Moncloa Palace, "in view of the showcase status which Madrid has in the rest of the state." Not to win the 51 seats giving an absolute majority in the Madrid Assembly would be deemed a major failure by the People's Party, and Ruiz Gallardon himself acknowledged to YA that "if I do not win a majority, then it will be time to say good-bye." The People's Party takes it for granted that the capital's city council is assured, although the PSOE will seek a `poster' candidate with an image to compete with Alvarez del Manzano. In this case, Genova Street's greatest fear is that the PSOE will opt for Fernando Moran, who is credited with "sufficient pulling power" to threaten the municipal majority. European Elections As a first step in the People's Party strategy for tackling the general election, the debate centers on whether the European elections, scheduled for 12 June, should be tackled as a "primary" or a "special" election, prone to surprises and "exotic, Ruiz Mateos-style" candidacies, according to People's Party leadership members. For the present, the view that Jose Maria Aznar should openly support Abel Matutes' candidacy for Strasbourg seems to be that of the majority, because a victory in Europe -- which the European People's Party deems more than feasible -- would be a good starting point at the national level. Another basic factor which will mark the People's Party strategy for the hypothetical date of October 1995 -- apart from the evolution of the crisis -- will be the outcome of the 33d PSOE Congress, which will reflect -- according to the People's Party leaders consulted -- the party's true correlation of forces, and which therefore will make it possible to guess which candidates the Socialist Party will put forward in the election and especially whether it will continue to set aside its internal differences in order to present an image of unity for the polls. CiU Would Remain Key Factor The People's Party team of election strategists -- a team in which Deputy Secretary General Mariano Rajoy has emerged as the strong man (he will direct the People's Party campaign for the European elections) -- do not trust Felipe Gonzalez' signs of approaching retirement. "He is always giving signs, but never acts," YA was told by the People's Party leadership. Nevertheless, if Gonzalez did not run for the premiership in 1995, the People's Party believes that this would smooth much of its way toward being the party with most votes. However, the strategists themselves take it for granted that this victory will be very far from securing an absolute majority, so the nationalist parties, and specifically Convergence and Union [CiU], would remain a key factor for the stability of the legislative term. People's Party leaders flatly reject the possibility of a "Greek-style pact" with the United Left, and take it for granted that "the PSOE will not wish to burn itself out with us." Relations between CiU and the People's Party are "terrible," it is asserted in the People's Party. However, there is a conviction that, if the situation arose, it could have Catalan support. "Roca would justify himself by saying that he was helping us for the country's good, and in the meantime he would continue to work for Catalonia," the sources state. "But he should be clear," they add, "that we will not be as soft as the PSOE."
