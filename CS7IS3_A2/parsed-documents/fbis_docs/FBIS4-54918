During his visit, the vice chairman met with a number of leading government officials and businessmen, including Democratic Representative Tom Lantos, Thomas Dine, chairman of the Foreign Investment Coordination Committee, and Republican Representative Benjamin Gilman. In his introductory remarks Imre Szekeres said that according to indications, all political parties regard the MSZP as their chief opponent, and that this is understandable because the MSZP enjoys the broadest societal support. In contrast to 1990, political parties running in the present elections will have to accept the decisions made by voters, the vice chairman stressed. He added: The MSZP intends to take the place of the present coalition government, but contrary to certain statements, this does not mean the end of democracy. Relative to the program A HET, Szekeres said that in an unprecedented manner, the chairmen of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] and of Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] were asked to make statements relative to the MSZP; this was done in a manner that no elected officer of the socialists could express his position. In addition, by mentioning a possible dictatorship, party chairmen Lajos Fur and Viktor Orban offended the will of voters, and took the same position as Istvan Csurka. Matyas Szuros, who is not a member of a single elected MSZP body, expressed his own views only; these are not the same as the official situation analysis of the MSZP, and besides, he had no right to judge who could, and who could not be a party member, because he enjoys no support either from the party leadership or the membership, at least insofar as his statements are concerned. In summarizing the experience gained during his trip to the United States, Imre Szekeres emphasized that representatives of political as well as business circles told him that they had no reservations whatsoever about a possible socialist government. The socialist politician reported on the MSZP's foreign policy and economic policy goals, and on the situation that evolved in and around the Hungarian public service media. According to investors and economists, the economic situation is Hungary is extremely critical, and therefore there is a need for changes, and for a strong and effective state to resolve the problems, Szekeres said. In answering questions on anti-Semitism, the vice chairman had reassuring words to say. He made it clear that anti-Semitism in Hungary is not at all stronger than in West Europe, and that political anti-Semitism is not unmanageable either, but having said that, every means must be used to combat anti-Semitism.
