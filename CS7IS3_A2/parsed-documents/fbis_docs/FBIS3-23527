Chumak, candidate of technical sciences, and Lieutenant Colonel A. Manachinskiy, candidate of military sciences] [Text] Foreign military specialists view army aviation as a means that permits sharply increasing the mobility and striking power of army formations and units, effectively countering enemy close air support helicopters and aircraft, suppressing enemy air defense and supporting air delivery of supply items to forward defense areas and to advancing formations and units. Employment of reconnaissance helicopters, which detect and report precise coordinates of targets, is considered to be an important condition for successful performance of missions. On receiving such data, combat helicopters covertly move out to an attack position, quickly gain the altitude needed for detecting and delivering a strike against the target, execute a launch and immediately take cover or return to their basing areas. Below are data on successive operations of a helicopter and on time spent (in seconds) in an attack on armored vehicles. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Climb |5-14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Determine distance to target and leve-|5-12 | |l off helicopter | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Aim, launch and guide ATGM |12-16 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Descend (land) |4-8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To improve helicopter survivability in the zone of dense fire of ground troops' air defense weapons, the following are envisaged in its design: - armoring the cockpit, which permits withstanding the direct hit of 23-mm projectiles; - self-sealing coating of fuel tanks; - redundance of vital helicopter systems; - special glazing of crew cockpit and dulling of blades, which blocks the appearance of revealing glints of light; - cooling of exhaust gases, hampering the craft's detection by IR gear and enemy use of heat-seeking guided missiles. The West continues to search for means of combating combat helicopters. First and foremost, this concerns means of acquisition, above all radars. A helicopter's radar cross-section exceeds the corresponding indicator for an aircraft, but its detection is hampered (especially during a hover for the time of launching an ATGM). The reason lies in the absence of any kind of significant Doppler component of a signal reradiated by an essentially stationary object. It is very difficult to discriminate such a signal against the background of local clutter. Therefore, NATO countries are working to create radars capable of detecting helicopters from the reflection of the sounding radio-frequency signal from main rotor blades (the AN/TPS-36A radar, for example). Experience shows that rotating metal or plastic blades form a characteristic and rather strong reflected signal. The Doppler characteristic of the main rotor, determined by the number of blades and their rotation rate, is a distinctive "portrait" of the helicopter. Its analysis permits not only detecting, but also rather confidently classifying an observed object. Thus, the Helicapture radar developed by the Israeli firm Rafael permits detecting and identifying moving and hovering helicopters. The acquisition range is 9 km, range accuracy is 300 m, and azimuth accuracy 2.5�. The radar antenna is installed on a light tripod. The radar weighs 130 kg. It can operate in a circular or sector scan mode and includes solid-state transceiver, signal processing unit, computer and control system. The signal processing unit helps suppress parasitic reflections from local features and helps determine helicopter type. Target data are shown on the display. The letter H (Helicopter) lights up if the helicopter type is known and the letter U (Unknown) if it is not. The relatively light weight permits installing this radar on a motor vehicle. Radar operation can be controlled remotely, which provides safety for attendant personnel when antiradar missiles are guided to the radar. Another Israeli firm, ELTA Electronic Industries, developed a modernized version of the EL/M-2106 radar, designated the EL/M-2106H. The helicopter acquisition range is 8-10 km and that of an aircraft with a radar cross-section of 2 m[.sup]2[/] is over 16 km. The radar antenna's high scan rate reduces response time and ensures timeliness of target designation for a SAM or AAA system. The new radar can have a fixed or self-propelled design. The latter version provides for operation in movement. France is continuing further development of radars which are part of short-range SAM systems and AAA systems. They include Rodeo-2 and Rodeo-3 radars and pulse-Doppler radars functioning in the 2-3 GHz band. Their characteristic feature is the capability of simultaneously tracking two selected targets during a circular scan of air space. The Swedish firm Ericsson is creating the HARD (Helicopter and Aircraft Radar Detection) radar family, which has a low probability of being intercepted by the enemy. Thus, its specialists were developing the HARD-3D LPI 3-D mobile low-flying target acquisition radar permitting acquisition and tracking both of flying as well as hovering helicopters at ranges of 9-10 km and of aircraft at ranges of 10-12 km with a probability of 0.9. The phased array radar created on a solid-state base operates in the 8-12 GHz band and permits acquisition, identification and tracking (both in place as well as in movement) of 12 airborne targets at altitudes up to 4,000 m. The transmitter has a peak power of 30 watts. The HARD radar can be interfaced with the RBS-70 short-range SAM system or be part of an AAA system. In the United States, the firm Lockheed-Sanders created the P-STAR (Portable Search and Target Acquisition Radar) pulse-Doppler radar intended for acquisition of low-flying targets, including helicopters (40-60 GHz band). Helicopters, including hovering ones, are acquired with the help of a special Doppler frequency analyzer. The main array is supplied with two secondary arrays supporting suppression of sidelobe interference, which permits acquiring targets rather confidently. The liquid-crystal air situation display, which is located up to 100 m from the antenna system, is used for informing the Stinger shoulder-fired SAM system team about low-flying aircraft or helicopters at ranges up to 20 km. The radar is equipped with an IFF system. The French firm of Thomson-CSF created a family of pulse-Doppler radars, the TRS 2620 and 2621, as well as the TRS 2630 Griffon, intended for acquiring hovering helicopters (see table). TRS 2620 TRS 2621 TRS 2630 Griffon Frequency band, GHz 2.0-4.0 2.0-4.0 2.0-4.0 Peak power, watts . 100 or 200 100 or 200 Mean power, watts 20 20 or 40 15 or 30 Acquisition range, km: Moving target 14.7 12 (100 watts) 17 (100 watts) 14 (200 watts) 19.7 (200 watts) Hovering helicopter 8.3 6.8 (100 watts) 9.6 (100 watts) 7.8 (200 watts) 11 (200 watts) Acquisition altitude, 3 2.4 (100 watts) 2.4 (100 watts) km 2.8 (200 watts) 2.8 (200 watts) Range of measured 10 or 40-400 10 or 40-400 40-850 speeds, m/sec Resolution: Azimuth, degrees 9.0 7.8 5.2 Range, m 600 600 600 Accuracy of measuring coordinates: Azimuth 1 degree 10 mrad 10 mrad Range, m 100 60 60 Array Parabolic Planar array Antenna scan rate, 40 40 40 rpm Gain, db 21 22 25.5 Beamwidth in azimuth, 9 7.8 5.2 degrees Polarization Horizontal The radars operate in the 10-cm waveband. Helicopters are detected based on modulation of the echo signal caused by rotation of rotor blades and also by vibrations of the fuselage and main rotor hub. The frequency is changed both by a program and based on results of an analysis of the jamming environment. The radar uses modern signal forming and processing equipment: Solid-state semiconductor transmitter, dual frequency conversion receiver, digital devices for processing the received signal, and a pulse compression circuit. There is a capability of tracking six targets with operator involvement or eight targets with introduction of the automatic tracking mode. The radars are equipped with an IFF system which interrogates up to four targets in a 20� sector. The interrogator antenna is made in the form of a planar array. The TRS 2630 Griffon is the family's most modern version. Because a planar array is used, a lower radiation pattern sidelobe level is achieved: 33-35 db for near lobes and 40 db for far lobes. The sounding signal represents a sequence of 17 pulses and the operating frequency can take on 12 values. A frequency change is possible with each rotation of the antenna for one or eight pulse chains (in accordance with the program loaded into the computer). The echo signal processing gear includes a 12-channel Doppler filter. In case of intense jamming the radar can shift to a passive operating mode in which a special analyzer detects the emission source (jammer) and measures its azimuthal coordinates and operating parameters. Transition to the passive mode is possible in a limited sector. A programmed change in radar emission frequency is made in accordance with data of the jamming analyzer. Two models of the TRS 2620 radar and 48 sets of the TRS 2630 Griffon will be delivered to the French Army under a program for modernizing France's Samantha air defense assets. In addition, an order for acquisition of 22 sets of TRS 2620 radars has been received from the Finnish Army command and an order for eight from Latin American countries. The question of selling this radar to South Korea in the TRS 2630 B100 version, distinguished by increased emissive power (transmitter peak power will be 700 watts), is being considered. In studying the problem of supplementing the radar with alternative information sources on rotary-wing airborne targets, foreign specialists arrived at the conclusion of the possibility of using acoustic sensors. In this case helicopter detection is not limited by line-of-sight conditions, flight regimes, or weather conditions. Operation of acoustic sensors is based on the fact that each type of helicopter creates a specific subsonic emission whose characteristics depend on the speed of rotation and geometry of the main rotor as well as on flight speed. Use of the acoustic band permits detecting helicopters at extremely low altitudes and considerable distances, and identifying them based on characteristics of acoustic vibrations created by helicopters of different types. Such sensors, which have a sound detector and computer in their makeup, can function at any time of day and in all weather conditions without a deterioration of their characteristics. The Swedish firm Swetron already has developed the ground-based Helisearch acoustic system, which permits detecting a helicopter, determining direction and range to it and identifying the type of craft. The British firm Ferranti developed a similar system, Picket. It has a microphone unit and portable signal processing and indication unit. The helicopter detection range is at least 6 km, and information output on a target is updated every two seconds. The helicopter's azimuth, distance to it and flight mode (moving or hovering) light up on a panoramic display. It is believed that six Picket systems deployed with overlapping sectors of responsibility are capable of monitoring a zone with an area of at least 500 km[.sup]2[/]. Self-propelled antiaircraft [SP AA] guns, distinguished by high mobility and rate of fire (up to 3,000-6,000 rounds per minute) with a very slight reaction time (6-12 seconds), can be used very successfully to cover troops against combat helicopter strikes on the battlefield and on the march. They are capable of moving right in troop battle formations, conducting reconnaissance of the enemy in movement and firing from short halts. SP AA gun mounts with automatic and semiautomatic laying systems equipped with pulse-Doppler radars, which support the conduct of battle against diverse airborne targets in any weather, around the clock and in a difficult electronic environment, have been developed abroad at the present time. They are armed with 20-40 mm guns and are capable of bringing fire on helicopters at ranges of 2-4 km. But this is not always sufficient, inasmuch as ranges at which combat helicopters launch ATGM's already have reached 3-4 km, and in the future will increase to 6-8 km. Western developers believe that increasing the range of fire of SP AA guns is simplest by switching to calibers of 57-mm, 76-mm or more. Italy already has developed the Otomatic 76-mm SP AA gun with a unit of fire of 100 rounds. Fire usually is conducted in bursts of 4-5 rounds. The gun's fire control system includes a target acquisition radar with IFF device, millimeter-band monopulse tracking radar, opto-electronic aiming system, two control consoles and a digital computer. Evaluation testing showed that the effective range of fire of the SP AA gun is 6 km and reaction time is five seconds. The chassis of the Palmaria self-propelled howitzer was chosen as its base. The combat weight of the SP AA gun is 46 tonnes. But experts note that an increase in caliber of antiaircraft guns also has negative consequences: The gun's rate of fire drops, the unit of fire decreases because of increased projectile weight, and errors occur more often in firing at long distances. These circumstances prompted developers to seek an opportunity to correct the projectile's flight path in the target area. A solution was found by fitting it with an impulse correction motor consisting of six small explosive charges contained in the projectile body. By starting the appropriate motor it is possible to change the projectile's path within limits of 10� in any direction relative to the velocity vector by commands from a ground fire control system. The command receiver is contained in the base of the projectile, and its antenna, in the form of a four-element crossed array, is on the stabilizer fins. It is assumed that such a projectile, supplied with proximity and impact fuzes, will permit successfully combating helicopters at ranges of 8-10 km. It is also reported that its cost is 5-10 times higher than usual, but in the opinion of foreign specialists, with a 50-percent target kill probability, this is a fully advantageous alternative to SAM systems. Work also is being done to create a projectile guided by a laser beam. It has a sensor for determining angular deflection from the line-of-sight, which is used to control operation of gas switches of the steering mechanism and change the flight path. It is believed that the projectile's guidance along a laser beam in combination with a proximity fuze will ensure a target kill probability of 0.5-0.7. One new approach to increasing the destructive capacity of antiaircraft projectiles when fired against combat helicopters with rather powerful armoring is the use of fragmentation projectiles with a tungsten core. It is proposed to use tank guns to combat helicopters. Tank tube angle of elevation is sufficient for bringing fire on a helicopter hovering above the ground for launching ATGM's, and the burst of a large-caliber projectile (105-mm or 120-mm) several meters from the target is guaranteed to destroy it. But artillery systems are incapable of solving all problems of antihelicopter warfare. Thus, despite swift reaction, an SP AA gun cannot always open fire in time if a helicopter approaches the strike target covertly over the shortest distance, taking advantage of terrain relief features. In such cases, it is desirable to have a means of engaging the target beyond its line-of-sight limits. Such a task is accomplished within the scope of the U.S. FAADS forward area air defense program, which envisages creation of the FOG-M SAM system with the capability of over-the-horizon combat against low-flying airborne targets and moving armored ground targets. The SAM system has a missile with TV camera, and a fiber-optic two-way data transmission cable channel will be used for its guidance. In addition to a television head, it is planned to outfit the missile with a thermal imaging head operating in the 3.5-4.2 micron band. Foreign specialists are considering the question of creating a general-purpose SAM system for air and antitank defense on a platform that rises into the air. They believe that such a system will permit increasing the effectiveness of combating helicopters and other low-flying targets, with a simultaneous reduction in vulnerability of combat teams because of the possibility of its covert employment from behind natural cover. The foreign press reports that the United States is conducting research aimed at creating an antihelicopter mine (AHM). It will receive information on targets from acoustic detectors, which are to be set up in pairs on likely avenues of helicopter approach. This will permit detecting the helicopter and determining its coordinates by triangulation. When a helicopter approaches a certain line, a mine is fired at a signal from the sensors. Its IR homing head determines the most advantageous detonation conditions, as a result of which, it is asserted, total destruction of the helicopter ensues. In addition, according to the developers' thinking, the threat of encountering such a weapon at extremely low altitudes should force helicopters to go higher, where air defense weapons will be able to operate effectively against them. The firms of Textron Defense Systems and Texas Instruments in the United States and Ferranti-Eliant Techsystems in Great Britain took part in developing the antihelicopter mine concept. The Textron Defense Systems mine, which weighs 182 kg, has a jamproof ground sensor acoustic array which detects, classifies, identifies and tracks a rotary-wing target. All-around fragment coverage of the target area in the azimuthal plane with an increased casualty radius permits the mine to act against low-flying helicopters. Judging from available information, helicopters may be engaged at altitudes up to 200 m. The mine can be used in the forest and in limited areas because of a change in trajectory of the impact core formed when the charge is triggered. The mines are laid using the MLRS, the Volcano cluster mining system, and manually. There are provisions for switching off the mine in case friendly forces pass through the area where emplaced. Remote switch-on and switch-off are supported by reliable two-wire communications. Ferranti-Eliant Techsystems developed an antihelicopter mine weighing 10 kg with a diameter of 180 mm and a length of 335 mm, which is capable of killing targets flying at speeds up to 350 km/hr and at heights of 100 m and higher. The two-mode passive acoustic-IR sensor is jamproof and guarantees precise aiming. Identification of nationality is performed by a passive, nonemitting means. Deployed on the terrain, the AHM mine operates autonomously, but can be supplied with control and monitor modules supporting its remote arming and shut-off. In addition to ground assets, air-based systems can combat helicopters. The ATAS (Air-to-Air Stinger) antihelicopter system has already been developed. It includes a launcher accommodated aboard a rotary-wing craft and designed for 2 or 4 Stinger guided missiles. Their employment is being worked out in OH-58C and D, AH-64A Apache and AH-1 helicopters. A standard launcher weighs 43 kg with two missiles and 100 kg with four. The first model of the ATAS system was demonstrated in late 1979 and early 1980 aboard a Lynx helicopter. A helicopter can be armed with guns. Thus, the M230 Chain Gun 30-mm aircraft gun (installed on AH-64A Apache helicopters) provides acceptable accuracy of engaging the airborne enemy at a distance up to 3 km; the 20-mm gun (on the Huey Cobra) successfully engages targets at a distance of up to 1.5 km; and the fire of the 7.62-mm machinegun installed aboard a helicopter is effective at a range up to 1 km. A program for equipping helicopters with air-to-air missiles was begun in France in 1986. The Mistral SAM is being considered for these purposes. It is planned to install it on Gazelle, Tiger and AH-64A Apache helicopters. In 1988 the British firm Short Brothers together with the U.S. firm McDonnell Douglas developed an air-to-air missile launcher which will be accommodated on the AH-64A Apache and serve for firing the Hellstrike missile against airborne targets. The firm Westland is refitting the Lynx helicopter as a reconnaissance version in which the TOW ATGM will be replaced by an air-to-air weapon system. The Stinger shoulder-fired SAM system (General Dynamics) or Hellstrike with turret-mounted machinegun or gun (Short Brothers) are being considered as models. The Swedish firm Bofors is studying the possibility of accommodating RBS-70 missiles on helicopters. The U.S. Army is showing interest in developing a general-purpose system for combating airborne targets and tanks (HTDM-Helicopter Team Defense Missile). It is presumed that OH-58 reconnaissance helicopters and the AH-64A Apache combat helicopter will be equipped with it. The foreign press reports that the question of using drones for detecting helicopters is being considered. NATO specialists believe that installing television cameras and forward-looking IR gear on drones substantially improves the speed of receiving video intelligence and permits sharply expanding the number of its users with minimum costs. Commanders and staffs at all levels will be able to monitor in real time individual axes or zones that are most dangerous from the standpoint of helicopters and make an adequate decision in the shortest time. In addition, because of the absence of a pilot aboard, the drone can operate under conditions of increased risk beyond the front line. A number of firms are engaged in developing new target detection sensors for outfitting the latest unmanned means, designated HELTK (Helicopter Killer). The Brave 200 drone was chosen as its base. It is to be supplied with a millimeter-band radar and processor, which will enable it to independently detect and identify a helicopter under conditions of powerful ground clutter.
