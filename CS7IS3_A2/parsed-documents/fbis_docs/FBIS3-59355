Authorities are optimistic that next year will see an acceleration of reform and progress. In 1994, the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy will select 100 medium-sized and large state-owned enterprises as experimental sites for conducting a modern enterprise system in the corporation form. For state-owned small enterprises, the chief measures taken will be combination leases, auction or sale, lease prior to sale, while some enterprises can also remold themselves according to the joint stock system. At present, for a great many of enterprises which lack the prerequisites for remolding into corporations, the key is to implement the "Enterprise Law," "Rules for Transforming the Operational Mechanism," and the "Rules for Supervising State-Owned Assets," linking enterprises' rights of self-operation with the system of property rights supervision, to give positive impetus to property rights system reform. The impetus for pricing reform will continue in the next year, with cancellation at the earliest possible date of the dual-track pricing system for means of production, acceleration of the process of marketization of key production element pricing, positive reform of the current commodity circulation system, and strengthening and development of a commodity market network. This is an important program of reform. The key points in cultivating a market system are the financial market, the labor force market, the real estate market, the technology market, and the information market. The key points in reform of the revenue system are changing the current local revenue contract system into a tax division system on the grounds of reasonably dividing the rights of the central government and local revenues, setting up systems for central revenue and local revenue, and, meanwhile, implementing a system for refunding and transferring payments to localities from central government revenues to regulate the distribution structure and regional structure. The key points in financial system reform are strengthening the role of the central bank, setting up the central banking system as soon as possible to implement currency policy independently under the leadership of the State Council, regulating and controlling the currency supply to keep currency value stable, separating policy type business and commercial type business in the banking system, organizing and building a policy type bank, changing specialized banks into commercial banks, allowing them to become enterprise type financial organs. The key points in investment system reform will be dividing investment main entities and scope of responsibility along the lines of investment areas, progressively establish risk responsibility for legal person investment and bank credit, confirming the investment scope for government and enterprises, replacing the administrative examination and approval system currently in operation with project registration and maintenance of a file system.
