FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Suzanne Fecteau, Coupon and Retailer Branch, Benefit Redemption Division, Food and Nutrition Service, Alexandria, Virginia, 22302, (703) 305&hyph;2419. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Classification Executive Order 12866 This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purpose of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by OMB. Executive Order 12372 The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set forth in the final rule and related Notice(s) to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983, or 48 FR 54317, December 1, 1983, as appropriate, and any subsequent notices that may apply), this program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;354). The Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service has certified that this action does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule would have almost no impact on the vast majority of authorized firms, most of which follow the program rules carefully. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain recordkeeping or reporting requirements subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Executive Order 12778 This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) for program benefit recipients_state administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020 (e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities) or Part 283 (for rules related to QC liabilities); (3) for program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8. Public Participation and Justification for Less than a Thirty-day Effective Date This action is being finalized without prior notice or public comment under authority of 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A) and (B). The matters addressed by this rulemaking are nondiscretionary. The provisions in this rule have already been implemented and were effective on October 1, 1993. Therefore, the Department has determined in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b) that Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Opportunity for Public Comments is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest and, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d), finds that good cause exists for making this action effective prior to the date of publication.
