The congress, sponsored by the Argentine Justice Ministry, has been described as being of national interest, and has gathered experts from America, Spain, Italy, and Belgium, among other countries. This congress, which will hold sessions until 20 May, has been inspired by the issue of "the integration of Ibero-America." The four key issues of this congress are state reform, community law, the rights and liberties of individuals, and technological compatibility. Upon inaugurating the sessions, Menem said: "It is essential to keep abreast through growth because it is not possible to grow and advance unless we prepare our communities." Menem emphasized: "Information is important, but communication is more important still. We cannot be free unless we abide by the laws, but wise laws." For his part, Justice Minister Jorge Maiorano said at noon today: "If we assume that it is true that information science is linked to power, then we are astonished by the rapid changes." Maiorano also stressed: "Technological progress must serve human beings." He emphasized that "the use of information science for the benefit of humanity" is in the hands of the participants of this congress. In addition to Menem and Maiorano, Rio Negro Vice Governor Edgardo Gagliardi and Bariloche Mayor Maria Severino de Costa, among other authorities, were present at the inauguration ceremony.
