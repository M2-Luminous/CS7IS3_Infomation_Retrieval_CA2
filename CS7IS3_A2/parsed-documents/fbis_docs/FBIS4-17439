The press service of the Nagorno-Karabakh defense army reported to Interfax that over the previous 24 hours active hostilities were being waged on the greater part of the confrontation line. Fierce hostilities do not stop at the south-eastern part of the Karabakh front where the Azerbaijani forces try to break the defense line on the Martunin and Fizuli directions being supported by a great number of armored vehicles and combat aviation. According to the press service, last night Karabakh positions were attacked at two sections of Karabakh's Martunin region, near the populated center of Kuropatkino and in the region of Agburun. Experiencing great losses (according to preliminary information, as many as 50 soldiers were killed on mine fields), the Azerbaijani army managed to move forward and to seize three Karabakh posts. However, in two hours, the Karabakh formations started a counterattack and by the morning of April 23 moved the adversary to his starting positions. The Karabakh army lost two people were killed and nine wounded in the course of these hostilities. Simultaneously the headquarters of the Karabakh defense army refuted information of Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry stating that a great number of fighters had allegedly joined the Azerbaijani army. These reports have been qualified "as pure falsification intended to conceal facts of mass desertion of Azerbaijani soldiers." The border of the former Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous region has been practically restored after the recent counterattack of the Karabakh forces which liberated six villages in the north of the Mardakert region, the leader of the Karabakh army press center Serzh Arushanian reported to Interfax. In his words, as of today only a small territory of the Mardakert region which includes several villages, including the largest village Leninavan in the north-east of the region is still under control of the Azerbaijani forces. In addition, Arushanian said that the Shaumian region is still occupied though it has been part of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic since September 1991.
