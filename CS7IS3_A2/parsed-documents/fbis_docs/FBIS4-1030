In anticipation of armed conflict, AWB members' wives and children were last week sent to "safe havens" on farms in the Eastern Transvaal. Apart from stockpiling food, other signs of preparations for war include the purchase by rightwingers of at least 30 Saracen armoured vehicles at SADF [South African Defense Force] auctions over the last month. Sources said the AWB's plans centred on a "mini-secession" of certain towns in the Western Transvaal -- including Ottosdal and Schweizer-Reneke, which in recent months granted their "freedom" to the para-military AWB Wenkommando [Victory Commando]. Other sources said there were indications that parts of the Eastern Transvaal and Pretoria could be simultaneously declared "independent in the week before the election. The AWB allegedly has plans to blockade the towns to make the election impossible in these areas. Although it is envisaged the secessions will be achieved peacefully, sources close to the AWB fear that it will provoke the SADF and black inhabitants of the towns to react. Some are pinning their hopes on KwaZulu/Natal erupting into anarchy and tying down the security forces to the extent that they will not be able to act in the Western Transvaal. Three rightwing sources said that women and children have been sent to "safe havens" on Eastern Transvaal farms. Of the Saracen armoured vehicles bought over the past month, a [Orange] Free State rightwinger has bought two, while parties linked to the Pretoria Boerehommando [Boer commando] Group and the Akasia Town Council have also shown interest.
