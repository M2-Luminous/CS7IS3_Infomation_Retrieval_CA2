(vi) Grant funds provided under this program and any State, tribal, or local funds used to supplement grant funds under this program may not be used to replace other public funds previously used, or designated for use, for the purpose of this program. (See, section III.(a)(2)(vi). (d) Selection Criteria Each application for a grant award that is submitted in a timely manner to the local HUD field office or, in the case of IHAs, to the appropriate HUD Office of Native American Programs, and that otherwise meets the requirements of this NOFA, will be evaluated. An application must receive a minimum score of 75 points out of the maximum of 120 points that may be awarded under this competition to be eligible for funding. Grants will be awarded to the three highest-ranked, eligible PHA applications within each of the following 10 groupings of Area and State Offices: New England, New York, New Jersey, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, Great Plains, Rocky Mountain, Southwest, Northwest/Alaska, Pacific/Hawaii. In addition, grants will be awarded to the three highest-ranked, eligible IHA applications on a nation-wide basis, subject to the following condition: Of the total grants awarded to IHAs, the Director of ONAP retains the authority to insure that each Field Office of Native American programs receives a minimum of one eligible grant. This means that before an award is made to an IHA from the jurisdiction of a Field ONAP in which an IHA has already received an award, that award may be made to the next highest scoring IHA from the jurisdiction of a Field ONAP in which no IHA has yet received an award. All of the remaining eligible applications, both PHAs and IHAs, will then be placed in overall nation-wide ranking order, with the remaining funds granted in order of rank, except as discussed above for IHAs, until all funds are awarded. The following criteria will be used to evaluate eligible applications: (1) The extent to which the Youth Sports activities to be assisted with the grant address the particular needs of the area to be served by the activities and employs methods, approaches, or ideas in the design or implementation of the activities particularly suited to fulfilling the needs (whether such methods are conventional or unique and innovative). (Maximum points: 25). In assessing this criterion, HUD will consider the following factors: (i) The appropriateness of the applicant's methods, approaches, or ideas in addressing the particular needs of the area to be served by the program, as reflected in the description of the services to be provided by the applicant's proposed Youth Sports Program (section III.(a)(3) of this NOFA); (10 points)
