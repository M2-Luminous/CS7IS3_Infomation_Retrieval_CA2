This was the decision adopted by the party's third convention held in Moscow on January 26. The political resolution of the convention says that the party will back the president if the government policy "gives priority to financial stabilization, tangible support for entrepreneurship, reduction of taxes and taxation reform and providing the right climate for economic restructuring." The party thinks that the situation in the country "may culminate in increased social tension and economic hardships." Still, President Yeltsin is said to have a real potential to prevent this development if he "forms a government of reforms rather than a coalition government sheltering behind reformist phraseology." "As things stand in Russia today, the president must not agree to the role of an arbiter some would impose on him," the political resolution runs. The party will take an active part in regional and local elections. "It is on success in these elections that the party's future will largely depend," the party chairman Konstantin Borovoy said at a news conference Wednesday. He also said that the Economic Freedom Party intended to interact with democratic and reform forces and would work for a broad democratic coalition in parliament.
