David Levi, head of the Jordan Rift Valley Regional Council, said that the bypass road would be built east of Almog junction near Bet Ha'arava up to the settlement of Na'ama. Our settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman has learned that a permanent road closer to Jericho will be built later. The length of the permanent road will be 17 km. It will have two bridges and will cost 40 million shekels.
