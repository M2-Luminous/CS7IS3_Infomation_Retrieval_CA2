FR940621-1-00022 FR940621-1-00007 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AB73 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Extension of the Final Decision To List the Mobile River System Population of the Alabama Sturgeon as an Endangered Species With Critical Habitat AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule; notice of 6 month extension of deadline and reopening of the comment period. SUMMARY: On June 15, 1993 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposed to determine endangered status for the Alabama sturgeon ( Scaphirhynchus suttkusi ) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Act requires the Service to make a final determination on such proposals within 12 months, but provides for a 6 month extension if there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to that determination. The Service finds that there is such a substantial disagreement concerning whether the Alabama sturgeon continues to exist and therefore extends the deadline with respect to the decision to list the Alabama sturgeon. DATES: The deadline for final action on the proposal is now December 15, 1994. The public comment period is reopened until September 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and material should be sent to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Asheville Field Office, 330 Ridgefield Court, Asheville, North Carolina 28806. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Richard G. Biggins at the above Asheville address (704/665&hyph;1195, Ext. 228) or Mr. Robert S. Butler, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 6620 Southpoint Drive South, Suite 310, Jacksonville, Florida 32216 (904/232&hyph;2580). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This sturgeon, which is endemic to the Mobile River system in Alabama and Mississippi and was once widespread in this system, has had a significant decline in both population size and range in the Mobile River system. The fish may currently exist in only a short, free-flowing reach of the Alabama River below Claiborne Lock and Dam in Clarke and Monroe Counties, Alabama. Primary factors that have likely contributed to the sturgeon's decline include dams, altered river flows, gravel-mining operations, general habitat degradation from land use practices, and, perhaps, overfishing, particularly at the turn of the century. The Alabama sturgeon, once called the Alabama shovelnose sturgeon, or just shovelnose sturgeon, has been recognized since 1976 as a distinct, undescribed taxon (Ramsey 1976) that is most similar to the shovelnose sturgeon ( Scaphirhynchus platorynchus ) of the Mississippi River system and the Rio Grande. The Alabama sturgeon is a relatively small sturgeon; the maximum standard length is about 72 centimeters (28 inches). It has an elongated, heavily armored, depressed body and an attenuated caudal peduncle. The caudal fin has a long filament on the upper lobe that is characteristic of the genus. Sexual dimorphism is slight. Morphological characteristics of the juvenile Alabama sturgeon are unknown. The Alabama sturgeon can generally be distinguished from the shovelnose sturgeon of the Mississippi River system. The Alabama sturgeon almost always has larger eyes, it has different plate numbers posterior to the anal fin, there is a difference in dorsal fin ray numbers, and there are three diagnostic characters associated with its head armature (Mayden and Kuhajda 1994). The Alabama sturgeon is known only from the Mobile River system of Alabama and Mississippi. Historically, this sturgeon was found in the Mobile, Tensas, Alabama, Tombigbee, Black Warrior, Cahaba, Tallapoosa, and Coosa Rivers of the Mobile River system (Burke and Ramsey 1985). The only recent confirmed record (since about 1985) of the Alabama sturgeon is from the free-flowing portion of the Alabama River below Claiborne Lock and Dam. The Alabama sturgeon was once common in Alabama. In a statistical report to Congress in 1898 (U.S. Commission of Fish and Fisheries 1898), the total catch of shovelnose sturgeon from Alabama was 19,500 kilograms (kg) (42,900 pounds (lb)). Of this total, 18,000 kg (39,500 lb) came from the Alabama River, 1,000 kg (2,300 lb) from the Black Warrior River, and 500 kg (1,100 lb) from the Tennessee River. The shovelnose sturgeon reported from the Alabama and Black Warrior Rivers was the Alabama sturgeon; the sturgeon from the Tennessee River was from the Mississippi River system shovelnose sturgeon population. Any anonymous article in the Alabama Game and Fish News in 1930 stated that the Alabama sturgeon was ``not uncommon.''
