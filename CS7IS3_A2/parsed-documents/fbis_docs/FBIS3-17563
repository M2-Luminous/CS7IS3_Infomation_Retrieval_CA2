"It is impossible to solve the Abkhazian conflict without introduction of peacekeeping forces into Georgia," Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze declared at a press conference on Friday in Moscow. In his words, this issue was being discussed during the recent visit of the head of the Georgian state Eduard Shevardnadze to New York. It was also discussed in Paris where Shevardnadze met with the UN General Secretary Butrus-Ghali. Chikvaidze pointed out that deployment of the UN peacekeeping forces and all preparatory operations will take three months. "But the time goes on and forces should be introduced as soon as possible. We hope for Russia. The thing is that Russia does not want to undertake anything unilaterally. It's quite clear because if Moscow coordinates its actions with the UN then this organization will finance peacemaking operations of the Russian troops," said Chikvaidze. In his words, it is necessary to work out a mechanism providing for the return of 300,000 Georgian refugees to Abkhazia. "The presence of such a large amount of refugees creates a tense situation in Georgia and even changes the mentality of the people," said Chikvaidze. "The Abkhazian separatism can make a negative imprint on the situation in other countries, in Russia as well." Responding to our Interfax correspondent, Chikvaidze underlined that Georgia is ready to discuss political status of Abkhazia within Georgia. "I do not know how it would look like, but I can say for sure that Abkhazia will loose nothing minding what it possessed earlier in the sphere of its sovereignty. Now it should determine its position as soon as possible and to develop the country's Constitution together with the leaderships of Georgia, South Ossetia, and other autonomies, according to which we shall be able to live," said Chikvaidze. In response to another question Chikvaidze said that NATO's Partnership for Peace program testifies to the fact that this organization "is looking for a new role." "The confrontation between military blocks sank into oblivion and NATO should find its ecological screen. This organization should either acquire new function or disband," said he. In Chikvaidze's opinion, the mechanism of Partnership for Peace program implementation "has not been developed till the very end." "If one knocks at the door and asks NATO forces to bring order in Georgia, it will not happen. However, we still do not loose hope that in the future the Partnership for Peace concept will actually help to increase efficiency of peacemaking operations," he concluded.
