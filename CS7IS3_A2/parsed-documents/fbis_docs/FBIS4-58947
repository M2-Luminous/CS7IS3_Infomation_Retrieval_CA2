They demanded that these grants be dedicated to productive services like water and electricity. The members objected to the interference of the American Agency for International Development in the work of artisan associations through the extension of direct loans. They described AID requests for detailed information about the artisan associations involved as an attempt to obtain Egyptian secrets and thus establish U.S. control of craftsmen. The Assembly members pointed out that the agreement to grant small business loans entitles AID to deal directly with any association demanding a loan provided that association agrees to submit its activity to inspection by AID auditors without interference by the Egyptian Government. The members said that the Government has thus waived its rights and created a state within a state. People's Assembly Speaker Dr. Fathi Surur was asked why the Egyptian Government has relinquished its powers and left the associations on their own with AID. Once a grant is given by anyone, it becomes Egyptian. The Government has agreed to let associations benefit from AID grants, he said. State Minister for International Cooperation Dr. Yusuf Butrus-Ghali said that the associations have requested to deal directly with AID and they have rejected the government's intervention on the excuse that it delays loans. [passage omitted] Some members expressed their fears that the U.S. side might specify the associations that will receive loans. Dr. Surur asked the state minister if the United States is entitled to determine which association gets a loan. Dr. Butrus-Ghali replied: The Egyptian Government specifies the associations that can get loans, provided that they have a certified board of directors. He added that 23,000 have obtained loans, averaging 2,200 Egyptian pounds. The rate of repayment is 98.5 percent, he said. MP Salah Tawfiq remarked that the grant in its entirety will not even solve the problems of 4,000 craftsmen in Egypt, where there are millions of craftsmen. He rejected U.S. patronage of craftsmen, noting that the grant might harm Egypt through loans that result in U.S. control of craftsmen. [passage omitted]
