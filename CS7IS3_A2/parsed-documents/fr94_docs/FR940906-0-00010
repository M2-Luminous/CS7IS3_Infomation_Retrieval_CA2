FR940906-0-00010 FR940906-0-00008 38 CFR Part 3 RIN 2900&hyph;AG47 Exclusions From Income AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its regulations concerning exclusions from income. The amendment implements an opinion of VA's General Counsel that the portion of the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy which represents a return of premiums should not be considered income under VA's improved pension program. The intended result is to ensure that countable income is correctly computed when VA determines entitlement to improved pension. EFFECTIVE DATE: This amendment is effective October 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven Thornberry, Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 233&hyph;3005. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of December 17, 1993, VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 3.272 to exclude from income for improved pension purposes that portion of the proceeds from the cash surrender of a life insurance policy which represents a return of premiums (58 FR 65958&hyph;59). A technical correction extending the comment and review period was published in the Federal Register of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 278). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments, suggestions, or objections to the proposal on or before February 15, 1994. Since no comments were received, the proposed amendment is adopted without change. The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason for this certification is that these amendments would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these amendments are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 64.104 and 64.105.
