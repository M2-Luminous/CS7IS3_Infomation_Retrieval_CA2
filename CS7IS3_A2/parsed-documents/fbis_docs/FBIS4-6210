FBIS4-6210 "dreas075_j_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 Indonesia Further Reports on Labor Strikes, Ethnic Unrest Further Reports on Labor Strikes, Ethnic Unrest Violent Riots in Sumatora OW1804115794 Tokyo KYODO in English 1142 GMT 18 Apr 94 OW1804115794 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Jakarta, April 18 KYODO -- Labor-related demonstrations in north Sumatra have spread from the provincial capital to two other cities and turned into violent anti-Chinese riots, military and labor sources said Monday [18 April]. The sources said some 10,000 workers held a three-hour protest Monday morning in Pematangsiantar, 120 kilometers southeast of Medan and 1400 kilometers northwest of Jakarta, in which seven people were injured. Some reports said there were similar protests in Belawan, 40 kilometers north of Medan. Sunarti heads the central board of the Indonesian Prosperity Trade Union (SBSI), an independent union which has been challenging the government's policy of only allowing one trade union, the All Indonesian Workers' Union (SPSI). [sentence as received] At a news conference Monday, Sunarti said at least 81 people have so far been detained by the police, including two executives of the SBSI and the wife of a union executive. They were arrested following five days of rioting in Medan, during which one ethnic Chinese businessman was killed. The protesters are calling for better working conditions and higher wages. They protested the unexplained death of 22-year-old Rusli, a worker at a Medan-based company, after he took part in a labor strike that was only broken up when the troops were sent in. Many believe the SBSI is the motivating force behind the rally. The protests, however, have turned into violent anti-Chinese riots. Police reports said that some angry demonstrators pelted shops, factories and vehicles owned by ethnic Chinese. Chinese account for about three percent of the population of around 185 million in the mainly Muslim country. They are widely resented in Indonesia because of their economic power. In the country, the ethnic Chinese are often the target of jealousy because of their economic success. Some anti-Chinese leaflets were distributed among demonstrators saying, "Kill Chinese people as colonialists of the fundamental rights of indigenous Indonesian people," and "Send Chinese people back to China, because Indonesia is not their land." Sunarti said, "The pamphlets are not ours. We never distributed them. There must be third parties who have been using our protest for their own interests." The SBSI, Sunarti added, is only responsible for the protest for better working conditions, higher wages and the investigation into the death of Rusli, but not for the anti-Chinese riots. The situation in Medan is still tense, although Lt. Col. Agus Ramadan, the district military commander, said the streets were quiet and many shops and companies were still closed. Vincent Wijaya, an executive of the north Sumatran branch of the Indonesian trade chamber, told reporters that a Malaysian company had canceled its plans to buy land within the industrial estate after the riots. The Indonesian legal aid foundation said the protests would continue if the government fails to improve its labor policy.
