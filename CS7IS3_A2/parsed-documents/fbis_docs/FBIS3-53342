[Frayj] Good morning and welcome. [Al-Minufi] With the peace talks now under way between the Palestinians and the Israelis in Taba, we are surprised by the Israeli Government's decision to build a new settlement on Mount Olive. In your view, what are the reasons for this action? [Frayj] I denounce the confiscation of Arab land and the construction of settlements during negotiations and following the signing of the agreement and the mutual declaration [between Israel and the PLO]. This is not a sign of goodwill and casts doubts on Israel's desire for peace. I believe that this action has more arrogance than benefits for Israel. Mount Olive is densely populated and every inch of it is owned by Arabs, including the monasteries that have been in existence on this holy mountain for 2,000 years. [Al-Minufi] The negotiations being held in Taba between the Palestinians and Israelis have achieved positive results within the civilian committee, but there is still stagnation within the security committee. What is the reaction in the Palestinian street to these talks? [Frayj] There is mistrust among the Palestinians. This mistrust is deepening day by day. The Israeli measures in the occupied territories are worsening. They are not easing the tension, they are not allowing family reunions or freeing Palestinian prisoners, etc. The mistrust is deepening and could have a negative impact on the peace process. [Al-Minufi] April is the deadline for implementing the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, but so far the two sides have not settled the differences impeding the implementation of the agreement. What effect this could have on the Palestinians? [Frayj] According to the information we receive from the talks in Taba, there is tangible progress on the transfer of powers, but some (?difficult) obstacles remain regarding the security issues. Judging by the information we received from the Palestinian delegations, I believe that the Israeli troops will begin withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho before 13 April. [passage omitted]
