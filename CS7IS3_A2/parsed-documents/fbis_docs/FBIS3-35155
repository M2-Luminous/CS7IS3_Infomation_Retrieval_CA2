Our Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari says that in the discussions, which resumed in Cairo today, the Palestinians stressed that such a move is essential to prevent an interim vacuum in the territories. [Ya'ari] The talks, which were resumed at Cairo's Shepherd Hotel today, are headed by Major General Amnon Shahaq and Dr. Nabil Sha'th. Members of both delegations have said that on 23 February, they may be able to deliver a public statement on the results of this round. This time the Civilian Affairs Committee will discuss issues such as a fuel excise tax, the manner in which stamps printed by Palestinians will be introduced and used, and the Palestinian city planning powers. The Security Committee will decide on the number of Palestinian police and their equipment. The Palestinians want to set up a UN-supervised police training camp in the Bethlehem area, but Israel refuses to allow any foreign sponsorship. [passage omitted]
