In return for economic support from the Netherlands, the Vietnam authorities would guarantee that their fellow countrymen were not persecuted following their return. Foreign Minister Kooijmans and State Secretary of Justice Kosto hope to send the details of the agreement to Parliament next week for its assessment. "The talks with the Hanoi government are ongoing, but we hope to conclude them," the Foreign Ministry said. Two years ago the question of the Vietnamese asylum-seekers, who ultimately were refused asylum, led to great commotion when the group went on a hunger strike to protest against approaching extradition. The group was afraid of persecution in Vietnam, because they had traveled from Czechoslovakia to the Netherlands without the Vietnamese authorities' permission. According to Inlia, the church group which took care of them, some 300 of the original group of 350 are still in the Netherlands. Most of them have found shelter in low-rent accommodations in various villages, Inlia said. The other 50 have probably traveled to other European countries. Refugee Work [a refugee support group] said that the new treaty should offer straight guarantees that nothing would happen to the asylum-seekers when they returned to their own country. If Vietnam gave that guarantee, the Netherlands Government should demand effective local monitoring to ensure that the promise was respected. The treaty should also offer a solution for Vietnamese asylum-seekers who were sent back against their will, Refugee Work said. Germany and Vietnam have already made an agreement on the return of asylum-seekers in return for economic support. However, in Hanoi, Vietnamese people who return from Germany involuntarily have been put back on the plane to Germany. The talks on the Netherlands-Vietnamese treaty, which have been dragging on for two years, have been made possible by the improved economic and diplomatic relations between the two countries. At the end of last year, a trade delegation led by State Secretary Van Rooy visited Vietnam. A few weeks ago the Netherlands Embassy in Hanoi reopened.
