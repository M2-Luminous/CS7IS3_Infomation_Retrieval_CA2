FR940630-2-00126 FR940630-2-00098 [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;295 and 50&hyph;304] Commonwealth Edison Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;39 and DPR&hyph;48, issued to the Commonwealth Edison Company (CECo, the licensee), for operation of the Zion Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Lake County, Illinois. The proposed amendments would consist primarily of an administrative change to the Zion Station's Technical Specifications (TSs) to reflect an exemption to 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, section III.D.3. The exemption from section III.D.3 of appendix J, which is schedular in nature, would authorize the licensee to defer, on a one time only basis, the Type C leak rate testing requirements for valves 1(2)MOV&hyph;CC685 until the next refueling outage for each unit. NRC approval of this request would allow CECo continued operation of both units in full compliance with the operating license. Emergency circumstances existed in 1991, in that prior to that date, CECo was unaware of a number of penetrations and their associated valves, including 1(2)MOV&hyph;CC685, which had never been Type C leak rate tested in accordance with 10 CFR part 50, appendix J. On April 5, 1991, the NRC issued an Emergency Technical Specification Amendment (EMTSA) which allowed continued operation of Zion, Units 1 and 2, until their next refueling outages, at which time the required Type C leak rate tests for those penetrations were to be performed. The staff expected that 1(2)MOV&hyph;CC685 and the other penetrations would be subjected to the appropriate modifications and required testing performed, which would put Zion Station in compliance with the Type C testing requirement. However, on June 8, 1994, it was determined by Zion Station that the Type C leak rate testing requirement had inadvertently not been met for 1(2)MOV&hyph;CC685. On June 13, 1994, the NRC issued a Notice of Enforcement Discretion (NOED) not to enforce compliance with the Technical Specification (TS) for Zion Nuclear Power Station, Units 1 and 2 pending submittal of a schedular exemption request to the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, and a Technical Specification amendment request. The exigent nature of this request is necessary due to the identification of this issue after the completion of the Zion Station's refueling outage and startup operations and is required to be reviewed quickly by the staff to support an exemption request from the requirements to test in accordance with 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, for valves 1(2)MOV&hyph;CC685 until the next refueling outage for each unit. The exemption request was submitted by the licensee in another letter, also dated June 16, 1994. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6), for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. The subject pathway and associated containment isolation valves 1(2)MOV&hyph;CC685and 1(2)MOV&hyph;CC9438 provide the necessary assurance to conclude that the overall containment leakage rates will remain within the limits assumed in the accident analysis. Failures in excess of design basis requirements would be necessary to adversely impact the offsite dose in the unlikely event of an accident. This conclusion can be reached since the isolation barriers of the Component Cooling Water return from the reactor coolant pumps' thermal barriers meet the following criteria: _are of seismic design, _are required to operate post accident (except for large break LOCA), _the valves close automatically on Phase B isolation signal, _are subject to Emergency Operating Procedure guidance for manual IVSW system actuation, _are of similar design and exposed to similar environments as those penetrations that are Type C leak tested, As such, the consequences of previously evaluated accidents, with respect to offsite dose considerations, would not be significantly impacted. 2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications do not result in plant operations or configurations that could create a new or different type of accident. Installed plant equipment is not operated in a new or different manner. The proposed amendment does not add new or different types of plant equipment nor do the proposed changes alter any plant procedures used during recovery from accidents described in the analysis. As such, it can be concluded that the possibility for a new or different type of accident has not been introduced. 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As described in Technical Specification Bases, dose calculations suggest that the public exposure would be well below the 10 CFR 100 values in the event of a design basis accident. Calculations indicate that the accident leak rate could be allowed to increase to approximately 0.148%/day before the guidance thyroid [dose] value given in 10 CFR 100 would be exceeded. However, the 0.1%/day pre-operational test acceptance criteria provides an adequate margin of safety to assure the health and safety of the public. Additional margin is achieved by establishing the allowable operational leakage rate at 0.075%/day. The measured containment leakage rates are well within that limit. Despite the lack of Type C testing of the subject valves in strict compliance with appendix J, substantial barriers to fission product release are provided by the intact system piping and associated valves. Testing that has been completed on the subject valves and penetrations provides a high degree of confidence that Type C leakage limits would be met. Based on this it is concluded that the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
