FBIS3-34392 "drnes026_l_94005" FBIS-NES-94-026 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Feb 1994 ISRAEL Concern Expressed Over Fatah Hawks-Hamas Cooperation TA0702122994 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 7 Feb 94 pp A1, A8 TA0702122994 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Language: Hebrew Article Type:BFN [Report by army affairs correspondent Eytan Rabin and Amira Hess] [Text] Defense establishment and IDF [Israel Defense Forces] elements are concerned about the emerging cooperation between several Fatah Hawks squads, which have rebelled against the local Fatah leadership in the Gaza Strip, and Hamas elements. A report submitted by security elements indicates that Fatah Hawks squads were in touch with Hamas recently about possible cooperation, but no agreement was signed. So far, Hamas has merely provided moral support to the insurgent Fatah Hawks squads, but it is believed that the two sides will initiate joint operations at a later stage. The security elements' report states that 51 Fatah fugitives and activists have set up several squads and rebelled against the organization. The activists and the fugitives, including some who participated in attacks on Israelis, have acquired increasing power which rests mainly on support from accomplices. The report further indicates that the PLO-Tunis leaders have lost control over the Fatah Hawks squads. Even more serious, according to the report, is the fact that the squads have rebelled against the young local leadership of the Gaza Strip Fatah organization. It is believed that the local Fatah leadership in the Strip, headed by Sami Abu-Samahdanah, 'Iyad al-Ashqar, Dhiyab al-Lawh, and Sufiyan Abu-Zayida, is also unable to control the splinter squads. The security report asserts that several elements within the PLO leadership in the Strip, including fugitives, have rejected the authority of Fatah because of its agreement to ban attacks following the signing of the declaration of principles on 13 September. The report says that Fatah members who have rejected the organization's authority are still carrying out attacks, and in recent weeks, they have been involved in attacks on IDF and security troops. It has been further learned that the local leadership is also worried about the emerging cooperation. In view of the intensifying Fatah Hawks activities, the Jordanian branch of Hamas has issued an open statement encouraging the squads' work and even urging their expansion. The defense establishment has decided to continue the manhunt for these fugitives despite their affiliation with Fatah and despite the agreement that Fatah members would no longer be classified as fugitives. "The PLO leadership in Tunis, as well as the local leadership, realize that the IDF will continue hunting the fugitives, even if they continue to protest against this," a security figure has stated. The report also refers to the local leadership's fear of a wave of purges liable to be launched because of the discord -- which has not yet developed into a physical confrontation -- between peace agreement supporters and those opponents who have left the organization. In a leaflet disseminated yesterday in Gaza, the Fatah Hawks claim responsibility for the assassination of three collaborators over the past two weeks. A photocopy of the "license to carry arms and ammunition" belonging to one of the victims was attached to the leaflet. The three dead men are Salah 'Ashur from Dayr al-Balah and Yusuf al-Salibi from Gaza, whose bodies were discovered last Monday, and Muhammad Shihadah, alias al-Qaqam, from Jabalyah, murdered 12 days ago. The leaflet contends that activities against collaborators are coordinated between the leadership and the Hawks, although it implies a controversy over this matter between the Fatah "military branch" and the civilian leadership, which has reservations about the executions because of their detrimental impact on society. In the leaflet, the Hawks pledge to carry out every order of the Yasir 'Arafat-headed leadership, adding at the same time: "We announce that we will punish every traitor and collaborator." The leaflet announces that the Hawks have interrogated 'Ashur, "a collaborator since the 1970's and one of the most dangerous," warning other collaborators that 'Ashur divulged their names during his interrogation and that "the Fatah bullets are not far from them. We will soon meet." The Hawks leaflet further claims that Shihadah was "a member of the undercover units."
