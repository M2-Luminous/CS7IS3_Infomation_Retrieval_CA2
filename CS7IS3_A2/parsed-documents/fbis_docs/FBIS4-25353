He held: Liaoning's economy has developed continuously, speedily, and healthily since the beginning of this year, and the general situation is good. However, there are some conspicuous problems in the economic operation, especially the problems of the small increase in the production of state-owned enterprises, the low overall economic efficiency, and the increase in the enterprises that incur losses. We should now correctly handle the relations between development, reform, and stability. When talking about the basic situation in the current economic operation in Liaoning, Li Gejun first introduced the good aspects. First, spring plowing has proceeded smoothly; forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery are brisk; and township enterprises continue to develop vigorously. Second, state-owned enterprises have registered a fairly large increase, and nonstate-owned enterprises have continued the high growth rate. In the first four months of this year, state-owned enterprises in the province achieved an output value of 38.19 billion yuan, up 4.1 percent from the corresponding period of last year; and nonstate-owned enterprises achieved an output value of 61.47 billion yuan, up 56.62 percent. Third, the increase of fixed asset investment and the number of newly started projects have been brought under control to a certain extent. Fourth, market purchases and sales are stable, and the chaos in commodity prices took a favorable turn. Fifth, the export of local products has grown continuously, and the amount of foreign funds actually used has increased. Sixth, the increase volume of bank deposits outstripped that of loans, and people's savings grew substantially, with the increase volume 10.66 billion yuan higher than that of the corresponding period of last year. Seventh, the transition to the new tax system has been stable, and revenue and expenditure have basically been normal. According to the new tax distribution system, the local financial revenue of Liaoning reached 3.207 billion yuan in the January-April period, up 17.4 percent from the corresponding period last year in terms of comparable standards. In analyzing Liaoning's conspicuous problems in the economic operation, Li Gejun emphatically pointed out: The production of state-owned enterprises increased fairly little, and their overall economic efficiency was not high. In the first four months of this year, Liaoning's budgetary state-owned industrial enterprises created 1.825 billion yuan in profits and taxes, down 38.1 percent from the corresponding period of last year. Enterprises which incurred losses outnumbered the figure registered in the corresponding period last year by 275, and 66.1 percent of the enterprises suffered losses. Both the number of enterprises that incurred losses and the amount of deficits increased by a large margin as compared with last year. In the first quarter of this year, 447, or 12 percent, of Liaoning's state-owned industrial enterprises stopped production totally or partly, and 275,000 staff members and workers were involved. One of the factors that contributed to the rise of the losses of the state-owned enterprises was the fairly conspicuous contradiction in the shortage of funds, the unsmooth circulation of enterprise capital, the irrational structure of the funds that are tied up, the low efficiency in the use of funds, and serious mutual arrears among enterprises. In addition, the implementation of the new tax system has reduced the amount of the capital that enterprises can use. Another conspicuous problem in Liaoning's economic operation is the large commodity price increases. Li Gejun held: The current situation in commodity prices is very grim. After increasing by 13.5 percent last year, Liaoning's retail price index has continued to climb this year, rising by 19 percent in average. Now the price rises have slowed down. To effectively check price rises, Li Gejun held: Governments at all levels and every department concerned should continue their good job in monitoring, supervising, and inspecting prices. Since late last year when the system of reporting the main foodstuff prices every three days took effect, more than 2,000 cases violating the law on prices have been investigated and handled. The departments concerned in Liaoning are exercising administrative means to determine the price ceilings for grain and edible oil. Economic means have been exercised by 12 cities and 21 counties to establish price adjusting funds for nonstaple foodstuff in order to stabilize market commodity prices. After analyzing Liaoning's economic situation, Li Gejun pointed out: Some contradictions and problems have been alleviated to different degrees, but to resolve the contradictions in the structure and mechanism which have formed for a long time needs a pretty long process. The key is to correctly handle the relations between development, reform, and stability, to grasp the opportunity, to speed up development, to better the regulation and control over economic operation, and to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development in Liaoning. Zhao Xinliang, director of the provincial planning commission, stated that reports on the economic situation in the entire province would be held often in the future to increase the transparency of Liaoning's economic operation through the press.
