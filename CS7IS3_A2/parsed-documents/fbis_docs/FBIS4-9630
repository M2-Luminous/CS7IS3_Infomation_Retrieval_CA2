[Aleksandrov] I have this impression, that my resignation is being demanded. [Danevski] An impression is one thing; facts are something completely different. [Aleksandrov] I do not have facts. Officially, no one has spoken with me on this matter. I learn everything from the mass media. Anyway, there will be nothing terrible if I leave my post. [Danevski] Is your conflict with General Lyuben Petrov really so deep? [Aleksandrov] There is no conflict at all. There was a dispute whether those officers who must retire should do this now or in the fall. [Danevski] What was your opinion? [Aleksandrov] I had the opinion that we should not touch them until the fall, or until the Defense Bill is enacted. [Danevski] Do you accept President Zhelev's accusation that the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] is responsible for the small military budget? [Aleksandrov] I cannot comment on this statement. [Danevski] Is it true that you demanded a small Bulgarian Army? [Aleksandrov] It is the parliament that determines the size of the Army. I only said that, with the amount of money we received, we can provide food, clothing, and footwear for only a certain number of troops. [Danevski] If you think so, is there not the danger of having no army at all, because we do not have any money for it? [Aleksandrov] This is none of my business. The minister of defense does not provide funds. He only spends them. [Danevski] Did you want to create a mixed Bulgarian-Turkish battalion that would establish peace in Bosnia? [Aleksandrov] A noted Bulgarian politician -- Mr. Pasi -- advocated the establishment of such a battalion. Do not attribute his ideas to me, especially since this is a matter for the unforeseeable future. I do not commit myself to such ideas and claims. [Danevski] Perhaps he was only testing the idea? [Aleksandrov] It is fully possible.
