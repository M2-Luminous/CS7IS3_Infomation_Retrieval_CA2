Koichiro Aino was replaced by Morio Kimura, another Shinseito member, as a director of the lower house steering committee, the officials said. A senior party official said the change is a regular one. But the sudden change is widely regarded as punishment for Aino, who described the formation of a joint parliament group in the lower house which triggered the withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) from the coalition as a blunder by Ozawa. Aino's remarks angered Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist, and he later retracted them. The SDP walked out of the coalition in late April after the abrupt formation of the Kaishin parliamentary group, excluding the party. The SDP's withdrawal meant Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata had to form a minority government for the first time in 39 years.
