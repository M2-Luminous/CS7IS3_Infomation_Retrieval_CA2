This statement was issued to the press by Skoda Plzen Spokesman Jaroslav Hudec. According to him, he wanted to curb "speculation by some of the media about the visit to Iran by the Skoda director." Until Hudec's statement, however, there had been no trace of suspicion in any Czech or foreign newspaper that Skoda Director General Lubomir Soudek had offered tanks to Tehran. Until now, his trip to Iran has been marked by a completely different scandal: A willingness to supply the regime with technology for its nuclear program. Why did Spokesman Hudec decide to deny "speculation" that has so far not occurred to anyone? The Deputy Minister and the General The answer is simple. On Friday 7 January RESPEKT asked Director General Soudek the following question: "During your visit to Iran at the end of last November, did you hold talks with representatives from the Iranian Defense Ministry and military experts"? As Soudek was unable to reply -- apparently, he was too busy -- Jaroslav Hudec dealt with the matter: "I am authorized to state on behalf of the director that, while he was in Tehran, he did not hold talks with any of the people you mention." Three days later, the aforementioned denial was issued. Although no specific arms were mentioned in the RESPEKT question, Hudec thought it necessary to deny in advance talks about T-72 tanks. The two negative statements issued by Spokesman Hudec are, of course, at variance with the document RESPEKT has managed to obtain. This is an internal memorandum from the trip to Iran prepared for select trading partners of Skoda Plzen after the delegation's return home. The following two notes are contained in the comprehensive text: A Meeting at the Defense Ministry. Present on the Iranian side: Deputy Minister Vaheed and five members of his staff; the deputy foreign minister. We briefed them on the RDP Group and its possibilities. We gave them a rough outline, prepared by the RDP Group, of the options for supplying our hardware . Interest in: -- the new generation of surface-to-air missiles -- Tamara -- the modernization of tanks. Talks With the Army. Present: General Rahimi, deputy head of tank production. The general is an expert on tanks. It was recommended to: -- send him a list of RDP Group shareholders and their military production program (responsible: Engineer Vlcek, deadline 31 December 1993) -- invite representatives from the Iranian Army to a demonstration of the T-72 and other weapons innovations (responsible: Engineer Vlcek, deadline 2/94). On the basis of a demonstration of the hardware, it is possible to conclude an agreement on the purchase of weapons or on cooperation in the production of weapons systems in components. The Risk: An Unnecessary Fuss in Advance Jan Vlcek, the director general of the Czech RDP Group arms consortium, knows nothing about a list of shareholders or about inviting Iranian experts, which he is supposed to arrange. "I have not heard anything about this," he says. "We respect the law and Czech foreign policy." Like Jaroslav Hudec, he also describes all the reports about talks between Soudek's team and Iranian military officials as "mere deduction and speculation." Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy is more cautious in his judgment. In reply to a written question on whether he had been informed of Soudek's talks at the Defense Ministry in Tehran-- either before the visit or after it -- he said: "I am only given a brief outline of Mr. Soudek's plans during his foreign visits. I was not informed in advance of any specific contacts in Iran. I was briefed on his talks only after the visit was over." And the second question was -- what do you think of them? "During all of these negotiations, the RDP Group management exposes itself to the substantial risk that the activities that attract unnecessary attention in advance will come up against a stumbling block -- that the government will not grant a license for the anticipated exports." There is a slight slip here: In the Czech Republic today it is Vladimir Dlouhy's own office and not the government that grants licenses for military contracts. According to a cabinet resolution of May 1993, it must -- at the same time -- be guided by the point of view of the Foreign Ministry. It, according to its spokeswoman, Lucie Pilipova, only considers trade with countries under the UN Security Council's embargo to be unequivocally prohibited. Despite this, the Cernin Palace apparently also "carefully analyzes" all other requests to export arms and, after weighing up the situation, gives its consent or rejects them. Would the Foreign Ministry now permit the export of tanks and missiles to Iran? "It is impossible to give an unequivocal answer to such a hypothetical question that does not concern a specific application for a license," said Pilipova. "I think, however, that, after taking into consideration all the circumstances, our office would be inclined to the view not to permit such exports." An Element of Human Culture Jaroslav Hudec has prepared a little show piece for reporters in connection with the discussion on arms production at Skoda Plzen: A copy of the technical design for a saber -- "until now, our last arms order" -- that Skoda produced 300 of 10 years ago for the Castle Guard. "Nevertheless, I would like to emphasize one thing," says Mr. Hudec apropos the drawing. "Arms production is an element of human culture. It is a fact of life and we are realists. We are not ashamed of wanting to manufacture special technology. Unfortunately, however, we have found ourselves on the defensive." It is, of course, hard to determine the true extent of this "defensive." Skoda Plzen is one of the 40 shareholders in the RDP Group arms consortium and, within its framework, it coordinates the program for modernizing the Soviet T-72 tank. "It should be a truly quality tank," said Lubomir Soudek in LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE on 29 September last year. "We will modernize it right on the spot based on verified documentation from Western firms and tried-and-tested engines. I believe there will be a great deal of interest in it. In the near future, I will hold talks with the ministers of national defense of certain states outside Europe. We have to agree on some deliveries." Now the Skoda spokesman "on behalf of Mr. Soudek" is casting doubt on some of the statements made by his director. In particular, it is -- apparently -- out of the question that our arms producers could agree with anyone on supplies of the T-72 "in the near future." The entire modernization process is -- regardless of the verified documentation and the tried-and-tested engines -- in its infancy. The company has only just hired an expert to determine the course of the project, to prepare the budget, calculations, and so on. Apparently, no one has any details at the moment and nothing will be clear for about two years. The situation is the same with regard to another of the statements quoted -- "modernization on the spot." "So far, we do not know how the tank's modernization will proceed," Hudec told RESPEKT. "Mr. Soudek's statement was merely an entrepreneurial idea that has not yet acquired firm contours." Untrue again, at least as far as Jan Vlcek, the head of the RDP Group, is concerned. For him it is a fait accompli: "Country X will simply place an order for the modernization of its tanks and we will go there and carry out the work locally. The state where we will carry out the modernization has to be -- naturally -- approved by the government." There is a problem here, however. Today, there are very few countries X that have the "T-72" and that, at the same time, would meet our conditions for arms exports. The only logical customer would be our army. However, the RDP Group management itself admits that, so far, it has not managed to conclude a contract with it. Therefore, if Vlcek's company wants to adhere to our state's political line in its business dealings, its stake on the T-72 looks like an inexplicable risk: The markets that would be interested are embargoed and those to which the tank may be exported do not want the product. According to rival experts from this branch, the answer to the riddle lies in the phrase "modernization on the spot." Instead of provocative and largely unsuccessful attempts to "smuggle" assembled weapons to terrorist countries, this method provides scope for more dignified camouflage: Only parts of these weapons, licenses, and the appropriate know-how can be exported. Until the Bear Starts Waving His Arms Of course, tanks and missiles were not the only hot items discussed by the Czech businessmen during their visit to Tehran. Apart from General Rahimi and Deputy Minister Vaheed (the former head of the Iranian intelligence service), the Skoda Plzen director also visited Reza Amrollahi from the Iranian Atomic Commission. A well-known scandal erupted around these talks immediately after the return of Soudek's delegation. "The Iranian regime is trying to turn Prague into a purchasing center for technology, know-how, and materials that would be denied it elsewhere in the world," wrote the Israeli newspaper HA'ARETZ on 5 December and thus provoked an outcry in the domestic and foreign media. The most severe reaction came from North America. "According to the U.S. strategic doctrine, it is necessary to ward off the risk that Iran will produce a nuclear weapon. Germany, after it got its fingers burnt in Iraq and Libya, banned the export of nuclear technology to terrorist states, but people from executive power are trying to get round this ban. And the hungry Czechs want to sell to anyone," wrote THE NEW YORK TIMES three days before the end of the year. The article ended unequivocally: "If Prague sees its future as a merchant of death, it should be told that it cannot bank on membership in NATO. If the Russian bear again begins to wave his arms, whom would the Czechs want to guarantee their security? Will it turn to its nuclear customers in Tehran?" The domestic press mostly limited itself to quoting the official statements issued by Skoda Plzen. It admitted that negotiations were held on supplying a reactor to Iran, but it denied that it acted as an intermediary for Siemens or Westinghouse. The mass media, the Skoda Plzen spokesman, and some government ministers then repeated several times that Skoda's offer concerns "peaceful technology," which can in no way be used for the production of nuclear weapons. This argument was used recently by MLADA FRONTA DNES on 10 January: "To be slightly cynical, selling the Iranians a reactor just means a good deal to the tune of tens of millions of korunas. It would be hard for the company's management to explain to its shareholders that they had left such an opportunity to the competition." The Road to Prosperity The uproar over the nuclear reactor is the second time recently that the world has tried to scuttle Czech-Iranian nuclear cooperation. In June 1993 the secretary at the U.S. Embassy in Prague asked the Foreign Ministry to suspend the contract to supply technology for extracting and processing uranium ore concluded between the Prague company Geoindustria GMS and the Iranian Atomic Commission. The Czech side replied that it was impossible to turn down the deal because it involved "peaceful equipment," but in the end -- apparently, thanks to voluntary cooperation from the exporter -- the export deal fell through. Last year the GMS company even terminated its work on a geological survey of the uranium deposits in the Anarak and Bandar Abbas regions in Iran. Skoda Plzen, of course, refuses to make similar concessions in the nuclear business. The pressure to terminate the contract is, according to it, merely an "unfair move by the competition." The question of who this competition is remains unanswered. In democratic countries today there is no risk of being lost in the crush over orders for the Iranian nuclear program. The Federal Government (under pressure from the United States) prohibited Siemens from undertaking nuclear activity in Iran several years ago and the French Framatome company and -- of course -- the U.S. Westinghouse company cannot export there either. Skoda has also been criticized in the foreign press not for reasons of "competition," but on the contrary, because -- as an alleged intermediary -- it enables these companies to conduct prohibited business deals. At the moment, Iran has a contract with Russia to construct a nuclear power plant (the VVER [water-moderated water-cooled power reactor] type). Russia is also apparently considering whether to complete the half-built (and partly bombed) power plant in Bushehr that had to be abandoned by Siemens. According to Skoda Deputy Director Frantisek Svitak, the Plzen company is interested in participating in -- to say the least -- the first order as a general supplier via Russia. The point of view of the experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency is unequivocal: A project of this size will give the Iranians considerable experience in reactor engineering and operations. It will be essential to train local experts and to permit the operation of test reactors that, in the long-term perspective, will support the state's nuclear program. Moreover, if Tehran obtains the VVER reactor, this will provide it with enough of an excuse to submit orders for more nuclear technology. The equally unequivocal point of view of Skoda's senior management stands in opposition to all of this. Spokesman Jaroslav Hudec formulated it as follows in the December issue of the enterprise's magazine SKODOVAK: "Whether people like it or not, our enterprise will not allow itself to be dictated to by anyone who feels entitled to do so. We have our own way of thinking and our own plans for achieving prosperity."
