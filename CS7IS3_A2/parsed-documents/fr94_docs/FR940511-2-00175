FR940511-2-00175 FR940511-2-00110 In 1992, the Commission approved a PTC proposal to make certain VA REMIC securities, guaranteed by the U.S. government, eligible for deposit at PTC pursuant to PTC Article I, Rule 2. 13 The approval ran through December 31, 1992, to coincide with the expiration of the legislation authorizing the issuance of VA REMICs. 14 In 1993, legislation extending the VA's authority to issue REMICs through December 31, 1995 was enacted. 15 In light of the extension, the Commission approved a PTC proposal allowing it on a permanent basis to designate VA REMICs depository eligible, as long as they continue to be guaranteed by the U.S. government. 16 13 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30792, supra note 5. 14 38 U.S.C. 3720h(1) and (2), as amended by P.L. 102&hyph;291, enacted on May 20, 1992. 15 38 U.S.C. 3720h(1) and (2), as amended by P.L 102&hyph;547, enacted on October 28, 1992. 16 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31914, supra note 5. Should the VA's authority to issue securities with a U.S. government guarantee cease, any VA securities in PTC at that time shall remain depository eligible. Id. PTC has relied on Trepp as its vendor for VA REMIC prices and has used Trepp's model to determine margin for such securities. Trepp was established in 1979 and created the first independent CMO pricing service in 1988. Currently, Trepp provides pricing and analytical services to more than 500 institutions, including 23 of the 25 largest bank trust departments. 17 17 Letter from Michael D. Frieband, dated March 4, 1994, supra note 5. Because each CMO tranche has unique characteristics, Trepp models each security to determine its value. The information required to model each tranche of a CMO is derived from that CMO's prospectus, including the characteristics and principal payment priorities of each tranche, initial price and interest rate, and remaining principal balances and prepayment assumptions used to derive the cash flows and initial spread. 18 18 Id. Initially, PTC gauges the accuracy of these models by comparing the cash flows and other data calculated by the model to the information provided by the underwriter in the issuer summary report and the prospectus. In addition, the accuracy of the model is tested on an ongoing basis by comparing its valuations to those of the underwriter, and by using available factor information to verify the remaining principal balance of each security with those calculated by its corresponding model. 19 19 Id. PTC's model is an example of a static cash flow yield model, as distinguished from an option-adjusted spread (``OAS'') model. Static cash flow and OAS models differ primarily in their handling of future interest rate and prepayment scenarios. A static cash flow yield analysis uses an interest rate/prepayment scenario which relies on current market conditions. This reliance creates two limitations. First, it might not measure accurately reinvestment risk caused by an investor's inability to reinvest periodic payments at a rate equal to the yield on the security. Second, such a model does not value the embedded option representing a mortgagee's ability to prepay, which can be a factor in determining the value of a particular CMO tranche. 20 It is the option to prepay which causes OAS models generally to be considered more accurate than static cash flow models. However, the enhanced accuracy of OAS models comes at a cost; such models are more complex and computer intensive than those relying on a static cash flow analysis. According to PTC, there are no daily price vendors that provide bulk prices for CMOs using an OAS model. 21 20 Id. 21 Id. Each CMO tranche is subjected to a stress test, the purpose of which is to observe the effect of an upward and downward movement of 50 basis points in the underlying Treasury yield of each CMO tranche. 22 Because the volatility of a CMO tranche is primarily a function of the level of interest rates, PTC has stated it will recalculate margins whenever the Treasury yield curve has changed by 100 basis points from the time of original issue or last margin recalculation. PTC has also stated that securities whose attributes warrant it shall have their margins reevaluated quarterly. 23 22 Id ; letter from Leopold S. Rassnick, dated March 21, 1994, supra note 5. 23 Letter from Michael D. Frieband, dated March 4, 1994, supra note 5. PTC has yet to delineate the CMO attributes that would warrant quarterly reevaluation. See infra note 29.
