Commenting on a 6-trillion-yen income tax cut and the "creation of a national welfare tax" that the prime minister announced in the early dawn of 3 February, Mr. Kantor said: "You made a proper decision." In this way, he highly rated the prime minister's tax measures taken as part of stimulus measures. Mr. Kantor met with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii prior to his meeting with the prime minister. During the meeting, Mr. Kantor warned that "if the Japan-U.S. summit slated for 11 February ends in failure, it would have a great impact on the world economy." Referring to negotiations on the insurance sector under the Japan- U.S. economic framework talks, Mr. Kantor asked that Japan adopt "objective criteria" to measure the share of foreign insurance firms on the Japanese insurance market. In response, Finance Minister Fujii said: "The share is something that must be decided by the business activities of foreign firms."
