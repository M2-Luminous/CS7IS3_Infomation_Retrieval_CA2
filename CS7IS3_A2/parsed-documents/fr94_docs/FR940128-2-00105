OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0410. Title: Forecast for Investment Usage Report and Actual Usage of Investment Report. Form Number: FCC Forms 495A and 495B. Action: Extension of a currently approved collection. Respondents: Businesses or other for-profit. Frequency of Response: Annual reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 300 responses; 40 hours average burden per response; 12,000 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: The FCC Forms 495A and 495B implement the FCC's Joint Cost Order, CC Docket No. 86&hyph;111, which requires that certain telephone plant investments used for both regulated and nonregulated purposes be allocated on the basis of forecasted regulated and nonregulated use. The detection and correction of forecasting errors requires reporting of both forecasted and actual investment usage data. The Forecast of Investment Usage Report is used by carriers to submit the forecasts of investments used. The Actual Usage of Investment Report is used to submit the actual investments used. These reports are part of the Automated Reporting and Management Information System (ARMIS). The information contained in these two reports provides the necessary detail to enable the Commission to fulfill its regulatory responsibility to ensure that the regulated operations of the carriers do not subsidize the nonregulated operations of those same carriers. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1828 Filed 1&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M
