The remains of the completed forms, with photographs and fingerprints, were found in the yard of a Home Affairs office in Lenasia, near Johannesburg. They have been seen and photographed by the MAIL & GUARDIAN. The ID applications are largely those of African domestic workers and the residents of three squatter camps in the Lenasia area. The ANC [African National Congress] says they are likely to be ANC supporters. "This has very serious implications. It can suppress our capacity to muster votes," said Issu Chiba, chairman of the local ANC branch. The IEC confirmed that the documents were authentic and not "innocent refuse". The IEC is now investigating whether Home Affairs officials are sabotaging the process or guilty of "inefficiency and negligence". A Home Affairs representative said if the allegations were proven to be true, the department would take "the strongest possible steps" against the staff responsible. The find follows a SUNDAY NATION expose last August of Home Affairs officials in Barberton, Eastern Transvaal, who had burnt a pile of ID books. ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa called this "gross sabotage of the elections process". This week the ANC called for independent monitoring of the issuing of IDs and temporary voter cards in the run-up to the elections. The latest find took place when Lenasia ANC branch member Batista Mokwena investigated complaints from applicants who had waited months for their IDs and found the application forms and other documents in a bin at the Home Affairs offices. The torn-up application forms had been filled out, fingerprinted, stamped and signed by clerks before being thrown away. Other documents of applicants, including original birth certificates and photographs, were also discarded. Mokwena had been posted outside the Home Affairs office to assist droves of people plying ANC branch offices with requests for help in applying for IDs. He discovered the discarded forms after investigating the large number of applicants who had been told there was no record of their applications. Most of the destroyed applications were made in January and February this year and appear to belong primarily to domestic workers and squatter residents from three squatter camps in the area. Both the Department of Home Affairs and the IEC have sent investigating teams to Lenasia and much of the evidence has already been handed over to the commission. Complaints about the Home Affairs staffers in Lenasia surfaced early this year. Shan Balton, of the local ANC branch, met Home Affairs officials in January to complain that most of the Lenasia clerks did not speak a vernacular language and that free photographs were not being provided. "The problems did not stop and we decided to put a volunteer in the Home Affairs office to assist with forms," said Balton. "If this is happening in Lenasia, what's happening in small rural towns?" He added: "There is a problem with the absolute control that Home Affairs has over the issuing of IDs and temporary voter cards. They need independent people in the offices."
