The arrival of the Cuban president and a high-level delegation of Cuban Government officials in Bridgetown today increased attention on the first general conference on the sustained development of small islands, organized by the AOSIS [Alliance of Small Insular States], which belongs to the Group of 77. The Cuban delegation comprises Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government; Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; Ecology Minister Rosa Elena Simeon; and others. The Barbados summit is scheduled to approve a declaration and an agenda for the sustained development of these small countries. It also will review proposals from a meeting of nongovernment organizations (ONG), which is holding complementary meetings with the conference. The high-level meeting, scheduled for Thursday and Friday, will close the discussions which began on 25 March at the Sherbourne Center in Bridgetown, during which the participants considered the most desirable guidelines needed to face the effects of climatic changes in the states participating in the forum. The other 10 heads of state and government have already arrived in Bridgetown to hold an informal AOSIS summit in addition to the official discussions.
