I have a feeling that determining it is not logical to call for numerical targets, the United States is beginning to realize that such a demand will not gain support from the world opinion." The foreign minister held a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher in Cairo on 3 May. According to the foreign minister, the secretary of state said at the meeting that "we are not demanding Japan to set numerical targets." It seems that the foreign minister's remarks were based on Christopher's comment.
