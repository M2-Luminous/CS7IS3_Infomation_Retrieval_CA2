The Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog, however, has not received any response from the country so far, the spokesman said. Besides additional inspections on the radiochemical laboratory in the Yongbyong nuclear complex, north of the capital, the IAEA has also demanded North Korea allow the Agency to change film and batteries of surveillance cameras installed at nuclear facilities there, the spokesman said. Last month, a six-member IAEA team conducted inspections on North Korea's seven-declared nuclear sites to check that no radioactive material had been diverted from the plants for military purposes. But Pyongyang refused the team access to the laboratory, thus prompting the Agency to refer the issue to the U.N. Security Council. The Council issued a nonbinding presidential statement March 31 urging North Korea to grant full inspections on its nuclear facilities. The communist country has denied it is developing a nuclear arsenal and warned that a war could break out on the Korean peninsula if it was pressed too hard on the matter.
