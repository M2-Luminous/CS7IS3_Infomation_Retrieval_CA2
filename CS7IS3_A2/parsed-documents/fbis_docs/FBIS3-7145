The statement says: "The South Korean authorities are heading for reckless confrontation with fellow countrymen, totally denying North-South dialogue. This is an extension of the anti-DPRK, anti-socialist campaign they have consistently waged with the imperialist reactionaries. "No sooner had they brought the working-level contact for the exchange of presidential envoys to a rupture than they kicked up a big fuss as a servant of foreign forces in the anti-DPRK, anti-socialist campaign, by issuing a `special alert order' throughout South Korea, calling their master on the phone, sending a letter to him and making mendicant trips to do harm to fellow countrymen. "The reality shows that with the flunkeyist traitor left within the nation, our fellow countrymen cannot live in peace nor can they think of the peace and peaceful reunification of the country and the nation will inevitably suffer a scourge of war. "We regard it humiliating to have the traitor within the nation. We will never tolerate his treacheries. "The traitor Kim Yong-sam must clearly know that he will never be able to escape the blame for the consequences of his dependence on outside forces and flunkeyism against fellow countrymen."
