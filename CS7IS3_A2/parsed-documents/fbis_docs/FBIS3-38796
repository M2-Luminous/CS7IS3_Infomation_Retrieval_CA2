FBIS3-38796 "drweu026_p_94006" FBIS-WEU-94-026 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Feb 1994 GREECE * ND Leader Evert's Initiatives Discussed 94P20304 94P20304 Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] The various moves and activities of New Democracy (ND) leader Miltiadhis Evert are the subject of commentary in the Greek press. On Minorities According to the 19 January Athens daily TA NEA, Evert recently traveled to Thraki and visited various cities and institutions. One of them was a minority elementary school, where conditions were "not good." He then visited a "typical" elementary school in the same area. He found conditions in the second school "very satisfactory." As a result, he stated to the Christian teachers that "it is our duty to build as good a school for the Muslims, too." Agreement With Stefanopoulos The 9 January Athens Sunday newspaper O TIPOS TIS KIRIAKIS reports that a rapprochement between Evert and Democratic Renewal (DhIANA) leader Kostis Stefanopoulos is expected soon to enable the latter to be included in the ND's European elections list. "If everything goes well," Stefanopoulos will probably head the list. In another development, EC Commissioner Ioannis Palaiokrassas will not be a candidate, for he has concluded that he would be more useful by staying in Brussels for all of 1994, the paper reports. New Commission members will be appointed on 1 January 1995. Hardline Vs. Low-Key Policy The 9 January TIPOS TIS KIRIAKIS comments that the ND leadership is faced with a dilemma. Privately conducted polls show that 55 percent of ND sympathizers want a more hardline opposition, while 90 percent of center-right voters and those wavering between parties wish for a "gentler and dignified" opposition. Evert is attempting to conciliate the two views without disappointing either side, the newspaper notes. It adds, however, that the new year is ushering in a period in which the ND, besides reorganizing its own structures, will "intensify" its monitoring and criticism of government action "on all fronts" to gain the initiative in political developments. The 11 January TA NEA quotes Evert as stating on 1O January at a meeting of ND trade unionists that "if you elected me your leader just to overthrow PASOK tomorrow, you made a mistake. PASOK is following its course. My goal is to finally create in this country a modern political discourse that will make us more mature and ready to succeed when we come to power."
