E. Ankudinov, P. N. Fedorov; UDC 621.396.67.01] [Abstract]Ratios are examined between the power that is dissipated and the power that is absorbed when a random conducting antenna loaded with a matched load is irradiated from opposite directions. It was shown that with a random aspect to the radiation and polarization of the falling wave, the total dissipated power is always more or equal to that absorbed when the antenna is radiated from the opposite direction by a planar electromagnetic wave with coinciding polarization and amplitude. Moreover, depending on the nature of the load which ensures a minimum effective scattering cross-section, antennas can be classified into three categories. In addition, an example of an antenna which provides identical reception from any two directions is a thin rectilinear dipole antenna. Unlike a rectilinear dipole, the majority of antennas have unsymmetrical directivity patterns. 2 figures and 8 references.
