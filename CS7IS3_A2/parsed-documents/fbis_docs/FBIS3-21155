This reduces the cost of separation and recovery, and is another step toward practical application. Kansai Electric screened over 200 types of absorber liquids, conducted tests on about 40 types, then developed an absorber liquid that requires little energy. Until now, 900 kilocalories were needed to recover 1 kilogram (kg) of CO[.sup]2[/], but 700 kilocalories is enough with the newly developed absorber liquid. The absorber liquid is alkanol-amin-based. The required energy is expected to be even less if the absorber liquid is heated by steam bleeding from the steam turbine, and Kansai Electric will continue to concentrate on developing technology for separation and recovery of CO[.sup]2[/] from exhaust gas. Kansai Electric has carried out research on a chemical absorption method as a technology to separate and recover CO[.sup]2[/] for use in thermal power plants because this method facilitates capacity expansion. In 1990, small-scale basic testing equipment was set up in the Sakai Harbor power plant and from April 1991, research using actual exhaust gas was carried out at a pilot plant (processes 600 normal cubic meters of gas per hour) that was built at the Minami Harbor power plant. The pilot plant uses technology introduced from the U.S. firm Floa Daniel [phonetic]. Paralleling this, absorber liquid screening tests were carried out at the technology research institute. In the past, it took 900 kilocalories to separate and recover 1 kg of CO[.sup]2[/] from exhaust gas. This is about 20% of boiler heat input. With the newly developed absorber liquid, 700 kilocalories is sufficient, and the percentage of boiler heat input also drops to about 15%. Even greater conservation of energy can be realized by using steam bleeding from the steam turbine to heat the absorber liquid. CO[.sup]2[/] separation and recovery by the chemical absorption method entails absorption of CO[.sup]2[/], which comprises about 9% of exhaust gas, into a liquid in an absorption tower, then heating the liquid in a regeneration tower, which releases the CO[.sup]2[/]. Absorber liquid that absorbs CO[.sup]2[/] well and has little heat of reaction is sought. Kansai Electric has experimented with various types of absorber liquids, testing for absorption rate, heat of reaction, corrosion and degradation. The new absorber liquid reduces separation and recovery energy, which also lessens the percentage of power generation cost taken up by the cost of CO[.sup]2[/] recovery.
