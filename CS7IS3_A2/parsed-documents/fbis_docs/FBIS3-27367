In cases where a unit really needs to employ migrant workers, it must report this to the provincial employment service center for approval; if a unit employs migrant workers from outside the province without approval, the provincial labor supervisory organization will, in accordance with the provincial government's Decree No. 4, impose a fine of 2,000 yuan on the employing unit per one migrant worker employed. Second, the employing unit must register with the local labor department by the end of March for the migrant workers already working in the unit and must obtain approval for migrant workers' entry into Hainan for employment. As of 1 April, all levels of labor supervisory organizations in the province will conduct overall inspections. Migrant workers who do not possess employment approval certificates will be fined according to the regulations. Third, in accordance with the Document No. 15, issued jointly by the provincial personnel and labor department and the provincial public security department this year, after migrant workers' employment approval certificates come into effect the previous employment approval certificates issued by the provincial personnel and labor department will be revoked on 24 February.
