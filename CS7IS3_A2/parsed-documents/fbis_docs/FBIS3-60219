Friends and relatives cheered as the jury found them not guilty of smuggling £125 million worth of cocaine into Britain at the end of a three-month trial estimated to have a cost £2 million. They were held in an operation by Customs and police after the 115 ft yacht Fox Trot V, carrying 796 kg of the drug, docked at Durham Wharf, Charlton, south-east London, in November last year. Five were alleged to have been involved with the equipping and crewing of the boat while the sixth was said to have rented space to store the drugs. Three leading members of the conspiracy were said to have escaped. The man alleged to have rented warehouse space, Derek Hillier, 34, a plumber of Woodside Crescent, Sidcup Kent, told the jury he was forced at gunpoint by people so far not caught. But the other five maintained they did know the ship, on which they were crew, was carrying drugs. In the dock were Barry Murphy, 41, of Walworth, south east London; Barry Patrick Murphy, 21, of the same address; Lee Murphy, 26, of Abbey Wood, south London; Jose Lopez, 30, of Morden, south London, and Paul Williams, 25, of Kentish Town, north London. They all denied importing cocaine.
