The puppet Army's mobile tank groups deployed in Chomwon-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi Province, South Korea frantically conducted land attack operation exercises aimed at the northward invasion on that day in cooperation with the mechanized infantry outfits. Large- caliber artillery units of the puppet Army moved in Kajon-ri, Imje County, Kangwon Province, South Korea and assumed a firing position against our side, agitating us extremely. On the same day, the armed rascals of the puppet Army occupied battle positions in Nosang-ri, Ogum-ri, and Yongsan-ri in Paju County and fired at random some 1,000 shots of large-caliber machine guns and automatic rifles. Meanwhile, some 10 armed helicopters and transport helicopters of the puppet Army moved out in the skies above Yonchon and Pochon of Kyonggi Province and Chorwon County of Kangwon Province, South Korea, and frantically conducted exercises of supporting land units, dropping special attack corps, and supplying operation equipment in the air, while flying at low and very low altitudes. All these facts prove that the South Korean puppets are running toward confrontation and war and running counter to peace and detente.
