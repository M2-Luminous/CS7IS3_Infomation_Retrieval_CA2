FR941116-2-00082 FR941116-2-00065 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket Nos. 030&hyph;02640; 030&hyph;31605; and 030&hyph;32479 License Nos. 34&hyph;00293&hyph;02; 34&hyph;00293&hyph;14; and 34&hyph;00293&hyph;15 EA 94&hyph;215] The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio; Confirmatory Order Modifying License, Effective Immediately I. The Ohio State University (Licensee) is the holder of eight NRC materials licenses, including broadscope License No. 34&hyph;00293&hyph;02; License No. 34&hyph;00293&hyph;14, authorizing use of cobalt-60 sources in a wet storage irradiator for in-water irradiation studies; and License No. 34&hyph;00293&hyph;15, authorizing use of a cobalt-60 source in a teletherapy unit for treatment of animals. The broadscope license authorizes the Licensee to possess, in part: (1) Radiopharmaceuticals and brachytherapy sources in quantities as needed for medical diagnosis and therapy; (2) ten curses (370 GBq) of iridium-192 in a remote afterloading brachytherapy device for therapeutic treatments; (3) curie quantities of any byproduct materials (with atomic numbers 1 to 83) in any form for research and development (R&D) pursuant to 10 CFR 30.4, and for student instruction and calibration of instruments; (4) curie quantities of any byproduct material (with atomic numbers 3 to 83) in the form of irradiated metals for R&D; and (5) millicurie to curie quantities of specifically-listed sealed and unsealed byproduct materials for use in analytical instruments, gauging devices, and for instrument calibration, student instruction and R&D. The broadscope license was issued on July 19, 1956, and is due to expire on June 30, 1997. License Nos. 34&hyph;00293&hyph;14 and 34&hyph;00293&hyph;15 expire on July 31, 1996 and December 31, 1996, respectively. II. Between September 27 and November 4, 1993, the NRC conducted a safety inspection of licensed activities at the Ohio State University authorized under License Nos. 34&hyph;00293&hyph;02, 34&hyph;00293&hyph;14 and 34&hyph;00293&hyph;15. Numerous violations and other concerns were identified during the inspection. The findings of the inspection were documented in Inspection Report Nos. 030&hyph;02640/93001, 030&hyph;31605/93001 and 030&hyph;32479/93001, issued to the Licensee on December 16, 1993. The problems identified during the inspection were discussed with the Licensee during an Enforcement Conference held at the NRC Region III office on March 7, 1994. During the Enforcement Conference, the Licensee presented various corrective actions that were taken or were planned to be taken to prevent recurrence of the violations, ensure compliance with NRC requirements and strengthen its overall NRC-licensed programs. On June 10, 1994, the NRC issued a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties (Notice) in the amount of $17,750 (EA 94&hyph;032). The Notice listed 32 violations covering numerous areas, including decommissioning funding, radiation safety requirements for irradiators, and medical quality management program requirements. The violations represented a significant breakdown in the management of the radiation safety program and consequently were of significant regulatory concern. The significant of the inspection findings was exacerbated because many of the violations appeared to have been known or suspected to exist by those responsible for the radiation protection program, yet continued uncorrected. Moreover, conditions such as a lack of radiation safety office staff and adequate radiation safety office facilities were also known but were not corrected in a timely fashion. The root cause of the problems identified during the inspection was a lack of effective management involvement with NRC&hyph;licensed activities, coupled with a failure to provide sufficient resources for the radiation protection program. The June 10, 1994, Notice required the Licensee to respond to the specific violations. In addition to that response, the NRC requested that, within 60 days of the Notice, the Licensee develop and submit a detailed Radiation Safety Improvement Plan (RSIP) that includes a description of the changes to be implemented, the specific improvements in management oversight, and the additional resources to be dedicated to upgrade the radiation safety program. The RSIP was to address several specific topics including a program of audits and surveillances to assess program effectiveness, a schedule for completing all actions described in the plan, and a system for monitoring and tracking the plan's completion status. III. On July 8, 1994, the Licensee provided a written response to the Notice and remitted full payment of the $17,750 proposed civil penalties. The Licensee did not contest the violations in the Notice except for one violation pertaining to the failure to complete an evaluation of radiation doses incurred by an individual in September 1991. The NRC responded to the Licensee's July 8, 1994, submittal in a letter dated August 18, 1994. On August 2, 1994, the Licensee submitted the requested RSIP. Following discussion of the RSIP with the Licensee, the Licensee submitted supplemental information in a letter dated September 15, 1994. Key elements of the RSIP include: (1) A system of ongoing evaluations of the radiation safety program to determine compliance with NRC regulations and license conditions; (2) an assessment of personnel training and improvements in user training including cross-training of radiation safety office health physicists; (3) a compilation of radiation safety deficiencies identified during program evaluations and a description of short term and long term corrective actions necessary to address those deficiencies for lasting corrective action; (4) an increase in health physicist, technician and support staff for the radiation safety office; and (5) enhanced facilities and equipment for the radiation safety office. In light of the violations underlying the June 10, 1994, enforcement action, the public health and safety require improvement of the Licensee's radiation safety program. The NRC staff has reviewed the Licensee's RSIP, as supplemented, and finds that the commitments as set forth in its letters of August 2, 1994, and September 15, 1994, are acceptable and conclude that if these commitments are effectively implemented, the public health and safety are reasonably assured. In view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health and safety require that the Licensee's commitments in its August 2, 1994, and September 15, 1994, letters be confirmed by this Order.
