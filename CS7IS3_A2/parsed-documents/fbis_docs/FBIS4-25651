He said: It is very important to gather the good summer harvests. In northern Anhui, the summer crop alone can ensure food supply for the whole year. If the peasants have no worries about their livelihood, the rural situation will be stable, and rural stability is important to the stability and economic development of the whole province. He called on the cadres and people in those areas to take full advantage of fine days to go all out to rush the harvesting of summer grain crops; and to strive to get every seed of summer grain into the granaries. When Governor Fu Xishou chaired an executive meeting of the provincial government on the afternoon of 31 May, he learned of a possible weather change in the near future. He was so anxious that he again checked the forecast with the provincial weather station in the evening, and decided to leave for the countryside immediately. During those two days, Governor Fu Xishou and his party travelled more than 500 km and inspected summer harvesting work in eight villages in Dingyuan county, Huaiyuan county, Suzhou city, and Lingbi county. On the afternoon of 1 June, Fu Xishou arrived at the wheat threshing ground of Qiaotouyang village in Xizhoudian township, Dingyuan county. He grabbed a handful of wheat grains and checked them carefully. He then held the hand of peasant Yang Dongyong and cordially asked him about the area of his wheat crops, the expected completion time for harvesting, and expected yield. Yang Dongyong answered all the questions. Then, a responsible comrade of Dingyuan county informed the governor that the harvesting of the county's 850,000 mu of wheat could be completed in two days. Fu Xishou was satisfied with this information. In Huanyuan county and some other localities, Fu Xishou repeatedly told local responsible comrades to draw on the lessons of several previous years in which wheat mildewed due to continuous rain. He urged them to organize the labor force rapidly to rush the harvesting of summer grain crops, to avoid the loss of grain which was nearly in their hands, and to prevent the efforts made by peasants over last six months from being wasted. He called the departments concerned to provide good services to peasants. Fu Xishou saw the wheat crops in a large tract of land in the northern part of Lingbi county were not yet ripe. He asked the responsible comrades of the county to watch the weather forecast closely, be well prepared, and seize the opportune time to organize the peasants to rush harvesting and threshing of the crops, and to get the harvests into the granaries. Fu Xishou also inspected some county-run enterprises and village and town enterprises during his tour.
