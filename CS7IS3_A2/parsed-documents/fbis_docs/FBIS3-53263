He must first prove to the Palestinians that the step he is taking serves their national interests. Only after he succeeds in doing that will he be able to reduce the influence of his opposition, of the opponents of peace. I think his current obstinacy is a mistake, but so is the big fuss the Israelis are making over petty issues." The speaker is Bassam Abu-Sharif, Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, who has long been at the PLO leader's side. "The problem is not 'Arafat," he told me this week in a meeting in Paris. "The problem is that the Palestinian negotiators give the Israeli representatives the impression that what they agree on is final, and they fail to explain to them that they do not have the final say and that they must get the approval of the PLO leadership. "True, 'Arafat is in charge of implementation, but he can act only according to the decisions of the PLO Executive. 'Arafat must comply with the PLO constitution, just as Yitzhaq Rabin is accountable to Israeli law. "In my opinion, neither 'Arafat nor Rabin are to blame. Each of them is entitled to see and explain the problem his own way. Let me give you an example: The Oslo agreement refers to `Jericho'; not `the city of Jericho,' but just plain `Jericho.' 'Arafat reads this as the Jericho area, while Rabin takes it to mean the city of Jericho." [Avrekh] "If so, what is the solution?" [Abu-Sharif] "Seeing that both the Israelis and the Palestinians decided on peace, I do not think time should be wasted on minor issues." [Avrekh] "How would you settle it?" [Abu-Sharif] "Personally, the problem of the autonomous area of Jericho is completely marginal, I would even say irrational. After all, we decided in principle that Israel will get out of the area in exchange for a far bigger goal -- that is, a Middle East common market." [end Abu-Sharif] I met with Abu-Sharif in a small apartment, put at his disposal by a friend, on the 19th floor of a building overlooking the Seine and the Eiffel Tower. Abu-Sharif is recovering from an ear operation to restore the hearing faculties he lost about 20 years ago when a package sent to him blew up in his hands. At that time, he was considered a senior Fatah terrorist, and it is assumed that the parcel was sent to him by the Israeli Mosad. This man, whose face was disfigured, nevertheless went on to become an ardent "dove." The door of the apartment was opened carefully, just a few centimeters, by a blond French security officer with a walkie-talkie in his hand. Next to him was another Frenchman armed with a gun. Two other French security men were inside the apartment. The French Government sees to Abu-Sharif's security during his stay. Whenever he leaves the apartment, his entourage includes two cars, both of them carrying French bodyguards. The lounge is filled with smoke. There are large ashtrays and glasses of whiskey on the tables, and dozens of well-wishers calling on him after his operation: Palestinians; Lebanese working for UNESCO; a Jordanian guy who came especially from Amman; a rich Saudi who is a close friend of multimillionaire Adnan Khashoggi; many Frenchmen, such as the adviser of the mayor of Paris who returned that very same day from a visit to Syria and Iraq. As soon as I was introduced as an Israeli journalist, everybody wanted to talk and to exchange views about the Israel-PLO peace process. The phone rang continuously: Tunis, New York, Frankfurt, and again Tunis; the president of Yemen wants to speak to Abu-Sharif; then it is Madrid, Rome. Suddenly, a female friend calls out: "Bassam, it is Tunis on the line! The president wants you!" Abu-Sharif immerses himself in a long talk with 'Arafat. [Avrekh] "Some say you are `out,' that you are no longer part of 'Arafat's closest circle." [Abu-Sharif] "Nonsense! He asked me to pack my things and accompany him to Jericho. I asked him whether he would like me to leave before him in order to prepare the ground for his arrival. He replied: `No, I want you by my side when it is time to go'." [Avrekh] "If so, where did the rumors come from?" [Abu-Sharif] "Neither I nor my friends can be out. We are the founders. I am never far from the center of action, and that will also be the case in the future." [Avrekh] "Why did 'Arafat not take you along to the signing ceremony in Washington?" [Abu-Sharif] "It was beneath me to ask. My job is to promote the process of peace negotiations, and that is far more important than attending ceremonies. In the future, too, my duties will keep me away from ceremonies. After all, it is a known fact that I was the first Palestinian who pushed for negotiations with Israel. I have been the key figure pushing for such negotiations since 1988." [end Abu-Sharif] One may quite safely assume that Abu-Sharif harbors a certain amount of resentment toward 'Arafat, who failed to send him to Oslo as one of his representatives, take him to the ceremony in Washington, or give him a job on the negotiating delegation. If such resentment exists, however, Abu-Sharif goes to great lengths now to show it in any way. [Avrekh] "How big is the camp within the PLO that supports you and your views?" [Abu-Sharif] "A camp? There is no defined camp. We are the mainstream of the PLO. There are thousands who agree with me, and I am not necessarily talking about PLO members; I am talking about academics, technocrats, young and talented Palestinians. They are all in favor of peace. They are fed up with the bloodshed, just as Israelis are. They are eagerly waiting elections in the territories." [Avrekh] "What do you think should be the next step in the process?" [Abu-Sharif] "What is most important now is to establish institutions, to determine economic plans and form economic institutions manned by talented Palestinians. We have thousands of such youngsters, university graduates. Unfortunately, there is a serious dispute in our ranks over this issue. Some PLO leaders do not realize that if they fail to include high-caliber Palestinians, even if they are not members of the PLO, they will not be able to make progress. They must realize that the PLO is an organization, while the Palestinians are a people. "It is important not to waste time and energy on petty quarrels, on a meter here or there, and focus on strategic goals -- namely, the solidification of economic cooperation in the entire region. I am talking about a common market made up of Israel, the Palestinians, and the other Arab states." [Avrekh] "But the fact remains that the PLO has not yet presented any plans or set up economic cooperation institutions in the territories. Has 'Arafat drafted any economic plan?" [Abu-Sharif] "In my opinion, one of the mistakes of the PLO is that it is having a hard time moving from revolution to statehood. There is an enormous difference between an organization and a country. Ben-Gurion, too, was forced to abolish prestate underground organizations such as the Irgun and the Palmah, because he knew it would be impossible to found a state with so many political movements." [Avrekh] "What is the main obstacle to progress in the peace process?" [Abu-Sharif] "I am sorry to say that many people, both Arabs and Israelis, do not see the situation clearly. Only a few have the necessary vision. Shim'on Peres is an example of a man with such vision, and there are also a few Palestinians; however, the lack of vision of many people is what is causing problems in the negotiations." [Avrekh] "Does 'Arafat realize that he might `miss the train'?" [Abu-Sharif] "The peace process will not stop. When all is said and done, both we and the Israelis want to promote it. Nonetheless, the Israelis must realize that the Palestinians are Israel's bridge to the Middle East, while the Palestinians must see that the political plan they yearn for can only be attained through cooperation with Israel. Three-sided cooperation is needed at this stage between Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinians. This will constitute the first step toward a Middle East common market." [Avrekh] "But does 'Arafat understand that through his behavior over the past few weeks he has been sabotaging the chances of realizing the ideas you have just described?" [Abu-Sharif] "Peace and its implementation can no longer be killed by anybody. Whoever tries to do so will disappear. 'Arafat knows that very well. After all, he had the courage to step forward and extend his hand to Rabin." [Avrekh] "You have stressed the importance of economic cooperation several times. I have heard that you are now doing business with Adnan Khashoggi. Is that true?" [Abu-Sharif] "Let me tell you something funny. I first met Khashoggi here in Paris. I was staying in a hotel that has three suites: Khashoggi was in one, I was in another, and Ari'el Sharon was in the third. Khashoggi conducted 'shuttle trips' between Sharon's suite and mine in a bid to attain negotiations about Gaza. Sharon was prepared to give the Gaza Strip to the Palestinians, but the PLO would not agree to an arrangement that included only Gaza, which Sharon insisted on seeing as the final solution. Nothing came of it. "I have since met with Khashoggi on a number of occasions, all of them at President 'Arafat's instructions and never for private business. For example, I met with him shortly before the Gulf war. He was running back and forth between Saudi Arabia and Iraq in an attempt to prevent the war." [Avrekh] "Does everybody in the PLO agree with 'Arafat's moves?" [Abu-Sharif] "As is known, the PLO is made up of various organizations. Each one of them, however big or small, is independent. The largest and strongest of them is Fatah, which has a huge majority in the PLO. That is why any internal argument in Fatah automatically becomes a PLO problem. "Yes, everybody accepts the plan in principle, but there are differences about the implementation, just as there are arguments between Rabin and his cabinet ministers. That is legitimate. "There have always been differences within the Fatah leadership. The point is that when such conflicts break out at a time of delicate political negotiations, they stand out more than they ordinarily would. At the same time, it is clear to all that 'Arafat is the indisputable leader of Fatah. To wit, although the last Fatah congress passed a resolution to the effect that everybody should compete for his position, it was unanimously decided that 'Arafat would not have to compete and would remain the No. 1 man." [Avrekh] "Somebody told me that Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] was five votes short of reelection and almost did not make it. Suddenly there was a power outage, the computer went down, and 'Arafat announced that Abu-Mazin had been elected. How true is this report?" [Abu-Sharif] "If what you heard is true, 'Arafat did it because he supports the peace process and needs the votes of all those who support it, such as Abu-Mazin (laughing). But you should not infer from this that they always see eye to eye. "Nonetheless, it proves that 'Arafat is the man who calls the shots. However you look at it, 'Arafat is the man who runs Fatah and the PLO. In spite of all the complications, he is the man who can deliver the goods, and he will do so."
