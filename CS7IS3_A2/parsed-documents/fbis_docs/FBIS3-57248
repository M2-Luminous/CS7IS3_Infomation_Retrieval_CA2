Last night, Russian border guards foiled an attempt by an armed group to cross over from Tajikistan to Afghanistan, or rather from Afghanistan to Tajikistan -- I beg your pardon -- in the area of section five of border post no. 12 of the Pyandzh border detachment. Yesterday, in the area of the same border post, Russian border guards discovered a group of Tajik opposition fighters who intended to violate the border. In an exchange of fire that followed, three armed violators were killed, and the others retreated. Also yesterday, two rockets were fired at border post no. 12 from the territory of Afghanistan. Fortunately, there were no casualties among the border guards.
