South Africa is the largest of the 29 nations that recognize the Republic of China on Taiwan. Mainland China has said it wants to establish relations with Pretoria once South Africa holds all-race elections on 26 to 28 April. On Tuesday, Taipei's semi-official Central News Agency said President Li Teng-hui will attend the inauguration of the new South African president on 10 May. Tu Lin, director of the ROC [Republic of China] Foreign Ministry's African Affairs Department said Taipei is trying its hardest to maintain its relations with the future South Africa. Nelson Mandela's African National Congress [ANC] is widely expected to play a major role in any new South African government. The ANC has also said it wants to normalize ties with Peking, and the South African embassy in Taipei is not sure what is going to happen.
