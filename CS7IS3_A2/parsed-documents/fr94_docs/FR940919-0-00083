B. Treatment Standards for Chlorotoluenes K149_Distillation bottoms from the production of alpha (methyl) chlorinated toluenes, ring-chlorinated toluenes, benzoyl chlorides, and compounds with mixtures of these functional groups. (This waste does not include still bottoms from the distillation of benzyl chloride.) K150_Organic residuals, excluding spent carbon adsorbent, from the spent chlorine gas and hydrochloric acid recovery processes associated with the production of alpha (methyl) chlorinated toluenes, ring-chlorinated toluenes, benzoyl chlorides, and compounds with mixtures of these functional groups. K151_Wastewater treatment sludges, excluding neutralization and biological sludges, generated during the treatment of wastewaters from the production of alpha (methyl) chlorinated toluenes, ring-chlorinated toluenes, benzoyl chlorides and compounds with mixtures of these functional groups. EPA is promulgating the treatment standards that were proposed for chlorotoluene wastes. The preamble of the proposed rule describes the generation and characteristics in greater detail (58 FR 48121). Today's standards are concentration-based limits for wastewaters and nonwastewaters, numerically identical to the UTS promulgated elsewhere in this rule for the thirteen constituents regulated in these wastes. Comments received concerning the proposed treatment standards for chlorotoluene wastes came from the waste treatment industry; they were similar to those received concerning the treatment standards for coking wastes. Several waste treatment companies supported applying universal standards to these waste streams and the UTS concept in general. Two waste treatment companies objected to the benzene nonwastewater standards as unnecessarily high and pointed out that their facilities could achieve benzene limits below that proposed in the UTS. EPA, however, believes that the UTS for benzene nonwastewaters reflects an appropriate and broad assessment of benzene detection levels in combustion residues.
