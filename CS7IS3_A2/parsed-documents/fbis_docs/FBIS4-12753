Salute of the armed struggle, the only way to liberate Palestine; salute of the blessed intifadah, which forged the most splendid feats of struggle; salute from the honorable ones to other honorable ones: We in the group of the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque Martyrs [majmu'at shuhada' al-haram al-ibrahimi]-the Janin area claim responsibility for the following armed intifadah operations against enemy patrols: --Throwing a hand grenade at the entrance of Qabatiyah on 3 April 1994. --Throwing a hand grenade at the martyrs' triangle [muthallath al-shuhada'] on 8 April 1994. Enemy troops opened fire in a hysterical way. They also fired flares, closed the roads, and began a large-scale search for those who carried out the two operations, who returned safely to base.

It is a continuous intifadah until the land and man are liberated. [Signed] Your brothers in the group of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque Martyrs, PFLP-GC
