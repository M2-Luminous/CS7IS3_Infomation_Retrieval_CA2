The party has educated the Vietnamese people, particularly veterans, about that, and actual life has proven this during the revolutionary struggle. Even though they have suffered defeats in armed aggression, the imperialists have not changed their nature or plots. Now, along with making preparations to carry on armed aggression, their main method of aggression today is to cause turmoil and disorder and carry on "peaceful evolution" activities in an attempt to turn Vietnam into a dependent country within their orbit. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the socialist countries in Eastern Europe, they have promoted this strategy, which they refer to as a strategy for expanding victory. This is a very insidious strategy that is being carried on in two ways: They are stirring up turmoil and fostering local conflicts and carrying on "peaceful evolution" activities within each country in order to cause crises, poverty, and conflicts so that they can easily gain control. The situation in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, African countries, and a number of countries on other continents have proven this point today, there are 32 hot spots affecting 36 countries. In order to carry out this worldwide counterrevolutionary strategy, the imperialists have put forth four main policies: a. Both compete and cooperate with the major capitalist countries -- Western Europe and Japan -- in order to share the responsibilities, which actually means working together to eliminate the regimes of the independent countries and divide world rule. b. Continue to promote "democratization" in the SNG countries and Eastern Europe, which actually means to continue eliminating the achievements of socialism at the root and quickly promote the "capitalization" of those countries. c. Continue to transform the remaining socialist countries, the most important of which are China and Vietnam, and use Vietnam as the spearhead in the attack, because China is a large country that would take much more time; once Vietnam has been transformed, this evolutionary process will be promoted in China. d. Solidify and strengthen the political and military position of the United States in important zones, and gradually shift the center of immediate foreign affairs activities to Asia. Naturally, this is a subjective plot of theirs. Today, with the negative lessons from the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and other countries such as African countries that are suffering because of imperialist plots, the people of the world are on guard. The common trend today is toward national independence and peace. Internally, the American imperialists are facing many difficulties. They can't do everything they want. However, the decisive thing is that countries and peoples must be aware of their insidious plot and integrated offensive strategy--which includes political, ideological, organizational, economic, cultural, and social strategies, weapons, and both foreign and domestic forces--in order to constantly be on guard and actively defeat each of their stratagems and destructive plots. Vietnam is one of the key points where the enemy is carrying on "peaceful evolution" and trying to cause disorder. After many years, their plans to infiltrate armed exiles into Vietnam in order to establish "war zones" and disrupt things have been defeated. Thus, they have decided that the main method used to attack Vietnam will be "peaceful evolution" in conjunction with zonal violence. And they are coordinating outside forces with domestic forces. In each specific area, they rely on the hard-core forces and use specific forms of activities legal, quasi-legal, illegal, political, ideological, economic, cultural, and so on in order to build up their forces and political strength and create the proper conditions for "peaceful evolution" and disorder. As for strategic methods, they are using Cambodia and other conditions to penetrate Vietnam. They are blocking and destroying Vietnamese-Chinese relations. They are trying to prevent Vietnam from becoming strong economically, they continue to isolate us politically, and they are promoting ideological and moral decay. They are trying to penetrate state organizations, political and social organizations, and degraded and degenerate cadres, make use of the conflicts among the people and the mistakes of the cadres, and gradually invalidate the leadership of the party. Combining those two formulas disorder and loss of political stability and "peaceful evolution" will transform the system into a non-democratic, non-socialist system. In reality, they have carried on many activities to stir up trouble and create political instability, causing certain difficulties for us. Not including 1992 and prior years, in 1993 alone they carried out a number of activities. A typical example was what happened on 7 March in Ho Chi Minh City and nearby areas. They set off explosions, set fires, and planned to take over the city's radio and television stations and present themselves as a "government appealing for international help." With the spirit of vigilance of the people and people's security forces, we immediately crushed them. Thanks to the vigilance of the people and the correct and timely manner in which things have been handled by the administrative organizations, their plots and stratagems have all failed. Based on their activities, we can make generalizations about a number of their principal stratagems: They have used the mistakes made by a number of localities in implementing the policies and the gullibility and superstitious nature of a number of people to stir up trouble. They have set off simple and varied explosive devices and coordinated forces on the spot with forces from other localities. They have united reactionary elements posing as religious people and reactionary elements among the ethnic minorities, a number of puppet troops, and puppets of the old regime who refuse to reform themselves. They are in contact with people abroad and receive commands from abroad. Following their defeats in 1993 and in prior years, they realized that the situation was not yet ripe. In their view, for the situation to be ripe, there must be four conditions: 1. Steps must be taken to ensure that the people, particularly elements of the upper class and those engaged in social activities, are vague about political concepts, lose their socialist orientation, and accept the doctrine of pluralism and multiple parties. The party's leadership and the administration's control must gradually be invalidated. They say that there is a "germ" of this today, but this has not yet become a tide, and they are not yet strong enough. 2. There must be activist forces within using many forms of organization, including social democracy and radical democracy. This exists today but is not yet strong enough. 3. The reactionary and backward forces and rabble-rousers must be united under a unified command. They say that this is in the process of being formed.) 4. Active support must be provided from abroad. In order to bring about these conditions, they say that the resistance factions must be united and that well-known people must serve as the "banners" in propagating ideas and theories and carrying on legal and quasi-legal activities. Efforts must be concentrated on attacking a number of our positions and policies and specific mistakes made by us and on criticizing a number of leaders. They say that Vietnam has a tradition of patriotism and national pride and that the CPV has seized the nationalist banner. Because of this, slogans such as "eliminate socialism, eliminate the communist party" cannot be used. Instead, the mistakes and difficulties of the party and administration must be used to gradually erode and invalidate the leadership of the party. Only then will it be possible to create the conditions for toppling the system. Although the destructive activities mentioned above are important, they represent just the tip. Much more dangerous are their offensive activities on the ideological, political, economic, cultural, organizational, and espionage fronts. That is the core of their "peaceful evolution" offensive. 1. On ideological viewpoints, they have put forth the following requirements and contents: They say that in the stage when the situation is not yet ripe, requiring the people to directly oppose socialism and the communist party is excessive. Thus, socialism should not be criticized in its entirety. Instead, attacks should concentrate on the basic points of socialism such as the dictatorship of the proletariat, a single leading party, human rights, freedom, and so on. In order to do this, they have proposed a "third path," which they say does not follow capitalism or socialism or any other doctrine except freedom and prosperity. This is really aimed at abandoning the socialist path to follow the capitalist path. They reject the leadership of the communist party and the dictatorship of the proletariat, saying that the dictatorship of the proletariat is undemocratic and that the leading party has replaced god in ruling the people. They argue that President Ho's choice has not been fulfilled. While independence has been won, there is no freedom or happiness. And because Marxism-Leninism has made mistakes, the party has had to renovate itself. But the party has gone only half-way in renovating itself and so people must demand that it renovate itself more. The basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought must be abandoned and so on and so on. 2. They have put forth an action program -- which they call a scenario -- on Vietnam's transitional path. The contents are: At the start, there is no need to eliminate the communist party, but the party must renovate itself further. The party can then transform itself into a non-Marxist party and implement a system of political pluralism. The entire economy must be de-nationalized, the "independence" of the mass organizations must be assured and progressive and moderate political organizations must gradually come into being, with the tendency being toward political pluralism. Freedom must be expanded, opposition must be accepted, and so on. If the above "scenario" is implemented, the communist party and Vietnam's social system will be transformed into the system that they want, and that will be a "victory without war." They are disseminating the above arguments quite broadly using many means each week there are more than 100 documents, and in October 1993 alone there were 650 documents. They are also using meetings to propagandize the above theory and spreading rumors and sowing doubts. Recently, at a debate on Vietnam held by a number of Japanese businessmen, they mentioned having the CPV transform itself into a national party and having the Vietnamese system transform itself into a capitalist system. 3. On organization: They are not only propagating an anti-socialist viewpoint but also following the organizational path. Besides gathering people to openly voice opposition, they are trying to penetrate us using a variety of methods such as holding scientific debates, having groups come and go, and reviewing cooperative plans on the economic, cultural, and social fronts. We do not oppose the debates on economic and cultural exchanges. We have studied and accepted the scientific achievements of man and the economic and social management experiences of other countries. But we must wage a resolute struggle against the viewpoints of the enemy, who are using every form and means possible to destroy our system. 4. The economy: This is another very important struggle front against "peaceful evolution." Besides the economic embargo imposed by the American imperialists, the large capitalist countries have both fought for Vietnamese markets in order to reap large profits and also used the economic path in the hope of leading us into their trap. The following are a few examples: They have promised to invest a lot, but in reality, they have invested very little. They have invested mainly in private enterprises. They have emphasized investing in the travel, services, and processing sectors. Through economic activities, they have propagated depraved views and a corrupt culture, and they have bribed and corrupted cadres. 5. Culture, morality, and espionage: These, too, are fronts on which they are attacking us. Depraved cultural products that stimulate violence and debauchery, propagate a pragmatic way of life, and destroy good morals and good customs are corrupting some of our youths and children. Espionage and the theft of national secrets and activities aimed at causing splits among the people pose an immediate and long-term danger to defending and building the country. The "peaceful evolution" activities and other disruptive activities of the enemy forces pose a danger to the independence and path of development of our country. Opposing and defeating those activities is a strategic task of the entire party, all the people, and the entire political system of the state. This is a struggle front to defend the system and protect the fruits of the revolution and our nation's path forward. As revolutionary leaders have said, this struggle is a struggle on the political, ideological, economic, cultural, security, national defense, and social fronts. It must be waged using both education, discipline, and the laws; it must be both peaceful and violent; production must be stepped up; attention must be given to the people's standard of living; and the enemy must be isolated and exposed in order to defeat them. The immediate thing is to concentrate on the following: We must adhere firmly to a revolutionary socialist viewpoint, thoroughly understand the renovation lines and targets of the party with a scientific basis, and implement [the lines] more and more effectively. While making an effort to contribute to the struggle to have a prosperous people, strong country, fair society, and civilized country with a socialist orientation, we must never forget that the expansion of production with many economic elements must have a socialist orientation. We must open the door and study the scientific and technical achievements of other countries, but we must not forget to adhere to the concept of independence, sovereignty, and self-reliance. We must expand investment cooperation in order to attract capital and raw materials and gain experience, but we must not forget the struggle to eliminate the opportunistic and destructive factors. We must be vigilant and actively criticize the erroneous arguments and the distortions of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought, socialism, and the leadership of the party. Democracy must be elevated along with maintaining discipline and the laws. Those two aspects are inseparable in building strength. Democracy starts from the interests of the people, by the people, and for the people. Discipline is necessary to defend democracy. There must be active participation in mobilizing the masses, implementing the policy of great national solidarity, handling the "burning issues" and conflicts among the people, implementing the economic-cultural-social development programs and security and national defense programs in the localities to bring practical benefits to the people, and opposing corruption, smuggling, and other social evils.
