FBIS4-378 "drafr069_a_94012" FBIS-AFR-94-069 Daily Report 10 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Army Chief on `Containment' of RPF Advance Army Chief on `Containment' of RPF Advance EA1004171594 Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise in French 1123 GMT 10 Apr 94 EA1004171594 Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise French BFN [Excerpts] Dear listeners, due to the grave moments Rwanda is going through, mainly characterized by insecurity in the country particularly here in the capital, Kigali, and also characterized by the obstinacy of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], which has unilaterally decided to resume war, because of all this, our colleague Jean-Francois Nsengiyumva approached Colonel B.M. Gatsinzi, the interim chief of staff of the national Armed Forces to ask him how the country's Armed Forces and those in charge of security felt about all these issues. [passage omitted] [Nsengiyumva] Col. Gatsinzi, you are the interim chief of staff since the tragic disappearance of titular chief of staff, Deogratias Nsabimana, who disappeared in the accident, I mean, the presidential jet that was shot down as it approached Kanombe [airport]. [passage omitted] Following this tragic disappearance, some elements of the Presidential Guard and even other elements of the civilian population who were angered by the disappearance indulged in violence, sometimes unprecedented, which cost the lives of many personalities of the country, including the prime minister, Madame Agathe Uwilingiyimana. Therefore, I would like to ask you what concrete actions you are taking, as the security forces, to restore peace in the country and contain the situation so that the population can once again live peacefully. [Gatsinzi] [passage omitted] This tragic event afflicted and saddened the entire Rwandan population including the Rwandan Armed Forces. Unfortunately, there are some in the Army who left their barracks and with anger, maybe seeking revenge, killed some personalities and people. These people were not at all sent by the command of the military authorities. (?These are) (?people) who strayed, who spread left and right through the town. But I would like to assure you that at the moment this trend has been contained and the soldiers have been called back and kept in their barracks. The authorities have given instructions that peace must be restored in the city center and in the surrounding areas of Kigali, using elements that are usually charged with security, the gendarmerie and the military police, to go and search for those who strayed and bring them back to their barracks and to stop these activities. I can assure you that the situation is currently returning to normal. We continue to do everything possible to restore peace and calm. But unfortunately there are some other people, bandits, who have taken advantage of the (?uprising) and interfered in the problems by looting and massacring the population, sometimes for the sake of settling scores. [sentence indistinct]. Now, measures have been taken and are being implemented for the gradual restoration of peace in the country. This is the number one concern of the Crisis Committee, to see the return of peace and for the political authorities to recoup the leadership of the state, to give all instructions as befits their power for the return of peace and the resumption of normal life so that the government can function. We have helped to facilitate government members, who were scattered left and right, (?to meet) so that they alone can decide on the future of the country. The Army has not interfered in any way. We have just facilitated their meetings and contacts. And all the decisions were taken by the government, and the establishment of the latter is the prerogative of the political authorities. The Army has not interfered in that. [Nsengiyumva] Colonel, alongside this regrettable situation of insecurity, we have learned that the RPF-Inkotanyi decided two days ago, I think, to resume war instead of helping the Rwandan Government, its new partner. According to the terms of the Arusha Accord, it is the Rwandan Government that is the other signatory, so instead of helping this partner to restore peace in the country, the RPF has unilaterally decided to resume hostilities. For your part, are you ready to face these [words indistinct] attacks in order to reassure the population? [Gatsinzi] It is very regrettable that the RPF has resumed hostilities by leaving the premises of the National Development Council, where it was staying, and attacking the military barracks of Kimihurura [in Kigali] whose soldiers carried out massacres on the population. As I have said, it was not all the soldiers, but just some of them--in fact, maybe people disguised as soldiers. Investigations have been launched, and these will establish the truth. But it is very regrettable that the RPF has taken up arms and resumed hostilities. But as it is the duty of the Rwandan Armed Forces to protect the population, the security forces and the Rwandan Armed Forces in particular have contained the attacks of the RPF, which indeed, are [word indistinct] on the entire northern front [words indistinct]. At the same time, we were trying to help the establishment of the government so that it could continue contacts and negotiations with the RPF within the framework of implementing the peace accords, despite the recent disappearances, to avoid having a political vacuum. The Rwandan Armed Forces urgently call upon the RPF partners to use their goodwill to restore the climate of peace and negotiations, and not to favor war, for one cannot trust war as a solution, since it can be (?fatal).
