ACTION: Extension of closing date for submittal of applications under the Youth Gang Drug Prevention program announcement cited above. SUMMARY: On May 9, 1994, the Administration on Children, Youth and Families published a program announcement in the Federal Register (59 FR 23867). The announcement solicited applications from eligible agencies and organizations to conduct community-based, comprehensive and coordinated activities to reduce and prevent the involvement of youth in gangs that engage in illicit drug-related activities. Because of recent flooding in the Southeastern United States, which disrupted normal work schedules, we are allowing all prospective applicants more time to submit their applications. Therefore, we are extending the due date for submission of applications by two business days. The due date is extended from July 8 to July 12, 1994. (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number 93.660, Youth Gang Drug Prevention Program) Dated: July 7, 1994. Joseph A. Mottola, Deputy Commissioner, Administration on Children, Youth and Families.
