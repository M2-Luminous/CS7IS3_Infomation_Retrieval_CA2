FR941227-2-00054 FR941227-2-00043 Enactment of the 1987 Act, particularly the provisions authorizing the merger of unlike banks and associations, has caused the FCA to reevaluate its policies regarding the official names of institutions. The FCA Board has concluded that institutions should have the maximum flexibility possible in proposing official names for their institutions. At the same time, the official name of an institution should always be one that can be readily identified as belonging to one of the various types of institutions regulated by the FCA. For instance, one must be able to know whether a bank can lend to cooperatives, like a bank for cooperatives, or whether an association can only make short-term loans, like a PCA. The FCA Board has now determined that it will issue charters for institutions which contain the statutorily sanctioned names ``production credit association,'' Federal land bank association,'' ``bank for cooperatives,'' and ``Farm Credit Bank.'' If an institution requests an official name that does not incorporate one of those terms, the official name must include the acronym for the appropriate term after the name. For instance, the Production Credit Association of North Central Jersey could request a change in its name to ``Farm Credit Services of North Central Jersey, PCA.'' The FCA Board will also issue charters for institutions that contain the name ``agricultural credit association,'' for an association formed by the merger of a production credit association and a Federal land bank association, the name ``Federal land credit association,'' for a Federal land bank association that has direct lending authority, and the name ``agricultural credit bank,'' for a bank formed by the merger of a Farm Credit Bank and a bank for cooperatives. If such an institution requests an official name that does not include the appropriate term, the name must be followed by the acronym ``ACA,'' ``FLCA,'' or ``ACB.'' For instance, a Federal land bank association that has acquired direct lending authority could use names such as ``Farm Credit of Central City, FLCA,'' or ``Federal Land Bank Association of Central City, FLCA.'' Delegation of Authority: Any delegation of authority relative to approval of or changes to Farm Credit institution names will be covered under FCA Board Policy Statement on Rules for the Transaction of Business and Operational Responsibilities of the FCA Board, No. FCA&hyph;PS&hyph;58 as adopted 07&hyph;FEB&hyph;94 and as it may be amended. Reporting Requirements: The Corporate Affairs Division (CAD) will provide to the Office of the Board a copy of any approved charter amendment request. The CAD will also summarize all charter amendments and charter issuances in its quarterly Corporate Restructuring report. Dated this 13th day of October, 1994 by order of the Board. Dated: December 20, 1994. Floyd Fithian, Acting Secretary, Farm Credit Administration Board. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31640 Filed 12&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6705&hyph;01&hyph;P
