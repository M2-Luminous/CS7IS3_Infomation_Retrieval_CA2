FR940720-0-00074 FR940720-0-00006 g. List of Reformulated Gasoline Properties to be Established by Testing. Section 80.65(e)(2)(i) contains a list of reformulated gasoline properties that must be established by testing. This list in the final rule includes 50% distillation (T&hyph;50) and 90% distillation (T&hyph;90) (the temperatures in degrees F at which 50% and 90% of a liquid are evaporated). This list is being revised to add terms for E200 and E300 (the percent of a liquid that are evaporated at 200 and 300 degrees F). E200 and E300 are correlated with T&hyph;50 and T&hyph;90, and may be approximated from T&hyph;50 and T&hyph;90 measurements using conversion equations. The most accurate way of determining the E200 and E&hyph;300 of gasoline, however, is using ASTM&hyph;86&hyph;90, the distillation test method specified at §80.46(d). As a result, the list of mandatory testing is being expanded to include the E&hyph;200 and E&hyph;300 terms. This expansion does not constitute a change from the mandatory testing requirements for reformulated gasoline, because the E200 and E300 terms are established as part of the ASTM&hyph;86&hyph;90 distillation test that already is required. The correlation ranges for E&hyph;200 and E&hyph;300, 2.5 vol% and 3.5 vol% respectively, that are included in the §80.65(e)(2)(i) table are the reproducibility figures for these terms from the ASTM test, and are comparable to the five degrees F correlation range provided for the T&hyph;50 and T&hyph;90 terms. h. Reconciliation of Test Results. Section 80.65(e)(2)(ii)(A) is being revised to clarify one option for reconciling reformulated gasoline test results from a refiner's or importer's laboratory as compared with test results from an independent laboratory. Under this option, where the refiner's or importer's test result for any parameter is not confirmed, the refiner or importer would use the result for that parameter that is the ``worst case'' for the refiner or importer (``best case'' for the environment). Under this option in the final rule, the smaller of the two results for oxygenates is used for calculating all standards except RVP. This option is being revised to refer to oxygenates as a class without separately naming each oxygenate. This change will keep the option from becoming dated if any new oxygenates are used in reformulated gasoline. The option also is being revised to eliminate the larger oxygenate volume assumption in the case of RVP, because RVP is a parameter that is measured directly. Any oxygenate effect on RVP will be measured in the RVP test and would not be changed by a calculation using the ``worst case'' oxygenate level. i. Attest Engagement Requirement. Section 80.65(h) is being revised to specify that the attest engagement requirement applies to oxygenate blenders who meet the oxygen standard on average, and not to oxygenate blenders who meet the oxygen standard on a per-gallon basis. This change conforms §80.65(h) with §80.69(b)(4) which limits the attest engagement requirement to oxygenate blenders who average. 3. Compliance Surveys (§80.68) Section 80.68(c)(13) is being revised to clarify when VOC and NO X emissions reduction calculations must be reported to EPA by the surveyor under the gasoline quality survey requirements. 5 VOC emissions reduction calculations must be reported only for surveys during June 1 through September 15 of each year, including simple model surveys where a specified simple model VOC emissions reduction equation is cross-referenced. NO X emission reduction calculations must be reported for all complex model surveys before January 1, 2000, and beginning on January 1, 2000 for surveys outside the period June 1 through September 15. NO X surveys are not required during June 1 through September 15 under Phase II (beginning on January 1, 2000) because the Clean Air Act's restriction on NO X increases is satisfied through the NO X reductions required for VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline under Phase II. The rationale for this approach for NO X surveys is discussed at 59 FR 7773 (February 16, 1994). 5 This notice is also adding the paragraph number for this provision, which was inadvertently omitted in the notice of final rulemaking. 4. Covered Areas (§80.70) a. Putnam and Orange Counties, New York. In order to correct an oversight in the final rule, §80.70(d)(3) is being amended to include Putnam and Orange Counties, New York, as part of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island-Connecticut ``covered area.'' These counties are part of the New York City CMSA and are thus appropriately part of the New York City reformulated gasoline covered area. See 57 FR 13444 (April 16, 1992). Putnam and Orange Counties are also included in the New York City CMSA for purposes of the oxygenated fuels program requirements.
