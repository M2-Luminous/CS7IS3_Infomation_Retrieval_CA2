FR941202-0-00137 FR941202-0-00012 FHWA 49 CFR Chapter III List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 382 Alcohol and drug abuse, Highway safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons stated in the preamble, the FHWA amends 49 CFR part 382, as follows: PART 382_CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND ALCOHOL USE AND TESTING 1. The authority for part 382 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 31136, 31301 et seq., 31502; and 49 CFR 1.48. 2. Section 382.107 is amended by adding, in alphabetical order, a definition for ``positive rate'' and revising the definition of ``refuse to submit'' as follows: §382.107 Definitions. * * * * * Positive rate means the number of positive results for random controlled substances tests conducted under this part plus the number of refusals of random controlled substances tests required by this part, divided by the total of random controlled substances tests conducted under this part plus the number of refusals of random tests required by this part. * * * * * Refuse to submit (to an alcohol or controlled substances test) means that a driver: (1) Fails to provide adequate breath for alcohol testing as required by Part 40 of this title, without a valid medical explanation, after he or she has received notice of the requirement for breath testing in accordance with the provisions of this part, (2) Fails to provide an adequate urine sample for controlled substances testing as required by Part 40 of this title, without a genuine inability to provide a specimen (as determined by a medical evaluation), after he or she has received notice of the requirement for urine testing in accordance with the provisions of this part, or (3) Engages in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process. 3. Section 382.305 is revised to read as follows: §382.305 Random testing. (a) (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing shall be 25 percent of the number of drivers each selection period. (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random controlled substances testing shall be 50 percent of the number of drivers each selection period. (b) The FHWA Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for alcohol testing is based on the reported violation rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn from the alcohol management information system reports required by §382.403 of this part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the FHWA Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry violation rate. Each year, the FHWA Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing of drivers. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication. (c) (1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 25 percent or more, the FHWA Administrator may lower this rate to 10 percent of all drivers if the FHWA Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of §382.403 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less than 0.5 percent. (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 50 percent, the FHWA Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all drivers if the FHWA Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of §382.403 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less than 1.0 percent but equal to or greater than 0.5 percent. (d) (1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 10 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of §382.403 for that calendar year indicate that the violation rate is equal to or greater than 0.5 percent, but less than 1.0 percent, the FHWA Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 25 percent for all drivers. (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 25 percent or less, and the data received under the reporting requirements of §382.403 for that calendar year indicate that the violation rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the FHWA Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 50 percent for all drivers.
