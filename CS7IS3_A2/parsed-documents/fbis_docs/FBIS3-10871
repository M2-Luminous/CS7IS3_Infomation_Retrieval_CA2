He has also announced a special prosecutor's office was created to investigate the murder, reiterating "our hands our clean." In San Cristobal de las Casas, residents of the municipality's poorest areas created a Unity Civic Front [Frente Civico de Unidad] in support of Father Samuel Ruiz Garcia, the diocese's bishop and mediator in the armed conflict. In Tuxtla Gutierrez, more than 5,000 people participated in a rally organized by PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] municipal leaders and Municipal Council President Julio Cesar Garcia to demand peace in Chiapas. Meanwhile, the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN] began consultations with its grass roots regarding the agreements reached with Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, during the so-called meetings for peace. Since 9 March representatives of different Altos de Chiapas communities have been going to the towns of La Garrucha and Pantehuitz, Ocosingo Municipality, to participate in the consultation to accept or reject the commitments the federal government has made in San Cristobal Cathedral. Antonio Hernandez, a member of the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC), has said the group will ask for the abolition of the state government and the promotion of a provisional pact with the federal government to propose the overhauling of the state's territorial and political structure. Hernandez, who is also a state leader of the CIOAC [Independent Federation of Agricultural Workers and Peasants], has said: "They tell us we are crazy for making this proposal, but there is no other alternative due to the current Chiapas government's incapacity and lack of political commitment, something that was borne out during our march of 6 March when the governor refused to meet with us and sent us the police." The state governor praised publicly Mariano Perez Diaz, who was an OCEZ leader in Chiapas' northern zone, and he denied the existence of a "witch hunt" or that a prize has been put on the head of anyone. "The masterminds and perpetrators of this crime will be punished in accordance to the law. This is an act of provocation," he has affirmed. In a ceremony held at the auditorium of the Government Palace in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Lopez Moreno has urged state residents "against affixing lightly blame beforehand or being prejudiced. Nobody will succeed in separating the state government from local Indian organizations." In Simojovel, where Perez Diaz was buried, the governor has announced the creation of a special prosecutor's office, which the CEOIC will name. The governor has said the murder was regrettable, because Perez Diaz was an outstanding social activist. With Margarita Ruiz de Perez, widow of the peasant leader, present, Lopez Moreno has said his administration is opening its doors, because there is nothing to hide. There has been no complicity or illicit interests. Relatives of the deceased peasant leader have said Simojovel Council President Francisco Meneses Bassoul paid gunmen to kill Perez Diaz. They have also said there will be a march to demand justice and punishment for the masterminds and perpetrators of the crime. Mrs. Perez has said her husband had received death threats from Peasant Torch Oraganization and people from the village of Concepcion de los Cacaos, Simojovel Municipality, headed by his compadre, Sosimo Vasquez, with whom he had differences regarding land. In San Cristobal de las Casas, a pro-Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia Unity Civic Front was created. The group has decided to remain united to oppose those who want the clergyman to leave. They have said the bishop has helped them more than any coleto (San Cristobal de las Casas native) and felt it was unfair to accuse him of being responsible for the problems that began on 1 January. PRI supporters from different low-income areas of the city have also held a demonstration in Tuxtla Gutierrez to protest what they regard as the "stamping on of the constitution" of the state. More than 5,000 people came out in favor of restoring peace in Chiapas. CIOAC leader Hernandez has said the CEOIC will seek to meet with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to ask him to keep the commitments he made with the 280 groups that comprise that organization. He recalled later on 13 and 14 March the National Meeting of Indian and Peasant Organizations will meet in San Cristobal de las Casas to draft "a coordinated plan to demand the dissolution of the Chiapas government to establish a supreme government of Indians and non-Indians." Domingo Lopez Angel, leader of the Community of People Expelled from Chiapas [Comunidad de Expulsados de Chiapas], has said his group will abstain from taking over additional state buildings as a gesture of goodwill to contribute to peace. Meanwhile, peasant groups still control the municipal president's offices in Bella Vista and Sultepec in Chiapas Sierra Madre. The offices of the mayor of Tuzantan and Mazatan on the coast remain occupied. In those four cases, the protesters are demanding the dissolution of the local governments, because the mayors used public funds and did not carry out any projects.
