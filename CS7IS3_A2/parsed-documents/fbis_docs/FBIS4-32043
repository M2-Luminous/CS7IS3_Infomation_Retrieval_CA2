Speaking about his attitude toward the SDSS's close cooperation with the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], Hruby said that it was exactly the same as that of [late SDSS Chairman] Alexander Dubcek. Hruby noted that, during elections to the SDSS Central Council at the last party congress, he had received the largest number of votes of all candidates. In spite of that and in spite of his being SDSS deputy chairman, he had been offered the 46th place on the joint slate of candidates [of the Left Choice coalition of four left-wing, agrarian, and green parties]. He added that not every SDSS member was buying the honey-sweet rhetoric [not further specified), which is why it is quite possible that the party will split into two entities. He said that it was questionable whether Jaroslav Volf's friends from the SDL would still be interested in the Social Democratic appendage that will stay with Volf. Yesterday, we asked SDSS Chairman Jaroslav Volf: "Your party is supposedly falling apart. Is that true?" He replied: "It is possible that some people harbor this wish. Farmers and Greens had already been targeted, and I suppose it is now the Social Democrats' turn.... I believe, however, that this is just the effort of certain people from the outside to exploit the personal disappointment of individuals who have not been successful on the slate of candidates or, possibly, a case of failure to comprehend that the preservation of the party's identity is not incompatible with a coalition, which can, moreover, spread Social Democratic ideas and give them much greater publicity and a chance also in parliament and the government. I cannot but assess these efforts by individuals as an attempt that will most likely not meet with a favorable response in our party. Quite the contrary. These people are actually sealing their own fate."
