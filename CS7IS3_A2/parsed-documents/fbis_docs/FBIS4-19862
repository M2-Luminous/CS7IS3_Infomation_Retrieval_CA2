Fini hoped that Berlusconi would not invoke Article 92 of the Constitution and independently choose his ministerial team. He added that if Berlusconi were asked to form the government he would be able to offer complete guarantees for avoiding a conflict of interest, perhaps via a guarantor. Fini said he was sure that the government would have the Senate's confidence. [passage omitted]
