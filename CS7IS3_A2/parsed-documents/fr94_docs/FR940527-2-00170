A decision analysis process will be used to further refine and analyze the alternatives as part of the EIS process. Following analysis of the environmental consequences of each alternative, TVA will prepare a Draft EIS for public review and comment. Notice of the availability of this draft will be announced, comments on the draft solicited, and information about additional public meetings/hearings will be published at a future date.
