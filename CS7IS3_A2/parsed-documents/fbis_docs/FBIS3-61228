How do you assess the results of the economic reforms in 1993? 2. What, in your opinion, should we expect in 1994? These questions are answered by leaders of the leading economic-analytical centers of Russia. The materials will be published in full in the international journal DELOVYYE LYUDI (No. 12, 1993 and No. 1, 1994) Yevgeniy Saurov, Director of the Center for Information and Social Technologies under the Government of the Russian Federation: "Pouring Dollars into Mercedes Is Not Farsighted" 1. The experience of two years of reforms convinces us that we have climbed onto an "economic roller coaster." In the winter, by compressing the monetary mass we slow up the rates of inflation. In the spring, by advancing credit we return to our previous positions. Depending on the rates of inflation, the level of production increases somewhat or, especially during August-September, its decline increases. This is the second year in which we have been living in such a cycle. The amplitude of the fluctuations is somewhat less this year. It is still unrealistic to speak about putting an end to inflation. 1993 was a year of in-depth study of the market by enterprise leaders. While last year everyone went through what might be called the introductory course, now they feel like sophomores. There are more enterprises which are not certain whether they will survive or not. Those that are not viable, of course, do no good for the economy. They must be reprofiled, showing concern for retraining the people. This work is already underway during the process of privatization. This is a gratifying phenomenon. There are also points of great tension--the coal industry, for example. I have my doubts about the published data on the decline of production. It is fairly great. But it is linked primarily to the reduction of military orders. To the reduction of the "self-consuming" production of machine building. To the reduction of the output of poor-quality products. While a year ago there was a plethora in the viable branches, in 1993 signs of a positive structural change appeared during the slump. Thus things were not bad in the construction materials industry. There was a very slight growth in housing construction, mainly because of the individual sector. But the situation with electric energy is alarming: With all the problems of the economy, the consumption of kilowatt-hours is not decreasing. The country has forgotten about economizing on resources. What prices must we have for energy resources so that consumers will finally begin to be concerned about economizing on them?! It is bad that the dollar is not being put to work in the country. Entrepreneurs, as before, prefer to keep their hard currency abroad. There is a great disparity between exports and imports. This is evidence of a prolonged poor condition in the economy. The result of distortions in legislation and political instability. Measures of law enforcement organs cannot solve such economic problems. Russia can obtain a significant influx of currency not from foreign investors but from "their own," those who are keeping their dollars abroad. Putting them into circulation in the West, our ill-starred entrepreneurs have a poor idea of the rules of the game in local markets and are not aware of the immense risk to themselves. Incidentally, the risk in Russia is even greater. This means that we must seriously create conditions for business at home. The fact that domestic prices are coming close to world prices threatens to strike a blow to exports. Only high-quality products can be moved. The game involving cheap raw material and a cheap work force is coming to an end. But high quality requires expenditures: the purchase of new technologies and so forth. Pouring dollars into Mercedes is shortsighted. A new reality will be clearly manifested in the forthcoming year. The year 1993 was marked by development of reforms. It proceeded as though of its own accord, with less participation by the government, and with a smaller degree of state regulation. The year showed that a fairly serious, aggressive business has appeared in the country although, true, it is not very civilized yet. It is in a state of development. 2. It is difficult to predict the situation today purely economically: a great deal depends on political decisions. In the absence of a pro-inflation parliament the government might possibly be able to hold down the mass of money better throughout the winter. But inflation could be significantly encouraged by campaign promises and difficulties in relations with the regions. We will not manage to reduce inflation significantly in 1994. The other danger--unemployment--might become serious. Not catastrophic, but in any case it is very undesirable. It is necessary to make the designation of social protection more specific. As one of the developers of the new housing system I am particularly against the same low payment for service for privatized apartments for low-income families and for Konstantin Borovoy. The income level must not be ignored. The year will not bring the country out of its crisis. But I hope that there will be more appreciable outcroppings of hope than there were this year. Stanislav Shatalin, Academician, President of the International Fund for Economic and Social Reforms, and Sergey Fateyev, Chief of the Department of Reform Strategy of the Fund: "It Will Not Be Possible To Compensate for the Collapse of the Social Sphere" 1. It is not easy to give an assessment during a transition period. There are at least two groups of criteria that lie on completely different planes. The first are the directly macroeconomic indicators of current development, and the second are the institutional changes (since we are speaking about reforms). As for the first group of criteria, regardless of what has been said about signs of "stabilization" in the economy, a sober analysis of the results of three quarters of 1993 (there were no statistical data for the fourth quarter by the time this text was written.--Ed.) shows the opposite. The decline (as compared to three quarters of 1992) in the majority of productions did indeed slow up, but stabilization as a condition of steady equilibrium and the appearance of signs of upsurge did not occur. As a rule, the slowing up or even termination of the recession in certain months in certain branches was then replaced by a drop in production. Based on seasonal and random factors it is still impossible to draw a conclusion about stabilization. Taking into account the real condition of production capital in the majority of branches, and the continuing imbalance in the national economy, one can state that the "low point" has not yet been reached. Incidentally, if one considers the situation in retrospect it is not inappropriate to recall that government representatives have already repeatedly reported "signs of stabilization," but the time frames for it are constantly being moved back. The same thing can be said about inflation, the budget deficit, etc. The reduction of the monthly rates of inflation by the summer of 1993 from 25 percent to 17-19 percent was replaced in August by an increase almost up to 30 percent, and then again a certain slowing down. The reduction of the budget deficit was again followed by an increase. The standard of living of the population has continued to decline. According to our estimates, the inflation index from September 1992 through September 1993 was 1,254 percent, while the growth of monetary incomes of the population during the same period was 1,037 percent. The instability of economic development during 1993 was accompanied by a collapse of the social sphere, which it has not been possible to compensate for in recent years even with the active formation of new principles of social policy. In general, economic development throughout almost all of 1993 proceeded under conditions of a keen political struggle, and this fact alone could in no way contribute to economic stabilization. As for constitutional changes, that is, reformation as such, here without any doubt there have been certain advances. The number of privatized enterprises has increased significantly and privatization has indeed become irreversible, although it is frequently of a formally legal nature. The structure of property is changing, all the new elements of the market infrastructure are being created, and production is beginning to react to demand. Nonetheless, since these processes are taking place in an extremely unfavorable general economic situation in which a high degree of monopolization is retained in many cases, the changes are occurring randomly and without control. Unless there are positive structural changes, under conditions where price disproportions remain there is still the probability of the creation of a pseudo-market with all the consequences that ensue from that. Therefore, in our opinion, although 1993 brought certain positive changes on the industrial plane, they are still clearly not sufficient to enable us to speak about the success of the reforms even in this area. 2. Naturally, there is no justification for speaking of any economic advancement in 1994. As we know, the future of the economy is being set today and yet the investment climate throughout 1993 remained extremely unfavorable for the majority of branches--the enterprises do not have the reserves for successful operation. What features of development in 1994 can be predicted as the most probable? The overall decline of production will continue, although at slower rates. At the same time the decline in certain branches will begin to be partially compensated for by advancement in others. There will be increased differentiation in the economic position of the regions. The high level of inflation will remain. It will be practically impossible to reduce it to less than 10 percent per month. The task will be to learn to pursue an industrial and social policy with a high level of inflation. On the whole, there should be no economic catastrophe next year. At the same time, if 1994 does become the beginning of stabilization (which is not very likely), the completion of this process will take an extremely long time and can by no means be done within a year even with the most optimistic predictions. It is extremely likely that we will manage to stop the decline of the standard of living of the population. Problems of employment will be aggravated, but unemployment will not develop to the point of a national catastrophe. The problem of bankruptcy will definitely make itself felt in 1994, including, probably, among enterprises that have undergone privatization. Moreover, it is likely that some of the bankruptcies will be caused by shortcomings and mistakes that occurred during the period of reforms and flaws in the market infrastructure that is being formed. It is impossible to rule out a series of financial failures in the security market. On the whole, 1994 will more likely show a readiness to overcome new difficulties rather than the possibility of really "seeing the light at the end of the tunnel." Yakov Urinson, Acting Minister of the Economy of the Russian Federation, Director of the Center for Economic Market Conditions and Prognostication under the Russian Federation Ministry of the Economy: "The Results are Contradictory, But the Balance Sheet Is Positive" 1. The results of the reform in 1993 are extremely contradictory. On the one hand, the elimination of the plan-distribution system has been completed and the process of liberalization (of prices and domestic and foreign trade) and privatization has continued. Goods, although they are much more expensive, have filled the shelves of stores and wholesale warehouses. Although the ruble has lost value, the functions of the main means of payment in cash and noncash settlements lost at the beginning of the reform have been restored. At the center of public interest directives of the state plan have been replaced by finances and budget, monetary circulation and credit, hard currency exchange rates, and customs tariffs. People have stably accepted the higher cost of living, the weakening of state paternalism, and the economic instability. Some have changed the structure of consumption and begun to spend most of their income on food, while others have changed their employment and found additional earnings, and still others have entered into entrepreneurship. After the decline of the gross domestic product by 20 percent in 1992, in 1993 it decreased by no more than 12 percent. In 1993 investments are decreasing by 10 percent (as against 40 percent in 1992). A positive foreign trade balance is forming in Russia (true, mainly because of a reduction of imports). After the sharp reduction in 1992 (approximately twofold) the actual monetary incomes at the disposal of the population this year are expected to increase somewhat (so far only in the range of 5 percent). But on the other hand, against the background of the already low standard of living, there has been an increase in the differentiation in the well-being of groups of the population at opposite poles. There have appeared not only legal millionaires, but also people who are officially registered as unemployed. Certain defense plants have been left without government orders and there has been no effective demand for the products of many state enterprises. It has turned out to be necessary to interact with republics of the former Soviet Union in the economic sphere as with foreign states, that is, on a mutually advantageous basis, and the maintenance of a ruble space without regulating and formalizing monetary-credit relations among the countries included in it disorganizes the economy of Russia. In addition to this, subjective factors have manifested themselves in a certain way as objective processes, having a negative effect on the reformation of the economy. The "gift" financial resources aimed at eliminating the consequences but not the causes of the nonpayments, cheap credit for state enterprises, subsidies for agriculture and the coal industry, subsidization of regions, and "technical" credits for republics of the former Soviet Union--all these served as an impediment to the formation of a mechanism for feedback between production and demand. Under conditions of inflation the enterprises began to transfer their relatively free monetary funds into a consumption fund or to apply for freely convertible currency. The former increased the mass of money in the hands of the population and stirred up inflation even more while the latter prompted a decline in the exchange rate of the ruble on the foreign currency market. The situation was exacerbated by the unjustified social payments (higher pensions and labor compensation in the budget sphere) and a random growth of wages (including under pressure from strike ultimatums). It is especially dangerous that in 1993 institutional changes regulating the behavior of commodity producers slowed up drastically. As long as they do not bear real property liability for the results of their activity and as long as unviable enterprises of the state enterprise continue to receive support from the budget, the inflationary process will apply more and more pressure to the economy. The consequences of inflationary financing of the economy: retardation of the structural rearrangement, increased energy and material-intensiveness per unit of GDP, growth of the budget deficit, and a new (August-fall) cycle of inflation. But still the overall assessment of these positive processes and negative phenomena is clearly positive. The country will enter 1994 with a significantly altered economy. 2. In 1994 it will be necessary to restore a strict financial policy on a qualitatively new level, consistently reduce the state budget deficit to a tolerable level, and hold back the growth of the mass of money. As calculations show, this will make it possible to limit inflation to 500-600 percent (as compared to 1,100 percent in 1993). By regulating the bank interest rate at the same time it will be possible to create the necessary preconditions for invigorating the capital market and stimulating private savings, and in the next cycle--investments as well. Such measures must be conducted resolutely, but in a balanced way. It is also necessary to give a new impetus to the process of privatization and overcome the obstacles that have been artificially erected on its path. At the same time it is extremely important for enterprises remaining in the state sector of the economy to revise the legislative base for their economic activity in reduced periods of time. The finances of these enterprises must be clearly separated from state finances. Within the framework of the strict restrictions that are dictated by the requirements for financial stabilization, support (through government orders, preferential credit, and direct budget financing) must be given to enterprises with all forms of ownership selected in keeping with strict criteria and nationwide priorities. During the course of the market transformations there will inevitably be an increase in unemployment (in 1994 it will be necessary to find work for about 4 million able-bodied citizens) and an aggravation of problems of social protection. This means payment for structural rearrangement and increased effectiveness of the economy. The task of the federal government and local authorities is to minimize this payment and render special-purpose social support to segments of the population that objectively need it, granting capable citizens the broadest possibilities of manifesting initiative, increasing labor productivity, and participating in entrepreneurial activity. With the implementation of the aforementioned parts of the economic reform in 1944 the budget deficit will decrease to an acceptable level. The decline in production will not exceed 5-7 percent and it will assume a structural character. There will be some increase in the incomes actually at the disposal of the population. The population and enterprises will gradually begin to form natural savings. With the achievement of a positive rate of bank interest, investment activity will increase. During the process of structural rearrangement of production there will be new "points of growth" and within two or three years there will be a period of stabilization of the economy in its renewed form. Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Chairman of the Board of the Center for Economic and Political Studies (EPITsENTR): "The Situation Will Remain Difficult for Entrepreneurs" 1. On the whole the process of economic reforms was not marked by the achievement of any significant positive results. Inflation (the consumer price index) remained steady at the level of 20-25 percent per month. And this is in spite of the fact that the government made certain efforts to restrict the growth of the mass of money (the issuance of credit, expenditures from the state budget). Measures aimed at limiting the aggregate demand were relatively successful. But a result of this policy was a further decline of industrial production and not a reduction of the rates of inflation, whose development was generated by inflation of expenditures, against which the policy of restricting the aggregate demand had no effect. Therefore the Russian economy in 1993 experienced almost constant price shocks in various sectors. In the macroeconomic sense the situation was exacerbated also by the practice of monopolistic price setting and the failure of the antimonopoly policy, in whose implementation the government is experiencing many difficulties. As compared to 1992 the decline in industrial production slowed up (especially during June-August) but one must keep in mind that the recession in 1992 was very severe. All government announcements made during February-March 1993 about stabilization of the volumes of industrial production ignored the seasonal nature of this phenomenon and, as usual, during May-June there is a traditional reduction of the volumes of production, while August-September is a time of seasonal upsurge. On the whole as compared to 1992 the decline in the volumes of industrial production amounted to approximately 13-14 percent. In the area of privatization of industrial enterprises the results of the 1993 policy may be characterized by the word "collectivization." In essence we are seeing the appearance of enterprises that are in the hands of collective owners. The result of this kind of privatization is obvious: great difficulties in finding investors. For one must keep in mind that the position of Russian industry is very difficult--underinvestment has become extremely widespread and the condition of the equipment in many branches is terrible and must be replaced. In trade, privatization has led to the creation of monopolistic markets in many cases. These monopolies exist because of the fact that trade enterprises are connected to the local authorities. Hence all the "charm" of the unregulated monopoly: price support to the detriment of the consumers, outlays increased because of the absence of competition and a high profit norm, sales volumes below those on the competitive market, and closing off of access to the market for other sellers. In spite of the fact that in 1993 there were successes that may be characterized as partial (a large positive trade balance and a certain stabilization of the exchange rate of the ruble), nonetheless for the entrepreneurial sector of the economy the situation remains very difficult. This is largely the result of the political uncertainty, the lack of clear guarantees for private property, the imperfection of legislation, corruption in all echelons of power, an increased number of crimes against entrepreneurs, and the impossibility of engaging in business on the basis of honest competition. 2. Government actions will have a large impact on the condition of the economy in 1994. Nonetheless there are macroeconomic variables that are relatively unaffected by any actions of state power. Under today's conditions this is primarily inflation. In 1994 it will be high as usual--high and unpredictable enough so as to impede the development of the medium- and long-term credit market, and this means that we have little hope of modernizing industry relying on the mechanism of positive interest rates. In the second place, this means a decline in industrial production. Even according to the most optimistic version, the slump will continue. True, apparently it will not be as deep as in 1933, and the more so in 1992. But one should keep in mind that even if stabilization is achieved at the end of the year (which is not very likely), it will occur at the level of only 50 percent of the physical volume of industrial production of 1989! A great deal depends on the policy the government pursues in the area of demonopolization and control of monopolies and whether or not it decides to recognize in both word and deed the adaptation of economic institutions to the conditions of high inflation without abandoning the cautious fight against inflation through restricting aggregate demand, and also on the reform of economic legislation. Within the designated framework it is possible to have a broad choice of measures of economic policy. And the results of 1994 could vary a great deal depending on the decisions that are made.
