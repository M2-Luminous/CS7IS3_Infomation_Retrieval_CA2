Reports are being carried in the international mass media that there are efforts to sign a similar accord with all the republics of the former Soviet Union that have nuclear weapons, including Kazakhstan. What is your opinion on these efforts? [Zholdasbekov] We are responsible for safeguarding our nuclear weapons. Until all countries in the world guarantee that they will not use nuclear arms and the world is rid of such weapons, we will not destroy them or transfer them elsewhere. We are aware of the accord signed on the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine. However, we believe that disarmament should be accompanied by a world guarantee that such weapons will not be used. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] You have not announced this stance openly and officially. [Zholdasbekov] Our stance on this matter will be conveyed to the U.S. President on 17 February when Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev goes to the United States. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Why do you wish to report this to the U.S. President? [Zholdasbekov] Our president is visiting the United States at the official invitation of the U.S. President. Naturally, the objective of his visit is not to provide any clarification on nuclear weapons. However, it is natural that Mr. Clinton will speak to Mr. Nazarbayev about Kazakhstan's nuclear weapons. I mean that during these talks Mr. Nazarbayev will convey our country's official stance to the U.S. President. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, it is clear that Russia is constantly seeking to extend its domination over all the CIS countries. Do you believe this? [Zholdasbekov] It is not to our advantage to magnify such points. In view of the extensive economic and industrial relations that we have with the Russians, we do not consider it appropriate to overshadow these relations with political issues. We should keep in mind that we have the longest common border with Russia and that we should be seeking logical and principled ways to broaden these relations. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Do you have any political or economic news about Kazakhstan for us? [Zholdasbekov] Yes. In the economic field, I wish to tell you that in the last few days of 1993 (that is one month ago) we replaced the ruble with our own monetary unit, the tenge. In the political field, I may add that soon parliamentary elections will be held in Kazakhstan. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How soon? [Zholdasbekov] On 7 March.
