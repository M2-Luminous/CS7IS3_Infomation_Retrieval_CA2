Having reviewed the situation with his special representative for Haiti, Dante Caputo, the U.N. chief reiterated that "it is essential that the restoration of democracy be the result of an agreement by the Haitian parties," a U.N. spokesman said today. A draft Security Council resolution on Haiti, worked out by the United States and being circulated among diplomats here, gives Haitian military authorities 15 days to resign or leave the country. Otherwise, they will face much tougher sanctions. According to the Governor's Island treaty signed between exile Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Haitian Army chief Raoul Cedras last July, the president should have returned to his country by the end of the following October. But Aristide cannot do so because the military authorities failed to observe the accord they themselves signed. The secretary-general has asked Caputo to "continue to analyze the situation closely and to report back to him soon," and will report to the General Assembly this week, the spokesman said.
