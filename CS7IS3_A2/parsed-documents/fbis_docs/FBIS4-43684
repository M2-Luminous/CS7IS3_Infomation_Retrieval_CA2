FBIS4-43684 "drweu119__a94035" FBIS-WEU-94-119-A Daily Report 14 May 1994 ANNEX France Third Parties' Stance on Algeria Criticized Third Parties' Stance on Algeria Criticized 94P20816A Paris LE POINT in French 14 May 94 p 15--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94P20816A Paris LE POINT French CSO [Article by Michel Colomes: "Culpable Leniency"] [Text] For one Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) smuggler arrested on the Autoroute de l'Est, how many explosives, machine guns, even rocket launchers will have transited unencumbered through the sieve-like borders of Europe in the direction of Algeria? How many went to fatten the arsenal of those who hide their weapons under the tunics of the fundamentalists? Our neighbors' negligence, our European partners' indifference, and our American allies' lack of understanding are increasingly becoming a matter of concern and irritation for French foreign policy , favoring the goals of the fundamentalists as they do. Of course, France is the country most concerned with the tragic fate awaiting Algeria if nothing is done to stop the decay of its civil institutions. Also, it is easy to understand how, for the French prime minister, Algeria has become "one of the most serious worries." But how can the other countries of the Mediterranean be spared by the earthquake that the arrival in power of the fundamentalists in Algiers would mean? How could the fundamentalist wave have no repercussions on those European countries which, like ours, shelter immigrant Muslim communities? Finally, how is it possible not to see that the stability of the Maghreb--and probably beyond it--would be affected, and that the groundswell would certainly not spare moderate Arab countries? And yet, Madrid and Rome continue to grant visas without discernment to Algerian citizens whom the strong permeability of borders subsequently allows to go wherever they wish--and therefore to France. Without wishing to dramatize the situation, Paris notes that one of the FIS leaders, Rabah Kebir, continues his militant action in Germany. And that another FIS official, certainly more virulent and dangerous, Anouar Haddam, enjoys freedom of action and expression in the United States, to the point that from Chicago, he can send his propaganda to French newspapers. Finally, even if on 18 April the European Union did make available the Community assistance that Paris wished to give Algeria, the Americans, through the Eximbank, are doing everything in their power to complicate long-term credits needed by the Algerian Government. The attitude of the United States, which has reopened a dialogue with the fundamenalists, was actually--together with Bosnia--one of the reasons for Foreign Minister Alain Juppe's recent visit to Washington. The minister's message went something like this: "Neither you nor we have any reason to show leniency to people who hate us." It is not certain that it will be heard. First, because from Saigon to Tehran, and now in Algiers, the Americans are resolutely pursuing the utopian idea of the "third force," that of the so-called reasonable revoutionaries with whom it is possible to talk. With well-known results... Secondly, and more importantly, because on the other side of the Atlantic, the unavowed feeling that since the Algerian war France has continued to have unhealthy ulterior motives vis-a-vis its former colonies still lingers. To sum up, the Americans are allegedly cultivating Algerian fundamentalists to counterbalance the stench of French colonialism. Diplomatic communication is decidedly a difficult art.
