The Zymomonas mobilis 113 cell culture was grown for this purpose for 24 h in an aqueous nutrient medium. The experimental procedure and hydrogel production method are outlined. A schematic diagram of the immobilizing unit is cited, and the saccharose inversion degree is summarized. In particular, the effect of the aqueous poly-N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'diallylammonium chloride (PDMDAAC) solution in the Zymomonas mobilis cell viability and the effect of the Zymomonas mobilis culture concentration in the biocatalyst on the catalytic activity of the system within a 2-16% cell concentration range are examined. The findings show that treatment of calcium alginate hydrogel with immobilized Zymomonas mobilis 113 cells by an aqueous solution of the PDMDAAC cation polyelectrolyte results in the polyelectrolyte complex film (PEK) development on the gel particle surface; the film is polymer cation and anion complex insoluble in water. The polyelectrolyte complex film has the properties of a membrane, i.e., is permeable to low-molecular compounds such as saccharose and monosaccharide. The polyelectrolyte complex film membrane also prevents the immobilized cell release to the external solution, thus greatly increasing the biocatalytic system stability. Diffusion of saccharose and the reaction products inside the polymer matrix is the limiting stage of the saccharose inversion by the immobilized cells into the modified polyalginate hydrogel matrix.
