On 28 April the first 245 signatures were put under the agreement. The pompous act for some reason took place in the Georgiyevskiy Hall of the Kremlin, which symbolizes Russian military glory, although for the declaration of a civic accord, probably, a more peaceful place would have been more suitable. After the "Georgiyevskiy [Hall]" celebrations there were also other ones--on a smaller scale. But of greater significance than any symbolism is the essence of the matter: What precisely was signed, and who precisely signed the agreement. The Kremlin Has Come Closer to Moncloa It is necessary to say that during the several weeks that have passed since the time of the development and publication of the first variant of the draft agreement it has changed very substantially. The first thing that should be noted in comparing a number of intervening variants of the text with the final one is the fact that the very structure of the document has changed drastically. It has become more "addressed" [adresnyy], as they say now. In this sense, it has come to resemble much more the pacts of Moncloa. In the original variant, all responsibility and all obligations were equally divided between all the participants of the agreement. A sort of collective security was established. For example, it was provided that all future signatories--from the Seventh Day Adventists to "Women of the Navy"--obligated themselves "not to allow" either "a reduction of the defense ability" or "an irreversible technical lag", and expressed complete readiness to carry out "budget compensation to the regions." In the signed variant there is already nothing of this. The obligations of the parties are formulated sufficiently precisely and clearly, above all in what concerns the government and the Federal Assembly. Besides that, the points of the agreement to a significant degree lost poetic vagueness and began more to resemble political obligations. It is especially clear now what the Federal Assembly needs to do. Almost in every part of the agreement a lengthy list of legislative acts is cited which the Council of the Federation and the Duma obligate themselves to adopt, moreover, some of these laws are quite concrete. This is important, for in the meanwhile the new Russian parliament has worked utmost ineffectively: Upon the expiration of the parliamentary "100 days" it was discovered that the deputies have not adopted a single substantial law, but only laws regulating and "guaranteeing" their own activity. The Federal Assembly now promises to adopt at last a constitutional law on the government, civil and land codes, a new Codex of Labor Law, laws on free economic zones, on banking activity, on the securities market, and on the subsistence wage. Also envisaged is the adoption of laws "aimed at the perfection of the taxation system." The parliamentarians have also promised, however, to adopt at last the budget for the current year--for this alone one should give thanks to the "Agreement on Accord." Also quite concrete are the obligations of the Federal Assembly in connection with the laws on local self-government. In other spheres of lawmaking they were formulated in much more general form. The promises given in the agreement by the executive authority sooner have the character of establishing aims: Reduction of inflation, increase of investment activity, overcoming the structural deformations of the economy, an active social policy, etc. For the time being it is not very clear in what manner the government intends to carry all this out. It is not that the budget for 1994 presented to the Duma exactly during the period of the preparation of the agreement contradicted the government obligations in the agreement--both of these documents simply exist independently of one another, one ouitside the other. We will hope that the government has nevertheless some thoughts concerning ways of executing the obligations it has taken upon itself. However, for the time being these hopes are not too great. Here it is worthwhile to remember that even the economic obligations of the Moncloa Pact, assumed in conditions of a much more favorable situation, were by no means fully carried out. Moreover, the executive authority, one must suppose, realizes this. Not by chance, literally during the last days before the signing of the agreement, a cautious reservation was made to the government obligations: They will be carried out by the government only "on the basis of the legislation of the Russian Federation and within the limits of its powers." Thereby the success of the actions of the executive is closely linked to the preparedness of the parliament to cooperate with it and with the powers it will succeed in receiving. By comparison with the original text, the removal of the idea of "an economic conference" from it must be recognized as a reasonable change. According to the original idea of the authors, such a conference was to have worked out "coordinated proposals in the sphere of economic policy." It was proposed to include representatives of both the executive and the legislative power, as well as trade unions and entrepreneurs. The parties, too, made known their claims to participation in the economic conference. One can imagine to what paralysis in the course of economic reforms the creation of such an organ would lead--an evident next "talking-shop." Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning one circumstance here: On the whole, in their majority, the government economic obligations are in the channel of market reforms. The authors of the document succeeded in resisting the pressure which, without a doubt, was exerted on them in the direction of the "socialization" of the agreement. Thereby the agreement fixes the attained political-economic level of the reforms and does not permit restoration tendencies, which, evidently, also made it unacceptable to the "red" opposition. This is very important. Any accord must nevertheless have some central point, a base foundation, which is not called into question by either one of the sides. Today, the recognition of the fact that a change in the social system has taken place in our country can be and has actually become such a foundation. Already this alone makes the "Agreement on Accord" an important document. The obligations of the trade unions reduce themselves, in the main, to the promise not to strike, except for concrete economic reasons. The entrepreneurs pledge to do what any entrepreneur who has not lost his faculties and is not a swindler would do: Not to stop production without necessity and to fulfill his obligations to suppliers and buyers. The role of the remaining participants of the agreement, evidently, comes most of all to the moral support of the main acting parties. The Results of Trades From a substantive, not a structural, point of view, the agreement underwent the most important changes in the past few weeks in the part devoted to the federative structure, which was previously called "Regional Politics." A whole series of fundamentally important provisions were deleted from it. Thus, it was originally proposed that "the subjects of the Federation agree to the repudiation of the change of their constitutional statuses within 2 years." Now there is no such provision. Likewise missing from the agreement is the promise that "the constitutions, statutes and other legislative acts of the subjects of the Federation will be brought into conformity and newly elaborated in strict conformity with the federal Constitution." As far as is known, the main opponent of this restriction was the Tatar president, Mintimer Shaymiyev, who not so long ago defended the right of Tatarstan to its own constitution, which does not entirely link up with the federal one. The bilateral agreement with the federal authorities concluded by Shaymiyev, evidently, also induced the remaining subjects of the federation, the republics first of all, to insist on the withdrawal, from the text of the agreement, of the moratorium on the signing bilateral agreements about the delimitation of the subjects of jurisdiction and powers between the federal and regional organs of power. All this is the evident price that had to be paid for the regions' support of the agreement on accord. Has the price been raised too high and to what extent--still remains to be seen. For the time being there are rumors to the effect that even the president of Chechnya, Dudayev, is examining the possibility of joining the agreement--rumors that appear not completely improbable and sooner speak in favor of the concessions that have been made. Nevertheless, the resistance of the regions even to potential restrictions of their rights should serve as a serious warning to the federal government: The support on the part of the regions will not come automatically. Another significant difference of the original and the final variants of the agreement concerns questions of security. The original variant put emphasis on reform of the army and navy and, in the final analysis, on the transfer of the armed forces to a professional basis. In the final text there already is no mention of anything like that. The question of the army as a separate subject in general is virtually absent in the agreement. Only the necessity is proclaimed of "strengthening and increasing the effectiveness of the activity of the power structures," but, judging by the context, here they sooner have in mind the so-called "law enforcement organs." This is supported also by another place of the agreement. Still on the eve of the signing, the draft retained the obligation of the Federal Assembly "during the current year [as per text] to create the necessary legislative basis . . . for the execution of reforms of the law enforcement organs." At the very last moment, the word "reforms" was replaced by the word "strengthening." It is not clear to what degree "the organs" are responsible for this important change, but the impression has been created that it was to a considerable degree. Thus, in the lack of desire to reform themselves the "power structures" manifest touching unity. Some innovations in the agreement clearly represent "address" concessions, such as, for example, the promise of the government "to create acceptable economic conditions for the operation of the agroindustrial complex." This promise is among those that were put into the text literally at the last moment--at the obvious demand of the "landowners" [agrarii]. One must suppose, the hopes that the "landowners" as a result of such a concession will nevertheless sign the agreement were retained to the very last moment, for the promise in the agreement was retained, in spite of the splendid absence of the "landowners" among the signatories. With satisfaction it needs to be noted that they judiciously removed from the final variant the demand, addressed to "every member of society", to "tirelessly confirm" religious values, as well as "to propagate the primordial spiritual and moral traditions of Russia." Thereby the next draft "on the introduction of like-mindedness in Russia," fortunately, was not carried out. Also omitted was the obligation of the parties "not to utilize the assessment of the events of August 1991 and September-October 1993 as grounds for intensifying confrontation and resistance." Evidently, however, it was clear that any such assessments of these events call forth a confrontational reaction with one side or another--the memory of them, which has by no means receded into the past, is too fresh. So that to be silent about these events in this situation was the only way out. It would have been a good thing also to remove from the text the strange passage about "simplified and insulting assessments of the past"--for the same reason. Our recent past is too dismal to take it under such high protection. I would like to find out from the authors of the text: What assessment of that past precisely would they consider "insulting?" Self-pardon is not the best method for overcoming the past. Reality or Illusion? In completing the signing ceremony, Yeltsin said that henceforth the "Civic Accord Agreement" has become "a reality of Russian life." I am afraid that the desirable is here given out to be the real. I think that Grigoriyy Yavlinskiy was not right when he called the agreement harmful: The leader of "Yabloko" suggests that the present forcing of events will prevent the president in the future, when this will really become possible and necessary, to conclude such an agreement again--there are steps which cannot be taken twice. There is, of course, no harm from the agreement. Moreover, it can entirely exert a certain beneficial influence in the direction of mollification of the political nerves. The central idea of the agreement--the necessity of civic peace--is indisputable, the majority of words in it are correct. The repetition once more of good wishes cannot bring any harm. It appears that the very process of the development of the text of the agreement has led to some rapprochement of the positions of its participants--thus, for example, the balanced conduct of Ivan Rybkin, who overcame heavy pressure from his party comrades, calls forth unquestionable respect. What is worse is something else. Most likely, already in the near future the passions in regard to the agreement will be forgotten, as the agreement itself will happily be forgotten. This is already now clearly indicated by the reaction of society to the triumphant event: According to the results of a public opinion survey, immediately after the signing of more than 52 percent of those surveyed regarded it with indifference or did not have an opinion of their own. Such a reaction is understandable. The "Civic Accord Agreement" can become "a reality of life" only when it fixes trends that have really ripened in society. They indicate that society has grown tired of confrontation. But tiredness is not yet accord. All agree that "to live in this way is impossible," but unity about how for all that people should live, unfortunately, has not yet come into being. Thank God that the strange idea of Shakhray--to adopt the Agreement on Accord" as a federal law--was not accepted. If this had been done--the agreement could not escape becoming the double of the sadly famous resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee, the USSR Supreme Soviet, and the USSR Council of Ministers" with their endless "to pay special attention", "to intensify," and "to concentrate." As if accord can be planted by order from above, like a potato! Or like corn. The agreement will be useful if it does not give rise to unjustified hopes and, following them, bitter disappointments. Disappointed politicians are inclined to make indadequate decisions that strike society with pain. Sometimes a Protocol on Differences Is More Useful In the light of what has been said above, a list of names of the signatories or of those who refused to sign, is certainly not so important. The real conduct of these or those will hardly be determined by the presence or absence of their signature under the agreement. And nevertheless the position of the parties [to the agreement] represents a certain interest. Without a doubt, a significant factor is the refusal of the communists to join the agreement. Personally Zyuganov, who has already tasted the sweetness of the corridors of power and who has internally prepared himself to find a niche for himself in the system, possibly, would also have signed the agreement. He already repeatedly gave signals that he is prepared to transform himself into a social democrat of the parliamentary type for the sake of admittance into the Areopagus of the decision-makers. But the party, which has brought him into the Duma, decided differently, and to resist it Zyuganov, in contrast to Rybkin, did not have enough spirit. However, Zyuganov could not act otherwise--he understands that outside his party he represents a political zero. The decision of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has clearly determined its place in the Russian political spectrum--next to the National Salvation Front and Anpilov's Working Russia members. The Communists refuse to accept in the agreement the fact which is basic in it--the recognition of the reality of the change of the social system in Russia. They cannot reconcile themselves to this. Thereby they have determined their political future: Either to continually secure their influence through confrontation, or to disappear from the political scence. For Russian politicians to forget about this would be foolish. In fact, a sort of "protocol of differences" precisely setting forth the positions of the parties [to the agreement] was signed. Such a "protocol" is also useful, as the understanding of political reality is always useful. By contrast, games of the appearance of accord in the absence of a real will to it are extremely dangerous. Accord cannot be unlimited. Otherwise it is transformed into unprincipledness. Several days prior to the signing of the "Accord Agreement, on 23 April, an, in my view, extraordinary event occurred in Russian political life, which nevertheless passed completely unnoticed. On this day, the newspaper IZVESTIYA published a verbose article by Zhirinovskiy, with an exposition of his political program. I shall recall that by decision of the last congress of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], the leader of the party was given extraordinary powers, and, henceforth, the statements of Zhirinovskiy are not the opinion of a private individual, but the official position of the party, which has now adopted the name LDPR-PZH [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia--Party of Zhirinovskiy]. And so, among the many pearls of this programmatic party article, which I am not inclined to examine here, is the following: "It is necessary to `close' down the autonomous republics, oblasts, etc., and immediately reestablish the guberniya headed by a governor. And in so doing not hold any discussions. Quickly, rigidly, by means of a corresponding edict, dispatch the sovereign presidents who do not want to become transformed into governors to suburban Moscow dachas for a `discussion.' Let them rest, eat smetana [sour cream], watch television, only don't let them leave the territory of the dacha in the interest of their security. After a couple of years they will leave--it will already be a different country. And without a drop of blood." Well, as far as blood is concerned--that we have already heard: Vladimir Volfovich intends to make his way even to the Indian Ocean on tanks without a single drop of blood, proceeding from the "realistic" assumption that no one will start to resist him. But here in essence the procedure of "dispatching to dachas" described by Zhirinovskiy is called the internment of leading statesmen, and the passage as a whole is a call to a coup d'etat. The act of Zhirinovskiy, committed by him on 23 April, clearly qualifies according to Article 70 of the Criminal Code of Russia: "Calls for the forceful change of the constitutional order." According to Article 1 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Russia is a democratic federative law-governed state with a republican form of rule: Through the "closing down" of the republics, the constitutional federative basis of the state is fully destroyed. Internment--quickly, rigidly, and without discussions are an unequivocal act of force. Thus, the leader of the second largest parliamentary party group in the Duma, endowed by his party with the powers to formulate its policy personally, in the heat of the discussion of the final variant of the "Civic Accord Agreement," declares his intention to carry out a coup d'etat in the near future. And the only reaction of society in so doing is the limp answer in that same IZVESTIYA of Otto Latsis, ridiculing Zhirinovskiy, like Khlestakov! The procuracy is silent, which in its time under pressure of the public had instituted proceedings against Zhirinovskiy in the matter of the propagation of war, but now is clearly trying to have this case disappear in the sand. Also silent are the other parties and election blocs, the "colleagues" of the LDPR-PZH in the Duma are not conducting indignant parliamentary inquiries and are not declaring protests. Mr Gaydar, the defender of democracy, Mr Shakhray, the defender of federalism, how are we supposed to interpret your silence? Or do you also share the view that all this is only inoffensive shameless bragging to which one cannot but call attention? But then, what reasons do you have to expect that people will take seriously the parliament, where you sit next to Zhirinovskiy? Silent are the "sovereign presidents", the very same who intend to intervene, and, not even having wiped off the spittle from their face, place their signature under the "Accord Agreement" next to the signature of Zhirinovskiy? This is difficult to fit into consciousness. And after this you want society to place hopes on such an agreement? In such a situation the accord looks like connivance. Zhirinovskiy does not conceal his ultimate political ambitions. In his dreams he already sees the longed-for moment prophetically described by A. K. Tolstoy in the unforgettable "Istoriya gosudarstva Rossiyskogo" [History of the Russian State]: "And, having climbed up to the place of Boris, this impudent fellow, out of joy with the bride, he began to dangle his feet." If this, God forbid, will happen, then not civil peace, but full-scale civil war will become the reality of Russian life. In the grown-up Russian society, forces are announcing themselves that no longer under any circumstances will resign themselves either to the railway cars for dissidents "to Taymir, the last stop--tundra", or to the "bloodless" dashes to the south. Closing the eyes today to the appeal on the part of political adventurists, we are sowing the seeds of tomorrow's civil war. The country really needs civic accord. And not for two years. To secure it, not demonstrative, but realistic and principled actions are necessary. It is impossible to allow for political deluge to begin "after us." P.S. A number of days ago, appearing on radio with commentaries concerning the signing of the agreement, I expressed the opinion about the dangerous game set forth above, which the leader of the LDPR-PZH is playing. Soon after this, I received a call from someone who called himself "colonel of the tank forces" from the "army in the field" and promised that in the near future I will be "crushed" (by a tank, one must suppose?). We are not talking about me--I am an elderly person who has long since ceased to be afraid. But then what about civic accord? Not invite to the signing of the "Accord Agreement" also the "forces" who killed Ayzderdzis? It goes without saying, having amnestied them beforehand.
