Source is listed in parentheses following each item: Radio Reloj at 2040 GMT on 24 January reports that accelerated repairs are being made at the Republica Dominican Mill in Carlos Manuel de Cespedes municipality, Camaguey Province. Originally, the Rebublica Dominicana Mill was not scheduled to participate in the grinding in Camaguey this harvest. It was later decided that the mill would participate "because of the importance to the nation to produce as much sugar as possible." Radio Reloj at 2042 GMT on 24 January notes that production in Matanzas Province has decreased. According to a statistical study, the province produced 777 million pesos' worth of goods in 1993, which was 71 percent of the amount that had been projected. "In comparison with a similar earlier period, Matanza's economy showed a decline of almost 21 points, felt most strongly in the sugar industry." Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 25 January reports that 400 caballerias of tobacco have been planted in Pinar del Rio. Some 4,000 students are participating in the planting. Radio Reloj Network at 2030 GMT on 25 January reports in its 30-minute newscast that: The plant at the Ignacio Agramonte Sugar Mill that produces the product called "sorbitol," a sugarcane by-product, produced over 300 tons of the product in 1993. "Sorbitol" is used in making toothpaste, diet foods, pharmaceuticals, and other things. The plant has the capacity to produce 10,000 tons a year in the Villa Clara and Camaguey plants. Also obtained were 217 tons of glucose. The local industries of Contramaestre municipality, Santiago de Cuba Province, brought in 5 million pesos for the state in 1993. "Esteban Lazo, secretary general of the Communist Party of Cuba for the province, urged local industries to improve quality and design, and to increase prodcution of certain very important products, such as shoes for school children, workers, and the population in general." "Over 13 million passengers were transported within Matanzas in 1993 thanks to the efforts of the state inspectors, who also created a favorable atmosphere for moving some 1,000 metric tons of various types of merchandise. During that period, the more than 230 men and women commonly known as `yellows' [because of the color of their uniforms] collected slightly more than 1 million pesos and made use of over 1 million vehicles belonging to enterprises and organizations." They were assisted by around 70 volunteers. There have been 42 Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's] formed in Havana Province to-date: 29 in miscellaneous crops; 10 in tobacco, and 3 in citrus. Four remain to be formed: one in Artemisa, two in Alquizar, and one in Batabano. At present, the Havana Province UBPC's consist of almost 6,600 workers, not a final figure. There are at present five bicycle factories in Cuba. The overall goal is to manufacture 300,000 bicycles in 1994. In 1993, 174,700 bicyles were produced by all these plants together, a figure significantly higher than the 1993 figure of 86,000. Each plant works on its own design, which leads to competition in making the bicycles and motivates the workers to do better work. All facilities are trying to improve post-sale services. The Tropical Travel Agency in Havana sold over 10.5 percent more optional activities in 1993 than in 1992. In 1993, this brought half a million dollars more than in 1992 to the national economy -- said Juan Emilio Santana, director of the Tropical Travel Agency. Santana said that the optional activities and proposals targeting international tourism at the diverse tourist hubs also increased in 1993, with a view to increasing the amount of hard currency brought in. The task of the Tropical Travel Agency is to provide international tourists with all types of services and information, thus occupying the free time of travelers while in Cuba. Cuba Vision Network at 2310 GMT on 25 January reports that in Granma Province, workers of the Manzanillo shoe enterprise produced more than 250,000 pairs of shoes in 1993. They are increasing efforts to meet the demand of sugar industry workers. Radio Reloj Network at 1506 GMT on 26 January reports that the Havana Convention Center obtained more than $3 million in 1993 as compared to the previous year. Adding national and convertible currency, its income amounts to some 6 million of an unspecified currency from the various activities in this center over the past year. More than 12,000 foreign delegates participated in congresses, fairs, meetings, and other forums in that center last year. Radio Reloj Network at 1509 GMT on 26 January adds that the Cuban Ministry of the Steelworking Industry, the Sime, is working hard to become self-suffient. Sime's main objectives for this year are to become an exporting organization capable of guaranteeing its self- sufficiency, providing financial resources, and meeting the special demands of the national economy. Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 26 January reports that an Asturian solidarity group donated office equipment worth $11,500 to the accounting department of the University of Havana.
