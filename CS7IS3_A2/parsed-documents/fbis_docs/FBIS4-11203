In this first demonstration against the administration that took office on 27 January, the marchers demanded measures to counter the high cost of living and an end to mandatory military service, one of the promises Reina made during his election campaign. Upon taking office, Reina asked Hondurans for 100 days to organize measures that would give a "human face" to the economic adjustment program and which would diminish the protagonistic role of the military in state affairs. The demonstrators accused Reina of not keeping his promises and demanded a price freeze to halt inflation, which increased 7 percent in three months; reactivation of the agrarian reform; and land grants to peasants. Rafael Alegria of the National Federation of Rural Workers gave a speech saying that Reina must change the economic policies inherited from the former administration. Juan Almendarez, a pacifist leader, demanded a dialogue with the government and popular sectors to unify support against "pressure from international organizations" of credit which demand the economic adjustment measures. He warned that "if urgent measures are not taken, there may be social instability" in Honduras.
