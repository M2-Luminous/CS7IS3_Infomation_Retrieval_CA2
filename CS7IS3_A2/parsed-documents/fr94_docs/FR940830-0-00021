FR940830-0-00021 FR940830-0-00005 Under part 516, the OTS may extend the application review period for an additional 30-day period upon notice to the applicant. 24 Part 516 also permits the OTS to extend the review period in cases involving a significant issue of law or policy or where a protest has been filed under the CRA. 25 However, consistent with new section 10(s)(2) of the HOLA, new §563.22(d)(4) and (h)(2)(iii) of the rule specifically provide that the 60-day review period for an Oakar application may be extended for up to 30 days only if the OTS determines that the applicant has failed to furnish information requested by the OTS, or if the information furnished is substantially inaccurate. 24 12 CFR 516.2(e). 25 12 CFR 516.2(f). E. Technical Amendments The final rule amends the definitional provisions of §§552.13 and 563.22 of the regulations to reflect the expanded authority conferred by new section 10(s) of the HOLA. In addition, as noted above, the final rule makes additional technical and conforming changes throughout these sections to simplify and clarify the application and notice procedures applicable to all mergers and other combinations involving savings associations. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Executive Order 12866 The OTS has determined that this rule does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866.
