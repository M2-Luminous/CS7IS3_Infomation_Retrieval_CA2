[Begin Sainovic recording] The situation regarding the implementation of the program is completely stable. The best indication of this that I can present at the moment is that production, industrial production in March has increased in comparison to February by 21.3 percent. Let me remind you that in comparison to January, the production in February increased by 12.4 percent. This is [word indistinct] information that tells everyone that production is increasing. That is the basic reflection of stability. Prices have been stable for some time now, and I can also say that the National Bank's activities have secured (?funds) for procuring raw materials for the economy, in excess of $100 million. This will have a positive effect in the coming months. Let me also add that the balance of the foreign currency exchange of both citizens and the economy with the National Bank and the merchant banks is positive [sentence as heard]. This means that foreign currency reserves are increasing, while the total activities and complete coordination of the Yugoslav National Bank, the Service for Monetary Transactions [Sluzba za platni promet], and the federal and republican governments has made sure that negative occurrences on the financial market have been efficiently suppressed. You can see that in the past week the technology of handling ready cash has been altered. This, in turn, has led to a decrease of financial scams and an increased return of ready cash into the channels of monetary transactions. This coordinated activity has decreased the so-called sticung [the cut taken by dealers when selling foreign currency on the black market]. Some of these people are already behind bars. Therefore, this is a simple demonstration of the efficient, synchronized activity of all state bodies in maintaining the stability of the program. [end recording]
