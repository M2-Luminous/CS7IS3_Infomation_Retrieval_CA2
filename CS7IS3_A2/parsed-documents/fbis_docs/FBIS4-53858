[Yamagishi] The Hata government is a government led by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito. Mr. Koji Kakizawa, who once attacked the reformist policies of the coalition government in the Diet interpellation session, has become foreign minister. A majority of the Hata cabinet members are former Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] cabinet members. The Hata government is a carbon copy of the LDP government. The Hata government is positively responding to legislation at a time of emergency and constitutional debate which is aimed at paving the way for Japan to exercise its right to collective defense. The Hata cabinet is different from the Hosokawa cabinet and most of the Hata cabinet members are hard-liners. The Hata cabinet will not push for reform. Changes occurred because political intentions to change worked when the Hosokawa cabinet was in place. With the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger] out of the coalition, however, the Hata government has largely lost its internal-check mechanism. The issue of foreign policy and defense is the tip of an iceberg. What concerns me is that such a trend may appear in domestic policy. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How will Rengo deal with the situation? [Yamagishi] Rengo maintained a cooperative relationship with the Hosokawa government. This time, however, Rengo has no choice but to wrangle with the Hata government over policy. I feel as if my relatives have become other people. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Mr. Shigeto Nagano resigned as justice minister for making remarks that the Nanjing massacre was a "fabrication." What is your opinion? [Yamagishi] I felt as if I was listening to broadcasts aired by the Japanese military during the war. Mr. Nagano is a convicted criminal [kakushinhan]. What is at issue is why Prime Minister Hata appointed Mr. Nagano as justice minister knowing what he does about him. If the prime minister himself decided to appoint Nagano as justice minister, he should be held politically responsible and questions should be raised about his choice. If the prime minister appointed him as justice minister after being pressed by others, that is a problem. I cannot help but say that Mr. Nagano was appointed as justice minister in line with a certain political strategy. The basic posture of the Hata cabinet is being questioned and Prime Minister Hata's appointment of Mr. Nagano as justice minister is not an issue that can be resolved simply by revoking the controversial remarks and Nagano's resignation. In principle, the Hata cabinet deserves to suffer defeat in a no-confidence vote in the Diet. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The talk is that a general election should be held after dissolving the House of Representatives. [Yamagishi] The Hata cabinet should seek the public confidence at the earliest date. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Will the general elections be held under the current multiseat constituency system? [Yamagishi] The most desirable way is to hold the general election under the new electoral system. If no decision is made on the demarcation of small constituencies, it will create a political vacuum that may continue for six months or a year. This should not be allowed to occur. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] A major political task is reform of the current tax system. Is there any possibility that the issue of reforming the current tax system will lead to the dissolution of the House of Representatives? [Yamagishi] Effort should be made to draw a fruitful conclusion to reform of the current tax system by June, when the current Diet session ends. The SDPJ should not shun the issue of reforming the tax system on the grounds that it has now become an opposition party; that would be irresponsible. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What, then, will happen next? [Yamagishi] North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons will likely generate heated debate on the issue of Japan's security. The security issue could provide the excuse for a no-confidence vote in the Diet against the Hata cabinet. It is highly possible that the issue could then trigger the dissolution of the House of Representatives. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What would be the main points of contention in the ensuing general election? [Yamagishi] I think the tactics of power politics would be a major issue. Other points of contention would be the choice between open politics and back-door politics. The choice between politics for the people and politics for party interests will be taken up as a major campaign issue at the next general election. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How are you going to deal with the chilled relationship between the SDPJ and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]? [Yamagishi] I cannot agree with the suggestion that Rengo should distance itself from the chilled relationship. If Rengo fails to handle the sour relationship properly, it would lead to another split in Rengo. Rengo will play a role helping to patch up their differences, while at the same time presenting the two parties with its own policies. With the SDPJ at odds with the DSP, how can we form a new liberal political party? [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Would you explain the plan to form a new liberal political party? [Yamagishi] The SDPJ has proposed forming a new liberal political party from liberals from the SDPJ and the DSP, but I do not agree with the plan. There is a misunderstanding that the new liberal political party will be formed by liberals mainly from the SDPJ and the DSP. I, however, intend to rally all liberal forces. Specifically, I intend to rally reformers from the SDPJ, the DSP, Sakigake, the Japan New Party and the Mirai [Future] Party, the LDP, and other reformers keen to break away from the LDP. The LDP does not know the meaning of reform. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What about the possibility of Rengo forging an alliance with the LDP? [Yamagishi] There is no such possibility. The LDP is a mix of jade and stone. The jade is better than the stone. Rengo advocated the need to tear down the 1955 system and form a non-LDP government. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What are the major issues and where do the liberal forces stand on them? [Yamagishi] They are the Constitution and Japan's international contributions. Liberal forces attach the maximum importance to the current peace Constitution. Defending the Constitution has both a negative and positive aspect. Japan should make non-military international contributions. Japan should make such international contributions in the non-military and civilian fields through a reformed United Nations. Japan should not play the role of the Self-Defense Forces on the world stage. Japan should, rather, play the roles of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Environment Agency, and the Ministry of Labor. I hope that the Hata government will pay attention to workers when it handles domestic policy. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] When do you think the general election will be held? [Yamagishi] In July at the earliest. It would then be held shortly after the Naples summit, which is scheduled for early July. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Some trade unions appear to have started preparing for the general election already. [Yamagishi] They have probably started preparing for the general election. Many trade unions are aware that they must prepare for a general election which is not too far away.
