FR940224-2-00130 FR940224-2-00082 (i) For FNBC's client accounts, a cash entry for the amount of Fund shares purchased or redeemed and a corresponding entry to the client accounts for the number of Fund shares purchased or redeemed as of the Pricing Time through operation of the computer ``sweep'' program; and (ii) For the Fund's sub-custodian account, all purchase and sale transactions and the net cash proceeds, if any, received by the Fund through the operation of the ``sweep'' (or, conversely, the net redemption proceeds paid or payable by the Fund if there were net redemptions). In addition, the Fund's sub-custodian account would reflect the specific amount in fact invested in the particular transaction (including the ownership of the securities securing the repurchase agreement). If the ``sweep'' had resulted in unanticipated net redemptions for the Fund, the relevant sub-custodian account would reflect this fact and show no ownership of any of such securities transferred by FNBC or its affiliates to the account, since (contrary to expectations) none of the Fund's assets had been used to purchase the securities. To the extent that transferred securities exceeded the Fund's assets that were available for investment (as shown by the results of the day's computer processing), FNBC or the appropriate affiliate would be shown to be owner of such securities. 15. After the Completion Time, FNBC would transmit to the Fund's transfer agent records relating to these automatic investment transactions. The transfer agent's records would show an entry to each of the corresponding shareholder accounts for the number of Fund shares automatically purchased or redeemed as of the Pricing Time through operation of the ``sweep.'' 16. Each Fund will purchase only securities in which it may invest as described in its prospectus and statement of additional information and as limited by rule 2a&hyph;7. The Master Repurchase Agreement into which each Fund proposes to enter will be collateralized only by U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds. The transactions will comply with the guidelines set forth in Investment Company Act Release No. 13005 (February 2, 1983) and will be collateralized fully as that term is defined in rule 2a&hyph;7. The Master Repurchase Agreement will be subject to annual approval, with respect to each Fund, by the Fund's Board of Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not ``interested persons'' (as defined in the Act) of the Fund or FNBC or its affiliates. 17. The transactions would be ``repurchase agreements'' for purposes of Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. These statutes provide that, if the bankruptcy of the counterparty occurs, the repurchase agreement can be liquidated without being subject to the potential delay associated with the automatic stay or similar provisions of these statutes. If the transactions were not ``repurchase agreements'' as defined under those statutes, the Fund might encounter significant liquidity problems if a large percentage of its assets were invested in repurchase agreements with a bankrupt counterparty.
