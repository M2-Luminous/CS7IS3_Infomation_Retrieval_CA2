This is apparent from the figures released by the Czech Statistical Office. States with an advanced market economy had a 60.8-percent share in the republic's overall foreign trade turnover (European Union states had a 42.8-percent share and European Free Trade Association [EFTA] states had a 12.3-percent share). The Slovak Republic accounted for 15.2 percent; the countries of the former Soviet Union for 10.3 percent; developing countries for 7.3 percent; European states with a transitional economy (excluding the countries of the former USSR) for 5.6 percent; and states with a state-controlled trading system for 0.8 percent. Imports in all categories rose. However, imports from Slovakia fell by 16.6 percent compared with the January-March period of 1993. Imports from states with a state-controlled trading system (index 144.2) and from European states with a transitional economy, excluding the countries of the former USSR, (index 132.7) rose most dynamically. Despite the overall decline in exports, exports to EFTA states (index 161.6) rose. This was mainly due to the dynamism of our exports to Austria (index 169.0). Exports to Austria accounted for almost 10 percent of the Czech Republic's overall exports. Exports to developing countries (index 120.8) continued to increase. The most substantial decline in exports -- apart from exports to states with a state-controlled trading system, which, however, have a small share in overall exports -- was to Slovakia. Exports to Slovakia reached only 66.5 percent of the level for the first quarter of 1993, which represents a reduction of 6.6 billion korunas [Kc]. Imports from OECD countries during the first quarter amounted to Kc48.6 billion and exports amounted to Kc54.9 billion. The balance of trade was in the black by Kc6.3 billion. Compared with the same period last year, imports from OECD countries rose by 23 percent and exports to these countries rose by 13.8 percent. The balance of trade for the first three months of 1994 showed a surplus of Kc1.7 billion. A surplus was achieved in trade with all territories, except the former Soviet Union, where there was a deficit of Kc8.5 billion. The surplus with European Union states amounted to Kc4.4 billion; with developing countries to Kc3.4 billion; with EFTA states to Kc1.3 billion; with European states with a transitional economy (excluding the countries of the former USSR) to Kc0.6 billion; and with states with a state-controlled trading system to Kc0.3 billion. In overall imports from January to March 1994, the Federal Republic of Germany had a 23.1-percent share; the Slovak Republic had a 15-percent share; and Russia had a 13.8-percent share. Imports from Brazil (a 0.3-percent share in overall imports), Canada (0.7 percent), South Korea (0.6 percent), China (0.6 percent), Denmark (1.0 percent), and Switzerland (2.1 percent) grew most rapidly compared with the same period last year. Imports from Egypt and Bulgaria fell. During the same period, 29.1 percent of the Czech Republic's exports went to the Federal Republic of Germany. Some 15.5 percent went to Slovakia; 9.8 percent to Austria; 3.2 percent to the United Kingdom; and 3.2 percent to Russia. Compared with the January-March period of 1993, exports to Turkey (a 1.9 percent share in overall exports); Japan (1.5 percent); Taiwan (0.4 percent); Hong Kong (1.6 percent); and Brazil (0.1 percent) increased most. Exports to China, Denmark, Romania, and Slovenia declined considerably. From January to March 1994, in the structure of imports according to the categories of goods, the percentage of imports of machinery and means of transportation declined by 3.5 points compared with the same period last year. The percentage of imports of fuels and raw and processed materials in overall imports rose by 2.6 points and the percentage of industrial consumer goods rose by 0.9 points. The percentage of imports of foodstuffs remained the same. The value of imports, compared with the first quarter of last year, increased for all categories of goods. During the first three months of 1994, 1.7 million tonnes of oil (1.5 million tonnes during the same period last year) and 3.1 billion cubic meters of natural gas (1.7 billion cubic meters last year) were imported. During the first quarter of 1994, in the structure of exports according to the categories of goods, the percentage of imports of fuels and raw and processed materials and industrial consumer goods rose by 2.1 and 3.0 points respectively compared with the same period last year. On the other hand, the percentage of exports of machinery and means of transport declined by 2.4 points and foodstuffs declined by 2.7 points. Compared with the first three months of 1993, only exports in the industrial goods category rose, by 19.1 percent.
