He said the agreement provides for creation of "two emission centers or two central banks with a single currency, the ruble." However, as he underlined, it does not provide for efficient mechanisms to control emission. Consequently, Illarionov summarized, "there appears an opportunity for Belarusian residents to transfer monetary funds, bypassing the Central Bank of Russia." "Belarusian residents receive an opportunity to compensate their expenditures at the expense of the Russian Federation," he added. Illarionov reported that the agreement between Russia and Belarus also provides for the creation of a joint fund of gold and currency reserves and "it will be a hard burden for Russia as it is quite obvious that Belarus has no such reserves." According to Illarionov, creation of such a single monetary system could become an additional stimulus for the inflationary process in Russia, totaling 10 percent. "At the same time such an agreement creates a precedent for other CIS republics to sign agreements with Russia on similar conditions," he noted. Illarionov also reported that according to the governmental working center of economic reforms, in December inflation was 10.9 percent (according to the state statistics committee -- 12 percent) and will remain the same until April 1994. After that "there could be a substantial rise in the level of inflation," he believes. The working center reports that the industrial production level remained stable over the last 5 months but the number of unemployed is growing. In December there were already 1.5 Mn [million] unemployed in Russia or 1.2 percent of Russia's employable population. "Growth in unemployment is the reaction of the Russian economy to the toughening of the government's monetary policy," said Illarionov.
