The physicians ruled that he was hit in the head by an ax, and not by a bullet, as had been initially claimed. Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el reports that the riot in Hebron was dispersed by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers' gunfire. A soldier was lightly injured in Rafah when a fragmentation grenade was thrown at an IDF patrol. The soldiers opened fire at the estimated site from which the grenade was thrown. IDF troops launched searches in the area.
