It pointed out that the Army and Air Force "will not open fire except against armed groups who attack them, who directly jeopardize the civilian population, or who seek to return to positions and towns they had occupied." In an official communique, the secretariat added, "the Air Force, in particular, will cease fire except in cases of attacks on Army personnel in uninhabited areas where they require help." President Salinas de Gortari had said he decided to "suspend all fire" in the conflict area because the Army already fulfilled "the initial goal" of its mission to restore control and security in the region. In the communique, which was issued immediately after the presidential announcement, the Defense Secretariat pointed out that the troops "will continue to protect towns that requested help to prevent any possible aggressions." The communique said, "they will not allow these armed people to move outside the region," and it added, "they will maintain free mobility in terms of personnel and equipment, including ground and aerial reconnaisance operations."
