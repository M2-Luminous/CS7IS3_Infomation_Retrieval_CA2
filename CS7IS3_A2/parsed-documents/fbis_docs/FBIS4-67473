As one of China's major heavy industry bases, Liaoning has many industries that cause serious pollution, including the metallurgy, chemical, paper-making and mining sectors. To raise sewage disposal capacity, Liaoning plans to invest two billion yuan to launch the "clean water" project, which was initiated in 1992. A pollution control program was framed to tackle industrial pollutants in the province's main rivers and all reservoirs. According to the program, some 157 enterprises in the province would put about one billion yuan into building 218 sewage treatment projects. When they go into operation, these projects will be able to handle additional 300 million tons of waste water every year. Early in 1988, the province carried out a "Blue Sky" project to curb air pollution in the region, which involved 14 cities, 35 counties and 3,800 enterprises, with a total investment of 770 million yuan. All aspects of the project were completed and went into operation in June 1990. During the ensuing three-year period, nearly 20,000 boilers and furnaces were upgraded and 200 projects for industrial pollution control were completed. Shenyang city, once labeled by the world environmental protection organization as one of the ten most seriously polluted cities in the world, began to issue licenses for airborne emissions in 1991. So far, air pollution in the city has been brought under control. Ash and smoke content in the air has dropped remarkably.
