During his stay in the city, he listened to the work reports of the city of Wuhan and of Hubei Province, and met with main responsible persons from various democratic parties, and the Wuhan branch of the Federation of Trade and Commerce. Wang Zhaoguo said: A China craze is spreading in the world now. Many countries are amazed at China's economy, which has been developing very rapidly for 15 years running without considerable fluctuations. There are two main reasons contributing to this: First, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we have taken economic construction as a focus, and always have persisted in deepening reform and expanding opening up. Second, we have actively promoted the development of socialist democracy and politics, and have persisted in and developed our fundamental system of people's congresses so as to consolidate and improve our multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the CPC, and our political consultation. We have done our best to extensively arouse positive factors in various quarters, promote political consultation and democratic supervision, and enable democratic parties to participate in and discuss government and political affairs. This is a condition and guarantee for promoting social stability and economic development. Wang Zhaoguo fully affirmed the achievements made by Hubei and Wuhan in reform, opening up, and economic construction, and in particular, their marked success in attracting investment from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. Wang Zhaoguo stressed: Wuhan must give full play to its geographical strong point to vigorously attract foreign capital. It must support and help foreign businessmen run enterprises well. It must set a good example in this respect to attract more foreign investment. Wang Zhaoguo particularly emphasized: It is of great importance to carry out economic and trade work related to Taiwan. This is beneficial to linking the feelings of the two sides of the straits, and to promoting their economic cooperation and the peaceful reunification of the motherland. During his stay in Wuhan, Wang Zhaoguo also met with heads of Hong Kong's New World Group, the Sun Hung Kai Group, and the Henderson Group. He also inspected Wuhan's Tianhe International Airport, which is under construction, as well as a home-ownership project. He attended an inaugural ceremony for Hankou's Changxing Park, and a ceremony marking the completion of the airport highway project. Those who accompanied Wang Zhaoguo on his inspection tour included Hu Deping, vice chairman of All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce; (Zhang Mengna), secretary general of the United Front Work Department under the CPC Central Committee; and responsible persons of the relevant departments.
