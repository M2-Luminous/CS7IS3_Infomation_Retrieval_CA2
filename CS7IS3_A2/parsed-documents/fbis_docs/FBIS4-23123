FBIS TRENDS-22Jun94-Ukraine Anti-Reformist Masol Named Premier by Kravchuk and Leftists Anti-Reformist Masol Named Premier by Kravchuk and Leftists SUMMARY Appearing to join leftists rather than fight them, President Leonid Kravchuk on 15 June proposed that the Supreme Soviet elect as premier Vitaliy Masol, a foe of reforms whom Kravchuk himself had helped force out of office in late 1990. Kravchuk explained that he chose the leftist Masol over others simply because he was the only candidate with a chance of winning a majority in the Supreme Soviet, where leftists form the biggest faction and control the leadership, and in fact the Supreme Soviet quickly approved him. The nomination of Masol--a sharp critic of Kravchuk rival Leonid Kuchma and a favorite of new Supreme Soviet Chairman and presidential candidate Oleksandr Moroz--suggests that Kravchuk may be collaborating with Moroz, whom Kravchuk surely wants to keep in the presidential race to take away some of Kuchma's votes in the east and prevent any possibility of a Kuchma victory in the first round. END SUMMARY Kravchuk offered Supreme Soviet leaders several possible candidates for premier, including some who were at least moderate economic reformers, but virtually no nationalists or non- easterners. He presented the candidates to the Supreme Soviet Presidium, commission chairmen, and heads of factions on 1 June (Vysokyy Zamok, 4 June). Vecherniy Kiev on 7 and 8 June reported "from unofficial sources" that Kravchuk had proposed seven possibilities--present acting Premier Yukhym Zvyahilskyy (from Donetsk), Kravchuk's Odesa protege Valentyn Symonenko, Industry Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko, head of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast State Administration (Presidential Representative) Pavlo Lazarenko, Liberal Democratic Party leader and former Kuchma and Kravchuk adviser Ivan Markulov (Donetsk), Dnipropetrovsk factory director Anatoliy Melnyk, and Masol (Donetsk). Markulov is a strong advocate of privatization, Vecherniy Kiev characterized Lazarenko as leaning to reform, saying that he "has the reputation of an adherent of reforms among circles close to Kravchuk," while Symonenko had been put in charge of economic reform by Kravchuk in 1992 but was assailed by reformers as not really pushing reform. After gauging reaction from the Supreme Soviet leadership, Kravchuk on 15 June formally proposed Masol, probably the most anti-reformist of the group and certainly no friend to Kravchuk. Kravchuk explained that he was proposing Masol simply because he was taking account of the "balance of forces in the Supreme Soviet" and that "other candidates do not have the support of a majority in the Supreme Soviet Presidium and groups" (Kiev radio, 15 June). (See Note 1) Kravchuk had played the key role in forcing Masol to resign as premier in 1990 (see below), and Masol has been harshly critical of Kravchuk, accusing him, for example, of tolerating corruption in his presidential entourage (Silski Visti, 14 June). As the 17 June Kyivska Pravda pointed out, Kravchuk said "not one word about Vitaliy Masol's working qualities" when he presented his candidature to the Supreme Soviet. (Note 1) Kravchuk had similarly bowed to the will of the dominant forces in the Supreme Soviet in late 1992 when he proposed Kuchma for premier instead of his own favorite, Valentyn Symonenko. (See the Trends of 21 October 1992, pages 25-27.) The leftists, who won the largest number of deputies in the March-April election and won control of the posts of Supreme Soviet chairman and deputy chairmen, clearly supported Masol. Moroz praised him as a possible premier in a 21 May Demokratychna Ukraina interview, and Masol had been shown special honor when the Supreme Soviet opened in early May. On its opening day, the parliament elected a temporary Presidium of five, including Masol (ITAR-TASS, 11 May), even though he, unlike the other four, was not head of one of the main Supreme Soviet factions. After Kravchuk's nomination, leftist Supreme Soviet First Deputy Chairman Oleksandr Tkachenko announced that 12 of the Supreme Soviet's commissions backed Masol's candidacy, while two opposed and three abstained (Kiev radio, 15 June). Masol was quickly approved by the Supreme Soviet, but angry democrats and nationalists boycotted the election. The vote was 199 to 24 for Masol, with one invalid vote, but the announcement of the vote specified that 302 deputies had received ballots but only 224 cast votes (Kiev radio, 16 June), indicating that almost 80 deputies had boycotted the vote. Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil had said that "since we are not able to effectively influence the formation of the cabinet, our faction, after holding consultations, will probably not take part in forming the government" (Holos Ukrainy, 28 May), and ITAR-TASS on 16 June reported that the majority of the opposition did not participate in the voting. Masol Judging by Masol's recent statements as well as his background, he is probably the most leftist-conservative of the proposed candidates. In his 15 June speech to the Supreme Soviet after being nominated, Masol called for closer ties to Russia and for more state regulation of the economy. Although he committed himself to Ukraine's independence and territorial integrity, he defined Ukraine's "economic isolationism" and "breaking of economic ties with our age-old partners and neighbors" as "the main causes of the state's economic decline" and called for closer ties with Russia. While citing the need for faster reforms, a transition to market relations, and support for entrepreneurship, as well as declaring Ukraine "a market economy," Masol assailed the Ukrainian Government for having copied Russian reformer Yegor Gaydar's reforms and he stressed protection of the population against the effects of market forces; he said nothing about free prices. Masol added that "while giving the reforms a stronger impetus, the government must ensure state regulation of the economy, especially in strategic industries, which is being done in every market-oriented country" (Kiev radio, 15 June). Although he gave favorable mention to economic reform in his Supreme Soviet speech, Masol had made clear his anti-reform views and his hostility to Kravchuk and Kuchma just a few days earlier. In a long interview in the 3, 7, 9, and 14 June Silski Visti entitled "What the 'New Political Course' Has Brought," Masol delivered scathing attacks on even the modest reforms of the Ukrainian Government, contending that since he left power in late 1990 the "least favorable variant" of policy has been followed. He argued that the fall of production, the "catastrophic lowering of people's level of living," and the growth of social tension "could have been avoided" and blamed these on the repeated "experiments on our own people" and those who "deceived" the people with "slogans of 'freedom' and 'democracy,' 'national revival' and 'independence'" and promises to create a "miraculous market" by means of "shock therapy." To divert the public from dissatisfaction with dropping living standards, he argued, the leaders blamed "conservatives" for resisting change and stirred up tension with Russia to create an external threat. He made it clear he was blaming both Kuchma and Kravchuk for the disastrous policy and, reflecting his dislike for Kravchuk, also directly accused the president of tolerating corruption in his presidential entourage. In addition to the Silski Visti interview, in a 14 June interview with UNIAN, he criticized those who opposed a planned economy and said that he really did not want the post of premier but he was "unable to remain on the sidelines after the Kuchma government made so many ill-considered moves." Masol's dislike of Kravchuk and the reformers and his fond nostalgia for state planning and the Soviet Union are not surprising in view of his career. He had been Ukraine's Gosplan chairman from 1979 until 1987 when he was named premier by Ukrainian Communist Party First Secretary Volodymyr Shcherbitskyy. He was driven out of that office in October 1990 when the democratic opposition organized strikes demanding his resignation and dissolution of the Supreme Soviet, after which then Supreme Soviet Chairman Kravchuk worked out a compromise, persuading Masol to resign to placate the strikers. Masol's subsequent occasional interviews--in the 23 February 1993 Holos Ukrainy, 24 July 1993 Demokratychna Ukraina, and in the June 1994 Silski Visti--underscore how much he resented being sacrificed as the scapegoat in a cave-in to the democratic opposition. In retirement he wrote a book "The Lost Chance" lamenting the collapse of the USSR (Kyivska Pravda, 17 June). He has not been prominent since leaving office, but ran for the Supreme Soviet this March as an independent and won in a runoff in Chernihiv over a CPU candidate (Post-Inform, 11 April). Although not a CPU member, he says he "remains a communist at heart" (ITAR-TASS, 16 June). Kravchuk-Moroz Connection Kravchuk's nomination of Masol suggests that he has made some sort of deal with Moroz or is at least collaborating with him to undercut his rivals Plyushch and Kuchma, seeing them as more threatening than Moroz and Masol, at least for the moment. The nomination's timing strongly suggests that Kravchuk was motivated by political calculations rather than a desire to get the government moving in a new or more activist direction. Kravchuk had been willing to let the government go on with only an acting premier and virtually no cabinet changes since.shortly after Kuchma left as premier last September only to now rush to name a new premier just before the presidential election. In doing so, he appeared to be responding to Moroz's expressed wishes, since the parliament speaker in his first speech after being elected called for immediate election of a new premier without waiting for the presidential election (Kiev radio, 18 May). Kravchuk, according to Moroz, also did not object to Moroz's proposal to amend the constitution to put all executive power in the premier rather than the president (UNIAN, 20 May; Aktsent, 10 June). Masol's nomination aids Kravchuk by placing a sharp critic of Kuchma as head of government (someone Kuchma will surely seek to dislodge if elected president) and pleases Moroz, who not only praised Masol as a potential premier (Demokratychna Ukraina, 21 May) but laid out an economic program apparently based on Masol's ideas. Moroz's report to the Supreme Soviet, carried on Kiev radio on 15 June, called for more state regulation and blamed the crisis on the dismantling of the "planned-administrative system of management" without replacing it with new market structures, the "collapse of the USSR national economic complex," the "mechanical" adoption of other countries' experience, and "ill- considered price liberalization" and privatization. Masol denied having drawn up the economic program that Moroz was to present to the Supreme Soviet but said that much of it had been borrowed from his own writings (UNIAN, 14 June), and he lauded Moroz's program in his own 15 June Supreme Soviet speech (Kiev radio, 15 June). Whether or not Kravchuk secretly provided Moroz with the extra votes needed to be elected Supreme Soviet chairman (as Chornovil charged in the 20 May Nezavisimost and Silski Visti) remains unclear, but Moroz's election did undermine Kravchuk rival Plyushch and did not disturb Kravchuk. Kravchuk spoke favorably of Moroz's election and said he could work with?him, according to ? the 19 May ITAR-TASS. Now Kravchuk's nomination of Masol appears to establish a temporary alliance to weaken Kuchma, whom he has said is his main rival (Interfax, 3 June; Izvestiya, 4 June). For his part, Moroz also has an interest in working with Kravchuk because Kuchma is a competitor for some of the same constituency as Moroz and also because an aggressive President Kuchma may be more difficult to work with for Supreme Soviet Chairman Moroz than President Kravchuk. Kuchma reacted negatively to Masol's appointment, calling the appointment just 10 days before the election a political game, and predicted a clash with Masol if he himself is elected president (Mayak radio, 17 June; UNIAN, 18 June). Implications Ukraine is clearly lurching to the left, as exemplified by the big Communist victory in the March-April Supreme Soviet election, the leftists' capture of most leadership posts in the Supreme Soviet, and now leftist Masol being named head of government. Even if Kravchuk, who is virtually the only hope for the nationalists, is elected president, he may be pulled in a more socialist, anti-reform, pro-Russian direction along with the Supreme Soviet and cabinet, especially if the Supreme Soviet amends the laws to transfer some presidential powers to the premier. Even though Kuchma is more pro-Russian, he favors a strong presidency and his election would lead to an early clash with the Supreme Soviet and new Premier Masol over power, if not policy.
