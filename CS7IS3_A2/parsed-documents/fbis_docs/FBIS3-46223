Provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu and Vice Governor Chu Bo attended and delivered speeches at the closing session in which they emphatically stated that 1994 is a crucial year for Hunan's finance and taxation system reform. Therefore, government departments at all levels in Hunan should become fully prepared for certain temporary difficulties that might arise by strengthening confidence, making concerted efforts, sharing weal and woe, and actively, assuredly, and successfully furthering finance and taxation system reform as well as other types of work. Speaking on Hunan's work at present, Governor Chen Bangzhu pointed out: All levels and all departments across the province should develop the spirit of plain living and hard struggle, curb expenditure, and strive to maintain a sustained balance between revenue and expenditure. Finance departments, on their part, should make every possible endeavor to guarantee the basic livelihood of the broad masses of the people, notwithstanding revenue cuts resulting from policy changes and growing pressures in this regard, and should resolutely put an end to the practice of issuing IOU's to both peasants and cadres. Provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu noted, in particular, that finance and taxation departments at all levels in Hunan should waste no time in collecting revenue during the first quarter of 1994. Party committees and governments at all levels in Hunan should take the interests of the whole into account and give unreserved support to finance and taxation system reform and finance work.
