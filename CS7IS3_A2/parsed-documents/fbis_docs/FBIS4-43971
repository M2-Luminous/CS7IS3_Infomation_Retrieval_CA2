Papandreou made his statement upon arrival at Corfu Airport. The direction of the economy does not concern me, he said. We are not magicians but we have a convergence plan that can be achieved and that takes into account social circumstances, Papandreou stressed. The prime minister said there will be an amendment to the Maastricht Treaty in 1996 and that perhaps we will see significant changes in the direction of the economies of many European countries.
