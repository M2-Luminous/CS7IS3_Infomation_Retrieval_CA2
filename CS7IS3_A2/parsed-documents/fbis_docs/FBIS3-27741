Many responsible U.S. officials said straightforwardly that the purpose of this radio is to propagate U.S. concepts and lifestyle to those Asian lands where freedom and democracy are absent. The U.S. Senate decision has sparked immediate reactions from various Asian countries. On 27 January, a Chinese Goverment spokesman said that through its decision to set up Radio Free Asia, the United States has trampled on the standards of international relations and interfered in the internal affairs of China and other Asian countries. The spokesman also said: The U.S. Senate's 26 January decision must be cancelled. KCNA -- the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY of the DPRK -- issued a statement condemning the U.S. decision to set up Radio Free Asia. Myanmar also expressed its concern over this U.S. Senate decision. Radio Free Asia is not the first instrument aimed at propagating the U.S. outlook and philosophy. Earlier, during the Cold War, the United States established Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty to direct broadcasts at European countries and former Soviet countries. Then came the recent establishment of the Jose Marti radio and television stations to beam broadcasts at Cuba. One of the first directors of Radio Free Europe later revealed that the purpose of such radio stations was to create public insecurity and anarchic conditions for propaganda targets in the relevant countries. These radio stations are important tools of the United States in its peaceful evolution strategy. Not only have relevant countries protested against such stations, they have also been condemned by the international community on several occasions. After the Cold War, along with the general international development trend, Asia has emerged as a dynamic and fast-developing zone of peace and stability. Apart from pressing for peace, stability, and equal and mutually beneficial cooperation among regional countries, Asian countries want to expand their cooperative relations with all regions and nations on the basis of peace, stability, and mutual benefit, respect for independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. Aware of the prospects of Asia, many countries and regions, including Europe and even the United States, consider their cooperative relations with Asian countries important. The Asian people believe that the U.S. Senate decision is a product of the Cold War period that runs counter to general trends in the Asian region, is detrimental to Asian socioeconomic development, and will have a bad effect on relations between the United States and many Asian countries. According to a 29 January BBC dispatch, there has even been criticism in the United States against the plan to set up Radio Free Asia. Those who oppose this plan contend that this is a Cold War-style product which is no longer useful and suitable, especially when economic relations between the United States and Asia are increasing daily. U.S. President Bill Clinton and other top-ranking U.S. officials once declared that the United States would respect the sovereignty of other countries and their right to self-determination and that it would not interfere into the internal affairs of other countries. Regrettably, the U.S. Administration has reneged on its own words by infringing upon international law and interfered in the internal affairs of Asian countries. It is hoped that the United States will make the correct decisions to suit the general trend of the world and the region.
