Since his first report three years ago, van der Stoel reiterates the same call month after month and the more he repeats it the wider and longer becomes the list of crimes against individuals and groups in Iraq and the more the Special Commissioner bumps against international unwillingness to challenge tyranny. This unwillingness is exhibited by the same countries that turned their backs on the Iraqi people during the popular uprising of 1991 and whose technological weapons broke the backs of our heroes in the Iraqi north and south. Van der Stoel is a supporter of our great people, who will remember him and other friends of the Iraqi people like him for centuries to come for the positions they took. We need to implement his recommendations today for the sake of fairness in the world and justice in Iraq. We have called repeatedly, and shall continue to do so, for a secure region in the whole of Iraq, or in any part of it that would allow freedom to grow, as it grows and prospers today in the north of Iraq thanks to the international protection it enjoys. Today, we are called upon to support and implement the recommendations of the Special Commissioner. By calling for the deployment of international observers to safeguard human rights throughout Iraq, he is in effect calling for a secure zone that would encompass all Iraqi lands--a zone where human rights are inviolate and where the Iraqi people are not targeted for genocide. We realize that the power and determination to do so are lacking today, but we insist on that just demand, hoping that we will have an opportunity in the near future to prove to the world that human rights and freedom in Iraq are of the essence for the stability of the region, just as oppression over a quarter century was at the core of deterioration and wars in and out of Iraq. We remain hopeful today for the establishment of such a secure zone and for deploying international observers in all of Iraq, in our bloodied south, in our burnt regions, and in our abused Baghdad. Today we call against standing hand-tied before the crisis and for being diligent in seeking some means to realize the people's aspirations for freedom and for crippling the hand of dictatorship and staying it from oppressing and terrorizing the Iraqis. We have a request in this connection that only takes a political resolution by the United Nations: deploy international human rights observers throughout our liberated northern Iraq and give them the official task of recording the facts and investigating conditions in Iraq from within Iraq. Such an assignment would derive its legality from authorizing the observers to guarantee that everyone respects human rights in our Iraqi north and guarantee respect for those human rights and the cessation of terrorist practices by the regime there. Other assignments for the observers would be to monitor and investigate instances of human rights violations by the regime in regions that still suffer under it, thereby fulfilling the commissioner's task; and to prepare for the direct coverage of human rights monitoring in the regions and towns that achieve liberation from dictatorship. Such a direct implementation of the special commissioner's recommendations will not be sufficient and will not achieve its purpose for the time being, but it would represent a qualitative change that would put the regime on the defensive, for the first time since the Gulf war, about an operation linked to a fundamental issue that has to do with the people directly. That would restrain the regime's terrorism and atrocities and would lend efficacy to the pragmatic deployment of observers. It would be an accomplishment in that we would be relegating to the international community responsibility for the people's tragedy. As we call for deploying international human rights observers in Iraq, we urge the leaders of the Arab and Muslim worlds and the UN secretary general to abandon their silence and stop ignoring our life and death issues. Are they going to let strangers to Arabdom and Islam, like van der Stoel, Emma Nicholson, and others, show more concern for and interest in our causes?
