FR940505-1-00062 FR940505-1-00012 As a result, without further SIP or FIP measures, the total amount of emissions in the Sacramento area is not expected to change significantly by 1999 or 2005. CARB and EPA have performed extensive meteorologic analysis and urban airshed modeling (UAM) of ozone formation for the Sacramento area. This modeling suggests that several combinations of VOC and NO X reduction can achieve attainment of the ozone standard. As discussed in Section III.H.3.a., EPA is using reduction targets of 40 percent VOC and 30 percent NO X from 1990 baseyear emission levels for the Sacramento area FIP attainment demonstration. In order to achieve the 40:30 target, SIP and FIP controls must reduce the future inventories for 1999 and 2005 to approximately 140 tons per day of VOC and 130 tons per day of NO X . (These targets are often referred to as ``carrying capacities.'') b. SIP rules. Irrespective of EPA's FIP obligation, California and the Sacramento nonattainment area are required to submit an ozone attainment SIP in November 1994. As part of this and previous SIP efforts, CARB and the local air agencies in the Sacramento area are continually adopting and modifying regulations to reduce NO X and VOC emissions. EPA is not proposing to act on any SIP improvements as part of this NPRM, but will do so on a case-by-case basis in separate actions. For purposes of the attainment demonstration in this NPRM, EPA is not generally assigning emission reduction credit for those measures that are not fully adopted in enforceable form. EPA urges the responsible State and local agencies to complete rule development and submit rules for SIP approval as soon as they are fully adopted. This will allow EPA to approve the regulations and substitute the locally developed measures for FIP rules. c. FIP rules for 1999 and 2005. Sacramento is classified as a ``Serious'' ozone nonattainment area and is, therefore, initially required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 to demonstrate attainment by 1999. There are several reasons why a 1999 attainment target for a FIP, however, would result in an unreasonable plan with undesirable impacts on the local economy. The following discussion outlines these reasons and explains EPA's proposed solution (i.e., bumping up the classification to ``Severe'' and extending the attainment deadline). EPA is soliciting comment on whether its solution is appropriate or whether the advantages of attainment by an earlier date justify the imposition of the kinds of measures which would be necessary. The FIP rules proposed for implementation in the Sacramento area for the 1999 and 2005 attainment options are discussed in sections III.B.2 and III.B.3. Mobile source measures which yield emission reductions for both the 1999 and 2005 options include an enhanced I/M program, credit for national standards for nonroad vehicles and engines, offroad recreational vehicle standards, motorcycle standards, and a parking cash out requirement. Other mobile source measures needed for attainment, discussed above and below, depend on the attainment year, 1999 or 2005. For 1999, the additional measures include accelerating turnover for heavy duty truck engines, capping emissions for nonroad fleets, restricting driving for highway vehicles and a strategy for recreational boats. For 2005, the additional measures includes strategies for motor vehicles, locomotives, recreational boats, airports, military installations, and an employee commute options (ECO) program. For stationary sources in Sacramento, both the 1999 and 2005 proposals include the source specific reasonably available control technology (RACT) regulations discussed in III.C.2, all of the regulations for specific source categories discussed in III.C.3 and the statewide regulations discussed in III.C.4. Many sources will also be subject to the cap regulations discussed in III.C.5. which will require approximately a 20&hyph;45 percent reduction in VOCs by 1999 (for the 1999 attainment option) or a gradual 4&hyph;9 percent per year reduction in VOCs from 2001 through 2005 (for the 2005 attainment option). d. 1999 attainment option. By 1999, the existing State and proposed FIP measures common to both the 1999 and 2005 proposals for both stationary 26 and mobile sources will have reduced the Sacramento VOC inventory from 236 tons per day in 1990 to 155 tons per day in 1999, and the NO X inventory from 185 to 153 tons per day. Much of the progress on VOC and NO X comes from the stationary source measures, continued benefits of the current motor vehicle control programs, and a substantial improvement in in-use emissions of light duty vehicles due to an enhanced I/M program. New initial emissions standards affecting nonroad diesels and locomotives are just barely beginning to be felt in new engine purchases. New standards for medium duty vehicles, heavy duty vehicles, and heavy duty nonroad engines in California are just taking effect in the 1999 model year. 26 The stationary measures include all of the measures discussed in III.C that are identified as applying to Sacramento and those that are applied statewide, and the cap regulation which requires a 20&hyph;45 percent reduction by 1999. In 1999, the shortfall in emission reductions is about 15 tons per day for VOC and 23 tons per day for NO X . NO X is almost entirely contributed by mobile sources in Sacramento. Twenty-three tons per day represent about 16 percent of the remaining mobile source emissions of NO X in 1999, or 43 percent of the remaining light duty motor vehicle emissions (i.e., passenger cars, light duty trucks and motorcycles). If the FIP must reduce the additional 23 tons of NO X without the benefit of new standards and normal turnover, then it must contain measures to require accelerated turnover and to reduce the activity of mobile sources. Under the option of retaining Sacramento's ``Serious'' area classification, EPA's strategy for making up the shortfall focused on mobile sources because of the absence of significant stationary NO X sources and aimed first at technology measures that are able to yield NO X reductions by 1999. EPA then considered whether similar opportunities existed for VOC reductions. The remainder of the reductions came necessarily from measures to reduce activity. (1) Onroad heavy duty trucks. On-highway heavy duty trucks are a category for which EPA believes an accelerated retirement/replacement program can be adopted and implemented because the regulatory development for tighter emission standards, certification protocols and product design work was updated in 1993. For the 2005 option, the FIP proposes significant changes to the emission standards and certification protocols which will be applied to on-highway heavy duty trucks beginning with the 1999 model year. However, the NO X standard for this category was also recently made more stringent. Since the 1991 model year, engine manufacturers have been certifying engines meeting a 5 gram per brake horsepower-hour standard. The federal NO X standard reduces further to 4 grams per brake horsepower-hour in 1998. Engines currently in use may range in design standard as high as 10.7 grams per brake horsepower-hour. Thus, there is an opportunity to require accelerated turnover in this category to effect reductions from the current fleet in order to contribute to a 1999 attainment strategy. In order for EPA to implement and enforce an engine replacement requirement, it will be necessary for California fleets to show compliance with a fleet average NO X standard prior to registration. The details of such a registration system and other requirements are described in section III.D.3., Programs for Onroad Heavy Duty Vehicles and Engines. For the 2005 option, a fleet averaging program begins in 2001. If the 1999 attainment option is ultimately selected, fleets registered in California would be required, after 1997, to have an average gram per brake horsepower-hour level of no more than 5 grams.
