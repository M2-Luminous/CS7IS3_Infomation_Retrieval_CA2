But the cartoon world of clear demarcations between gratitude and resentment and sharp distinctions between good and evil is unable to explain the complex political approach of this unconsciously powerful and connected LY member. When Lin Chih-chia squeaked into the post of chief party secretary in the election for the KMT's chief party secretary in the LY on 19 Jan 1994, outsiders speculated that the KMT might be on the verge of a brand-new parliamentary image, while being concerned about whether Lin Chih-chia, who is commonly known as the "child king," could make the overall transition to moving in such "high political circles." Lin Chih-chia is of course not a child. His father, Lin Ta-k'un [2651 1129 0981], served in Taipei County for three terms as the Wuku Township magistrate, and for 13 years as township legislative assembly president, so that the Lin family is considered to be not an inconsequential faction in Wuku and even in all of greater Taipei County. Early in his childhood, the Lin family was involved in politics and, as children were not noticeable as opponents, Lin Chih-chia as a child was often sent into the enemy camp to election headquarters to gather intelligence, acting as a "messenger." But while Lin Chih-chia was familiar with "participation" in election battles early in his childhood, he is certainly not held to have more political cells in the LY than other legislators. With a background in chemistry, he studied in the United States, only genuinely engaging in the field of government administration during his Ph.D. studies, with political science on the side, before which he had been only a pure and conscientious overseas student. Growing up in a smooth-sailing atmosphere made it unnecessary for him to be concerned about or deal with "human" issues, with the eternal topics in political struggle around mainly man and human nature certainly not having left a deep impression on him in his early life. His neglect of human nature left him appearing stuffy in this election for chief party secretary. Being unfamiliar with the customary exchange of gifts among legislators at New Years, Lin Chih-chia greeted legislators of all parties with complimentary baskets of bamboo shoots to express thanks for their votes. While these were small gifts with great feeling, the legislators who were generally not used to receiving New Years gifts from Lin Chih-chia still felt such gifts to be rather abrupt, which discounted their effectiveness. In addition, he had not been alert enough to promptly explain the ties that he had forged with Cheng Feng-shih [6774 6646 2514] at the time of the legislative elections in his election district, causing the LY second-team public-opinion society headed by Cheng Feng-shih to become his major election obstacle in this election for chief party secretary, which Lin Chih-chia had never expected. The conflict of LY Chairman Liu Sung-fan [0491 2646 5672] and Vice Chairman Wang Chin-p'ing [3769 6855 1627] with Jao Ying-ch'i [7437 4481 1142] involved him, affecting his votes for chief party secretary, making him a nomcombatant offender. Strictly speaking, all of these influences on the elections results were ones that Lin Chih-chia could not have considered, leaving him during the elections without his former guiltless smile, and asking with fear in his heart: "How could things have turned out this way?" Lin Chih-chia had always had a positive image among his party's legislators, as he was probably one of the legislators with the best attendance rate in the LY. Due to his family's all-out backing and support, Lin Chih-chia was able to devote all of his attention to the congress without concern for his home front. Meetings to deliberate on bills were able to add to his legal and professional knowledge. While other legislators might avoid various LY meetings as being beneath them, Lin Chih-chia attended them with much pride and glee. When the legislature was not in session, other legislators rushed back to their districts to do grassroots work, while Lin Chih-chia showed up at the LY every morning at 0800 sharp. KMT calls to his office to mobilize party legislators to vote were often in vain, as he had long since been in the legislative chamber. In light of these points, he was more suited to become party whip than most of his party's legislators. When Liao Fu-pen [1675 4395 2609] was chief party secretary, Lin Chih-chia was deputy party secretary, as well as serving as LY work committee vice president. While Liao Fu-pen held himself to be "intelligent, resourceful, and courageous" but helpless about having too many outside affairs, so was certainly not very actively involved in consultations between the ruling and opposition parties, Lin Chih-chia as his assistant had many more opportunities to temper himself in such consultations. DPP offseason secretary general Lu Hsiu-yi [1982 0208 0001] holds Lin Chih-chia to be a moderate and rational "gentleman" with whom one can work. As a natural gentleman, the moderate and rational Lin Chih-chia has always had the air of a scholar. His coordination in 1993 spurred the health administration to agree to build a children's hospital on the site of Taiwan U's former hospital. While such planning and staffing concern for Taiwan U's hospitals and capacity might be a best opportunity to show merit on behalf of voters for an ordinary legislator, Lin Chih-chia did not even report it to the media. No one in the LY has ever seen Lin Chih-chia pounding the lectern, shouting, or clashing with others. Despite mistakes by subordinates and assistants, Lin Chih-chia has no record of blaming others. But his moderate nature is also interpreted by some at times as irresponsibly obedient behavior. Especially when faced with structural issues within the KMT organization, many question whether Lin Chih-chia knows how to settle inner-party demands of various differing interests and factional disputes. Within the party, the KMT is now facing a transition period, entangled between top-down mission-type political party leftovers and bottom-up democratic-type political party pressures. Unfortunately, the LY is the convergence point for these two forces. Party legislators are pressured by voting from below and policies set by the party central committee from above. They have to both protect party policy and pay attention to winning votes and keeping from losing them. Mobilizing for such efforts is always painful for the party organization. With one legislator being more powerful than another, who fears whom? It is always hard to serve as party whip, not to speak of the moderate Lin Chih-chia. Another problem that may become a headache for Lin Chih-chia is LY factional grievances. Particularly under the two senior and mid-level party whips of Central Policy Council Enforcement Chief Jao Ying-ch'i and LY Work Committee Director Liao Fu-pen, there are special problems involved in playing the role of a low party whip. With the ties between Jao and Liao, while Lin Chih-chia was once Liao Fu-pen's assistant, and is regarded by outsiders as part of Jao's forces, the two both see Lin as a youthful member of the younger generation, and as a disciple. So the problems caused by the two elders for the younger, as to Lin Chih-chia who does not easily clash with others, and how to stand off the close ties between these two legislators, seems to be a problem that Lin will have to do much future work on. Lu Hsiu-yi has some reservations about Lin Chih-chia's ability to act responsibly and take charge in the future. In addition, as politics revolves around people, with alliances and grievances among political figures, both the good and the bad, playing out and changing in the space of weak and unclear human nature, Lin Chih-chia who is less sensitive about "people" is likely to have to make an even greater show of rare spirit.
