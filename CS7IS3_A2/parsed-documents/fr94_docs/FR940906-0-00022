ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On November 13, 1992, the West Virginia Department of Commerce, Labor and Environmental Resources; Division of Environmental Protection; Office of Air Quality (WVOAQ) submitted a request to EPA to redesignate the Charleston moderate ozone nonattainment area (Kanawha and Putnam Counties) from nonattainment to attainment and also submitted a maintenance plan for the Charleston area as a revision to the West Virginia State Implementation Plan (SIP). On June 13, 1994, EPA proposed approval of West Virginia's redesignation request and maintenance plan. No adverse comments were received on the proposal. EPA is approving West Virginia's request to redesignate the Charleston moderate ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment and is approving the maintenance plan submitted by WVOAQ as a revision to the West Virginia SIP because relevant requirements set forth in the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, have been met. This action is being taken in accordance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule will become effective September 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107 and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, Office of Air Quality, 1558 Washington Street, East, Charleston, West Virginia, 25311.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 13, 1994 (59 FR 30326&hyph;30331), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of West Virginia. The NPR proposed that the Charleston moderate ozone nonattainment area be redesignated from nonattainment to attainment and that the maintenance plan submitted by the WVOAQ as a revision to the West Virginia SIP be approved contingent upon West Virginia's submittal of a revision to its maintenance plan's provisions to clarify the procedures for implementation of contingency measures. The formal request for the redesignation of the Charleston moderate ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment and the maintenance plan SIP revision were submitted to EPA by the State of West Virginia on November 13, 1992. Subsequent revisions to the State's maintenance plan were submitted to EPA on February 28, 1994 and August 10, 1994. Maintenance Plan West Virginia's August 10, 1994 submittal revised the maintenance plan to clarify the State's enforceable procedures for implementation of contingency measures specified in the maintenance plan. The revision requires that one or more of the ``contingency measures'' listed and described in the maintenance plan shall be selected within three months after verification of a violation of the ozone national ambient air quality standard. The regulatory measures shall be adopted as emergency rules and implemented within six months after adoption. In accordance with West Virginia law, the provisions of these emergency regulations are fully enforceable. The emergency rule(s), subsequently, will be filed as legislative rule(s) for permanent authorization by the legislature in accordance with West Virginia law. EPA is approving the State of West Virginia's maintenance plan for the Charleston area because EPA finds that West Virginia's submittal meets the requirements of section 175A of the CAA. Errors and Corrections The NPR for the Charleston redesignation request and maintenance plan SIP revision published in the Federal Register on June 13, 1994 (59 FR 30326&hyph;30331) contains several errors that are corrected as follows:
