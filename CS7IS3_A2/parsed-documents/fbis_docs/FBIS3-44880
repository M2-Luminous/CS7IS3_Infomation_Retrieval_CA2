In the coming years, it will be imperative to be world-oriented and future-oriented and to develop the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries in a more extensive way. Hata made the following comments in an interview with XINHUA at the Diet building prior to his visit to China. He said: "We celebrated the 20th anniversary of Japan-China diplomatic normalization the year before last. Last year witnessed the 15th anniversary of the conclusion of Japan-China peace and friendship treaty. Relations between the two countries have entered a new stage. Hata pleasantly recalled his visit to China in January 1973. He said with deep feeling: "I am very pleased to see that the relations between Japan and China have been developed in such an extensive and profound way over the past 21 years. I visit China every two or three years and every time I am very strongly impressed with the fine relations that are increasingly developing." He said: In developing Japan-China ties, it is imperative to face the future and be conducive to world affairs in the future. As far as Japan is concerned, we should not forget to introspect the past's history. We should render active support to China in its reform and economic development. He continued: "A long-term and sustainable economic development in China is of vital importance. Now China is striving to build a socialist market economy. If it succeeds, it will have a significant bearing on the global economic development and on peace and stability in Asia and the world at large." Commenting on Japan's economic cooperation with China and its aid to China, Hata said: It is hoped that China will pay attention to environmental protection while developing its economy. He said: "China is now upgrading weapons and striving to modernize its equipment. I do not believe that China will go for a big-military power status." He said that Japan will continue to provide aid and support to China in the future. On the question of Japan-Taiwan ties, Hata said: The Japanese Government has maintained non-official contacts with Taiwan since the normalization of diplomatic ties between Japan and China. Although there are divergent views on the issue at home, the government's principled position is unchanged and it will remain so in the future." At the conclusion of his interview, Hata said: Prime Minister Hosokawa has expressed on many occasions his wishes to visit China. When the opportunity arises, he will pay a visit at the earliest possible date.
