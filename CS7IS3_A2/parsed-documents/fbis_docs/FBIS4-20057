Are we to have a guardian angel for the prime minister? [Fini] Absolutely not. The idea of having a "vigilante" stems from the fact that there will be no professional politicians at the Palazzo Chigi [government seat] and because a Left unleashed is insinuating that private interests will be intertwined with political activities. [Guiglia] But who will guarantee the guarantor? [Fini] Clearly one cannot think of making a law nor of "coming to an agreement on" a sentry-candidate here. It is a problem of political expediency; the leader of Forza Italia will have to indicate a person who will be neither a loyal collaborator nor a known adversary. However, the role of the guarantor in effectively separating economic and political acitivities will last a few days: from the formation of the new government up to the vote of confidence in parliament. Then it will be the government team that will guarantee [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's "transparency." [Guiglia] Berlusconi wants to open up to the People's Party [PPI], the Pact for Italy, the autonomists. Do you not think that the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] is being a little too ecumenical. [Fini] He is right to open up to others, but he must not do it in an indiscriminate way. There is only one central point: presenting himself to the entire, not individual members, will make opposition by certain moderate forces difficult. [Guiglia] Andreatta [lower house floor leader] of the People's Party is turning the issue upside down by saying to Berlusconi: If we join, Fini must leave the executive. Do you fear that the alliance will be overturned? [Fini] I bought a calender and an abacus for Andreatta. If he looks at the calender he will realize that he has 25 April mixed up with 25 March when the election campaign was in full swing. He will have an even more bitter shock with the abacus: Even by putting together the whole of the PPI [Italian People's Party], the Pact for Italy, the Republicans, Liberals, Socialists, pensioners, and housewives, Andreatta will not succeed in obtaining the number of parliamentarians that National Alliance has. And he will continue to suffer through this abstention from power. [Guiglia] [Northern League leader] Bossi stated that federalism can wait. Is this a joke or a "major turning point" in the Northern League? [Fini] I consider it to be a very wise move. I hope that it will be confirmed over the next few days when we draw up programs. The government must reconfirm its commitment to reforming the model of the state without proposing a compulsory institutional model. The whole of parliament must be called upon to discuss the rules of the game. Also, there must be a referendum in which the Italian people decide what sort of Italy they want. [Guiglia] Are you not afraid of being politically squashed between Berlusconi and Bossi? [Fini] Nobody can mistake National Alliance' responsible attitude for -- how can I put it? -- docility. We have decided not to raise controversies and push for this or that seat. Those who voted for us must know that we are going to govern and remain loyal to our commitments. Two in particular: the unity of Italy and solidarity between north and south. [Guiglia] Bossi is laying claim to the Viminale [Interior Ministry]. What does Fini lay claim to? [Fini] I lay claim to the right not to issue vetoes or prejudicial ultimatums over one or the other ministry. Bossi is wrong to do so because vetoes lead inevitably to the Cencelli manual [former Christian Democratic power-sharing method]. The prime minister will choose the ministers. [Guiglia] How about [President] Scalfaro resigning: no, or not yet? [Fini] No. The president is showing that he is capable of promoting the passage from the first to the second republic. [Guiglia] According to Nolte, the German historian, you are set to become "Mussolini's modern heir" by proposing "nontotalitarian fascism." Do you subscribe to this analysis? [FIni] That just shows historians do not always perceive political events correctly. There is no fascism, "constitutional" or otherwise, around the corner. Fascism was born, grew, and died with its creator Mussolini. I will soon go on a tour of Europe's capitals and the United States to explain the great Italian innovation called the National Alliance. Liberty and justice must be the cardinal values of the second republic and democracy the only means of affirming them.
