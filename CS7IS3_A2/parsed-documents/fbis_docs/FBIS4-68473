In what capacity is the question. This was the topic of an interview for a ROSSIYA correspondent granted by Ion Botnaru, first deputy minister of foreign affairs of Moldova. [Petrova] Many people are saying that, following the parliamentary elections and the Consultation With the People poll, the situation in Moldova has changed and that it is now highly propitious for a solution of the conflict between the banks of the Dniester. Do you also believe this? [Botnaru] Yes, I too believe that extra incentives for a resumption of the process of dialogue have appeared. Why? First, the results of the poll confirmed once again that we will not unite with Romania. The realization of the poll was an accommodatory step toward and, I would say even, a concession to the left bank. Second, a consensus of political forces came about during the elections, in my opinion. Everyone already recognizes that special status is necessary for the Dniester region. And, third, which political party could within six months or a year be considered to be coping with its obligations as the country's ruling party unless there is a change in the situation? That is, from the political viewpoint the possibility of a solution of the conflict is very favorable. [Petrova] All the negotiations between Chisinau and Tiraspol have become frozen in a discussion of the conditions under which they should be held. Are there fears that things will get no further this time also? [Botnaru] Yes, because the Left Bank perceives each concession of ours as a display of weakness and, correspondingly, demands the next concession. But there should be a different view of the situation: We are not weak, we are adults and we recognize how dangerous the situation is, and we are for this reason agreeing even to contacts with illegal structures--just as long as the "cart" of the negotiations starts to move. Now, after Russia has displayed good will and the CSCE has expressed its recommendations, the process of negotiations should move ahead. [Petrova] What kind of status is Moldova prepared to offer the Dniester region? [Botnaru] First and foremost, the status of the Dniester region must in no way impinge on the territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. Consequently, there must be one constitution, a common foreign policy, a common monetary system, a common macroeconomic policy, and common borders and customs. We must take account of the variegated ethnic composition of the population of the country and the existence within it of areas with the compact residence of Gagauz, Bulgarians, and Ukrainians. If we take the path of comminution, we will create a very dangerous precedent for Europe. We can, however, find formats whereby the local structures operate in the central government. [Petrova] But the Dniester region is as yet sticking to the idea of a confederation or, at least, a federation and declaring that such an arrangement of the state would not mean a violation of its integrity. [Botnaru] The declarations concerning a federation are connected more with a desire to preserve some structures. But if there is a common budget, and it must be common, the need for the elimination of all parallel structures will naturally arise.
