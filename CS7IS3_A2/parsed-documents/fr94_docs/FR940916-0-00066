FR940916-0-00066 FR940916-0-00018 This final rule is based on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) No. 89&hyph;26 that was published in the Federal Register on September 22, 1989 (54 FR 39086). A corresponding NPRM, Notice No. 89&hyph;27, that proposed changes to parts 1 and 33 for definitions and engines was also published in the same issue of the Federal Register (54 FR 39080). In addition, a joint public meeting was held on November 16, 1989, in Forth Worth, Texas, to discuss both notices (54 FR 41986). All interested persons have been given an opportunity to participate in this rulemaking and due consideration has been given to all matters presented. Some minor editorial changes have been made to clarify the proposals. The changes are based on comments received and further FAA review of the proposals. Except as indicated herein, the proposals contained in the notice have been adopted without change. Discussion of Comments The commenters represented airframe manufacturers, airworthiness authorities from other countries, rotorcraft owners and operators, and private individuals. The commenters generally agree with the substance of the proposal with certain recommended changes. The following discussion addresses these recommendations and their disposition. Sections 27.923 and 29.923␣Rotor Drive System and Control Mechanism Tests The notice proposed changes to §§27.923(e) and 29.923 (a) and (b) that add the special tests to the rotor drive system endurance test schedule, which are necessary to qualify the rotor drive system for the new 30-second/2-minute OEI power ratings. One commenter, referring to §§27.923(e)(2)(i) and 29.923(e)(3)(i), states that if the 5-minute takeoff power run to qualify the drive system is conducted as part of the endurance run, and the 30-second/2-minute OEI requirements are conducted on a bench test, then the takeoff power 5-minute run will be conducted twice on the same set of gears. The commenter proposes that the wording for the bench testing requirements be changed to state ``*␣*␣* following stabilization at takeoff power.'' The FAA does not intend to duplicate the takeoff power 5-minute run and agrees that clarification is needed; therefore, the recommended change has been incorporated. Another commenter recommends doubling the test time in §29.923(b)(3)(i) because the drive system, at the higher and potentially more damaging 30-second/2-minute OEI power ratings, will be substantiated by less endurance testing at these new powers. This recommendation is beyond the scope of the notice. Further, the FAA disagrees with the recommendation to double the test time for drive system substantiation because the test time proposed for the new 30-second/2-minute OEI power ratings is more severe than the current OEI ratings, when considering expected usage. The test time was established based upon the proportionate duration of load applications during these test runs when compared with the expected service life of the rotor drive system. In addition, the test time was also based upon the statistical failure rate of turboshaft engines and three applications of 30-second/2-minute OEI power during the expected life of the drive system. The relationship between test time and anticipated OEI exposure in service is more severe by a factor of 2.64 for the new OEI ratings. Another commenter proposes removing the words `` *␣*␣* when engine limitations either preclude repeated use of this power or would result in premature engine removal *␣*␣*'' from §§27.923(e)(2)(iii) and 29.923(b)(3)(iii). The FAA disagrees because the preferred method of conducting the tests is on the rotorcraft where the entire drive system is subjected to the OEI powers. Since the FAA recognizes that in some cases it may not be possible to conduct these tests on the rotorcraft, a bench test, which is representative of the aircraft, is included as an acceptable alternative. Another commenter proposes to clarify §§27.923(e)(2)(iii) and 29.923(b)(3)(iii) by inserting the word ``vibration'' between the words ``the'' and ``frequency.'' The FAA agrees, and the change has been made. Other than some minor editorial changes, these amendments are adopted as discussed. Sections 27.1143 and 29.1143␣Engine Controls The notice proposed to include the requirement for automatic control of the 30-second OEI power in §§27.1143(e) and 29.1143(f). One commenter suggests that §29.1143(f) is ambiguous in that it does not adequately define the meaning of ``control.'' The FAA agrees that additional clarification is necessary. The amendment now states ``*␣*␣* automatically activate and control the 30-second OEI power and prevent *␣*␣*.'' Other than this clarification, the amendments are adopted as proposed. Sections 27.1305 and 29.1305␣Powerplant Instruments The notice proposed to include the requirements for a pilot alert and a recording device when 30-second/2-minute OEI powers are used by adding paragraphs (t) and (u) to §27.1305 and paragraphs (a) (24) and (25) to §29.1305.
