Such proteins may be used as a catalytic component of immunotoxins if they are connected with proteins capable of recognizing specific receptors of eukaryotic cells. Hybrid proteins, which contain, in addition to fragments of endotoxin A, either a fragment of protein A of staphylococcus or interleukin-2 were used to create proteins which may be used as the catalytic components of immunotoxins or as already pepared immunotoxin. Analysis of the stability of these hybrid proteins and their derivatives showed that all the hybrid proteins except one proved to be stable in E. coli cells. Figures 5; references 18 Western.
