Though, according to our Foreign Office, the visit is part of routine tours that the Congressmen undertake to areas of their interest during the Congressional recess, given the intensity of the United States' renewed focus on the nuclear non-proliferation issue, it is not hard to figure out that the point of their interest in this case is to bring around Pakistan to a rollback of its nuclear programme. On our part, successive governments have repeatedly made it clear to the U.S. that they would be willing to sign the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] provided India agrees to a simultaneous ratification of the treaty or accepts Pakistan's proposal for a five-nation conference to achieve a regional non-proliferation regime. There is no ambiguity whatsoever in this country's stance on the issue that may need further clarifications or elaboration. And on the other side too, Sen. Pressler has continued to stick to his guns in subjecting this country to a discriminatory law of which he himself is the author. In fact he came visiting a couple of years ago also but that did not help him to see things in a fair and rational perspective. One wonders what more can Pakistan tell him about its position on the nuclear issue, or he to Pakistan on where he stands, that this nation already does not know through his consistent criticism of its nuclear programme and a punitive law that denies it eligibility to U.S. aid in some important defence equipment. Hence when Pressler comes again, along with some other members of the Congress, there is little the two sides can be expected to add to each other's knowledge on the chief issue of contention between them. The one hope for optimism in the visit though may be that the Senator might have learnt something from the failure of his efforts at forcing this country into accepting what is unjustifiable by any standards of fairness. Then there is also the fact that face-to-face meeting among people tend to help them better understand each other's points of view. In that respect discussions with the other members of his delegation may lead to a productive exchange, and Sen. Pressler, having realised the futility of his exercise against Pakistan, might also be willing this time around to listen with an open mind and revise his position vis-a-vis both India and Pakistan. Other than this hope, there is not much that can be expected to come out of the Congressional visit.
