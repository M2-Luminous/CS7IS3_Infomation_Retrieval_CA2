As long as there is a war existing there are dangers existent and the main loser is the Yemeni people. He clarified that our infrastructure is subjected to destruction and that those who are imposing war on us now have no cause, emphasizing that we have a cause for which we are struggling and that we are owners of the right. This came in a press interview held by the AL-KHALIJ newspaper of the United Arab Emirates with Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the chairman of the Presidential Council, and published in its issue dated 5 June. He clarified that what is going on in Yemen today is not a Yemeni issue only. The project that collided with the unity project and spoiled it is another project connected to many projects and how can we explain that Iran was displeased by the UN Security Council's resolution concerning Yemen? He added that the issue now is the issue of the Gulf states, the stability of the people, and the interests of these countries. Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid went on to say: The others are trying to impose the Gulf crisis on us, but [words indistinct] its expansion to another region in the south of the Arabian Peninsula. In his reply to a question about published information mentioning that there are Jordanian airplanes which are providing Sanaa with weapons and ammunition, Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: Yes, there is information about this matter. In the beginning I did not believe it, but when we followed up the matter we got sure about it. I did not expect this stand from Jordan. It is me who went to King Husayn to help us in reaching a solution and mediation. I had not expected this. I had not wanted King Husayn's stand to be heard, but this is their state policy. This is their own concern. About the relations of the Democratic Republic of Yemen with the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the chairman of the Presidential Council said: We created here a state which wants stability. I consider it in the first defense line of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. We are seeking stability and he who seeks stability continues as a defense line for all those who seek stability anywhere.
