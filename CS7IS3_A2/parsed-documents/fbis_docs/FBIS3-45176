However, at the same time, the economy has also swiftly started to move toward overheating. Our aim in looking back at and analyzing past fluctuations is to be better able to understand China's economic structure at present by comparing it with that of the past. We want to see which aspects have seen change and which aspects have not yet seen change, so that we can, in a targeted way, adopt effective policies for macroeconomic stability. 5.1--"Already changed" and "not changed" First, we should recognize that as compared to 1987-88, our country's economic structure has seen many positive changes: 1) There has been further development of the non-state-owned economy, and such entities now account for over 50 percent of gross industrial output value and GNP. These are economic entities which are oriented toward the market and have strong self-restraint. They thus play a positive role in stabilizing the economy. 2) There has been a further expansion of opening up to the outside, there has been a great increase in investment of foreign funds, imports and exports have been further expanded and price increases have, in many areas (such as steel products and other production materials) already been subject to the restraints of international market prices. 3) All sorts of markets have seen further development. While in some markets, such as the share market, the real estate market,and the securities market, there has been some chaos (especially because of the "speculation using public funds" engaged in in some markets by state-owned and semi-state-owned companies), in the end, however, these still provide more investment avenues and play a role in holding down the expansion of consumer demand and in encouraging the accumulation of capital. All of these aspects have played a stabilizing role in regard to macroeconomic movement. However, solely on this basis or on the basis of the phenomenon of "market weakness" which appeared during the two previous years of tightening up, holding that China's economic structure has undergone a "basic change," and that there has been a change from "resource constraint" to "demand constraint" (see Guo Shu-qing, 1992) is a bit premature. China's economic structure has not yet seen basic changes in the following two major areas: 1. The basic structure of the state-owned economic sector has not yet seen change, and the soft budgetary restraints of the local governments and state-owned enterprises and the various operational modes based on these (including the response modes to the many economic "policy variables") have not yet seen basic change. 2. The leading position of the state-owned economy has still not changed. This can be explained through the following two aspects: 1) While the state-owned economy no longer constitutes the majority in terms of output value or national income, the state-owned economy still occupies the dominant position in terms of expenditure and total demand. Here the key question is: When the bank savings from the various economic sectors are transferred into credit, they mainly flow through the state banking system to state-owned economic sectors (at present, it is estimated that this is the case for more than 80 percent of the total), while the credit issued to town and township enterprises only constitutes a very small part. In this way, the operational sectors, which only constitute a small part of the income structure, through the savings-credit link, come to constitute a large part in the expenditure structure, and particularly investment expenditure. Seen from the situation of enterprise direct financing, the state-owned enterprises have quite weak restraints, and quite great "nerve," and the funds they draw in are naturally quite great. 2) The state-owned economy is mainly centered in national economic lifeblood sectors such as light and heavy industry, energy, and mining. Thus, the guiding role that it plays in the national economy has not changed. 3) Based on the above two points, that which determines the changes in economic fluctuations in our country at present is still the various state-owned economic sectors. Town and township enterprises and the private economy have seen quite high growth rates since 1990. However, as they are mainly centered in consumer product processing industries, commerce, and service industries, they only play a role in maintaining the supply of consumer products, and they cannot spur the revival of the overall economy. Only when the state-owned economy "revives" will the overall economy be gradually enlivened. A prominent point in this is that not only does investment by state-owned sectors still constitutes a large part (over 60 percent) of overall social investment, but the expansion of investment by the state-owned economy (whole-people ownership investment) still plays, as it did in the various previous economic fluctuations, a leading role and a decisive role in overall economic recovery. 4) In financial income, the profits and taxes which derive from state-owned enterprises still constitute the major part. As the financial balance situation plays an extremely important role in the formulation of macroeconomic policies, the operational situation of state-owned economic sectors still plays a decisive role in overall macroeconomic changes. For example, sectors will not dare or are not willing to adopt various policies to restrain the expansion of credit or growth of demand (such as by raising credit interest rates), just so that they can ensure that the profits and taxes handed up by state-owned enterprises do not decline or their losses do not further expand. 5.2--A new round of handing down power and financial chaos Under the precondition of the "no changes" noted above, since the beginning of 1992, following the further expansion of the autonomy of localities and enterprises, and the intensification of decentralized "competition under soft constraints," elements of economic instability have seen a further increase rather than a reduction. Of these elements, the two "autonomies" noted below have been particularly important in macroeconomic instability and accelerating the pace of economic overheating: 1. Autonomy in terms of examining and approving investment projects has been completely handed down. This has led to a very great increase in investment by localities themselves (for example, some data show that 82.7 percent of newly commenced projects involving whole-people ownership investment over the period January to May 1992 were local projects). Also, there has been a great increase in fixed-asset investment. Over the period January to May 1993, there was a growth of 70.7 percent over the same period of the previous year in state-owned fixed-asset investment. This is a "high speed" rarely seen previously. 2. "Autonomy in terms of direct financing." This is a very important autonomy which has been obtained by local governments and enterprises, as it enables them to avoid central government measures to control (directly or indirectly) credit and money. They raise funds directly in society by paying interest rates much higher than bank savings deposit interest rates. This results in government money policies losing their effectiveness. In 1992, the total value of various types of negotiable securities on China's securities market was 128 billion yuan. Of these, state bonds were valued at 41 billion yuan, the investment bonds of the various state investment companies under the State Planning Commission totaled 12.7 billion yuan, enterprise bonds totaled 37.9 billion yuan, financial bonds totaled 25.5 billion yuan and shares totaled 10.9 billion yuan. The above-mentioned securities are all quite regular and the amounts issued can be ascertained through statistics. If we add to these the shares issued within enterprises, the raising of funds outside the plans, the sale of urban household registration in order to raise funds and other "nonstandard" securities issues, according to an estimate by the headquarters of the People's Bank of China, the total value would be about 270 billion yuan. At the end of 1992, the outstanding balance of securities monitored by statistics in our country was 410 billion yuan. Seen from the proportion between direct financing and indirect financing, excluding the 25.5 billion yuan of financial bonds, in 1992 the total volume of direct financing throughout our country was 194.5 billion yuan. This was equivalent to 54.6 percent of the increase in state bank credit in that year (356.3 billion yuan). It was also equivalent to 46 percent of the increase in credit issued by financial organs (including state banks, credit and investment organs and urban and rural credit cooperatives) throughout the country in that year (422.8 billion yuan). The proportion of the year's newly increased total financing constituted by newly increased direct financing rose from 12 percent in 1991 to 31.5 percent in 1992. This means that changes have occurred in the mechanism for transforming our country's savings into investment. However, it also shows that the effectiveness of some of the current macroeconomic money regulation and control measures is being further weakened. (For the various data noted above, see Xie Ping, 1993) The handing down of such autonomy clearly exacerbates the "competition under soft constraints" under the decentralized state-owned economy and increases economic instability. It is thus inevitably linked with chaos in the financial sphere. Our economy has, since the beginning of 1992, not only entered a new round of fluctuation basically the same as those in the past, but has also entered a new round of high-speed growth which is faster than that in the past. The fact that the economy has, even more quickly, seen the appearance of "overheating" illustrates this point very clearly. The current question is which policies the government should adopt in order to counteract this instability so as to ensure that the degree of fluctuation is the smallest possible. 6. The Current Countermeasure Thinking for Macroeconomic Stability: `Dual-Track Regulation and Control' On the basis of the analysis above of the economic fluctuations in the eighties and the effectiveness of the various macroeconomic stability (retrenchment) policies, and in accordance with the analysis above of the current economic structural situation and the structural causes for the new round of high-speed economic growth, we can put forward the following lines of thought on countermeasures. 6.1--Gradual reform and macroeconomic regulation and control In the current process of choosing policies for macroeconomic stability, we have to first clarify the following major issues: First, at present, the issues we need to clarify, especially on the level of understanding, are: 1) The effectiveness of different macroeconomic regulatory and control policies depends on different economic structural conditions, especially on the "microeconomic base" of the economy. 2) We must develop a market economy, but our current economic structure is still not a market economy, while the "microeconomic base" of macroeconomic operation is far from the "microeconomic base" of a market economy. Thus, many macroeconomic stability policies which are effective under market economy conditions are, under current structural conditions, actually unable to play an effective role. This is prominently manifested by the fact that the state-owned economic sectors, which are still to a large degree dependent for their operation on administrative links at present, can only be restrained through the use of administrative measures, and in a situation where localities and enterprises still lack internal self-restraint mechanisms, it is still necessary to retain a certain amount of external restraint. Each economic structure has its own special logic, and this cannot be violated. At present, we want to put great effort into developing a market economy structure. However, this mainly requires that we put effort into structural reform, and especially into transforming the economic base of the economy (this we will analyze below). It does not mean that at present we can completely change the "policies" and "measures" by which the economy is managed. If, at present, we blindly use market economy macroeconomic policies, which have not yet seen obvious results, to manage our economy, it will not really be beneficial to the development of the economy and will not be a real act of "marketization." Second, structural reform is a process which requires quite a long period of time to see results, while macroeconomic regulation and control is a near-term problem of "overall demand management." The two must not be confused. Thus, the claim that "through deepening reform, we can achieve macroeconomic stability at present" is an idea which may sound correct, but is not. Reform must be intensified, and this is particularly so at present. However, prior to the completion of the reforms, we still face the problem of how, under the current set structural conditions, we are to carry out macroeconomic regulation and control. The correct statement is that "through deepening reform, we can achieve long-term economic stability." Third, although our economy is not yet a complete market economy, it is no longer completely a planned economy. Rather, it is in a changeover stage as it makes the transition from the old structure to the new structure. Its basic characteristic is a "structural dual track." China has adopted a "gradual" mode for its reforms. The basic characteristic of this mode of structural change is: It does not suddenly destroy the vested interests formed under the old structure. Rather, in the early period of reform, it appropriately maintains the vested interests, so as to reduce the social obstructions faced by the reforms. Thus, the overall process of economic reform does not involve first destroying the old structure, but rather involves first developing new structural components at the "side" or in the "cracks" of the old structure. Following the development of the new structural components, and the expansion of the proportions which they constitute in the overall economy, there will be gradual deepening of the transformation of the old structure. This mode of reform will naturally mean that the process of reform is characterized by "dual-track transition." That is to say, for quite a long period there will a situation where the new and the old systems and the two types of economic components coexist. The new structure will have been partially formed, but the old structure will continue to exist and its absolute scale may even continue to grow. The two types of structures will continue to play roles in the economy, but after a certain period of transition, the change from the old structure to the new structure will be completed for the overall economy. The "dual-track transition" can be said to be the basic form of the "gradual mode of reform." Here, "dual-track transition" not only refers to a "dual-track pricing system," but also means "dual-track property rights" and many other types of specific dual-track structures. We can see that during the process of our country's economic structural reforms, in every sphere there will exist this "dual-track transition" form. When components from the different types of structures coexist in the same economy, it is inevitable that there will be mutual restraints and that they will play a role regarding each other. Also, the activity mode of each will inevitably affect the other. However, as the basic operational mechanisms of the two structures are different and, in the end, they differ in terms of their activity modes, their reactions when facing the same kinds of economic changes, government policies and external pummelling will also be different. This then produces the macroeconomic management level question of how to adopt different policy measures to carry out regulation and control in respect of the different economic components. Thus, during the period of structural transition, the realization of an appropriate structural dual track clearly requires that the macroeconomic regulation and control measures are themselves also "dual-track." By using only one method, it will not be possible to achieve the hoped-for results. This is prominently manifested in the fact that actually, at present, we do not have any macroeconomic regulatory and control measures, either direct or indirect, "market-driven" or "administrative," "monetary" or "planning" measures, which can very effectively carry out regulation and control of the overall economy. However, on the other hand, none of the current regulatory and control measures are completely useless. They all have a role to play to a certain degree and over a certain range. This requires that we "comprehensively" utilize the various types of measures, so that we can carry out "comprehensive regulation and control" of the economy. (Fan Gang, 1992) 6.2--"Dual-track regulation and control" "Comprehensive regulation and control" will, during the period of "dual-track transition," be specifically manifested as "dual-track regulation and control." The basic line of thinking on this is as follows. On the one hand, in respect of the non-state-owned economy, it means using indirect regulatory and control policies which have already begun to show a certain effect, such as monetary policies and taxation policies. In particular, we must strengthen the use of interest rates. Even though the state-owned economic sectors will not at present be sensitive to this, we already have a quite large non-state-owned economy which is quite sensitive to interest rates (when other conditions remain the same, personal savings always react to interest rates), and the other types of indirect regulatory and control policies have also already shown themselves to be quite effective in these areas. In another respect, in regulating and controlling the state-owned economic sectors which are at present still maintained through reliance on administrative links, we should continue to use direct administrative control measures to a certain degree. In particular, we must, in a timely way, directly control investment activities and consumption of public funds. In the analysis above, we have already seen that at present, only direct measures are effective measures for controlling the scale of final demand in a decentralized state-ownership economy. At the same time, we should appropriately strengthen management and control over the issue of securities and direct financing by local governments and state-owned enterprises. (There is no need to excessively intervene in the direct financing activities of non-state-owned enterprises. It is only necessary to strengthen the establishment and implementation of regulations.) The basic line of thinking is that in respect of economic activity principals which have not yet formed internal self-restraint mechanisms, we must maintain necessary external restraints. At the same time, we should not implement excessively tight regulatory and control measures in respect of credit. Under current structural conditions, if we implement excessively tight credit controls (reducing the scale of planned credit), it will basically be a uniform administrative control on financing, and that may produce a quite strong "counter-choice" reaction--a reaction whereby credit which should be blocked is not really subject to much restraint, while that which should not be stopped is the first to bear the brunt of the measures. For example, as soon as there is excessive tightening up on funds, the state-owned enterprises which do not have good results or which incur losses can still use new credit to maintain their existence. However, profitable enterprises with deposits fall into difficulties when funds are blocked, and they are unable to even draw on their own funds. Thus, their potential cannot be brought into play. The non-state-owned enterprises which originally had difficulty obtaining credit find it even more difficult to obtain funds, their development is restricted, and so on. In the process of marketization, we need not feel a "taboo" about continuing to use "administrative measures" for direct control. However, we must particularly ensure that we do not implement "uniform"-type administrative controls over the entire economy. More importantly, we should not implement administrative management over the non-state-owned economy. Seen from the relationship between macroeconomic regulation and control and the marketization reforms, a major advantage of "dual-track regulation and control" is that it manages that which should be managed and only regulates that which should be freed. It does not manage these two things together. This is beneficial to having the overall economy make the transition toward the "single-track" of the market economy, and finally abandoning administrative measures. Doing things in this way is actually beneficial rather than disadvantageous to the development of the market economy. 6.3--"Retaining some things and discarding others": How to develop the market mechanism in the current process of readjusting financial order The aim of "dual-track regulation and control" is not to maintain the existing economic structure and the administrative measures for intervening in the economy. Rather, it is intended for better making the transition to the market economy. Thus, during the period of transition, in the process of carrying out "dual-track regulation and control" of the economy, it is very important that we should clarify what we should give up and what we should put great efforts into developing. In the early period, the main problem in macroeconomic stability will be chaos in the financial market, and there is a need to engage in readjustment, including the use of administrative measures to implement necessary restraints. However, in the process of readjusting the financial market, it is also necessary to avoid the practice of "implementing in a uniform way." Rather, we should "retain some things and give up others." Specifically, there are problems in two areas to which we should pay attention: First, we should avoid the complete abolition of the "secondary funds market." For example, at the same time as handling the problem of inter-borrowing of funds, we should consider how to better develop a funds market. A major element by which the reform of our country's financial structure lags behind the reforms in other spheres is that we have not, in a timely way, implemented in the financial sector a "dual-track interest rate system" which is in accord with the law and which is subject to state supervision and management. Interest rates are the price of funds use. Over the last few years, in our country's product markets, many prices have, after making the transition through a long period of the "dual-track system," been gradually freed, and the reform of marketization has been realized. However, in respect of interest rates, it is still the case that the state sets the prices. The result of this is not that we have not seen the appearance of "dual-track pricing," but rather that we have not seen clearly priced "dual-track pricing" which is "in accordance with the law," which is subject to state management, and from which the interest income goes to the state rather than into the pockets of private individuals. What have appeared are "black markets" and "gray markets" for funds, as well as "official speculation in funds" and "financial corruption." Thus, here there actually exists the problem of how to squarely face the objective laws of the development of things and intensify "price reform" in the funds market. Over the last few years, in the financial sector, the area in which regulation through market mechanism has played a major role has been inter-borrowing funds. The inter-borrowing funds market is actually to a certain degree equivalent to the development of a nonstandardized funds market which is not subject to management, and is outside the traditional credit system in which interest rates are difficult to change and credit is subject to planning controls. To a certain degree, this forms another price for credit funds. At present, many non-state-owned companies and enterprises find it difficult to obtain credit under the state credit plans, and thus they can only obtain their funds through various forms of "inter-borrowing." In this sphere, because many things are "not in accordance with the law" and there is a lack of effective supervision, there exists great chaos. For example, a large part of interest rate differentials flows into the pockets of individuals. A large part of inter-borrowing funds is used by some state-owned or semi-state-owned financial and real estate companies, which have special links with banks, to invest in the securities and real estate markets. However, in the final analysis, through this avenue some funds are deployed by the market to production sectors where interest rates are quite high. Thus, at present, on the one hand we must readjust the funds market, so as to stop illegal inter-borrowing, and "uncouple" some companies from banks, while on the other hand we have to consider how to develop an "interest rate dual-track system" which accords with the law and is subject to supervision and management. We must not simply recover the "inter-borrowing funds," again institute firm and unchanging interest rates, and forcibly return to the "single planning track" which has been proved by practice to be ineffective and not feasible. If we continue to institute unitary "planned interest rates," and the rates never float, the result will inevitably be the re-emergence of "gray markets" and corruption. As compared to this, it would be better to first let the interest rates for some funds "legitimately" move in accordance with market prices, and appropriately allow some bank funds to be loaned out "beyond the plans" at market interest rates. This would be like when we initially allowed enterprises to have the prices of some of their products set by the market, and they were free to sell them at those prices. This will not only be beneficial to the effective use of funds, and beneficial to the reform of the financial system, but will also be beneficial to the development of the non-state-owned economy. Having credit funds subject to unified central control and managing them very tightly will not injure the state-owned enterprises. They are always "guaranteed funds come rain or shine." The ones to feel the brunt of such measures will certainly be the various types of non-state-owned economy operations. Even initially they had a hard time getting anything from the "credit plans" basket. If the financing avenues outside the plans are abolished, their development will certainly suffer seriously. This will be very disadvantageous to the growth and development of our country's market economy mechanism and to the sustained development of the overall economy (the development of the market economy and economic growth over the last 10-plus years have mainly depended on the development of various forms of non-state-owned economy operations). Second, in the process of readjusting the financial market, we should strengthen management over non-state-owned, nongovernment financial organs (cooperative and shareholding-type credit organizations and banks, as well as private banks). However, we should not restrict their development. On the contrary, in order to further develop the market economy, we should adopt more open policies, and allow and encourage the development of non-state-owned financial organs. In the view of the authors, in terms of the process of reform of the financial structure, an aspect which is lagging behind at present is the development of non-state-owned, nongovernment financial organs. Up to now, the measures adopted have been to restrict rather than to encourage nongovernment financial organs. Thus, while, in the overall economy, the national income created by the various forms of non-state-owned economic entities has already reached 50 percent of gross national income, in financial activities, the proportion constituted by nongovernment financial organs is still very small, and the figure is not commensurate with the development of the overall non-state-owned economy. A major excuse given for restricting the development of nongovernment financial organs is that these financial organs will "cause chaos to normal financial order." The problem, however, lies in what is meant by "normal financial order." In the financial sphere, the most basic and most important order is "requiring repayment of monies borrowed." It is on this point, we are afraid, that the nongovernment financial organs are the greatest respecters of "normal order." It is difficult to imagine a nongovernment bank continually approving loans to an enterprise which is a heavy loss-maker and which fails to repay repeated loans. Is it not on this point that our state-owned banks are those with the greatest disrespect for "normal order"? The problems are which order do we want to maintain? Do we want to establish a new order which is in accord with the patterns of the market economy? Developing nongovernment financial organs does not mean that we should abandon management of financial order by the government and the state-owned central bank. On the contrary, the development of the nongovernment financial organs will be of benefit in strengthening such management and making it more effective. In fact, the central bank has great difficulty in implementing effective management of the various state-owned commercial banks. The reason for this lies in the fact that the central bank and state-owned commercial banks, like state-owned enterprises and the various levels of local government, are all state-owned, and none of them can say to the others that they alone "have authority." They all have a thousand ways in which to "finance" their needs. However, the central bank, representing the state, can exercise management over nongovernment financial organs. This is relatively easier and more effective, the interests of the two sides are clearly demarcated, and the monetary regulation and control measures of the central bank will be more authoritarian. In market economy countries around the world, it is the central bank which controls non-state-owned commercial banks, and the effectiveness of government monetary policies is built on this basis. Why do we consider that allowing the development of nongovernment financial organs will result in great chaos? In the early period of the development of nongovernment financial organs, because of the supersession of the old system by the new, it will be difficult to avoid some confusion, but through perfecting laws and strengthening management it will be possible to ensure that the new structure and the new order are gradually established. However, if we do not allow the development of nongovernment financial organs, it will not be possible to establish a new order and it will not be possible for the government to gradually learn through practice how to manage nongovernment financial organs. This will result in our always lagging behind in financial structure reform. In the early period of the development of our non-state-owned production enterprises, there were also many problems, leading to many people accusing them of harming "normal economic order." However, what they were actually doing was playing an important and positive role in breaking down the old traditional planning structure and order, in establishing a new market economy structure and order, and in accelerating economic development. The basic experiences of our reforms of gradual marketization over the last 10-plus years have involved: 1) Using a "dual-track pricing system" to break down and gradually replace the old planning structure; 2) through developing the non-state-owned economy, changing the property rights structure of the overall economy, forming more market activity principals, and, through a "structural dual track," making the transition to a market economy. The reason our market economy has been able to take embryonic form and the reason our economy has been able to maintain a growth momentum during the reforms is that we have relied on these two aspects. In the current process of deepening the reform of the financial structure, we cannot forget these two precious experiences of our "gradual mode of reform." 6.4--The basic route for achieving long-term stability: Speeding the pace of property rights reform As far as long-term stability is concerned, we not only must actively carry out reform of the banking structure, the financial structure and the macroeconomic management system, but also need to step up and deepen reform in other aspects. In particular, we need to intensify reform in terms of property rights relations in the state-owned economy. The 15-year history of our reform and opening up has shown that as far as the state-owned economy is concerned, purely "handing down power and allowing retention of profits," while not carrying out reform of ownership relations, cannot resolve the problem of macroeconomic stability. Our current economic instability is, to a great degree, due to the "handing down of power and allowing retention of profits" in a situation where there has been no reform of ownership relations in the state ownership economy. The result is that localities and enterprises have the "right" to seek their own interests, but there is still no one who will take real responsibility for capital losses, the "budgetary restraints" have still not been "firmed," and the relationship between the government and enterprises has not seen any essential change. The so-called "sluggishness in financial reform" is actually due to the sluggishness of property rights reform in the state-owned economy, which in turn "drags back" financial reform. The situations in various respects show that we have already reached the stage where we have to accelerate reform centered on property rights. Reform of property rights relationships has become a pressing issue. Some property rights reform measures which are feasible and where we should begin at present include: Clarifying the specific ownership representatives or ownership principals for state-owned assets (including land); through legislation, clearly setting down the scope and volume of state-owned assets; and appropriately defining and distinguishing central ownership rights and local ownership rights. After this, we should widely promote the "company corporatization" of state-owned enterprises and, in the majority of state-run enterprises, implement a system by which state assets are converted into shares, so as to turn them into limited liability companies (not necessarily "listed companies"). Through this mode, we will be able to clearly define and quantify the property rights relationships of state-owned enterprises. Thereby, we will ensure that property rights in respect of state-owned assets are quantified property rights which can be divided, which can be traded and which can be transferred. This will create beneficial conditions for the further stable reform of ownership relations in future in accordance with the demands of the market economy and in accordance with the demands of efficiency standards. The property rights relations of the state-owned economy need to be reformed, while within the non- state-owned economy there also exist problems such as property rights not being protected, property rights not being clear and so on. These problems also need to be resolved through reform. In this aspect at present, we should set about the following work: Protecting property rights and encouraging various types of private investment, so that the various types of non-state-owned economic entities see more healthy and more stable development, so as to reduce the extravagant consumption and the large-scale outflow of national capital which have already appeared, and so as to speed the accumulation of social capital. In town and township enterprises and the various types of cooperative and collective economy operations at present, there exists in very many cases the problem of property rights relationships not being clear, and this has already affected the development of the economy and the accumulation of capital. Thus, we should speed the reform of property rights. The main route at present is through promoting, in the collective economy, the "shareholding cooperative system" which has emerged in practice, to ensure that the collective property rights of the past, which previously could not be divided and could not be traded, become divisible and capable of being traded. Theoretical analysis and practical experiences have both proved that if we do not start out with reform of basic economic relationships, and do not reform the activity modes of state-owned enterprises and local governments, so as to form market economy mechanisms, we will never be able to break free from the cycle in which "relaxation gives rise to chaos and taking back power results in stagnation," those indirect regulatory measures which have proved effective in market economies will never be adopted in our economy, and we will never achieve the hoped-for results.
