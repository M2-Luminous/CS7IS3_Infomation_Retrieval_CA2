Success at home was key for his presidency for, he virtually decimated George Bush on the promise of change. President Bush had realized rather late the depth of craving among his people for change, and did initiate certain moves for an economic recovery. Mr. Clinton had reaped the benefits of those measures, being in a position today to claim that during his year in office budget deficit has been slashed down heavily. A U.S. government release on the occasion makes particular mention of the President's success in smoothly getting on with Congress for legislative purposes, and refers to legislation ranging from Family and Medical Leave Act and Health Care Reform to the Brady Bill that seeks to control the proliferation of handguns among citizens. No doubt Mr. Clinton has not made empty claims on his domestic agenda, and the inevitable approval rating after his first year in the White House is bound to show that it has jumped up appreciably since it dipped to a precarious 38 percent soon after his assumption of office. But how has Mr. Clinton fared in foreign policy? The advantage he enjoyed over Mr. Bush, who had neglected the home front, could not have seen him through in the conduct of the United States as the world's only super power. The way his foreign policymakers messed up things in Somalia and Haiti and considerably lowered U.S. prestige in Bosnia could not but claim Defence Secretary Les Aspin. If Secretary of State Warren Christopher is still around, it is not for lack of suggestions for his removal, but because Mr. Clinton hopes the newly-inducted second in command, Mr. Strobe Talbott, would make up for lost ground through his expert handling of Russia. But Yeltsin's Russia at the feet of the U.S. cannot possibly add many more feathers to America's foreign policy crown. Mr. Clinton may rely more on subjects specially dear to his heart, such as human rights. However, it is noticeable that an Asian voice has been increasingly asserting itself against Western definitions of human rights. After China, India and Malaysia, it is now Singapore which has rejected the West's concept of what constitutes human rights. As others feel the pinch they will speak out, and the rejection will extend to Western positions other than human rights, to equitable trade relations, transfer of technology, and non-proliferation of nuclear capability. The trouble with the Clinton Administration is that its idea of restructuring the world in the international order is largely confined to what happens in the West and its poor cousins in central and eastern Europe. For the rest, the medicine must remain the same as during the cold war -- the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, missiles technology control regime, trade restrictions, and human rights.
