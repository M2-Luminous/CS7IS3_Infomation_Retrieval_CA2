FBIS3-50421 "dreeu020_p_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-020 Document Type:Daily Report 31 Jan 1994 POLAND Kawalec, Borowski Comment LD2901232694 Warsaw TV Polonia Network in Polish 1830 GMT 29 Jan 94 LD2901232694 Warsaw TV Polonia Network Language: Polish Article Type:BFN [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak has presented Stefan Kawalec the document dismissing him from the post of deputy minister of finance. The reason, according to the prime minister, was the work of the deputy minister in its entirety, and in particular the methods of privatization of the banks and reform of the insurance system. These clarifications did not satisfy Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and minister of finance, who did not grant his consent to the dismissal of his deputy minister. [Unidentified correspondent] The government press office reported the dismissal of Stefan Kawalec yesterday. Marek Borowski, the direct superior of the deputy minister, expressed surprise and requested a clarification of the reasons for this decision. This morning, Waldemar Pawlak invited deputy minister Kawalec for a meeting. [Begin recording] [Kawalec] The prime minister handed me my dismissal. He informed me that Minister Borowski had not consented to this dismissal, which is why the prime minister took the decision independently. The prime minister told me that the cause is an evaluation of my work in the Ministry of Finance, inter alia the concepts for privatization of banks and insurance societies. [Correspondent] Did this reply satisfy you? [Borowski] No, of course it does not satisfy me, since no analysis of the work of Deputy Minister Kawalec was actually carried out. For matters to be clear, I here neither defend him nor attack him. I myself addressed the Supreme Chamber of Control with a request for an inspection. I feel that it was not appropriate to make such a decision before the results of an inspection. [Correspondent] Marek Borowski requested the prime minister to give a wider justification for this decision in writing by Tuesday. Waldemar Pawlak said that the document is already ready. [Pawlak] I quite simply do not wish to reveal the details before it is received by Deputy Prime Minister Borowski. [end recording] [Announcer] In the prime minister's view, the dismissal of Deputy Minister Kawalec will not be the cause of any sort of troubles within the government coalition. [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Have you in this situation considered the possibility of resigning, and if so in what circumstances? [Borowski] Well, unfortunately, this question I must leave without comment, and without reply at this moment. [Correspondent] But is it appropriate to expect such a reply, and if so when? [Borowski] As I said, I am waiting until Tuesday, for the prime minister's reply . [Correspondent] Stefan Kawalec, dismissed today, had held his post for four years. He was one of the closest colleagues of Leszek Balcerowicz. Among other things, he undertook the negotiation of the reduction of our foreign debt and the introduction of the convertibility of the zloty. He was also responsible for the reform of the banking system. Most recently, he supervised the privatization of the Bank Slaski. [end recording]
