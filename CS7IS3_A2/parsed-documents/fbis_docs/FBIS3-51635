The body has informed the public, via a press release, that informal meetings have taken place between members of its technical office in charge of organizing the national conference and several political personalities of the country, who have decided to work for the success of this inter-Haitian summit under the auspices of the most representative sectors of the civil society. This week CARENA has invited the Parliament to take into account the upcoming resolutions of the national conference in Haiti and to get in touch with the United Nations and the OAS in order to request of the UN Security Council an immediate halt to the plan to reinforce the new sanctions against Haiti. Regarding this subject, a fruitful conversation has taken place between the members of the committee and the head of the French diplomatic mission to Haiti, Charge d'Affaires (Philippe Seltz), who has promised to pass this request on to his government. He showed himself particularly interested in the holding of this national conference in Haiti. The United States, Venezuela, and Canada have shown the same interest and received similar requests from the committee in order to stop any actions by international organizations which could aggravate the situation in Haiti. The entire General Staff of the Haitian Armed Forces received the CARENA members, discussed the plan, and asked pertinent questions, while encouraging this objective and unbiased initiative of the key sectors of civil society, with no preconditions. By the way, a letter has been sent to President Aristide and to resigning Prime Minister Robert Malval for them to send a representative of the executive to this conference. A national conference appears to be an urgent subject for both sides, says CARENA. On that basis, the CARENA members deem it necessary today to ask all invited sectors to inform them of the names of their delegates by writing to the office of the national conference at the Holiday Inn in Champ-de-Mars. This note is signed by Attorney Fritz Bissereth, coordinator in charge of the technical office; Attorney Bruny Raphael, coordinator in charge of the administrative affairs; and Adyjeangardy, coordinator in charge of communications.
