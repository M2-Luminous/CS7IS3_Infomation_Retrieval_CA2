Zimbabwe is a better analogy than Angola or Mozambique. In Angola and Mozambique the Portuguese troops -- and the police structures -- withdrew almost overnight (as in the earlier Belgian Congo), leaving a power vacuum. Looting and disorder took over, then civil war. Portuguese civilians fled with what they could carry. In Zimbabwe, Ian Smith's police and army stayed in place. The transition was orderly and the army later integrated with guerilla forces. Some of the white civilian population chose to stay on, many today enjoying a lifestyle barely distinguishable from before. South Africa is in the grip of social and political upheaval far beyond what happened in Zimbabwe, in spite of the scale and ferocity of the bush war. But South Africa also has in place a large and efficient police force and, to back it up, the most effective military machine south of the Sahara. Citizen Force and Commando reserves have been called up for later this month to keep the lid on disorder. More can be called up if necessary. They will be used to patrol and protect city centres and suburbs as well as the township flashpoints. The military back-up has been severely stretched by commitments in Bophuthatwana, Lebowa Ciskei and kwaZulu/Natal, as well as on the East Rand, but the authorities are nevertheless determined to keep a firm grip. The police have put together a comprehensive plan for the period leading up to elections, the days of polling and the post-election phase. Measures include "maximum visibility in all areas by means of intensive patrols in all residential areas and on routes to polling stations". Spotting will be done from the air and fixed observation posts, while there will be maximum use of video cameras. "By the day of the election our forces will be at a peak," says Major-General Opperman, a former infantry commander who is now director of communications at Defence Headquarters. "We will be in a position to contain any situation that might arise." He says the frequency of incidents needing security force attention is expected to pick up as the election date approaches. The troops will stay in place after the election, to help the police. If conditions warrant, the call-up could be extended. "We will still be in place in the post-election phase, to provide the security we regard as essential for transition to a new dispensation and democracy." Gen Opperman emphasises that, in consultation with the police, military units will patrol urban and suburban areas as needed, as well as rural areas and townships. No part of the country will lack a security force presence. "I suggest communities who feel anxious about their security should get in touch with their regional police commands so that adequate arrangements can be made. Our operation will be very much hearth and home-protection of the ordinary civilian". He is bemused by speculation that the military call-up later this month will be poorly answered. "We have no evidence at all to suggest this. The call-up hasn't happened yet, so how do people make these claims? We have every confidence the call-up will be answered, as it always was before. It doesn't make sense for people to refuse when it's law and order and their own security that is at stake." After the elections the SADF [South African Defence Force] will continue to be a stabilising force, says Gen Opperman." "We are not a colonial power about to return home. We will integrate with other forces over a period but we won't lose our efficiency. We will be an effective fighting force. Internally we act as a back-up to the police but, in the end, the SADF is the only force with the numbers and resources to stand firm against chaos and anarchy.
