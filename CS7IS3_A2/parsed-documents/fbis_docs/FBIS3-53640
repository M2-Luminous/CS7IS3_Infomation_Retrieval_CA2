[Sukenik] But President Clinton himself said that President al-Asad spoke about normalization with Israel. [Rabin] But it was Clinton who said that, I have to hear it also from al-Asad. [Sukenik] The new factor is that normalization was mentioned for the first time in the Syrian context. [Rabin] Normalization has been referred to by the Syrians in the past. The problem is how it fits into the concept of peace, what the timetable to achieve peace is, and what price Israel has to pay.
