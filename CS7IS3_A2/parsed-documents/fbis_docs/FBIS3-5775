There is a high probability that the police will surpass the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] and Defense Security Command [DSC] in intelligence capability and that an era will come when police information is treated as the "highest class" intelligence. This talk is not circulating because the police's intelligence capability, that is its collection, analytical and interpretation capabilities, is better than other agencies. It is because, confronted by an era of civilian government, the activities of the NSP and DSC, long exercising tremendous influence, have been relatively reduced. "Can police intelligence continue like this?" -- words casually dropped by Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u after his appointment as minister. The words of Minister Choe became widely known in political circles and there are many people who interpret them as instructions to strengthen police intelligence capability. Those in police intelligence were also greatly encouraged by this one statement. In connection with this statement, there are those who ponder the fact that last year the National Police Administration created a new position in its Intelligence Bureau: Intelligence Analyst. Some look at this and speculate, "The police have gone into full-scale research to strengthen their intelligence capabilities." Although the duties of the intelligence analyst are not yet known in detail, attention has focused on the fact that at a delicate point in time, a senior superintendent, with the rank of police-station chief, was put in the position. One thing to be considered carefully in connection with the reduction of the activity of the NSP, considered the highest intelligence agency, is the activation of the Telecommunications Secrecy Protection Law. Actually, it is no secret that a considerable portion of the NSP's intelligence collection depended on wire tapping. In an inspection of Korean Telecommunications by the National Assembly's Transportation and Communications Committee held October 22 of last year, Democratic Party lawmaker Yi Yun-su divulged, "The NSP has exclusive use of 9,000 telephone circuits. Of these, over 5,000 are used for eavesdropping." Rep. Yi demanded that they "reveal precise details," but Korean Telecommunications representatives equivocated, saying, "We don't yet have a grasp of it." "Considering that the police have only 885 dedicated circuits and the DSC has only 383, although both have similar intelligence duties, this supports the view that the NSP depends for a considerable portion of its intelligence on wiretapping," insisted Rep. Yi. The intelligence activities of the NSP were dealt a fatal blow last year when the Telecommunications Secrecy Protection Law passed the National Assembly. The decoration of the pages of daily newspapers by articles entitled, "NSP Employees Stop Work," is not unrelated to this. "It's not that we have stopped work altogether, as they are saying on the outside, but it is true that morale has dropped considerably," said one NSP source, indirectly conveying the mood within the NSP. The DSC, which stirred up a controversy because of its surveillance of civilians, already cut off its arms and legs last year. Beginning with a sudden change of the DSC commander, the DSC reorganization led into the abolition of its intelligence office (Office II), which was responsible for intelligence collection against civilians, together with the movement of municipal and provincial-level security units to within military bases. Also, over 400 veteran intelligence agents who had been working in rear areas were moved to forward areas. The DSC is now powerless in any arena other than national-defense-related intelligence. Such variables external to the police thus encourage the idea that, as far as intelligence goes, this is the "era of the police." In the vicinity of Seoul's Sogang University and in front of Ehwa University, there are several offices with signs reading, "Council" [as published]. In their names, these offices do not fit in with the mood of a university neighborhood. These offices are actually intelligence offices subordinate to the Police Administration's Intelligence Bureau: they collect various kinds of information tied in with politics, economics, and the college area. The Police Administration has three such offices within Seoul. The entrance to the National Assembly building and political party buildings are also the responsibility of police officers belonging to these intelligence offices. The police's intelligence organization is this broad. Police intelligence activities tie the nation together as with a spider's web. Those active in the front lines of intelligence collection are the intelligence-section detectives of each police station. Also, taking responsibility for one police box each within their respective jurisdictions, they gather information on important figures living in their areas and public opinion within their jurisdictions. Thus, they in fact have every quarter of the entire country covered. The police station intelligence department is divided into Intelligence Sections I and II. Pure intelligence-collection activities are the responsibility of Intelligence Section II. Although there are places with less than ten police officers, 20-30 detectives are active for police stations in areas of Seoul with concentrations of major organizations and in areas near universities. Information collected at each police station is sent to the municipal or provincial police intelligence-management department. This once again goes up to the National Police Administration, where the administration's intelligence analyst interprets information based on this. Even apart from this intelligence system with its vertical organization, the National Police Administration, municipal and provincial police also have separate, horizontal organizations. The Seoul Municipal Police have an Intelligence-Management Department with Intelligence Sections I and II. Other municipal and provincial police also have similar structures. The Intelligence Bureau within the Police Administration has Intelligence Sections I through IV. This is the place that epitomizes nationwide police intelligence. Intelligence Section I is responsible for general affairs; Section II, for collecting information on politics; Section III, on economics and society; and Section IV, on academia and religion. Intelligence Sections II, III, and IV manage Intelligence offices 1, 2, and 3 respectively. It would not be far off the mark to say that the entire public is confined within the police intelligence network. Besides this, the police even have officers dispatched to the Blue House, NSP, DSC, the courts, and public prosecutor's offices. Of all government departments, the police have the greatest number of government workers dispatched to other places. Although not attached to duty, there is even a designated person responsible for the media. However, this does not mean that police intelligence has tremendous influence. Although its collection capability is outstanding, it has been considered to be relatively behind in its analysis and interpretation capabilities. "Police intelligence is rock-bottom intelligence: a collection of all of the most detailed but trivial information," said one intelligence police officer, "Accessing high-class information is not an easy thing." Let us look at an example. There was a police officer in his fifties working at the Namdaemun police station in Seoul. He has now moved to a different police station within Seoul, but many people remember his activity when he was in charge of the Samsung Group as a member of the intelligence section. As an intelligence-section "detective," his rank was not that high, but there was not a Samsung Group director who did not know his name. This was because concerning internal information on the Samsung Group, and particularly information about the movements of the group's head, he was the quickest and most knowledgeable. Among the intelligence he collected was information unknown to even the NSP, the leader of intelligence agencies. Long "frequenting" the Samsung Group headquarters, it was possible for him to collect even trivial information on things such as the exchange of the air purifier in the C.E.O.'s office. However, his activities never got him much credit. The information he collected was, in a word, fragmentary. Police analytical capabilities were unable to thread this voluminous information together to make a product. Even if they could have been said to have made a "product," it was always behind that of the NSP and DSC. This is because the police intelligence of the Fifth and Sixth Republics had no influence. The main reason the police were unlikely to access high-class information and so could not help but fall behind the NSP, was "money," say sources associated with police intelligence. "The NSP pours out bundles of money. Naturally, high-class information follows," said one police-intelligence source. Concerning the question, "Will a time come when the police surpass the NSP and DSC in intelligence capability?" present theories are unlikely to give a clear answer. This is because, although there are clear signs of this, there is still no movement in that direction. "I have not heard a concrete commitment from Minister Choe concerning the strengthening of police intelligence capabilities," said Senior Superintendent General Yi Su-il, the National Police Administration's Intelligence Bureau Chief. "It is only speculation based on various circumstances. There have been no concrete efforts taken within the Police Administration to improve its intelligence organization and it is technically impossible to change an intelligence organization in a day." "The establishment of the position of Intelligence Analyst was only a separation of the existing intelligence-analysis personnel," said Yi. "It is unrelated to movements to strengthen intelligence capability." However, one source associated with the police said, "The attempt by President Kim Yong-sam and Minister Choe Hyong-u, representative victims of the past abnormal intelligence activities of the NSP and DSC, to strengthen the legal intelligence activities of the police in conjunction with an era of civilian government is only natural." The source also said, "Internally, the police will be deliberating on proposals now." "The quality of intelligence has a deep correlation with money," said one National Police Administration source, "even if there are efforts at improvement, because if there is no budget support the results will not be remarkable." "Even if it changes, it won't change much in a short time," he forecasted. Always crowded out by the NSP and DSC, even while having the most massive organization and number of personnel of the three intelligence agencies, the police now appear to be gradually gaining strength. One police officer said, "Within the limits of what is not damaging to the public, intelligence collection must proceed, appearing to be and not to be at the same time."
