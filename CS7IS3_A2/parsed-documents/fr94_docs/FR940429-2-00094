FR940429-2-00094 FR940429-2-00070 Both the Act and Exchange rules reflect the crucial role played by specialists in providing stability, liquidity, and continuity in the Exhange's auction market. Recognizing the importance of the specialist in the auction market, the Act, as well as Exchange rules, impose stringent obligations upon specialist. 10 Primary among the obligations are the requirements to maintain fair and olderly markets and to restrict specialist dealings to those that are ``reasonably necessary'' in order to maintain a fair and orderly market. 11 10 See Rule 11b&hyph;1 under the Act, 17 CFR 240.11b&hyph;1 (1993); Amex Rule 170. 11 17 CFR 240.11b&hyph;1(A)(2) (1993). The importance of specialist performance to the quality of Exchange markets was highlighted during the 1987 and 1989 market breaks. In the Division of Market Regulation's (``Division'') report on the October 1987 market break (``1987 Market Break Report''), the Division examined specialist performance on the Amex on October 19 and 20, 1987. 12 The Division found that, although some Amex specialists appeared to perform well under adverse conditions, others did not. 13 12 See Division of Market Regulation, The October 1987 Market Break, February 1988, at 4&hyph;29 to 4&hyph;41. 13 See 1987 Market Break Report at 4&hyph;41. The Division also examined Amex specialist performance during the volatile conditions of October 13 and 16, 1989 (``October 1989 Report''), and found that specialist performance during the time was similar in many respects to the pattern of specialist performance during the October 1987 Market Break. 14 Specifically, the Division found that, during these two periods of adverse market conditions, specialists were confronted with extreme volume and volatility. 15 14 See Division of Market Regulation, Market Analysis of October 13 and 16, 1989, at 33. 15 1987 Market Break Report at 4&hyph;30; October 1989 Report, at 27. Both the 1987 Market Break Report and the October 1998 Report reaffirmed the importance of specialist participation in countering market trends during periods of market volatility. At the same time, the reports emphasized the importance the Commission placed on the Amex's ability to ensure that all specialists comply with their affirmative and negative market making obligations during such periods. One area of specialist performance specifically reviewed by the October 1989 Report involved specialist's compliance with their obligation to maintain and orderly market by buying and selling stocks for their own accounts to relieve imbalances between supply and demand. In the October 1989 Report, the Division requested that the Amex examine the language of Rule 170.02. 16 Amex Rule 170.02 states that, unless a specialist has the prior approval of a Floor Official, he or she should avoid liquidation of all or substantially all of position by selling stock at prices below the last different price or by purchasing stock at prices above the last different price unless such transactions are reasonably necessary in relation to the specialist's overall position in the stocks in which he or she is registered. The Division indicated that Rule 170.02 appeared to provide specialists with unnecessarily broad latitude for effecting transactions on destabilizing tricks. 17 16 See October 1989 Report at 29. The Division also requested that the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') examine the language of NYSE Rule 104.10, which contains similar language to Amex Rule 170.02. Specifically, the Division stated that the suggestion regarding NYSE Rule 104.10's treatment of estabilizing transactions is equally applicable to Amex Rule 170.02. See October 1989 Report at 29&hyph;30, note 56. 17 See October 1989 Report at 19, note 31. The proposed rule change is responsive to the request regarding Rule 170.02 as well as the conclusions of the two market break reports. The Amex, recognizing that market conditions may necessitate that a specialist participate heavily in a rapidly declining market, has proposed amendments to Rule 170.02 to provide specialists with flexibility in liquidating specialty stock positions in order to facilitate their ability to maintain fair and orderly markets, particularly during unusual market conditions. At the same time, the amendments also would strengthen the specialist's concomitant obligation to participate as dealer on the opposite side of the market after a liquidating transaction. Under the amended Rule, a specialist may liquidate a position by selling stock on a direct minus tick or by purchasing stock on a direct plus tick only if such transactions are reasonably necessary for the maintenance of a fair and orderly market and only if the specialist has obtained the prior approval of a Floor Official. Liquidations on a zero minus or a zero plus tick, which previously required Floor Official approval, can be effected under the pilot procedures without a Floor Official's approval, but continue to be subject to the restriction that they be effected only when reasonably necessary to maintain a fair and orderly market. In addition, the specialist must maintain a fair and orderly market during the liquidation. Both the Act and Exchange rules reflect the crucial role played by specialists in providing stability, liquidity, and continuity in the Exchange's auction market. Recognizing the importance of the specialist in the auction market, the Act, as well as Exchange rules, impose stringent obligations upon
