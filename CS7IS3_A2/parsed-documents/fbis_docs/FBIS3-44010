At the end of the meeting, Chief Beye told the press that everyone should pray that the peace talks have a good ending in the shortest possible time. Marcolino Moco and Chief Beye met very briefly, considering the issues discussed at the meeting. In less than 30 minutes the special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola spoke about humanitarian assistance and explained to the prime minister how things are progressing in Lusaka. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Chief Beye, it must be true that your meeting with the prime minister centered on Lusaka peace talks? [Beye] That is true. That is the concern of the Angolan people, and, therefore, the concern of the Angolan Government. I briefed the prime minister on our work. I also had the opportunity to reiterate to the prime minister my best wishes for 1994 and that this may be a year of peace for Angola. We also discussed the issue of humanitarian assistance which greatly concerns the government, the provision of supplies to the people, and the visit of the executive director of the World Food Program. [Reporter] Will the peace talks still take long? [Beye] We have to be very prudent. I must also respect the contract that we made. A day will come when I shall talk and I think this day will come very soon. We must, therefore, pray for this. Let us avoid predictions. [Reporter] What is the deadline for the end of discussions? [Beye] We cannot set a deadline for the end of negotiations. It must, however, be as soon as possible. Thank you very much. [end recording]
