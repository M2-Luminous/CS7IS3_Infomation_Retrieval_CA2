She was addressing a news conference in Kathmandu this afternoon prior to her departure for home. Replying to a question on plebiscite in Kashmir, the prime minister said: [Begin Bhutto recording] (?Already) Pakistan made its demand for plebiscite. And you know who else agreed to plebiscite? Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India. And you know who else agreed to plebiscite? The entire international community in the United Nations. So what we are saying is that why this subcontinent gives rapt attention just because India and Pakistan cannot deal with the problem which we have inherited from partition. [sentence as heard] So, we are saying let us solve that. Let us solve that under the Simla agreement and let us in the light of UN resolution (?if we cannot do it bilaterally). So let us do it multilaterally, but let us find a political solution. I noted the Indian scene that this is the Pakistani inspired uprising. But that is not so. There is no difference in this uprising than the difference wherein the people of Nepal rose up against the Rana rulers, for instance. So nobody can quench the desire of freedom because it is the part of the way I think; it is the people of a country or the people of a society. [sentence as heard] If they rise up, nobody can do anything about it. [end recording] To another question, she said her visit to Nepal will herald a new era of cooperation between Pakistan and Nepal. A warm send off was given to the prime minister when she left Kathmandu today for Islamabad. The Nepalese prime minister, Mr. Girija Prasad Koirala, bade farewell to Ms. Benazir Bhutto at the Tribhuvan Airport. Also present to see off the prime minister of Pakistan were members of the Nepalese cabinet, the mayor of Kathmandu, senior officials of the government, diplomats based in the Nepalese capital, and members of the Pakistani community. An impressive guard of honor was presented to Ms. Benazir Bhutto. National anthems of the two countries were also played on the occasion. Before boarding the aircraft, the prime minister and members of her entourage deeply thanked the Nepalese prime minister and other officials of his government for the warm hospitality during their stay in Kathmandu. The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, called on his majesty King Birendra of Nepal at Narenhiti Royal Palace in Kathmandu last night.
