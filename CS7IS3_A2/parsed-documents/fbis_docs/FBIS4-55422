"There will be arms, even if the blockade is such that not even a needle can slip through," says the daily in reaction to the latest debates on exempting Moslems from the arms embargo. In September 1991, the United Nations imposed an embargo on arms exports and imports in the entire territory of former Yugoslavia, but the breakaway republics of Croatia, Slovenia and the Bosnian Moslem government in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as certain Islamic and Western countries have repeatedly violated this resolution. A shipment of 2,000 tonnes of weaponry, for which Moslems paid 27 million dollars abroad, reached Zagreb through the Adriatic Sea in mid-September 1992, says LJILJAN as carried by the Bosnian Serb News Agency SRNA. In the night between November 24 and 25 of 1992, Moslems from foreign countries launched a ship, The Dolphin, to take 6.7 million dollars' worth of arms to Bosnian Moslems from an unnamed port to Croatia. According to the LJILJAN report, The Dolphin was carrying four cannon with around 60,000 shells, 122mm mortar sets, 700,000 12.7mm calibre bullets, 3,500 anti-tank shells, 82mm mortar sets with 1,500 shells and 10,000 122mm calibre rockets. The cargo also included Toyota army jeeps with communications equipment used in the Desert Storm operation in the Gulf war and 10,000 modern uniforms for the Bosnian Moslem Army. The Dolphin arrived at its destination port in late December, a month after it left dock, but it was intercepted by NATO military patrols in charge of implementing the U.N. resolution on the ban of arms shipments to former Yugoslavia. The ship was turned back and sent to Italy and the weapons and equipment were sold, LJILJAN says. In parallel with the Dolphin operation, five Boeings left for one of Croatia's military airfields with a cargo of 90 tonnes of weaponry for the Bosnian Moslem government, including arrow missiles with launchers, 100 rpgs with around 8,000 shells. This cargo reached the Moslems in Bosnia, LJILJAN says. The U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST said on Friday that an Iranian plane with at least 60 tonnes of explosives landed in Zagreb last week and that the shipment was part of the agreement between the Croatian authorities and the Bosnian Moslems to renew military operations against Serbs.
