Sources in the Israeli delegation said that even if the invitation is declined, this will not mean failure because the very fact that it was issued constitutes a small step forward that is indicative of a change in atmosphere. Our correspondent in Qatar Karmela Menashe reports that the Israeli delegation is meeting with delegations from Arab states concurrently with the plenum sessions. Sources in the Israeli delegation said that progress has been made in the discussions of the committee on arms control. The atmosphere in the meetings outside the plenum hall is relaxed. In all the sessions, all the participants are addressing the issue of Israel's nonconventional weapons arsenal. The Qatari foreign minister will leave for Cairo tomorrow to attend the signing ceremony of the agreement between the PLO and Israel.
