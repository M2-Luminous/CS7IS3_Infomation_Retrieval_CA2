He warned that the official exchange rate will enter into force on 6 July but added that there will be controlled foreign exchange and secondary [marginal] exchange fed by nontraditional exports. Sosa Rodriguez added that the Central Bank may at some time supply that secondary dollar market with some foreign currency. According to Development Minister Alberto Poletto, the regulated prices of staple products will be announced after the exchange rate is announced. In the minister's opinion, the price control measure is necessary to halt the increase in the prices of staple products, because hoarding has been on the rise in recent weeks. He believes that profound changes will take place when adjustments to the economy are made, mainly in terms of the financial crisis involving government intervention in eight banks and one financial corporation. That is why the measure is temporary and depends on the balance of the market. [Begin Poletto recording] These prices should be adjusted. There will not be a frozen price rate. The prices will be adjusted inasmuch as some indicators may vary, mainly the monetary indicator, meaning the exchange rate of the bolivar to the dollar. We are trying to cover a whole range of products, which as we understand -- that is, what came out in the decree you are familiar with -- represent 80 percent of the usual and normal consumption of the Venezuelan people. [end recording] Commenting on the services mentioned in the decree, Poletto indicated that regulations are in the hands of the respective ministries. Some services are even being controlled by contracts.
