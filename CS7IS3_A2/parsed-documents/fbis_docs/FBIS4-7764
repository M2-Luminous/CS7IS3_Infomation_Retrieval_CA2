He said in our early morning program that this will take a few days. Rosati said that, at the request of representatives of both coalition parties, he has changed his earlier decision to resign as the candidate. In his opinion, failing to appoint someone to the post of deputy prime minister for economic affairs and minister of finance has aroused concern in Poland and abroad. [Begin recording] [Rosati] My impression is that the situation is certainly not good when there is no one responsible for the economy, when there is no one with whom one can have responsible talks on what government policy will be in the near future, on how the government will try to resolve the situation concerning the pressure of demands for pay hikes, how the government will solve the problem of restructuring of the state industries, etc. [Reporter Olejnik] Would you put your name to this budget? [Rosati] I have already said that the budget bill, in fact the budget itself [pauses]... Is this what you mean? [Olejnik] Yes, yes. [Rosati] The budget is a compromise between needs and capabilities, and, personally, I think I would sign my name under this budget. [Olejnik] And what is your opinion on the excess wage tax [Popiwek] law? As you know, the president has not signed this law. [Rosati] I was against Popiwek from the very beginning, and I did not like the new version of the law, either. I favor adopting different solutions, as I have written before. However, at the moment, we are in the worst possible situation because we do not have any law, and we also do not know if there is going to be any law in the future. Consequently, there is an incentive here for work enterprises to take advantage of this short period, when there is a lack of any legal regulations, and introduce pay rises. [end recording] [Announcer] Monika Olejnik was talking to Professor Rosati.
