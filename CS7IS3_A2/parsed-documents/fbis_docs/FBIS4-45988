The inspection team will watch [kamsi] the work of replacing nuclear fuel rods in Yongbyon and conduct additional inspection of the radiochemical experimental power station. The United States and IAEA have high expectations for the inspection team's activities. After arriving in Yongbyon today, the IAEA inspection team, composed of three inspectors, started the work of confirming whether fuel rods were replaced by examining surveillance cameras and seals installed in the nuclear reactor. Even if North Korea has launched the work of replacing nuclear fuel rods, the IAEA will persuade North Korea through various negotiation channels to allow the inspection team to optionally select nuclear fuel rods from nuclear reactor at the initial stage of replacement and to store them in a separate special instrument. The reason for this is that if the inspection team takes a sample from storage house after the replacement of the fuel rods is completed, the team cannot examine the precise amount of nuclear material already converted. The IAEA maintains that the sample-taking during the time of replacing the nuclear fuel rods is indispensable for deciding whether the North Korean report that damaged fuel rods were replaced only once since the operation began in 1986 is true or not and for finding out the exact quantity of fuel rods replaced. Therefore, the IAEA inspection team will decide the extent of progress in the replacement of nuclear fuel rods and examine whether the precise sample-taking is feasible at the present stage or not. The inspection team is given a special mission to urgently report the result of its aforementioned activities. Meanwhile, the Clinton administration has expectations for the result of the activities by the IAEA inspection team in North Korea. During a regular briefing today, U.S. Defense Department spokesman (Box) expressed an optimistic view, stating that the inspection team will complete inspections of the seven declared nuclear facilities, which remained unsolved last March, and will go into the nuclear reactor in question in Yongbyon and replace film and batteries.
