The harvest workers have put a poor start behind them and, dismissing difficulties, are fulfilling the trust placed in them. This is the reason Camaguey was selected the winner in the eighth regional emulation period with results surpassing those of Las Tunas and Holguin Provinces. In sugar produced, they are second, nationwide; in sugarcane grinding, yield, transportation, planting, soil preparation, and power provided to the national electric system, the region is the vanguard. This is very encouraging and, in the opinion of specialists, denotes efficiency and stability, even though there is still much to do. The emulation assessment was chaired by Jose A. Naranjo, chief of the commander in chief's coordination and support staff, and Politburo members Nelson Torres, Sugar Minister, and Julian Rizo Alvarez, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Camaguey Province, in addition to the first secretaries of Las Tunas and Holguin Provinces. It became evident in the analysis that an extraordinary effort is required in the next 40 days in order to meet the unalterable commitment of the three provinces decisive to Cuba's sugar program. It was stressed that the doctrine of fulfilling daily tasks is not only beautiful but essential, now more than ever.
