(a) A majority of the entire membership of the Board may vote to close a portion of a meeting or to withhold information concerning a meeting under the provisions of §7.3 of these bylaws. The members shall take a separate vote with respect to each meeting a portion of which is proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld, and shall make every reasonable effort to take any such vote at least 8 days before the date of the meeting involved. The members may take a single vote with respect to a series of meetings, portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to information concerning the series, so long as each portion of a meeting in the series involves the same particular matters, and no portion of any meeting is scheduled to be held more than 30 days after the initial portion of the first meeting in the series. (b) Whenever any person whose interest may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the Board close that portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in §7.3 (e), (f), or (g) of these bylaws, upon request of any one of its members the Board shall vote by recorded vote whether to close that portion of the meeting. (c) The Secretary shall record the vote of each member participating in a vote under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. Within 1 day of any vote under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the Secretary shall make publicly available a written copy of the vote showing the vote of each member on the question. If a portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public, the Secretary shall, within 1 day of the vote, make publicly available a full written explanation of the action closing the portion, together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation. (d) If a committee of the Board determines that a majority of its meetings may properly be closed to the public for any combination of reasons referred to in §7.3 (d), (h), or (j) of these bylaws, it may close a meeting or a portion of a meeting by a recorded vote of a majority of its members at the beginning of the meeting or portion in question. The Secretary shall promptly make available to the public a written copy of the vote showing the vote of each member on the question. Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, and §7.5 of these bylaws do not apply to any meeting or portion of a meeting closed under this paragraph. However, at the earliest practicable time, the Secretary shall publicly announce the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting and each of its portions. (e) Immediately following each public announcement required under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the Secretary shall submit for publication in the Federal Register the text of the announcement or the information made available. The Secretary shall also submit the announcement or information to the Postal Service Public and Employee Communications Department for dissemination to the public.
