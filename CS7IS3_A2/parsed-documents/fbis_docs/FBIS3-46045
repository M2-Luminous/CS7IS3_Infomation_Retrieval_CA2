By the end of World War II, the struggle of Asian and African peoples for national independence was spreading like a storm, and Britain was compelled to withdraw from its former colonies. However, in the course of its withdrawal, Britain took great care to use various inglorious means and tricks; it sowed discord between different races, religious sects, tribes, and other political forces to spark contradictions and conflicts, thus implementing "divide and rule"; or forced the implementation of mergers in the form of a "federal state," namely, "merge and rule"; or went all out to prop up a pro-British government. In a nutshell, it attempted to continue to maintain British vested interests and maximise political influence. "Divide and rule" was one of Britain's usual notorious methods, and India served as the most typical example. In 1943, Britain set forth a policy of "divide and rule," and advocated the division of India into three governing regions, namely, separating India into a Hindu region, a Muslim region, and a region of various princely states and feudatories. Lord Louis Mountbatten, the last British viceroy of India, dished up his "divide and rule" plan in June 1946, which partitioned India into three--two dominions, India and Pakistan, and various princely states and feudatories. At the same time, it was stipulated that the princely states and feudatories had the right to decide on their own to join any of the two dominions, with the aim of using the princes of the Indian princely states and feudatories as a force to counter the Indian nationalist movement; and second, it sowed discord in relations between Muslims and the Hindus, and this eventually led to the partition of India and Pakistan. Indian and Pakistani historians indicated this by hitting the nail on the head, saying that the aim of the partition of India and Pakistan plotted meticulously by Britain was to make these two countries weak and make things difficult for them to stand on their own feet. Of course, history did not develop in the way the British colonialists hoped for. On the Palestine issue, Britain first encouraged the Arabs of the Ottoman Empire to resist Turkish rule; later, they hoisted the banner of supporting the Zionist movement, roping in the Jews to elbow out the Arabs at one point, then taking advantage of the Arabs to oppose the Jews at another. In Cyprus, to split the anti-British struggle of the local people, Britain encouraged Turkish Cypriots to confront the EOKA, the anti-British Greek Cypriot organization. Later, Britain led Greece and Turkey into Cyprus' internal conflict; consequently, the sovereignty of this island state fell apart. Furthermore, this resulted in complicated contradictions and conflicts between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus, and between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, while turning the Cyprus issue into an international hot spot. Sometimes, Britain pushed the strategy of "merge and rule" in some regions through forcing together "federations" by force. A typical example was the "Central African Federation," which Britain patched up. In 1953, the British Government merged British Southern and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and formed a so-called "Federation of Central Africa." This was out of British political and economic considerations. Economically, Northern Rhodesia abounded in copper, Southern Rhodesia had skilled Caucasian technicians, and Nyasaland possessed a huge cheap labor force. Welding those three factors into an economic federation was conducive to Britain's maintenance of its economic interests in this region. Politically, the Caucasian immigrants in Southern Rhodesia were powerful and controlled the local government; with the organization of the "federation," the influence of the Caucasians of Southern Rhodesia would extend to all of British Central Africa, thus suppressing newly rising black nationalism in Africa. Nevertheless, the "Central African Federation" went bankrupt in 1963 because of the strong opposition of its black African inhabitants. In addition, another important policy target of Britain in the course of its withdrawal from its colonies was to prop up pro-British forces, and it transferred power to pro-British governments. National independence and liberation movements with a strong momentum broke out in British colonies in south, and Southeast Asia in the early post-war years. India at that time was like "a loaded ship on fire in the ocean." Britain was compelled to make the decision to withdraw quickly from India, while transferring political power into the so-called "hands of Indian who have a sense of responsibility" to prevent catastrophe for Britain. It was precisely in this way that Britain realized a "peaceful transfer of political power" in India, while a whole range of organizations of old colonial rule were retained, while India and Pakistan remained members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and British private capital in India was left intact. In the early post-war years, the Burmese People's Movement vigorously developed. To avoid being thoroughly driven out from Burma, Britain rapidly transferred political power to "moderates," who were acceptable to Britain. British economic interests and military bases in Burma basically remained intact. Britain's method in Malaysia was almost undisguised. The Malaysian people had already emancipated the country during the war of resistance against Japan. When the British Army returned to Malaysia, it started to restore the colonial order in Malaysia. Later, Britain announced a state of emergency in Malaysia, and Britain eventually transferred political power in the mid-1950's, when the situation had basically stabilized. The various tricks Britain resorted to in the course of its withdrawal from its colonies left the former colonial countries endless hidden dangers after independence. This found conspicuous expression in long-term turbulence in the political situations of these countries in the wake of their independence, and endless conflicts between neighboring countries or within countries, whereas socioeconomic development was impeded and restricted. In "divide and rule," Britain implemented artificial partitions or mergers of territory in former colonies, thus creating numerous complicated nationality and border issues for the independent countries later on. In August 1947, Britain hastily withdrew from India two months after the Mountbatten plan was presented, which resulted in slaughter between the religious sects and an escalation of turmoil. Statistics show that 500,000 people died directly or indirectly in the turmoil, and 5 million people fled from their homes. Based on the Mountbatten plan, Pakistan was founded in two separate areas in the east and the west, some 1,600 km away from each other; the inconvenience in transportation resulted in extremely great difficulties in economic development. The rivalry between India and Pakistan over Kashmir resulted in several armed conflicts, and the issue remains unresolved as of today. Britain's implementation of "divide and rule" in Palestine left a large number of Palestinian refugees homeless. The long-running confrontation between the Arabs and Israel and the four Middle East wars that broke out one after the other all find their roots in British "divide and rule." Likewise, the civil war and divisions between the Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots after Cyprus' independence, and the conflict between Greece and Turkey are all inseparable from the evil consequences of what Britain did during its rule in Cyprus. The British colonialists created divisions in Nigeria by utilizing contradictions between various tribes to instigate regional separatism and jeopardize Nigeria's national solidarity and unification, while sowing the seeds for long-term internal disturbances after Nigeria's independence. In the late 1960's, the Nigerian Civil War that centered around the independence of Biafra cost 1 million lives, and economic and social development was seriously damaged. Britain bears unshirkable responsibility for all of this.
