Last year alone, this writer received 183 business cards from friends serving in the military. These cards belong to both cadres and soldiers, with 168 people engaging in office work, accounting for 92 percent, and 15 others working in military-run enterprises, accounting for 8 percent. These business cards are characterized by the abundant use of Army unit designations, titles, and sensitive internal Army telephone numbers. With these problems in mind, this writer has conducted investigations in several Army units. People have reported that the indiscriminate printing and distribution of business cards poses many disadvantages to army building: It endangers the management and security of the barracks areas. After taking the business cards offered them by servicemen, some job-seekers have visited various Army units "out of admiration." To find a suitable job, they go to this office today and that office tomorrow in an effort to establish a network of relationships. This has not only disrupted the normal work and order in the barracks areas but has also encouraged unhealthy practices. Some unscrupulous persons have even taken advantage of the opportunity to commit crimes in Army units. It discredits the Army units' prestige. To build up their social status, some servicemen have indiscriminately added titles to their business cards, such as "director" of this factory, "manager" or "business section head" of that company, and "member" or "director" of a wide variety of societies and associations. As some are not worthy of these titles, the prestige of the Army units has suffered. It is not conducive to confidential nature of the Army units' work. Some of the business cards carry the Army unit designation, detailed address, and internal telephone numbers. This has undoubtedly gravely damaged confidentiality. There has been no lack of lessons in this regard. According to an armed services newspaper report on 27 March 1993, an operational staff officer called He from an Army unit stationed in a special economic zone gave his cousin in Hong Kong a business card bearing the address and classified telephone number of his unit. The result is that the classified telephone is no longer classified. A certain clerical worker called Huang also brought losses to army building by indiscriminately distributing his business cards, which have been made use of by an enemy agent. In short, the fashion of distributing business cards in Army units has more disadvantages than advantages for army building and should arouse the close attention of the department concerned. It is necessary to adopt effective measures to step up guidance and management, especially to strictly observe security discipline.
