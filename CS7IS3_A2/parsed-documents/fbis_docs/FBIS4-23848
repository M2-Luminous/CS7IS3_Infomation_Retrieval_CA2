A Red Cross hospital in a government-held sector of Kigali admitted 180 soldiers and civilians injured in battles between Rwandan rebels and government forces, officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross said. The two UN officers, one from Bangladesh and the other from Uruguay, were hurt in what was believed to have been a grenade or mine explosion about 20 kilometres (12 miles) north-west of Kigali during a reconnaissance mission on the road to the town of Ruhengeri, UN military sources said. No further details were immediately available and it was unclear who was responsible for the explosion. Fighting erupted despite a shaky two-day-old ceasefire between rebel and government forces. Rebel commandos of the mainly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front freed about 400 civilians in a commando raid early Friday on a church behind government lines where militiamen of the Hutu majority are believed to have abducted and killed hundreds of people. Other rebel forces started firing to create a diversion, and the 180 wounded people, including civilians and soldiers, were believed to have been hurt in the ensuing fighting.
