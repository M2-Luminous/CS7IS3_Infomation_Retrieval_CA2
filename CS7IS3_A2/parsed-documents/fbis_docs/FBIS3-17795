Moldova has sufficient credibility in the eyes of the World Bank's Coordinating Council and due to this it has granted Moldova $300 million credit so far. Teodor Stolojan, World Bank's expert in privatization problems, said that a group of experts representing the executive power and the parliamentary commissions should be organized during the formation of new government. This group will discuss the privatization program for 1994-95. In Stolojan's opinion, "it is very important to take decisions at already solved in other countries," says the communique. Leonid Talmaci, Moldovan National Bank Governor, pointed out that the WB had reduced the interest rate for its credits due to a decrease of inflation to 10 percent in early March. President Snegur said that in his speech to the new parliament he will emphasize specifically the promotion of economic reforms in pace with a program for the social assistance of vulnerable groups. Snegur noted that it is difficult to attain these objectives and this is due to the conservatism of certain enterprises' managers and oppositionist speculations. He said the opposition manipulates the population in a difficult moment with a well-defined aim to gain political capital, says the communique.
