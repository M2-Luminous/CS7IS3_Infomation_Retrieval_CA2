For many months, in fact on the occasion of every official visit, it has been stressed that a treaty will be signed before long. Smiling politicians, posing for pictures together, claim that agreement has already been reached and that only a few details need to be discussed. However, as the wise French saying goes, the devil is in the details. Most probably it was this devil who is to blame for the fact that the treaty has not yet been signed. Of course, during the talks in Vilnius between President Walesa's envoy and [Lithuanian President] Algirdas Brazauskas, details were not discussed because presidents or their envoys do not usually discuss such matters. Therefore, whether this treaty will really be signed will be decided in the fifth round of formal negotiations. The laconic statements of politicians on Thursday [3 February] seem to suggest, however, that a major step forward has been made. Both sides probably agreed on a compromise-- Poland because it agreed that the evaluation of the past will be included not in a separate declaration but in the treaty's preamble, and Lithuania because it probably worded this evaluation of the past in such a way as to make it acceptable for us. The final statements concerning the evaluation of history are very important, not only for moral but also for pragmatic reasons. The evaluation of Polish-Lithuanian relations during the 20 years after World War I affects the present regulations concerning ownership issues of Poles living in the Vilnius region. It is still an open question whether a compromise reached by politicians will be generally accepted--first of all in Lithuania. Andrzej Zakrzewski is not entirely right when he speaks about "political folklore" in the context of Lithuanian accusations concerning the "Polish invasion of the Vilnius region." Such terms are used not only by Lithuanian informal groupings and organizations, such as the notoriously anti-Polish Vilnija, but also by political elites. No matter what, we cannot say that the parliamentary opposition headed by Vytautas Landsbergis is political folklore. Therefore, it will not be until another three weeks have passed that we will be able to say whether a breakthrough has been achieved in relations between Vilnius and Warsaw.
