The times when Czech enterprises waited fruitlessly (and are still waiting) for payments--again in a "standard" way--are also gone. It seems that the era of genuine standard trade, without the quotation marks, has arrived. The trading conditions, however, may not be quite standard yet, but Czech manufacturers and exporters are rapidly learning to tackle them. A Small Exporter Myth? From the naivete of the questions that some Czech entrepreneurs are asking of the Mixed Chamber of Commerce "East" it can be inferred that small exporters are really a myth. If someone who is interested in the Russian market is inquiring whether there are custom fees in Russia, what can be sold there, and who buys what, then he has no great chances. Maybe it is this naivete that makes the Chamber prepare more educational courses for Czech entrepreneurs--the beginners. The chairman of the Chamber, Josef Cerny, as well as its secretary general, Miroslav Cuker, are stressing that small exporters do not have do be a myth, however, a completely unexperienced exporter is certainly a myth. All those who have successes on the Russian market today have experience and know their territory. If an exporter knows what products he wants to export, when he has an idea about the price and the quality, then he can much profit from the Chamber. The Chamber is connected to a network of about 60 regional chambers in Russia, and through them our Chamber "releases" information onto the Russian market. The Chamber has a secretariat in Moscow that, every month, publishes the offers of the Czech and Slovak entrepreneurs, and mails them to about 3,000 addresses. Anyway, any Czech entrepreneur can buy the directory of Russian entities at the Chamber in Prague. Prospective Czech suppliers to the Russian market can order a tailor-made service at the Chamber, for instance, research into the marketing conditions for their product. This research can by a simple report or a profound analysis. Since the Chambers has its own contacts and Russian experts participate in drafting the analyses, the results can really be considered to be real information, and not imagination. As a service to its members (and for a fee to nonmembers) the Chamber regularly publishes commercial information, for instance, Russian laws, lists of enterprises, privatization rules, instructions for establishing joint ventures in Russia, etc., etc. The Chamber is capable of securing the participation of Czech entities in Russian expositions, and some expositions were even organized by the Chamber (in Almaaty in April this year, and in Moscow in June). The Road for a Small Exporter: An Association The Association for the Development of Trade with the East (APROV) was established at the beginning of the year as an interest group involving Czech firms that wanted to assert themselves (not only) on the Russian market. President of the Association Jiri Sedlmajer (and not only he) says that small manufactures cannot assert themselves on the Russian market since they do not have funds to at least have their own man in Moscow. He believes (again, he is not alone) that the physical presence is the alpha and omega of the success. APROV has the ambition to gradually establish offices not only in Moscow, but in other interesting places, too. Only several dozens firms, whose turnover runs from one to several million korunas, have become members of the association so far. Most of them are from the industrial and agricultural complex. According to the Association's idea, their members can conduct trade not only in the classical way--that is, for money--but partially also as barter trade. The Association has a list of Czech firms that are interested in certain Russian goods (wood, plastic materials, fertilizers, etc.). The management of the Association is prepared to provide information to their members (for a fee to nonmembers) about the situation in Russia. APROV is not the only organization of this type. Today, there are more of them and all are counting on the common denominator: One's own man on Russian territory, information from the source, and willingness to conclude barter deals. The Success of the Great Ones: Inekon Regarding the number of employees, Inekon Ltd. is a small firm, but its turnover ranks it in a different category. About 30 people made 1.7 billion [currency not specified] last year, and the company foresees 2 billion this year. The company was established in 1990, and made a profit in the trade in chemical products. Later, they returned to trading in products with which the founders have experience: engineering products. Director Josef Husek admits that even their experience was not good enough to prevent the company "falling for" the so-called spisky [Russian word for lists] that were drafted by the then Soviet Union and the Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Ministry. In good faith, believing that these lists were a binding document, Inekon exported 200 CKD-made [Ceskomoravska Kolben Danek-made] locomotives to the Soviet Union. Only half of them have been paid for, the rest represents their dollar-denominated claim in Russia. Josef Husek affirms that the company is delivering goods to Russia and other former countries of the Soviet Union only against cash payments (in convertible currencies), and even against advance cash payments. According to Husek, Western European, U.S., and Japanese firms set the same conditions. The Inekon company is trading on its own account. It exports locomotives, street cars, and trolleybuses. According to the company, enterprises in Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, or Kazakhstan are willing to pay, but the company is afraid that Czech suppliers may not be able to manufacture and deliver the required products on time. Inekon has certain reservations about the Association of Czech Exporters and the assistance provided by chambers [of commerce]. A View From the Other Side Alexander Safonov, chief of the Economic Department at the Trade Mission of the Russian Federation, explains in good Czech that the Czech-Russian trade has gotten over the "shocks" already. In 1991, this trade survived the transition to convertible currencies, in 1992, the breakup of the Soviet Union, and in 1993, the establishment of the Czech Republic. Nevertheless, Safonov stresses that the Russian market is far from "easy," since the Russian industrial lobby is fighting for the protection of the Russian market against "foreign intruders." According to Safonov, Russian foreign trade is liberal, and its legal and legislative basis is basically a standard one. Nevertheless, while the list of products for which import licenses are required is being reduced, the control of the export of strategic materials is being intensified, and so is the control of the quality of imported goods. Licenses for the export of strategic materials are issued only within the quotas fixed by the state (crude oil, gas, electricity, nonferrous metals, corn, certain fish products, uncut diamonds, etc.). By a decree of the Russian president last year, Russian enterprises that are conducting trade with former COMECON [CEMA] countries have been exempted from the obligation to sell half of their foreign currency income to the state. However, this applies only to the trade that is conducted in national currencies, which, on the other hand, is not the case when strategic materials are exported from Russia. Safonov believes that the "trend to use national currencies in mutual trade between the Russian Federation and the Czech Republic is a sound trend, the development of which can contribute to the smoothness of accounting." The Russian representative draws the attention of the Czech manufacturers to the fact that the Czech products will have to compete with Asian and Western products on the Russian markets. The export of these products is often subsidized. According to him, Asian and Western firms deliver goods while using state-subsidized credits, and enjoy state-provided support when establishing and operating information services, etc. The Czech Government Is Also Doing Its Best Jan Hronik, chief of the department in charge of countries with transition economies at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, points to the fact that we have succeeded in stopping the decline in Czech exports into the countries of the former USSR, while imports have declined, which means that the trade balance has begun to improve. Last year's deficit declined by one third compared with 1992. Hronik is saying that after the Czech Republic was established, it was necessary to start negotiations on drafting and signing standard legal documents, and, today, they have been signed with Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other countries of the former USSR. Today, the Ministry of Finance, in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade, is drafting additional important documents regarding the support for and the mutual protection of investments, and on preventing double taxation. The Czech and Russian sides have agreed on the establishment of the Czech-Russian Intergovernmental Commission for solving the most important and topical problems. The Czech claims certainly are one of those problems. Ivan Kocarnik chairs the Czech part of the Commission. At present, a protocol on mutual deliveries of goods between the Czech Republic and the Russian Federation is being drafted for 1994. A list of products in high demand will certainly be attached as a supplement to this protocol. Evidently, after the experience of 1991, no one in the Czech Republic will consider these lists to be a guarantee for exports--or payments. What About the Future? Everyone with whom we have spoken--in the sphere of trade and in the state administration--agrees that Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union are, prospectively, a very important market. To make these prospects materialize in the nearest future, exporters must have the knowledge of the place, the people, and the milieu. They must have their own man in Russia. They must verify that their partner is solvent--at least in rubles, since the Russian internal convertibility will secure them access to the freely convertible currencies. Since the Russian manufacturers are pushing for the protection of their markets, it seems that the transfer of production into Russia--that is, establishing joint ventures--could become a partial solution. The infamous lack of technological discipline is not necessarily an evil. When stricter control is applied, discipline can be improved. Moreover, the sharp increase in transport tariffs in Russia, which makes Czech imports logically more expensive, would not play an important role if the production was launched on the market there. Some experts believe that joint ventures would contribute to the unfreezing of Czech claims. However, the manufacturing and commercial circles are pointing to the fact that the government is expected to do something about it. The government should try to find a global solution for dealing with the Russian side (a task for the Intergovernmental Commission?). The Czech Government is expected to persuade the Russian side to be more willing to meet us halfway and to waive the requirement that the exporters to the Czech Republic must "offer" half of their foreign currency income to the Russian state coffers. This requirement is hampering the development of barter deals, despite the fact that Russia does have certain regards for the suppliers from the former CEMA countries. When asked whether the government should exert pressure on the Russian Government, tradesmen speak about a trade-off. Of course, the Czech exporters to Russia would be happy if a law existed on support to exports that would provide them with easy access to cheaper and long-term credits. They have come to terms with the fact that guarantees are rare. The largest companies, however, want to feel the "state" presence from time to time. The minister's visit to these territories is also an important proexport measure, despite the fact that he only shook hands and smiled at everyone.
