FR940124-0-00019 FR940124-0-00002 In its August 17, 1993, letter to the State, OSM cautioned that such exclusion would render Wyoming's statute less effective than the Federal regulations requirements and less stringent than the requirements of SMCRA. In its October 7, 1993, reply to OSM's concerns, Wyoming did not address this issue. Additionally, OSM cannot determine whether the use of the term ``fish and wildlife habitat'' in this definition means fish and wildlife habitat for ESA purposes or fish and wildlife habitat as a land use. Based on the above discussion the Director finds that the proposed statutory definition at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx) is not in accordance with and is less effective than the Federal program requirements and is not approving the proposed definition. Wyoming is required to either repeal this statutory definition or modify it to be in accordance with and no less effective than the Federal program requirements. 4. W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b): Establishing Standards Wyoming proposes to revise existing W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) as follows (proposed language in upper case): (b) To the extent federal law or regulations require consultation and approval by state wildlife agencies regarding surface mining lands to be reclaimed for fish and wildlife habitat, the Wyoming game and fish department shall consider fish and wildlife habitat to mean as defined in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi) and does not include grazingland as defined in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvii). IN ESTABLISHING RECLAMATION STANDARDS PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION AND APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW OR REGULATION THE COUNCIL SHALL APPLY THE DEFINITIONS OF W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi) THROUGH (xxx). a. Proposed Statutory Provision The proposed new language requires the Environmental Quality Council to use the following specific statutory definitions when establishing standards regarding required consultation and approval by State wildlife agencies when lands are to be reclaimed for fish and wildlife habitat: ``Fish and wildlife habitat'' land use (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi)); ``Grazingland'' land use (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvii)); ``Agricultural lands'' (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxviii)); ``Critical habitat'' (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxix)); and, ``Important habitat or crucial habitat'' (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx)). The statutory definitions for fish and wildlife habitat and grazingland are existing definitions that were previously approved by OSM. The statutory definitions for agricultural lands, critical habitat, and important habitat or crucial habitat were proposed by Wyoming in this amendment. As discussed in Findings 1, 2, and 3, the three proposed definitions referenced in this provision, W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxviii), (xxix) and (xxx), are not being approved by OSM. This provision, if approved, would inappropriately reference the disapproved definitions. Furthermore, the Environmental Quality Council is already required, by existing W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b), to use the land use definitions of fish and wildlife habitat and grazingland at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi) and (xxvii) when developing reclamation standards for those two postmining land uses. The proposed additional language is redundant and confusing. Based on the foregoing, the Director finds that the proposed revision to W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) is less stringent than SMCRA and less effective than the Federal regulations and is not approving it. The Director is requiring Wyoming to repeal this provision. b. Existing Statutory Provision On February 21, 1990, OSM required Wyoming, by letter, pursuant to 30 CFR 732 (required amendment), to revise its program to be no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3)(i). In the cover letter to this submittal, Wyoming specified that existing W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) and W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi), approved by OSM on July 8, 1992 (57 FR 30121), satisfy the required amendment of February 21, 1990. Wyoming did not, at that time, identify the submission of proposed W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) and W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi) as a response to the required amendment of February 21, 1990, but rather as a State-initiated amendment. OSM approved W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) and W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi) as a State initiative, leaving the required amendment outstanding. Wyoming now contends that the language approved in the previous program amendment was intended to address the portion of the February 21, 1990, required amendment pertaining to consultation and approval by the appropriate State agencies responsible for fish and wildlife habitat land uses. Accordingly, OSM has reviewed the State provision at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b), as well as the existing State provision at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi), to determine if Wyoming has satisfied the required program amendment. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3)(i) provide as follows: (b) Standards for [revegetation] success shall be applied in accordance with the approved postmining land use and, at a minimum, the following conditions: *␣*␣* (3) For areas to be developed for fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, shelter belts, or forest products, success of vegetation shall be determined on the basis of tree and shrub stocking and vegetative ground cover. Such parameters are described as follows:
