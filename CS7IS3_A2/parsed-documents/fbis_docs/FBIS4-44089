Their hour-long talks during a break at the Corfu EC summit were described by British officials as "productive and cordial." The optimism raised expectations that the two will be able to clear remaining obstacles to the publication of a framework agreement on a political settlement at an Anglo-Irish summit in July. The document is seen as essential to ending the vacuum in Northern Ireland following December's Downing Street declaration. Teams of officials from both governments accompanied Mr Major and Mr Reynolds to Corfu and got down to work last night on resolving differences over the repeal of Dublin's constitutional claim to Ulster and over the shape and authority of proposed joint boards to enhance cooperation. The framework document will cover relations between London and Dublin, cross-border co-operation and outline plans for a new assembly in Northern Ireland. It is intended as the basis for restarting talks between the constitutional parties. The most controversial element is the proposal for new north-south institutions in Ireland, which is expected to arouse opposition from Ulster Unionists who will see it as a further surrender of sovereignty. Mr Major is prepared to have cross-border executive boards to oversee a common approach to areas such as transport, energy, agriculture and tourism provided it is balanced by Dublin's agreement to repeal legislation giving it a constitutional claim to the province. Richard Savill, Irish Correspondent, writes: Earlier it was disclosed that Mr Reynolds considered a united Ireland "by agreement and consent" would provide the best solution for the problems of Ulster -- an objective rejected by Unionists. His comment is contained in a letter to the hardline Ulster Democratic Party which sought clarification of his interpretation of the Downing Street declaration. Last night Mr Jim Wilson the Ulster Unionist general secretary, accused Mr Reynolds of "pouring petrol on the fire" at a time when the province was "volatile." In Dublin, more than a third of the submissions to a Sinn Fein peace commission which took soundings from republicans and nationalists after the declaration have urged the IRA to call a unilateral ceasefire.
