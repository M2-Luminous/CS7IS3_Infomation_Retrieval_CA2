Authority: 12 U.S.C. 1707; 42 U.S.C. 3535(d). Subpart A_General Provisions §266.1 Purpose and scope. (a) Authority and scope. (1) Section 542 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 directs the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, acting through the Federal Housing Administration, to carry out programs that will demonstrate the effectiveness of providing new forms of Federal credit enhancement for multifamily loans. Section 542, entitled, ``Multifamily Mortgage Credit Demonstrations,'' provides new independent insurance authority that is not under the National Housing Act. (2) Section 542(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 specifically directs the Secretary to carry out a pilot program of risk-sharing with qualified State and local housing finance agencies (HFAs). The qualified HFAs are authorized to underwrite and process loans. HUD will provide full mortgage insurance on affordable multifamily housing projects processed by such HFAs under this program. Through risk-sharing agreements with HUD, HFAs contract to reimburse HUD for a portion of the loss from any defaults that occur while HUD insurance is in force. (3) The extent to which HUD will direct qualified HFAs regarding their underwriting standards and loan terms and conditions is related to the proportion of the risk taken by an HFA. (b) Purpose. The primary purpose of this pilot program is to test the effectiveness of providing new forms of credit enhancement for multifamily loans, i.e., utilization of full insurance by HUD, pursuant to risk-sharing agreements with qualified housing finance agencies, for the development of affordable housing. The utilization of Federal credit enhancements should increase access to capital markets and, thereby, increase the supply of affordable multifamily housing. By permitting HFAs to underwrite, process, and service loans and to manage and dispose of properties that fall into default, HUD expects affordable housing to be made available to eligible families and individuals in a timely manner. §266.5 Definitions. Act means the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, as amended. Affordable housing means a project in which 20 percent or more of the units are both rent-restricted and occupied by families whose income is 50 percent or less of the area median income as determined by HUD, with adjustments for household size, or in which 40 percent (25 percent in New York City) or more of the units are both rent-restricted and occupied by families whose income is 60 percent or less of the area median income as determined by HUD, with adjustments for household size. A residential unit is rent-restricted if the gross rent with respect to such unit does not exceed 30 percent of the imputed income limitation applicable to such unit. Board and Care/Assisted Living Facility means a residential facility for independent living that is regulated by State or local government that provides continuous protective oversight and assistance with the activities of daily living to frail elderly persons or other persons needing such assistance. Continuous protective oversight may range from as little as awareness on the part of management staff of residents' whereabouts (and the ability to intervene in the event of crisis) to a higher level of services and assistance. Assistance with the activities of daily living may include, but is not limited to, bathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed or chairs, walking, going outdoors, using the toilet, laundry, home management, meal preparation, shopping, supervision of medication, and housework. Commissioner means the Federal Housing Commissioner or his or her authorized representative.
