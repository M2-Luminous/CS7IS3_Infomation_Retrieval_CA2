Takemura told a press conference, "it may be difficult for the government to decide on the contents of the package by the end of the day." The ruling coalition is split over whether or not to introduce a new national welfare tax to finance the planned tax reduction, the focus of the economic pump-primer reportedly worth 15 trillion yen, the largest ever. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest force in the coalition, is dead-set against the proposal and has threatened to withdraw its officials from the cabinet if the government pushes ahead with the plan. Takemura also said the Democratic Socialist Party, another component of the coalition, urged Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to give up the new tax idea and give further debate to the issue on how to offset the tax cut. A government source said Hosokawa is unlikely to rethink his decision on the proposal. "The prime minister is determined. I don't think he will change his mind," said the source.
