The secretary for foreign affairs in the Libyan General People's Congress, Saad Mustafa Mujbar [name and title as received], said Wednesday his country commended Malaysia for reserving its stand on imposing wide sanctions against Libya. The sanctions were imposed in April 1992 following Libya's refusal to hand over two of its citizens for trial in the United States in connection with the 1988 bombing of Pan America Flight 103 over Lockerbie in Scotland in which 270 people were killed. Mujbar, who leaves for home today after a four-day visit, told a press conference that Libya was ready to co-operate with the international community to reach the truth, but not to the extent of violating its laws and constitution. A proposal by Scotland to have the two suspects tried in Scotland was rejected by the United States, Britain and France.
