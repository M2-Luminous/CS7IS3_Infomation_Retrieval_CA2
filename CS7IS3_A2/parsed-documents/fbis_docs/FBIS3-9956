The complaining parties stated their disagreement with the imposed sentences by saying the investigations in this case were neither thorough nor impartial, that the trial was not, in their opinion, "trustworthy," and that its objective was "to shield" Armed Forces and military intelligence top commanders . The Military Court of the Supreme Council of Military Justice delivered sentences yesterday ranging from one to 20 years in prison against the individuals accused of kidnapping and murdering a professor and nine students of a Lima university named La Cantuta. The event, which occurred early 18 July 1992, generated a confrontation between the political opposition and the Armed Forces, whose top commander, Nicolas Hermoza, went as far as warning he "would not tolerate" any campaign of discredit against the military institution. Army Commander Hermoza and Presidential Adviser Vladimiro Montesinom, a member of the National Intelligence Service, have been accused by General Rodolfo Robles, who is self-exiled in Argentina for directing "death squadrons." The two have been accused of being involved in the La Cantuta case. Saul Cuadros, one of the attorneys of relatives of the civilian victims, has said: "Everything indicates the government has politicized the objective of the process so that in a not too distant future the convicts may benefit from an amnesty or a pardon." Cuadros said during the trial, which was held behind closed doors and under strict security measures at the Simon Bolivar Barracks of Lima's Pueblo Libre District, no evidence was presented and no witness was called to the stand. Enrique Bernales, a former UN Human Rights Commission relator, has affirmed no investigation has been carried out and that the quick sentencing indicates "everything was ready beforehand." He said the sentences were passed before the case was transferred to the military. The ruling came only 48 hours after the files on the case were received, and "it is impossible to read such a voluminous file in such a short period." The government representatives have praised the military judges, though, noting the sentences are a "very good example" for the Andean country. Carlos Torres, first vice president of the Peruvian Congress, has said the sentences have no precedent "in the legal history of Peru or Latin America." President Alberto Fujimori has termed the sentences "drastic and exemplary," and he discarded the possibility of any member of the Armed Forces Command being involved in the death of the 10 civilians, as relatives of the victims, the political opposition, and the independent media have charged. Legislator Gloria Helfer, of the Democratic Left Movement, commenting on what Torres has said, stated the military court "can break any fast-reading world record after having read and analyzed a file containing thousands of pages." Roger Caceres, former president of the Legislative Branch human rights commission, has said: "Sooner or later, the La Cantuta case will have to be reassessed in a legal and moral framework that is impartial and just." Guatemalan Rigoberta Menchu, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who has visited Lima to inaugurate the first Latin American Rural Organizations Congress on 21 February, called for a more exemplary punishment for the military personnel and for the trial to be directed toward a civilian court. The military court sentenced Majors Santiago Martin Rivas and Carlos Pichilingue Guevara to 20 years in prison. They were found guilty of being the direct authors of the crime and of having acted on their own, without the knowledge of the Armed Forces command staff. To justify the transfer of the "La Cantuta" case to the military courts, Colonel Raul Talledo, the military prosecutor, has said the crime had been committed while on duty in an area that was in a state of emergency due to the political violence. During the trial, which lasted three days, the military court also sentenced noncommissioned officers Julio Chuqui Aguirre, Jesus Sosa Saavedra, Nelson Carbajal Garcia, and Pedro Suppo Sanchez to 15 years in prison. General Juan Rivero Lazo, who was director of Army intelligence when the military personnel raided "La Cantuta" University in eastern Lima, was sentenced to five years in prison, and Colonel Federico Navarro to two years. Both were found guilty of negligence. Captain Jose Velarde Astete was given a year, the lowest sentence, as it was considered his participation in the crime had been minimal. Furthermore, the military court absolved Col. Manuel Guzman Calderon and reserved its sentence on Lieutenant Aquilino Portella, who was tried in absence because he escaped to a foreign country.
