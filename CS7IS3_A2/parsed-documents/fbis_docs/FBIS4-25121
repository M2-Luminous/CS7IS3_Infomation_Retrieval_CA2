I hope Japan and other nations will put pressure on China to halt the infringement of human rights in Tibet." The Tibetan religions leader granted the interview during his brief half-day stopover in Japan on his way to the United States for a meeting with American scientists. In the interview, the Dalai Lama stressed there is no change in his position stressed in the 1988 Strasburg proposal that he does not seek complete the independence of Tibet, and will allow China to retain its power to handle Tibet's foreign and defense policies. In the interview, he candidly admitted that the Chinese Government has yet to make any positive response to his proposal. Asked who will succeed the Panchen Lama, the Buddhist leader in Tibet who ranks 2nd only to the Dalai Lama in the Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy, the Tibetan religious leader said he has a list of candidates compiled by China and which contains five candidates. During the interview, he disclosed that he asked the Chinese Government to choose a successor to the Panchen Lama based on traditional methods, not on political reasons. He also proposed sending a survey team to that end, but the Chinese Government has rejected his request.
