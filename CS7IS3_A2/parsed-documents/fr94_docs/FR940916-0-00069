FR940916-0-00069 FR940916-0-00018 Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The FAA's criteria for a small aircraft manufacturer is one employing fewer than 75 employees. A substantial number is a number that is not fewer than 11 and is more than one-third of the small entities subject to the rule. A significant impact is one having an annual cost of more than $14,900 (1987 dollars) per manufacturer. A review of domestic helicopter manufacturing companies indicates that there are fewer than eleven small helicopter manufacturers. Therefore, the amendments to Parts 27 and 29 will not affect a substantial number of small entities. Trade Impact Analysis The rule changes will have little or no impact on trade for both U.S. firms doing business in foreign countries and foreign firms doing business in the United States. In the U.S. market, foreign manufacturers will have the option of designing engines and helicopters capable of satisfying the new OEI ratings and, therefore, will not be at a competitive disadvantage with U.S. manufacturers. Because of the large U.S. market, foreign manufacturers are likely to certificate their rotorcraft to U.S. rules, which will limit any competitive advantage U.S. manufacturers might gain in foreign markets. Federalism Implications The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that these amendments do not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. These amendments are considered nonsignificant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 CFR 11034; February 26, 1979). A regulatory evaluation of the amendments, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the docket.

List of Subjects in 14 CFR Parts 27 and 29 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Rotorcraft, Safety. Adoption of the Amendments Accordingly, Parts 27 and 29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Parts 27 and 29) are amended as follows: PART 27_AIRWORTHINESS STANDARDS: NORMAL CATEGORY ROTORCRAFT 1. The authority citation for Part 27 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 1344, 1354(a), 1355, 1421, 1423, 1425, 1428, 1429, and 1430; 49 U.S.C. 106(g). 2. Section 27.923 is amended by revising paragraph (e) to read as follows: ยง27.923 Rotor drive system and control mechanism tests. * * * * * (e) A 10-hour part of the test prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section must be run at not less than takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque. The main and auxiliary rotor controls must be in the normal position for vertical ascent. (1) For multiengine rotorcraft for which the use of 21/2 minute OEI power is requested, 12 runs during the 10-hour test must be conducted as follows: (i) Each run must consist of at least one period of 21/2 minutes with takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque on all engines. (ii) Each run must consist of at least one period for each engine in sequence, during which that engine simulates a power failure and the remaining engines are run at 21/2 minute OEI torque and the maximum speed for use with 21/2 minute OEI torque for 21/2 minutes. (2) For multiengine turbine-powered rotorcraft for which the use of 30-second and 2-minute OEI power is requested, 10 runs must be conducted as follows:
