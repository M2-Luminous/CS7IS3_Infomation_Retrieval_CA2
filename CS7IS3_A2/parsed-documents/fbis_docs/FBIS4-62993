According to the Russian president, the head of the two countries discussed political, socio-economic issues and international problems. "It is very good that there is no pause in our relations: the recently elected new Finnish president paid one of his first visits to Russia," Yeltsin said. Apart from the Russian president, the official talks are being attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin and other officials. "There are no political problems between the two countries," said Russian President Boris Yeltsin, answering journalists' questions about the results of Russo-Finnish summit talks. Yeltsin said that during one-on-one talks with the Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari as well as during talks between the Russian and Finnish delegations about 20 different problems were discussed. Yeltsin pointed out that on all international problems, including the Yugoslav crisis, the position of the two sides coincide. In particular, the Russian president mentioned the construction of a big gas pipe line Yamburg-Germany in the north with an extension to Finland. According to the Russian president, an agreement was reached on the settlement of the problem of Russia's inconsiderable foreign debt. There is no agreement between Russia and Finland yet on double taxation and protection of investments, the Russian president said, adding that the sides agreed to prepare such agreements. Yeltsin pointed out that one of the main problems discussed was Russia's decision to give special guarantees to foreign companies which will make investments into Russia at the level of the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry, guaranteeing them against political risks. "This was one of the most important questions raised by foreign companies which was lifted today," Yeltsin said. For his part, the Finnish president said that the fact that he arrived in Russia almost immediately after he was elected president shows that relations of cooperation between the two countries are at a good level. Bilateral economic cooperation has been successfully developing for a number of years, Ahtisaari said. The Finnish president shared Yeltsin's opinion that there are no political problems between the two countries. He expressed the hope that in future, when Finland joins the economic union, its cooperation with Russia will successfully develop as well.
