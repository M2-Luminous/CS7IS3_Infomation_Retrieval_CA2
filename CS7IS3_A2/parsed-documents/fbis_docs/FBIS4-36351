In press statements published in the Tunisian capital yesterday, brother Abu-'Ala' added that brother Abu-'Ammar and senior Palestinian officials will not return to Jericho and Gaza Strip prior to the meeting due to be held by donor nations in Paris on 9-10 June. It should be recalled that brother president Abu-'Ammar said in a statement to a U.S. television network that he will not leave for the autonomous areas unless the international community quickly fulfills its financial commitments to the Palestinian self-rule. In his statements, brother Abu-'Ala' noted that the [Palestinian] leadership is facing acute financial problems. He added that this issue was raised by brother president Abu-'Ammar during a recent meeting he had with a U.S. Senate delegation in Tunis. Brother Abu-'Ala' emphasized that the Palestinian administration badly needs the required funds to pay the salaries of Palestinian policemen and employees, and also to rehabilitate and rebuild Gaza and the West Bank, particularly since Israel has exploited the resources of these two areas and caused immense damage there. Brother Abu-'Ala' also hoped that the Paris talks, which will follow up on financial and economic issues regarding the autonomy authority, will adequately and shortly settle the problem pertaining to the disbursement of pledged funds, which he said is worrying Palestinian leaders and strugglers.
