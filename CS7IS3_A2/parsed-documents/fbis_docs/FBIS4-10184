He did say, however, that to achieve this the current consumption rate should be reduced. Speaking at the American Club yesterday to a group of businessmen, Cavallo said he does not foresee President Carlos Menem asking for his resignation in the near future. He also added: "I am not thinking about resigning, I will carry on for a long time, I hope." He repeated, however, that should this event take place "there will surely by an economic team as good if not better than the present one." Cavallo even went one step further and added that "if, for example, the Radical Party win the next elections, they will not do what (Raul) Alfonsin tells them, rather they will field a much better team than us and manage the economy just as we are doing." Cavallo insisted that "one day" he would "cease to be a minister" but "there would be no discontinuity in President Carlos Menem's administration." Continuing on this issue he said: "President Menem's government will probably continue until 1999 and he guessed that "I will probably continue at the head of this Ministry. If I were not here or were only heading a partial Ministry, then whoever replaced me would not stop the work being done or propose a different team, but would complete the reorganization task," Cavallo added. Cavallo also said that now that the US economy is picking up those dollars that are not injected into the capital markets "should be obtained in exchange for our exports." He said that recessionary measures or a devaluation are not the way to increase production, rather investments," Cavallo added. Cavallo also admitted that to encourage exports, "more favourable relative prices are needed than there have been in the last three years." He pointed out that these will be achieved by "working on the service prices, all production costs, and the tax systems that distort companies expenses." During his speech Cavallo lashed out at Bolsa Stock Exchange President Jorge Berrardi his "lack of professionalism and seriousness in the statements he made. Berrardi had criticized the 3.75-percent commission the banks charged in the repurchase of YPF shares as excessive. "With these sort of opinions, how are we going to have a stable market?" Cavallo wondered.
