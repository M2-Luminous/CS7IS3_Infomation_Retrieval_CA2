FR941028-2-00133 FR941028-2-00093 Similar to MCC's and SCCP's current interfaces with NSCC's FITS for municipal securities, 6 all trade comparisons for corporate bonds and UITs will be conducted at NSCC and not at either MCC or SCCP. Under the expanded interfaces, the earlier cutoff times for the input by MCC and SCCP participants of two-side original trade information that were previously applicable for municipal securities trades now will be applicable to trades in corporate bonds and unit investment trusts. MCC's cutoff time for submission by its participants of original trade input will be 7:00 P.M. (central time) on the trade date and 4:00 P.M. (central time) on the day following the trade date (``T+1'') for supplemental trade input. SCCP's cutoff time for submission by its participants of original trade input will be 1:00 A.M. (eastern time) on trade date, and adjustments to original trade input must be made prior to 4:00 P.M. (eastern time) on T+1. 7 Because NSCC will be transmitting comparison reports to MCC and SCCP reflecting the compared trades of MCC and SCCP participants early in the morning on T+1, MCC and SCCP will produce contract reports for their participants by 8:00 A.M. (central time) and 9:00 A.M. (eastern time), respectively, on T+1. The interface will enable MCC and SCCP participants to take full advantage of the NSCC expansion of FITS. 6 For a complete description of the original MCC and SCCP interface with NSCC's FITS, see Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33524 (January 26, 1994), 59 FR 4958 [File Nos. SR&hyph;MCC&hyph;93&hyph;04 and SCCP&hyph;93&hyph;03] (order approving establishment of interfaces with NSCC's FITS). 7 The SCCP cutoff times referred to above are for automated input. SCCP's cutoff time for manual submission of original trade input will be 4:00 P.M. (eastern time) on trade date. Manual input adjustments to original trade input must be made prior to 1:00 P.M. (eastern time) on T+1. (B) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Burden on Competition MCC and SCCP do not believe that the proposed rule changes will impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. (C) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Changes Received from Members, Participants or Others Comments were neither solicited nor received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Changes and Timing for Commission Action Section 17A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act directs the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. 8 Because the expanded interfaces enable MCC and SCCP participants to utilize FITS with all its benefits, the Commission believes, for all the reasons set forth in the FITS approval order, 9 that the proposed rule changes filed by MCC and SCCP further this goal. 8 15 U.S.C. ยง78q&hyph;1(a)(2)(A)(i) (1988). 9 Supra note 4. MCC and SCCP have requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed rule changes because accelerated approval will allow MCC participants and SCCP participants to utilize and to take full advantage of the benefits of the expanded FITS as soon as it is operational at NSCC. Furthermore, the Commission has previously published notice of and approved NSCC's implementation of the enhanced FITS. NSCC's proposed rule change did not generate any comment letters, and none are expected on MCC's and SCCP's proposals. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submission should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule changes that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule changes between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 5th Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filings will also be available at the principal offices of MCC and SCCP. All submissions should refer to File Nos. SR&hyph;MCC&hyph;94&hyph;13 and SR&hyph;SCCP&hyph;94&hyph;06 and should be submitted by November 18, 1994. On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act, particularly with Section 17A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR&hyph;MCC&hyph;94&hyph;13 and SR&hyph;SCCP&hyph;94&hyph;06) be, and hereby are, approved. For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 10 10 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1994).
