Chao said both sides of the Taiwan Strait should step up communications, and that if mainland representatives visited here, they would realize the fact that Taiwan is a political entity. SEF is a semi-official organization set up to deal with civilian exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Chao [words indistinct] he has invited Deng Pufang, son of Mainland China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, to visit Taiwan [words indistinct] any message through Deng Pufang to his father. But he said he would not be opposed to inviting Deng here, saying his visit would help cross-strait relations. On his proposed meeting with Tang Shubei, standing vice chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), Chao said that he hopes Tang can come to Taiwan in July or August. The previous Chao-Tang meeting, held early this year produced no concrete results on the issues of the repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants and hijackers, and fishery disputes. Meanwhile, on Saturday, SEF again sent a message to ARATS concerning the Qiandao Lake incident in March, in which 24 Taiwan tourists were murdered. It was the ninth time he has asked ARATS for help in resolving the incident. In this case, SEF asked ARATS which insurance companies and travel agents will be involved in compensating families of the Taiwan victims. Relatives of the Taiwan victims Friday protested to the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), criticizing the government's efforts to resolve the affair as weak. They faulted MAC and SEF for their incompetence in negotiating a conclusion to the incident.
