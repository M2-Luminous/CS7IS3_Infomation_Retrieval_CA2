This is how Italy is trying to meet the Kremlin's demands to play a larger part in solving the world's major problems. Here is a report from Moscow. [Begin correspondent Lucio Gambacorta recording] Minister Andreatta spoke about the crisis situation in Europe, first with President Boris Yeltsin and then in more detail with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Andreatta was representing the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, of which he is currently chairman. The talks were based around three main points: 1. The crisis in Yugoslavia and the Serbian position with regard to the new Croatian-Muslim federation. There was no mention of Italian blue helmets possibly being sent to Bosnia. 2. In the Baltics -- Andreatta left Moscow for Estonia this evening -- Italy wants the Russian minority's civil rights to be respected. 3. The G-7. Italy is preparing a program for the forthcoming Naples summit in July. Some members, especially Japan, are perplexed about the idea of widening the group to admit Russia, and Russia's bid to join the group of the most industrialized countries will have to be taken one step at a time. The Kremlin's foreign policy will no doubt be the subject of political discussions, but in Naples only seven nations will participate in economic talks. [end recording]
