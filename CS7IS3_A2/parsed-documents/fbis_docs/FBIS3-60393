Analysts at Manchester University's chemistry department have detected highly radioactive soil around two manholes from a hazardous waste disposal pipeline leading from Aldermaston to the Thames. At the first site, opposite a row of houses between the villages of Tadley and Padworth -- and within 500 yards of the plant -- they detected plutonium levels 20 times above the Government's radioactive waste threshold of 400 becquerels per kilogram. At the second roadside site, next to an equestrian centre and a few hundred yards from Padworth, plutonium levels were 12 times the minimum. The monitoring, commissioned by Greenpeace, undermines previous claims by the Ministry of Defence-owned plant that `low-level' leaks from sections of the pipeline had only released radioactivity `slightly above the regulatory threshold.' Tomorrow Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, will demand that the MoD reveal all the contaminated sections of pipeline in the interests of public safety. Aldermaston has previously refused to reveal the sites, all of which are on land with public access, claiming they pose `no danger to landowners or to the public.' By contrast, the plant's neighbour, Blue Circle Cement, which is suing the MoD over the separate contamination of its property, has fenced off the polluted area and put up public warning signs. The Greenpeace report, to be published tomorrow, is the latest in a series of safety scares to plague the ageing Aldermaston plant, which makes the warheads for Britain's Trident missiles. Earlier this year The Observer revealed how nearly 100 employees had been killed, badly injured or contaminated in the course of more than a thousand accidents and at least 252 separate fires. Two more serious incidents have occurred in the last few weeks. On 3 September, the Health and Safety Executive ordered the plant to shut down equipment in the A45 facility, where the warheads are manufactured, after radiation leaked into waste receptacles. The HSE enforcement stated that `all necessary steps to restrict ... exposure of employees to ionising radiation have not been taken.' Then, on 11 November, the plant's liquid water treatment plant was temporarily closed after high levels of radiation were recorded in a sludge tank. An MoD spokesman stated that official monitoring of the pipeline was `comprehensive' and only very low levels of radioactivity had been detected.
