Speaking at the 16th trade conference, Hata said, "the reform will likely involve pain. But the government's goal of upgrading the overall standard of the Japanese people cannot be achieved without such efforts," according to an official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The conference took place at the prime minister's official residence, with foreign businesspeople attending a meeting of the highest trade body of the government for the first time. The meeting is designed to receive views and opinions from government officials and business leaders on deregulation and other market-opening measures announced at the end of March, the official told reporters. Horst Kramp, the head of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said most of the trade barriers that afflicted foreigners in the past have been successfully removed. But Japan should make further efforts to get rid of remaining barriers, such as administrative guidance that effectively limits foreign business activity and complex business licensing procedures, Kramp said, according to the official. James Wogsland, vice chairman of Caterpillar Inc. of the United States, urged the Japanese Government to identify and remove trade barriers on a sector-by-sector basis. He also demanded that Japan reform its distribution system to facilitate penetration of imports. Suvit Wanglee, the head of the Board of Trade of Thailand, voiced hope the Japanese business community, especially corporations operating in Thailand, will cooperate with local companies in order to foster Thai industries. "Japan should serve as a locomotive for world economic growth," the official quoted Suvit as saying.
