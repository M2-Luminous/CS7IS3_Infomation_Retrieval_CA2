According to the Croatian minister both countries may cooperate in all fields and in some branches such as shipyard and petrochemical industries, and tourism, they may compete on the third markets. The Polish side hopes for the cooperation in textiles, food processing, petrochemical and electrochnics industries. Also the Adriatic will hopefully arouse strong interest for Polish tourists. Maciej Lesny from the Polish ministry said that Poland will soon sign agreements with Croatia on avoiding double taxation and on protection of mutual investments. Trade turnover between the two countries have been gradually going down from 68 million U.S. dollars in 1991 to 62,4 million dollars in 1993, the decrease caused by Croatian unstable political situation.
