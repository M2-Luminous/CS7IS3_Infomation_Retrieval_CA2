"Right here, when the invasion war was at its peak, President Ho Chi Minh declared: The war may prolong to five, ten, or 20 years or longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and certain industrial cities may be damaged. But the Vietnamese people are not in fear. Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. "Uncle Ho spoke about the willpower, determination, and aspirations of the entire people who had been miserably living long nights of slavery with only oppression, prison, and wars, but not democracy and human rights. In order to achieve the present glorious victory, our people in the entire country exerted their utmost efforts and endured much long suffering. Dozens of millions of compatriots and soldiers contributed outstanding service. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers were killed in prisons and battlefields. Our Vietnamese people eternally acknowledge and voluminously appreciate the fallen combatants who sacrificed themselves for the nation's independence and people's freedom and democracy. "On behalf of the party, government, people, and soldiers, I bow myself at the soul of fallen combatants who sacrafied for our great national cause. I deeply appreciate families of fallen combatants and mothers who bore and brought up brave, stubborn, and loyal children before offering their beloved children for the survival of our fatherland. Especially, the noble mothers who sent off their children for national service three, five, and seven times. And all of them were killed on the battlefields, never returning to their mothers."
