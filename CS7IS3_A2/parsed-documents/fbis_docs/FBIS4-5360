The report is based on an analysis of choices of military measures in case North Korea does not give up nuclear development to the last. U.S. Congressional reports do not necessarily reflect a U.S. Administration's policies. And there has been no sign that the U.S. Administration is considering such a scenario. However, the United States is a country moved by public opinion. U.S. Congressional reports are reference materials for U.S. lawmakers' parliamentary activities. In this regard, the report is noteworthy. It comes as a shock that this U.S. Congressional report has turned to the negotiation strategy of trading the withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the ROK for North Korea's nuclear development. The withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the ROK is the last choice of negotiation strategies. It is natural to doubt if it would be actually realized. It is notable that the withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the ROK was raised after the snag of the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles on its own expenses with an aim to reinforce the U.S. Forces in the ROK in preparation for a possible contingency. It has been learned that our government's odd action of making a military defensive weapon as a diplomatic weapon put the U.S. Forces in the ROK in an awkward situation. Another noteworthy fact is the U.S. military authorities' information analysis that North Korea already has one or two nuclear bombs. Quoting the analysis, the U.S. Congressional report believes that North Korea possesses one or two primitive nuclear bombs and is able to transport them by truck. This is different from our government's opinion which denies the possibility on every occasion. It is puzzling on what basis the government has come to this assertion and to what extent should we believe it. Let us calmly reanalyze North Korea's intention to develop nuclear weapons. There could be many different opinions but it is safe to take the worst possible situation. That is North Korea's long-desired political goal of the withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the ROK is achieved. As long as North Korea believes the nuclear threat could effectively block the involvement of the U.S. Forces in the ROK in the contingency, it will never be satisfied with any carrot other than a condition that could achieve the goal. In this regard, the U.S. Congressional report makes us uncomfortable. Shall we refute that this creates a crisis on the Korean peninsula? Shall we repeat the optimistic observation that North Korea does not possess nuclear weapons? The government should first of all do its best in clearing up distrust and suspicion that the government is doing nothing.
