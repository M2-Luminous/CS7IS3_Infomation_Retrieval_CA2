He said it seemed "unfair to Samper, a president who won the elections honestly, to find himself involved in such a mess." He emphasized that "the transcript you published does not include the part where I said that neither of the two campaigns received money." Giraldo explained that he had spoken to the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers and asked them to contribute to the campaigns. "They gave me discretionary powers," he said, adding that he had met with Santiago Medina, treasurer of the Samper campaign, through Eduardo Mestre. "Eduardo had no connection to the campaign, but he is an important member of the Liberal Party," he said. Giraldo added: "Two days later I spoke with Medina, and he declined the offer, saying that the campaign was being conducted very honestly and that there was an overseer and an ethical prosecutor. Unfortunately, no definite decision was reached." Giraldo said he also had breakfast with Hernan Beltz, financial director for Pastrana's campaign, and made him the same offer. Like Medina, Beltz consulted with the party's board of directors, and their answer was negative. Giraldo added that he "later spoke with Alvaro Pava, who told me he would discuss the offer with Andres. Pava later gave me a negative answer; both sides said no." Giraldo Lopez said he suspects the recording was made by the CIA or DEA, adding that he cannot understand why it was given to Pastrana in Cali by unidentified individuals instead of to the authorities. Giraldo declared "his civil death. I committed civil suicide. However, it is unfair that, due to a mistake by a man like myself and because of an improper action by foreign governments, they should attack Colombia's democracy and taint the credentials of a man like Samper, who won the elections honestly." Alberto Giraldo Lopez sent the following message to EL TIEMPO director Hernando Santos: With a great display of publicity, television and radio newscasts and the press transcribed excerpts of a telephone conversation I held with Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. People who know me know that for many years I have been a friend of the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, who also count among their friends many honest people with whom they discuss various issues including politics, which, to a certain extent, affects them. During the conversation in question, we discussed politics, and the simple truth is the following: I told Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela that I could talk with the candidates' treasurers to see if it would be possible for them to make campaign contributions in an uncompromising manner. In Dr. Ernesto Samper Pizano's camp I spoke with Dr. Santiago Medina, who refused to consider my proposal, because the candidate himself had said that it was essential to keep contributions honest and ordered strict internal supervision. In Dr. Andres Pastrana Arango's camp I spoke on two occasions with Dr. Hernan Beltz Peralta, his campaign manager, and Dr. Alvaro Pava Camelo, director of the Sunday elections [Domingo Electoral]. Both of them refused the contribution with arguments similar to those set forth by Dr. Samper's camp. Both camps deemed the contributions unacceptable, and my efforts proved useless. I called the same number to inform the Rodriguez brothers of this. They said they would respect the campaign treasurers' position, although they were not requesting any services in return. I responded that at any rate the parties had declined the offer in a very courteous manner. Strangely enough, this part of the dialogue was withheld; only the part that could harm Colombian democracy was published.
