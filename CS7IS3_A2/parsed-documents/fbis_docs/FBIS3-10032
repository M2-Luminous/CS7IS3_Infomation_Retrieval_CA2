"They are moving fast because they know that if they do not succeed in reversing the actions they criticize, they will have lost too much ground as the result of internal and external circumstances," Gomez said. During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Gomez, who is also director of AREITO magazine, said there is a big tug-of-war between opposing sides of the Cuban community in the United States. "Those who favor better relations with Cuba have gained ground since Washington lifted the economic sanctions against Vietnam and because of the pro-Cuba activities of an increasing number of U.S. citizens," he added. Gomez emphasized the work of the U.S. ecumenical organization Pastors for Peace, which in 1992 and 1993 breached the blockade by taking humanitarian aid from the continental United States to Cuba, clearly violating the embargo. "Pastors for Peace are again gathering goods for the island. Unlike previous years, this time the authorities are giving them plenty of leeway. I think this is an encouraging sign," Gomez added. The director of AREITO also mentioned the effort of New York Democrat Congressman Charles Rangel, who on 17 March will present Congress with a proposal to call off the embargo. Gomez believes that, in view of the situation, the most recalcitrant exiles must make a show of force or risk losing the traditional government support they have enjoyed since the triumph of the Cuban revolution in 1959. "That is why they organized an event on Capitol Hill in Washington on Thursday. They rally was attended by only 1,000 people despite the presence of Robert Torricelli, the congressman who succeeded in having the embargo tightened in 1992." "The recalcitrant ones expected to rally at least 10,000 people. They rented planes and buses in Miami, New Jersey, and other cities, but the event was a political failure. The hard-liners know it, and they are worried," he said. Gomez recalled that Cuban community hard-liners rallied 50,000 people in Miami in October for a similar event. "Of course, the fact that only 1,000 people rallied in Washington does not indicate an absolute loss of rallying power. Moving people a couple of blocks away from home is not the same as moving them thousands of kilometers away. Nevertheless, the refusal to make the effort that all this entails is an indication of little interest in the activity," he said. Gomez is in Mexico City to participate in an International Book Fair, where he will lecture on the book Cuba In the Face of Cynical Logic [Cuba Ante La Razon Cinica] written by Heinz Dietrich Steffan.
