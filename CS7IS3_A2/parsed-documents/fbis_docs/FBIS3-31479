"most warmly" on Thursday thanked the Russian colleagues for a statement of Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, which stated concern over the discussions at NATO about the possibility of air strikes on the targets on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. A telegram expressing thanks was, on behalf of the parliament, sent by speakers of the parliament chambers Radoman Bozovic and Milos Radulovic to their Russian counter-parts, Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Ribkin. The U.N. Security Council in late May 1992 imposed comprehensive and binding sanctions against the F.R.Y. over its alleged involvement in the war of local Serbs, Croats and Moslems in the neighboring, former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. NATO threatened on February 9 to carry out air strikes on positions of the Bosnian Serbs and Moslems, who clashed around Sarajevo unless by Sunday midnight (GMT) heavy weapons were not withdrawn to a distance of 20 kilometers from the center of the city or placed under U.N. control. We are convinced that the appeal of your esteemed parliament for a peaceful settlement of the crisis, lifting of the unjust and inhuman sanctions and reintegration of the F.R.Y. into the world community would be inspiring for friendly Russia to persevere in such initiatives at the U.N. Security Council and that this would mobilize all the justice-loving countries to implement this idea, the telegram said. The solidarity of Duma with the Serbian people "at exceptionally difficult circumstance" was assessed in the telegram as "more than mere encouragement", that is, "as a confirmation of the fact that the Serbian people, in its just resistance to outside pressures, has in the Russian people a true friend and full understanding and support."
