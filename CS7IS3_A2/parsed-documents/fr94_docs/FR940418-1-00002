FR940418-1-00002 FR940418-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 12 CFR Part 3 [Docket No. 94&hyph;05] RIN 1557&hyph;AB14 Capital Adequacy; Net Unrealized Holding Gains and Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is proposing to amend its capital adequacy rules to revise the definition of common stockholders' equity to include unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of applicable tax effects. Inclusion of such unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders' equity is consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,'' and would keep the OCC's definition of common stockholders' equity consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). As Tier 1 capital under the OCC's capital adequacy rules is defined to include common stockholders' equity, this proposal, if adopted, would require these net unrealized holding gains and losses to be considered in determining the amount of an institution's Tier 1 capital. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before May 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the OCC's proposal may be submitted to Docket No. 94&hyph;05, Communications Division, Ninth floor, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 250 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20219. Comments will be available for inspection and photocopying at that address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Zane D. Blackburn, Chief Accountant, (202) 874&hyph;5180; Roger Tufts, Senior Economic Advisor, Office of the Chief National Bank Examiner, (202) 874&hyph;5070; Ronald Shimabukuro, Senior Attorney, Bank Operations and Assets Division, (202) 874&hyph;4460, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under the current OCC minimum capital requirements (leverage ratio) and the risk-based capital guidelines set forth at 12 CFR part 3, a major component of Tier 1 capital is common stockholders' equity. Common stockholders' equity is defined to include (1) common stock, (2) common stock surplus, (3) undivided profits, (4) capital reserves, (5) adjustments for the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation, and (6) net unrealized losses on non- current marketable equity securities. The net unrealized losses are those recorded under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 12, ``Accounting for Certain Marketable Securities'' (SFAS 12). In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,'' (SFAS 115). This statement supersedes SFAS 12 and establishes a new component of common stockholders' equity consisting of net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. Under SFAS 115, available-for-sale securities are those securities which a bank does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, but does not intend to trade actively as part of its trading account. In August 1993, the OCC, the Federal Reserve Board, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, announced the adoption of SFAS 115 for regulatory reporting purposes. The OCC now proposes to adopt SFAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes as well.
