In connection with this, we believe it necessary to provide the citizens with objective information about the questions under discussion. In its everyday activity, the Ministry of Culture and Publishing is guided by the Belarusian Constitution as well as other legislative and normative acts which safeguard state guarantees of the freedom of expression and publishing; the Ministry aims to create favorable conditions for real economic and creative independence of periodical publications and normal functioning of the entire system of national press. With regard to the annulment of the registration certificates of NAVINY BELARUSKAHA NARODNAHA FRONTU "ADRADZHENNE" [BNF News "Revival"] and VYBAR [Choice] (Vitebsk), the resolution on this was adopted in accordance with the law on publishing and other information media. The Article 13 of this law provides: If a publication is not issued or published during over a year, its renewal requires a new registration certificate. The last issue of NAVINY BELARUSKAHA NARODNAHA FRONTU "REVIVAL" is dated 26 March -- 20 April 1993. On 28 February 1994, the founder of the newspaper, Zyanon Paznyak, was asked in a letter to send to the ministry all issues of the newspaper, which were published following 20 April 1993. The ministry has received no answer to this letter. As a consequence, an annulment of the registration certificate was signed (22.04.94). The newspaper VYBAR halted publication due to the fact that its founder -- the Vitebsk City Club "For Democratic Elections" -- has been denied registration by the Vitebsk Executive Committee of people's deputies. In short, the newspaper has lost its founder. Since the statement of the BNF opposition deputies mentions the newspaper SVABODA, it is worth noting that the Ministry of Culture and Publishing has sent notices about violations of the law on publishing and other information media to the SVABODA founder and editorial staff, too. Unfortunately, the provisions contained in legislation has been ignored by them in many cases. SVABODA has often published materials that came into conflict with Article 5 of the law on publishing and other information media, thus becoming a subject of consideration by people's courts. The Ministry of Culture and Publishing thinks that the BNF opposition's statement concerning the competence of the Ministry, is unsubstantiated and does not correspond to reality. In our opinion, this statement appeared due to profit-seeking reasons -- a striving for acquiring political capital during the last stage of the presidential elections in Belarus.
