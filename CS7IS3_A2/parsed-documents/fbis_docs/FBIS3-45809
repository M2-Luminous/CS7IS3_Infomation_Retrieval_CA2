The central government is moving to maintain the economic upturn which could be jeopardized by runaway inflation. Vice-premier and governor of the central bank Zhu Rongji told a national work conference last Saturday that the country must stick to the tight money policy introduced last July. However, runaway inflation caused by overheated growth, will severely damage the work done so far. Moreover, high inflation will also cause social distress and instability. Some economists and politicians believe the government should keep economic growth this year at around 9 percent. They say China should extend the time limit to achieve its target. Early in September last year, economists warned of the consequences of loosened credit policies. The central government had introduced measures to enhance its economic control, especially over credit, when the economy began to overheat -- a problem characterized by chaos in banking and double- digit inflation. Although the trouble in the banking world, such as rampant fund- raising and inter-bank lending, has largely been ironed out in recent months, the monster of high inflation still looms over the economy. Zhu's speech at the weekend aimed to reinforce central government moves to squeeze the money supply and halt price hikes, which haunted the grain market at the end of last year, triggering a buying spree in big cities. State Price Information Centre said the cost-of-living index in 35 large cities hit 23.5 percent last December compared with the same month of the previous year. One root cause of the increasing inflation was excessive investment in fixed assets. In the State sector in the second half of last year it grew by around 65 percent compared with the same period the previous year (see chart 1). And from September, the banks began to take their feet off the brakes on the money supply to meet State-owned enterprises' increasing pleas for working capital. Most State enterprises have to rely on bank loans and at time of economic retrenchment they must slow production almost to a halt. To keep the engines of State-owned enterprises working, banks increased their loans of working capital to industry to 68.9 billion yuan ($8 billion) between September and November last year. The equivalent figure in 1992 was only 25.2 billion yuan ($2.9 billion), said the State Statistics Bureau. On this point, bankers say they would rather make loans to governments to establish a social security system than to throw money into propping up often-inefficient State enterprises. Moves to bring annual urban inflation back under 15 percent, 5 percentage points lower than last year, will also depend on support from regional governments, which have a much greater and selfish desire to speed up their economies. Some regions and departments are again blindly opening investment projects, some of which violate State policies, said a front-page commentary on Sunday in People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO], the leading newspaper of the country. The newspaper called on regional governments to quell the renewed real estate fever which is developing again in some regions after a temporary lull. In 1992, the huge amounts of money invested in real estate were one of the chief factors that put the economy into the frying pan. It will be much easier to keep the economy growing at a sustained pace, while fending off inflation, if regional governments take more consideration of the country as a whole.
