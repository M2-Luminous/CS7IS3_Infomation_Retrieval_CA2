This statement was made in Moscow on Tuesday by President Boris Yeltsin after signing a number of British-Russian documents. In answer to a question from Interfax's correspondent the Russian leader said that his partner in the talks -- Prime Minister John Major -- shares Moscow's view that it's essential "to transfer the military hardware surrounding Sarajevo to the U.N. forces, and compel the warring Bosnian sides "to settle their conflict peacefully" by means of talks. Yeltsin confirmed however that the organizers of the possible attacks on the contingent of U.N. peace-keepers should be "punished." Earlier on Tuesday the president's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, said that the possible "NATO air strikes on Serb positions would be inevitably associated in the eyes of international and Russian public opinion with the USA and with the recently proclaimed "Partnership for Peace" program. "In my view this may do psychological damage to that diplomatic initiative," he stressed in an interview with Interfax. "The world has not fully grasped the concept of that program yet," Kostikov said. "Many people may consider the bombing of Serb positions by NATO forces, in which the USA plays the leading role, as reflecting the ideology of "Partnership for Peace" in concrete terms. Since such turn of events is quite possible, the proposed operation may be viewed as a false start of the American initiative." In his view, the president's press secretary pointed out, to resolve the Bosnian conflict politically would be in the interests of both the USA and Russia. In the meantime the State Duma's committee on geopolitics conducted hearings on Tuesday and decided that the international public must not interfere in the affairs of former Yugoslav republics. Deputies issued a resolution which calls for restoring "a unified democratic state" in the territory of former Yugoslavia. According to them, this is the only way to stop the bloodshed. According to the resolution, the practical implementation of NATO's decision to bomb Serb positions around Sarajevo "should be viewed as an act of international terrorism". The document suggests that the Russian president should "use the right to veto in the U.N. security Council in regard to air strikes in former Yugoslavia, and resolve the issue of lifting by Russia economic sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia". These decisions were not affected when a spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, Vladimir Ivanovsky, addressed those present. He tried to explain that the U.N. resolution concerning former Yugoslavia lays responsibility for breaking the siege of Sarajevo on the U.N. secretary-general, and that in fact there is no need to convene the U.N. security Council for taking a decision on the use of aircraft. Under the circumstances the possibility of Russia's using the right to veto is purely "hypothetical", the diplomat said.
