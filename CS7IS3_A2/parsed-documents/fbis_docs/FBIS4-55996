The realization of this endeavor is planned for the middle of next month. The idea for a "customs corridor" which would connect Macedonia with the Western European countries, as it was emphasized in Bucharest, was given by the U.S. Administration, with the aim of helping Macedonia and carrying out its trade deals, which has been made difficult by the Greek embargo and the upholding of the sanctions against Federal Republic Yugoslavia. Mihai Panzaru said "the corridor will span from Austria through Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, to Macedonia." He added that Romania has already discussed this with the Hungarian authorities, while the Bulgarian side is also expected to be contacted these days.
