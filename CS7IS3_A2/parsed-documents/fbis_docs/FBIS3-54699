"Unfortunately, neither the strategy nor the tactics of the Ukrainian military leadership are changing. Russia is being systematically squeezed from the Black Sea region. Now Kiev has waited for the Ashgabat agreements to be adopted and `gone on the attack' on engineering establishments of the Black Sea Fleet. "This action itself had no significance -- either militarily or politically. The installations would have been voluntarily transferred to Ukraine by the Black Sea Fleet in January 1994. Someone in the Ukrainian military evidently wanted to assert his own personal importance and to prove his 'devotion' to the republic's political leadership. "Russian sailors have no intention of `taking' their installations back from the Ukrainian military. Let them use them. But I believe that these will `count against' Ukraine when the new documents on the Black Sea Fleet are signed."
