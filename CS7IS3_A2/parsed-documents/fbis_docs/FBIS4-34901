[Begin De la Calle recording] President Gaviria's proposal to call a referendum to reform the Constitution stems precisely from situations that we have observed. We, too, have questions about this ruling which today is a legal reality that can only be removed from the Colombian judicial scene by improving the Constitution. We applaud the government's decision on this issue. [end recording] Meanwhile, President Cesar Gaviria believes there is no way to implement Constitutional reforms other than through popular participation. [Begin Gaviria recording] There is no other possible option, because, while it is true that, in the opinion of the court, the judicial measure allows legislators to regulate matters related to age, place, employment, and some other activities in which drug consumption takes place, unquote [as heard], this is not enough to ban or penalize drug consumption as a rule, which in our opinion should be the case.
