He explained that he will appoint the remaining six in the near future: the education under secretary and the five under secretaries of the Defense Ministry. Last night, after attending a mass that marked the 12th anniversary of his father Eduardo Frei Montalva's death, President-elect Eduardo Frei announced that he would release the list of under secretaries the next day. This decision -- which caught everyone by surprise because the president-elect himself had indicated earlier that the appointments would be postponed -- had journalists waiting for the announcement at Frei's offices on Hindenburg Street since early morning on 22 January. Just as he had done with the cabinet, the president-elect did not appoint all the under secretaries at once, leaving six appointments for later. [Begin Frei recording] Since I believe in teamwork I also believe that the respective ministers and under secretaries should be properly attuned to each other and trust each other because they will be working together day in, day out. Thus, I will appoint the education under secretary later and the same goes for the under secretaries of the Defense Ministry.

[Begin Frei recording] I would like to say once again that I have not been pressured to make any of these appointments. Undoubtedly, the various political parties have conveyed their suggestions and I have talked to the ministers, but everybody left me free to make the appointments. As I have explained, the delay -- which I believe to be perfectly normal given the fact that I was operated on just a week ago -- in making these appointments gave me the chance to talk to all of them and make sure that they will do their jobs independently.
