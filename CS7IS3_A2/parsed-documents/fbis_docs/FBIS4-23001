The outcome of computer methods of comparing the proteins under study on the basis of the pairwise distance are used to classify proteins by their main function, identify new proteins, and reconstruct the evolutionary history of the proteins under comparison in the form of philogenetic trees using any existing algorithm. For illustration, sea anemone toxins are compared to other toxins separated from the snake venom and equine, duck, rat, and human proinsulins. Based on the maximum total scores, Radianthus macrodactylus toxins are closest to long neurotoxins whose classification scoring points are analyzed on the basis of the pattern recognition theory. Pair Euclidean distances for 22 proteins from four groups, the concentration of informative amino acid residues and classification scores for snake toxins, and a comparison of Radianthus macrodactylus toxins RTX-I and RTX-V to snake neurotoxins and cytotoxins are summarized in a tabular form. The sample of ten A2 phospholipases is divided into two groups according to the organisms they represent using the newly introduced distance. An original application software package developed by the authors for comparing the proteins by their amino acid composition is described. It is available for purchase from the developers.
