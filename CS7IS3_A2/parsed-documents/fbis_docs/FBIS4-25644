In a meeting here with Long Yongtu, China's assistant minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, Kantor mentioned what he called "a courageous decision" President Clinton announced two weeks ago to extend China's most-favored-nation trade status without conditions. He described it as an extremely important step for promoting U.S.-China relations. He said that the two great countries of the United States and China should establish a relationship of cooperation with mutual confidence between them. While giving assurance of Washington's continued support for China's effort to resume its seat as a founding member of GATT and become a member of the World Trade Organization, Kantor indicated that China should, like all other countries, assume the responsibilities as the multilateral trade system requires. The Chinese assistant minister said that basing itself on the principle of balance between rights and duties, China has shown and will continue to show the greatest possible flexibility in the talks on its re-entry into GATT. But he made it clear that there is a limit to such flexibility, i.e., the obligations China is expected to undertake have to be suited to the present level of China's economic development and full consideration must be given to the fact that China's economic reform and the establishment of a market economy are a process of gradual advance. Long Yongtu led a 24-member Chinese delegation to the ninth round of Sino-U.S. bilateral consultations on China's re-entry into GATT, which were held here on June 5-8. The U.S. delegation in the 4-day talks was composed of 45 people from various government departments. A Chinese official said that both sides regarded this round of talks as frank and sincere, which resulted in positive progress. According to the Chinese official, considerable differences still exist between China and the United States on a number of issues, especially on the issue as regards the U.S. demand for China to open its market in the service sector. The two sides agreed to continue their consultations in Geneva at the end of this month.
