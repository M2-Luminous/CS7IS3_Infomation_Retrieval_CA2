The new bodies would have sweeping powers to enable them to investigate rights abuses and penalise the perpetrators, according to a draft copy of the bill obtained by the Sunday Morning Post. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Bill, to be forwarded to the Government tomorrow, also proposes major changes to the territory's legal system and includes a proposal for a tribunal to deal with human rights disputes. Under the private member's bill, a human rights and equal opportunities commission would be set up to examine whether existing laws were in line with the Bill of Rights. It would also investigate complaints, advise the Government on Bill of Rights issues and international human rights conventions, as well as educate the public. An equal opportunities tribunal would also be established to deal with complaints from those who believed their rights were being violated. "This is a human rights court," said Ms. Wu, who estimated the new bodies would cost more than $40 million a year to run. Under Legislative Council standing orders, the new bill can only be tabled with the approval of the Governor, Chris Patten, since it involves public expenditure. But Mr. Patten has already hinted he would not necessarily block the bill. "I'm pretty open-minded about it, but I think there are overlapping powers," he told the Sunday Morning Post. "We haven't yet been persuaded of the case, but it's not for me a locked door or a shut window." Principal Home Affairs assistant Duncan Pescod, who meets Ms. Wu tomorrow to discuss the bill, said the Government wanted to study the draft in detail before commenting further. If the Governor backs the bill, it is expected to be introduced to Legco in May after a two-month consultation period. Councillors have already indicated their support for the establishment of a rights commission through a motion last year. But Beijing is likely to warn against the move, which many commentators believe is primarily aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong after 1997. Pressure over the issue is expected to mount following the return from London today of independent legislator Christine Loh Kung-wai, who last week urged the House of Commons' foreign affairs committee to recommend the creation of a human rights commission. Committee members have already indicated they are likely to do so in their report this Easter. The Governor said he would take such a recommendation "very seriously". Under Ms. Wu's draft bill, the rights tribunal would be based on a body that exists in Australia. It would consist of a president, who must be a judge of at least seven years' standing, and two other members. The new court would have almost unlimited powers. It could order human rights violators not to repeat unlawful conduct, to pay compensation, employ, reinstate or promote victims, or "to perform any reasonable act or course of conduct to redress the loss and damages suffered by the complainant". The tribunal could also impose an interim order to preserve the status quo and protect the rights of both parties to the complaint. Those who failed to comply with an order of the tribunal would be liable to a fine of up to $10,000 for an individual or $50,000 for a corporate body. Ms. Wu's proposed human rights commission would have fewer powers than the tribunal, but a wide-ranging remit to investigate potential human rights abuses. It would comprise a president, human rights commissioner, sexual discrimination commissioner, racial discrimination commissioner and disability discrimination commissioner. All would be appointed by the Governor from the ranks of local judges, barristers and solicitors. It would even have a remit to examine any proposed law for possible human rights violations, upon request by the attorney- general, Legislative Council president, or any group of 500 Hong Kong people. The committee's terms of reference would allow it to "inquire into any act or practice that may be inconsistent with, or contrary to, any human right". Any person who believed their rights had been violated could lodge a complaint with the commission, either as an individual, or on behalf of a group of victims. Complaints would be referred to the tribunal if they could not be solved by conciliation. Complaints lodged from detainers and prisoners could be directly referred to the commission, overruling prison rules. The commission would also have the power to subpoena evidence and examine witnesses with those who failed to comply liable to a maximum penalty of $50,000. Ms. Wu said the proposed new bodies would greatly improve existing human rights conditions in Hong Kong. "The existing court system has its own restrictions," she said. "It is too slow and expensive and too few people can get help from the Legal Aid Department. But it (the tribunal) would be less costly, more efficient, and would also provide legal aid in terms of finance and expertise."
