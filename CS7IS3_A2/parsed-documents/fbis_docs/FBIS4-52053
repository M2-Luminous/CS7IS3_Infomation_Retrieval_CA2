FBIS4-52053 "dreas088_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-088 Daily Report 4 May 1994 North Korea Radio Reports on U.S.-ROK Air Exercises Radio Reports on U.S.-ROK Air Exercises Deployment 3 May Detailed SK0605115294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1200 GMT 4 May 94 SK0605115294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1200 GMT 4 May 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to a military source, on 3 May, the U.S. imperialists deployed from overseas bases for mobile operations several tens of fighter planes and lethal equipment in South Korea. Following this, they waged a provocative joint aerial war exercise aimed at a northward invasion. That day, F-15 fighter-bombers, FA-18 pursuit-assault planes, AV-8 vertical take-off and landing assault planes, KC-135 refueling planes, which were flown in from U.S. Pacific bases, were deployed for mobile operations at the bases of the U.S. occupation air force in South Korea. That day, too, C-141 and C-130 transport squadrons carrying numerous troops of aggression and lethal equipment flew into South Korea one after another from overseas bases. In accordance with the integrated operational plans of the U.S. Pacific Area Air Force Command and Naval Command, a joint aerial war exercise of a northward invasion was frantically waged, centered on the areas over Tokchok Island, Yoju, Chongson, and Muju that day. Put into this frantic war exercise were airplane squadrons, which had come for mobile operations from overseas bases, and about 450 fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes, reconnaissance planes, and armed helicopters belonging to the U.S. occupation air force in South Korea and to the puppet air force. Within the system of this war exercise, KC-135 refueling planes conducted midair refueling for about 50 F-16 and F-15 fighter-bombers which were flying around for a joint aerial war exercise of a northward invasion, using an area over the sea off Kunsan as an operational arena. This war exercise, sputtering the fire of a war [chonjaengui pulshiga tuingguinun], was a reckless playing with fire aimed at promoting the practical cooperation between the overseas-based air squadrons, and the U.S. occupation air force in South Korea and the puppet air force and at increasing the capabilities for an actual warfare with a succession of surprise strikes against strategic sites in the northern part of the Republic with the support of midair refueling planes. In the meantime, the South Korean puppets ran wild in a war exercise of a northward invasion in an area near the Military Demarcation Line, right in front of our nose. On 3 May, the puppet Army's tank group deployed in Kumpa-ri in Paju County fired about 20 shells at Hapo-ri. The puppet Army's large-caliber gun units, which had held firing positions in Mago-ri of Yonchon County, Yongsan-ri of Paju County, and Yulli-ri of Chorwon County of South Korea's Kangwon Province, fired some 70 shells into the areas adjacent to the DMZ, thereby showing off a war frenzy. On the same day, some 10 (?500)-MD armed helicopters, which had been mobilized in the air over Paju, Yonchon, and Chorwon of South Korea's Kangwon Province, instigated a war atmosphere by frantically waging an exercise of missile strikes and support for ground attacks. The reckless war maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, which are becoming graver day after day, prove that the rascals are running along the path to confrontation and war, running counter the peace and easing of tension in Korea.
