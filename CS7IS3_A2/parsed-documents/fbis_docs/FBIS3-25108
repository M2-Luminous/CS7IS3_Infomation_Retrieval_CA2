Reacting to reported remarks by the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] commanding officer, Brig Gabriel Ramushwana, that the NPKF would not be ready for deployment before and during the April general elections, Gen Holomisa said: "South African political leaders have no other option but to approach African, Asian or Western powers for the assembling of a force to keep peace in South Africa or approach the United Nations Security Council for the deployment of a UN peace keeping force in the country while we are still training and sorting out the current problems of the National Peacekeeping Force." He added: "We need to send an SOS call to our friends outside South Africa. If we need their capital for investment and related assistance, I see no reason why we cannot have confidence in them when it comes to security matters. What is needed is to agree on the rules and regulations as to how they will be involved. The Namibian and Zimbabwean transitional arrangements can be used as a model." The general added it was clear the South African Government had no interest in seeing the NPKF take off. A total of 10,000 soliders for the force was the target "but the RSA [Republic of South Africa] government saw to it that a mere 3,700 were being trained for the purpose. This low number cannot even cordon off Soweto when violence flares up."
