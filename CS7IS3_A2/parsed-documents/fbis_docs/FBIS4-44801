The net loss of Fr212 million in 1992 was not an accident. CGS is going through a serious crisis, due in the first place to poor economic conditions and to declining cost-plus contract activities (which accounted for 30 percent of its sales in 1993). But the SSII [data-processing services and engineering company] is also experiencing a severe disappointment, especially in Germany, following Daimler-Benz's acquisition of an interest in Sogeti and the creation of a joint subsidiary, Cap Debis--owned 51 percent by Debis Systemhaus and 49 percent by Cap Gemini Sogeti. "Germany accounts for much of our results," the management pointed out, acknowledging that the creation of Cap Debis (Fr2.2 billion in sales) was "a significant financial failure." Moreover, "managing a 50-50 SSII is tricky, and poor economic conditions just make it more difficult." This is why Cap Debis, which owned 20 percent of CCS (the computing center management subsidiary), will become part of Debis Systemhaus, the Daimler Benz subsidiary. The resulting company will be worth about Fr6 billion, and CGS will obviously become "diluted" in it. Without the German burden, the management claims, results would be comparable to those of 1992. The group will thus see itself forced to increase its capital by Fr1.5 billion. In addition, other assets will be sold, without any geographic disengagement. While management claims that their interest in the Sema Group still possesses strategic value, they acknowledge that they will take part in negotiations on the future of Cisi [International Data Processing Services Company], 36 percent of which is owned by Sogeti. The year 1994 will be marked by the search for another partner, besides Daimler Benz.
