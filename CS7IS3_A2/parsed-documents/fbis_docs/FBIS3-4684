Mr. Yoneyama is due to meet with high-ranking U.S. Government officials in charge of overseas American military bases and leaders of the U.S. military. So far, working-level officials have visited Washington to discuss the issue with their American counterparts, but this is the first time that a top Japanese Government official in charge of handling the issue of streamlining and scaling down the U.S. military bases on Okinawa visits the United States to discuss the issue with American officials. Everyone acknowledges that the key stumbling block impeding Okinawa's development is the existence of huge U.S. military bases on the island. Nobody can argue against the acknowledgement. The Okinawan people have thus far persistently pleaded for the streamlining and scaling down of the huge U.S. military bases on Okinawa. In response to this plea, however, the Japanese Government has not tried to work aggressively to resolve the issue. Although 22 years have passed since Okinawa's reversion to the Japanese rule, the return of Naha military port, which has been agreed upon between Japan and the United States, has yet to be materialized and the huge U.S. military bases still remain as they have been on Okinawa. Upon Leaving Japan for Washington, Director General Yoneyama indicated that three issues -- the return of Naha military port and Yomitan auxiliary airfield and a halt to live-firing exercise by U.S. forces across National Highway No. 14 -- will be important objectives of his visit to the United States. Now that the director general specifically mentioned his intention to discuss those issues with American officials, we believe that he left Japan for Washington with a firm resolve. We hope that the visit by Director General Yoneyama to Washington will make a major headway in resolving the issue of streamlining and scaling down the U.S. military bases on Okinawa. On 25 February when Director General Yoneyama held a news conference prior to his visit to the Untied States, a "liaison meeting on various problems at the U.S. facilities and their areas on Okinawa" (the liaison meeting attended by officials from the Okinawa Development Agency, the Foreign Ministry, and the Defense Facilities Administration Agency) was held. During the meeting, Okinawa Development Agency Director General Uehara strongly asked that the liaison meeting not only exchange views on the three issues -- the return of Naha military port and Yomitan auxiliary airfield and halt to the live-firing exercises by U.S. forces across National Highway No. 14 -- but discuss specific ways to resolve them. The discussion of working-level officials alone cannot fundamentally resolve the issue of U.S. military bases on Okinawa. If government officials say they will "study," this means that they will do nothing. The discussion of working-level officials cannot resolve the issue fundamentally, but "they can only discuss how to build soundproof walls." The discussion of working-level officials will leave the issue of U.S. military bases on Okinawa unresolved forever. Now that 50 years have passed since the end of World War II, the Japanese Government has perhaps begun to think seriously of ways to resolve the issue. Some are asserting that Japan should make international contributions while others are saying it is an economic power. They, however, cannot say so in a situation where more than 1 million of their compatriots have been hindered by huge foreign military bases to develop their economy and society and have suffered great inconvenience in their daily lives. Fifty years have passed since the end of World War II. The time has come to resolve fundamentally the issue of U.S. military bases on Okinawa.
