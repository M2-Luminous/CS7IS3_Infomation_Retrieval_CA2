Shahin] [Excerpts] Amman--Two leftist political parties Wednesday [19 January] announced their decision to merge after months of negotiations between party cadres. The Jordan People's Democratic Party (JPDP) and the Jordanian Democratic Popular Unity Party (JDPUP) disclosed that their executive committees had agreed on a merger after a meeting late Tuesday. In what was an expected move, the JPDP and JDPUP decided to begin their merger by creating a coordination committee for their respective executive committees. "These have been long-standing plans and now we are beginning their implementation," said 'Azmi al-Khawajah, the secretary general of the JDPUP. "No one is quite sure how long it will take, but we are very serious about the merger. The announcement follows months of negotiations between the two parties whose members ran on a joint six-person ticket for the November legislative elections. Only one of the joint-ticker candidates, Bassam Haddaddin of the JPDP, was successful in his bid for a seat in Parliament. Mr. Haddadin is a al-Karak deputy. The two parties are Jordanian off-shoots of the Palestinian parties, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) respectively. [passage omitted] For now the leadership post will rotate among 'Azmi al-Khawajah and JPDP Secretary General Taysir al-Zibri. The two parties hope that a timetable and framework will be worked out between the two groups by mid-February. [passage omitted]
