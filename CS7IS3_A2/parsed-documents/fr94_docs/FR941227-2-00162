The session on January 10, 1995, is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m. and end at 9:30 p.m. The sessions on January 11, 12, 13, 1995, are scheduled to begin at 8 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. The purpose of the meeting is to review rehabilitation research and development applications for scientific and technical merit and to make recommendations to the Director, Rehabilitation Research and Development Services, regarding their funding. The meeting will be open to the public up to the seating capacity of the room for the January 10 session for the discussion of administrative matters, the general status of the program, and the administrative details of the review process. On January 11&hyph;13, 1995 the meeting is closed during which the Board will be reviewing research and development applications. This review involves oral comments, discussion of site visits, staff, and consultant critiques of proposed research protocols, and similar analytical documents that necessitate the consideration of the personal qualifications, performance and competence of individual research investigators. Disclosure of such information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Disclosure would also reveal research proposals and research underway which could lead to the loss of these projects to third parties and thereby frustrate future agency research efforts. Thus, the closing is in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 522b(c)(6), and (c)(9)(B) and the determination of the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs under Sections 10(d) of Pub. L. 92&hyph;463 as amended by Section 5(c) of Pub. L. 94&hyph;409. Due to the limited seating capacity of the room, those who plan to attend the open session should write to Ms. Victoria Mongiardo, Program Analyst, Rehabilitation Research and Development Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, 103 South Gay Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202 (Phone: 410&hyph;962&hyph;2563) at least five days before the meeting.
