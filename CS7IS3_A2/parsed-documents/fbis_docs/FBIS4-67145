This comment was made by Rolando Camacho Pena, director of the Council for the Comprehensive Prevention of Drug Abuse, Treatment, and Rehabilitation, Copre. He stated that drug addiction affects students in particular. He said: "For this reason the greatest part of our effort and work is directed toward that section of the population." He reported that in 1990 a study was made on drug consumption among high school and university freshmen students. The study revealed that the national average was 12.82 percent and that the most affected departments were Santa Cruz and Cochabamba with 16.39 and 16.35 percent respectively. He said: "This leads to the conclusion that the prevention program at the school level must be strengthened." The first Copre publication on epidemiological studies explains drug addiction trends and behavior patterns. Camacho said: "Unfortunately the trend shows that drug addiction among students is increasing. This means students are consuming more drugs, they are more involved in drug consumption." The study conducted by the Bolivian Red Cross in 1986 showed that drug addiction was 10.32 percent. This increased to 12.82 percent in 1992. Habitual consumption [consumo habitual] increased from 1.6 to 2.65 percent from 1986 to 1990. Camacho added: "The problem is constantly increasing." Camacho indicated that the studies will now be conducted every two years because "the problem is so serious that we need to study addiction trends and be alert for a possible epidemic that could have catastrophic consequences for our students." The drugs that are consumed most include the so-called legal drugs--alcohol and tobacco--which form "a bridge" to the use of other illegal drugs like cocaine and marijuana "which seriously affect the health of the young."
