SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. On November 21, 1989, applicant filed a notification of registration pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act and a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on January 11, 1990, and applicant commenced its initial public offering shortly thereafter. 2. On June 11, 1993, applicant's board of directors approved a plan of reorganization whereby applicant agreed to transfer substantially all of its assets to Smith Barney Shearson Aggressive Growth Fund Inc. (the ``Acquiring Fund''), in exchange for shares of beneficial interest of the Acquiring Fund and the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of certain liabilities of applicant. In accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8 of the Act, applicant's directors determined that the sale of applicant's assets to the Acquiring Fund was in the best interests of applicant's shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result. 1 1 Applicant and the Acquiring Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other by reason of having a common investment adviser. Although purchases and sales between affiliated persons generally are prohibited by section 17(a) of the Act, rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. 3. In approving the reorganization, the directors considered various factors, including, (a) the generally similar investment objectives and policies of applicant and the Acquiring Fund, (b) the fact that the funds have the same investment adviser, administrator, custodian, and transfer agent, (c) the significant savings in expenses for application's shareholders, and (d) the fact that the larger asset base of the combined funds should result in further reduction of expenses. 4. Proxy materials soliciting shareholder approval of the reorganization were distributed to applicant's shareholders of record on or about August 18, 1993. Preliminary and definitive copies of the proxy materials were filed with the SEC. Applicant's shareholders approved the reorganization at a special meeting held on October 12, 1993. 5. As of October 15, 1993 (the ``Closing Date''), applicant had 2,634,771 and 48,102 shares of Class A and Class B, respectively, outstanding, having a net asset value of $26,604,523 and $482,443, respectively, and a per share net asset value of $10.10 and $10.03, respectively. On the Closing Date, the reorganization was consummated. Applicant transferred all, or substantially all, of its assets and certain stated liabilities to the Acquiring Fund. In exchange, the shareholders of applicant received shares of the Acquiring Fund having an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of their investment in applicant. Holders of Class A shares of applicant received Class A shares of the Acquiring Fund, and holders of Class B shares of applicant received Class B shares of the Acquiring Fund. 6. On the Closing Date, applicant paid a capital gain distribution of $0.5240 per share which, together with all previous such dividends, had the effect of distributing to its shareholders all of its respective investment company taxable income for the taxable year ending on or prior to the Closing Date (computed without regard to any deduction for dividends paid) and all of its respective net capital gain realized in the taxable year ending on or prior to the Closing Date (after reduction for any capital loss carry forward). 7. The expenses in connection with the reorganization consisted of legal, accounting, printing, and administrative expenses totalling approximately $20,000. These expenses were borne by applicant. 8. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceedings. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
