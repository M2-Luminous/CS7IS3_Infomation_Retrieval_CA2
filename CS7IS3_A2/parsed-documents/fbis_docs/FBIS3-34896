These preliminary talks relate to the composition of the Palestinian police force which will be deployed in the area following the Israeli withdrawal. Other discussions relating in particular to the transfer of civilian powers and the release of the Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons (almost 9,000 according to the PLO, more according to the United Nations), are also due to start shortly. Mordekhay Drori, ambassador at the Israeli Mission to the European Communities, assesses the development of the peace process in the region. While the impetus of reconciliation does not seem to be waning between the Palestinians and Israelis, he reaffirmed the enormity of the task still to be accomplished. [Gosset] Are you still optimistic about the peace process as a whole? [Drori] Optimistic, but also cautious. People underestimate the difficulty, especially the practical difficulty, of the solutions to be found for the many problems between us and the Arab world. Moreover, it is much more complicated with the Palestinians than with the Syrians. With the Palestinians, we are intertwined with each other, there are no borders. And, in addition to that, there are economic problems. With Syria, the problems are less complicated because there are borders. But the solution to these problems is extremely complicated because we do not really know what the Syrians' real intentions are, whether they agree to sign a peace agreement with all that that involves: Diplomatic and cultural relations, trade. Or whether they just want one agreement without any other purpose. When we have the answer to this very complex question, we can move forward. [Gosset] With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad finally had to abandon his dreams of strategic parity with Israel. And he probably realized that he could be seriously outclassed... [Drori] That did have a decisive influence. It is one of the keys to the Near East affair. Whether willingly or unwillingly, the Arab countries relied militarily, economically, and politically on the Soviet Union. Because of its collapse, they no longer have that support. If a new conflict arose, they could no longer count on that unconditional aid. This fear has virtually abolished the risk of a military attack by the Arab countries on Israel. In addition, there is only one superpower left in the world -- the United States. The Syrians have clearly understood that if they wish to be integrated into the international world and develop their economy, they must find a means of reconciliation with Washington. And this reconciliation depends on the peace agreement with Israel. [Gosset] Many economic development projects have been mentioned. Which are those which can really be implemented? [Drori] For a European, it is very difficult to appreciate the lack of multiregional infrastructure in the Middle East. For you, it is perfectly natural to take your car and drive from Brussels to Paris, or to telephone from one country to another, and to watch foreign television channels. All that is desperately lacking in the Middle East because the countries in the region -- especially Israel -- have been cut off from each other. I therefore do not see any regional development and development among countries unless there are regional activities. Several fundamental projects ought to remain: Road and railroad communications, telecommunications, joint projects in the energy sphere. One problem has a very marked political character, and that is water: Because there is an overall shortage, and a fair distribution of this resource in the region is needed. It is clear that all this can only develop if there is an agreement in the region. But we must not expect the peace agreement to be signed in order to make preparations. We must start now. [Gosset] Following the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel in 1979, did this kind of development take place subsequently, even on a limited scale? [Drori] No, unfortunately not, aside from a few exceptions. We bought and still buy Egyptian oil. But that did not go further, mainly for political reasons: Egypt being the only Arab country to have signed a peace agreement with Israel, there were reservations about giving too obvious a character to that agreement. Also, it was not possible to launch a real regional project if the other countries stayed away. [Gosset] What is the impact of the economic boycott by Arab countries on the Israeli economy? [Drori] There are no figures and I think that those who give figures are mistaken (the figure of $3 million has sometimes been mentioned -- L'ECHO editor's note), because it is impossible to cost deals which have never been made for fear of the boycott. Let us not talk about the "primary" boycott, in other words the boycott between Israel and the Arab countries. The main problem is the "secondary" boycott, in other words all the entrepreneurs and all the companies which have been threatened with not being able to do business if they did business with Israel. In view of the size of the Arab countries, the choice has mainly been made in favor of the Arab countries. Examining the present trend, I think that this kind of boycott is being weakened. It has not stopped but should vanish if there is a general agreement. [Gosset] How does Israel manage to handle the arrival of new immigrants? [Drori] An immigrant who arrives in Israel receives housing from the government. Or he is helped to pay his rent for one or two years. He receives an allowance during the period in which he is looking for work. It is a huge burden, but we are used to it because we have always faced immigration and the country is organized accordingly. Around 500,000 people have arrived and several hundred thousand more are expected. In the long term, it is an extraordinary source of wealth, because many of them are highly qualified: Engineers, doctors... Professions which require years of training. In the short term, when you see, for instance, 5,000 doctors arriving, which will double the number of practitioners in the country, there has to be retraining -- which is sometimes tragic in the personal sphere, but necessary at national level -- and work has to be created for others. This all requires an enormous amount of work, which has borne fruit because unemployment resulting from immigration has fallen.
