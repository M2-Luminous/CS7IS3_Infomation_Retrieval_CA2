He warned that the failure of this agreement would lead to a comprehensive chaos in the region. In an interview to the Qatari paper AL SHARQ, which it published on Thursday [13 January], the brother President leader Abu-'Ammar stressed that the Palestinians would not be the losers at the end because instability would affect all the region. The brother President leader Abu-'Ammar added that while the Palestinians demanded a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region, the Israelis wanted to carry out an operation of redeployment of their army which is a matter violating the agreement signed between the two sides. The brother President leader Abu-'Ammar added that Israel wanted to control crossings in order to make the Palestinians live in isolated areas, which is a matter rejected by the Palestinian side in the negotiations. The brother president leader criticized the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and said that he was not interested in anything anymore now that he has received the U.S. reward for signing the Washington agreement including weapons, a giant computer which can only be found in super-powers in addition to 240 million dollars to spend on redeployment of Israeli forces in addition to other U.S. loan guarantees.
