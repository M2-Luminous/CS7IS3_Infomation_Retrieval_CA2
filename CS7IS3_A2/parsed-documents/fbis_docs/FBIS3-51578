Velasquez has responded to the charges made by the Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry] president [Edgardo Romero Nava] that the government is partly responsible for what happened at Banco Latino. Velasquez said emphatically that the government had been closely watching the bank since November. Finance Minister Silva said the Banco Latino disaster was due to the risks top bank officials took with bank funds rather than to withdrawals made by state institutions. [Begin recording] [Velasquez] I want to emphasize that I have been monitoring this case since late November. I have continually held night meetings with those who are bound by law to [words indistinct]. We have had countless night meetings with the finance minister; the Central Bank president [Ruth de Krivoy]; Bank Superintendent Roger Urbina; Bank Superintendent Negron; Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] President Esperanza Martino; Dr. Hernan Anzola, government representative at the Central Bank; and Banco Latino shareholders. I had to trust the information given to me by the Bank Superintendency and by the Central Bank, so what Dr. Romero said is untrue. I have been very interested in this case because it is my job. However, I had to accept the information provided to me by the Bank Superintendency as the truth. [Silva] This institution's history is linked to the political advancement of some of its leaders, but this is something that will be explained in due time. [end recording] Just as President Velasquez had, [Deputy] Reinaldo Cervini rejected the charges made by the Fedecamaras president and called for a thorough investigation. Renowned expert Domingo Maza Zabala also spoke about the case after meeting with President Velasquez, saying that people must believe that the financial system will solve this crisis and that their funds will be recovered. However, Maza also thinks that specific responsibilities must be determined. [Begin recording] [Maza] The financial institutions must be interested in clarifying what happened and how it happened. The new banking law must be good and efficient in order to correct these irregularities, mistakes, and vices of bank management, because the banking service is not a private business but an eminently public service in which the state must be interested and for which it must be responsible. [Cervini] It is distressing to realize that what happened at the Commerce Bank or at the National Discount Bank could happen in Venezuela; that rich businessmen, such as (Gonzalo de Roldoma) and his son, are stashing their fortunes abroad but keeping bankrupt businesses in Venezuela. This must stop. If shareholders are responsible, they must be liable. The concept of financial crime must be established [as heard]. I don't think the country should operate under privately enforced rules. This is not a state problem. It is a state problem, however, to improve the General Bank Superintendency [Superintendencia General de Bancos]. [end recording] Domingo Maza Zabala also spoke about the possibility that the National Congress may repeal or amend the value-added tax [VAT]. He thinks the Venezuelan fiscal system requires sweeping reforms and recommends that if the National Congress decides to repeal VAT, it will have to seek other fiscal revenues to replace those generated by VAT. He added that if it is not done, much larger economic imbalances will be created.
