FR941102-2-00047 FR941102-2-00036 [OPP&hyph;30228B; FRL&hyph;4769&hyph;9] Rohm and Haas Co.; Approval of Pesticide Product Registration AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces Agency approval of an application submitted by Rohm and Haas Company to conditionally register the pesticide product Anti-Foulant C-9211M containing a new active ingredient not included in any previously registered product pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Marshall Swindell, Acting Product Manager (PM) 31, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 272, CM #2, Environmental Protection Agency, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy, Arlington, VA 22202, (703&hyph;305&hyph;6908). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice published in the Federal Register of November 16, 1983 (48 FR 52124), which announced that Rohm and Haas Co., Independence Mall West, Philadelphia, PA 19105, had submitted an application to register the pesticide product Anti-Foulant C-9211M (EPA File Symbol 707&hyph;RTL) containing the active ingredients 4,5-dichloro-2- n -octyl-3(2 H )-isothiazolone~ at 35.0 percent and 4-chloro-2- n -octyl-3-(2 H )-isothiazolone at 5.0 percent, active ingredients not included in any previously registered product. ~ This application ~was approved on February 28, 1994, as Anti-Foulant C-9211M, containing the active ingredient 4,5-dichloro-2- n -octyl-3(2 H )-isothiazolone~~ at 30.0 percent, (EPA Registration Number 707&hyph;175) for use in the formulation of marine antifoulant paints. A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain data are lacking because a period reasonably sufficient for generation of the data has not elapsed since the Administrator first imposed the data requirements, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration period and do not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional registration period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of 4,5-dichloro-2- n -octyl-3(2 H )-isothiazolone~~,~~ and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations which show that use of ~~~4,5-dichloro-2- n -octyl-3(2 H )-isothiazolone during the period of conditional registration is not expected to cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. This conditional registration has been issued even though at this time, no additional ecological effects and environmental fate data will be required for this manufacturing use product. However, additional requirements for environmental fate and ecological effects data are being held in reserve pending the review of leaching studies and will be requested for this manufacturing use product. The leaching from the matrix data will be required for end-use formulators. The data only supports the formulation of marine antifloulant paints for boats and vessels only. If these conditions are not complied with, the registration will be subject to cancellation in accordance with FIFRA section 6(e). Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that this conditional registration is in the public interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions, and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects to man and the environment. More detailed information on this conditional registration is contained in an EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on ~~~4,5-dichloro-2- n -octyl-3(2 H )-isothiazolone~. A copy of the fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager listed above. The data and other scientific information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (703&hyph;305&hyph;5805). Requests for data must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and must be addressed to the Freedom of Information Office (A&hyph;101), 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Such requests should: (1) Identify the product name and registration number and (2) specify the data or information desired. Authority: 7 U.S.C. 136.
