Why? ['Arafat] To discuss the message which I had sent him through his special envoy Jacques Neriya whom I received in Cairo on Monday. I reaffirmed the measures which need to be taken to ensure the Palestinian people's security and tranquility in the Israeli-occupied territories. [Lorieux] In other words, you are putting forward preconditions for the resumption of the peace negotiations.... ['Arafat] We are not talking about preconditions but about the precise implementation of the agreement reached on 13 September in Washington by the Palestinians and the Israelis. Take the Jewish settlements within the city of Hebron. They are illegal. Moreover, eight ministers of the Rabin government are asking that their occupants be removed. I am not asking for them to be destroyed, but moved. [Lorieux] Why are these settlements situated in the heart of the city more illegal than Qiryat Arb'a, which is growing up outside the gates of Hebron? ['Arafat] The 13 September agreement makes provision for the issue of Jewish settlements (Qiryat Arba', for instance) to be discussed later. The text states: "As soon as possible and no later than the beginning of the third year" following the agreement. "As soon as possible" because we think, like the Israelis, that it is a burning issue. But, can you understand it? Although Qiryat Arba' is three-fourths empty, why on earth are the settlers coming and installing themselves in the city? Why are they coming and confiscating Palestinian houses? [Lorieux] Have you convinced Mr. Rabin? ['Arafat] Our reference is the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on 13 September. There can only be one authority: Israeli today and Palestinian when we are in Gaza and Jericho. The Israeli Army is therefore responsible for the security of the settlers. However, the settlers have become another power. A separate, armed, and dangerous power. [Lorieux] That is your analysis. But I repeat my question: Did you convince the Israeli prime minister on Tuesday evening? ['Arafat] No. It was a discussion. He gave his viewpoint, I gave mine. I spoke in particular about the establishment of an international presence in the occupied territories. The Declaration of Principles mentions this possibility. It is very important that this international presence should be rapidly established to ensure the protection of our people. We are not making new demands. We are just asking for the Declaration of Principles to be honestly implemented. Throughout the seven months of negotiations which have followed the Washington agreements, the Israelis have insisted on one issue: the security of the settlers. However, it seems that the Jewish settlements are time bombs. This is particularly glaring because those responsible for the Hebron tragedy are not only settlers but some units of the Israeli Army. The Israeli Army opened fire to protect the retreat of the Israeli settlers and, as we have since learned, it also opened fire on the faithful who were trying to flee the mosque. Outside, facing the entrance, soldiers killed eight people and wounded 24. The Israeli commission of inquiry itself admits that there was negligence. How is this possible? That mosque is under the sole protection of the Israeli Army. [Lorieux] It is constantly being announced that the UN Security Council will adopt a resolution on the 25 February massacre. This text should not only condemn the killing but also define the measures to be taken to prevent new incidents. ['Arafat] We hope that the U.S. representative will vote in favor of it. But 13 days have already passed. You can imagine what that means: 13 days after that horrible massacre. And, as I speak to you, nothing has yet been done. [Lorieux] Is the Security Council's inability to act the only obstacle to the resumption of the negotiations interrupted after the massacre? ['Arafat] It is one of the obstacles. Let us not forget that many UN resolutions have remained a dead letter. We are determined to ensure that the ones adopted on Hebron are actually implemented. [Lorieux] You are likely to have to wait for the completion of negotiations not only on the principle but on the methods of establishing an international presence in the occupied territories. The organization, composition, and deployment of that presence will have to be defined... ['Arafat] Let us make things clear. I want to be sure that the Security Council's decision will change the situation on the ground. It is my right to demand it. It is also the right of my people who want to see the situation changing in practice. They have been waiting for seven months. [Lorieux] When you talk of an international presence, are you thinking of an armed presence? ['Arafat] Allow me to ask you a question. Who will protect this international force? The armed Jewish settlers? [Lorieux] You mean that the members of this force will have to ensure their own protection... ['Arafat] Yes. It is for them to protect themselves. I am not asking them to have tanks. I am simply asking that they do not constitute an additional responsibility for we Palestinians. They will have to be active and play their role. [Lorieux] Where should they be deployed? In Gaza-Jericho which is due to come under Palestinian authority on 13 April? Or in the whole of the West Bank, which is to remain under Israeli occupation until the election of the "Palestinian authority" in July? ['Arafat] The first group should go to Hebron to provide the Palestinian population with the protection decided by the Security Council. This is urgent. We must be aware of our people's anger, and that of the Arab people, the Muslim people, the Christian people in the world, the international community. I have even received messages of condolence signed by Jewish organizations. [Lorieux] A consensus had still not been found in the UN Security Council 13 days after Hebron. Particularly because the Americans are refusing to allow the Council's resolution to be applied to the occupied territories "including Jerusalem?" Do you know why? ['Arafat] Ask the Americans! The Security Council is not working on a draft resolution presented by the Palestinians, the Arabs, or the nonaligned countries, but on a text presented by the U.S. Administration. This U.S. text refers to resolution 799 which relates to the fourth Geneva convention which is applicable to all the occupied territories "including Jerusalem." The Americans' refusal conflicts with their initial position. [Lorieux] Is it therefore a change of attitude by Washington? ['Arafat] That is what it seems to be. [Lorieux] Bill Clinton came to the presidency with the most pro-Israeli team that the White House had seen for a long time. The President, on contact with the real situation, seemed to change. But, since the Hebron massacre, do you think that the U.S. attitude has taken a step backward? ['Arafat] We will have to wait and see. This massacre is a turning-point. Like the Sarajevo market massacre. The Hebron massacre was planned and organized by Israeli Army units and by armed settlers. It is something like the Secret Army Organization -- illegal organization supporting French rule of Algeria formed during Algerian war. We must therefore wait until the whole U.S. reaction is revealed at all levels and not just in the Security Council. We will have to gauge their participation in the international force. We are not asking for the moon. We are asking for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles of 13 September which makes provision for an international presence. Will the United States be up to the responsibilities which it has shouldered since the signing of this Declaration of Principles at the White House? That is the whole question. [Lorieux] Russia thinks that the Hebron shooting has "completely scuttled the negotiation process." It has therefore just proposed the "convening of a second Madrid conference." What do you think of this idea? ['Arafat] It is a good idea. [Lorieux] Is the process launched in Madrid in October 1991 so bogged down that something else should be tried? ['Arafat] No, it should be freshened up and reactivated. [Lorieux] When you received me in October before your visit to France, you told me: "If Rabin makes a promise, he keeps his word." Can you confirm your judgment today? ['Arafat] I stick to the situation and the facts. Our people are waiting for the decisions to be implemented in the field. Slogans are not enough. [Lorieux] Some Palestinians burned your picture in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. What is your reaction? ['Arafat] These autos-da-fe are the work of secret services. I know who is behind them. I do not have the impression that the Palestinians are angry with me. [Lorieux] Over the months, and especially since Hebron, you have come under growing criticism. Even within the PLO.... ['Arafat] My comrades have the right to criticize me. It is their right to ask me to listen to them more. Seven months after the 13 September agreement, nothing has changed in the daily lives of the Palestinians in the territories. [Lorieux] Have you convinced Mr. Rabin and Mr. Clinton that it is necessary to go into action, as you put it? ['Arafat] I hope so. Otherwise, the scenario changes. Peace is not just something the Palestinians need. The Israelis, Americans, and Europeans need it, too. If this agreement is not implemented, the Near East will enter into a period of confusion and Balkanization. [Lorieux] The Israelis are in less of a hurry than you. That was obvious during your last meeting with Mr. Peres in Cairo a month ago. ['Arafat] In Cairo, I was very accommodating. I wanted to give the peace process a last chance. But I stress that it was a last chance. If the Declaration of Principles is not implemented precisely and honestly, I will be entitled to explain to my people how that came about. They are waiting for me to do so. I will not deceive my people. Its patience is limited. [Lorieux] Have you set a deadline? ['Arafat] Yes, 12 April is the deadline. It is the day fixed in the Declaration of Principles for the completion of the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. In one month's time! [Lorieux] If that deadline is not honored, what will you do? Will you close shop? ['Arafat] If nothing was done, that would mean that the Israeli Government had decided not to respect our agreements! It is not my responsibility which is at stake in this affair. It is the responsibility of the international community and, in particular, the U.S. and Russian joint sponsors of the peace process, particularly President Clinton. [Lorieux] Last Sunday, the Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist movement Hamas issued an ultimatum to the Jewish settlers: Move before 15 March or watch out! Do you agree with that? ['Arafat] You have to understand our people's despair. [Lorieux] Some 20,000 Israelis demonstrated in Tel Aviv last Saturday against the Hebron massacre. ['Arafat] By that they showed that a high proportion of Israeli society is against the settlers' crime, against the policy of settlements, and against the fanatical groups which are simply time bombs. This section of the population is opposed to any delay in the implementation of the 13 September Declaration of Principles. [Lorieux] It is in this terribly tense climate that Francois Leotard is making a visit to Israel. He met with one of your aides in Paris last week. What is your view of the French defense minister's visit? ['Arafat] I have no opinion to express on France's foreign policy. I just think that it would have been preferable to postpone that visit, especially since it is a visit by the defense minister and he will have discussions with the Israeli Army. This visit is likely to be seen by the Israelis, and especially by the fanatical groups, as a favorable signal.
