Meri had received Einseln's letter of resignation on May 31 and had immediately responded that the interests of Estonian state prevented him from accepting the resignation and that he was to continue his service. Einseln's press office released a statement earlier on Thursday saying he wanted to resign in protest over being left aside by Prime Minister Mart Laar over his defence deal with Israel. Einseln is a retired U.S. Army officer who accepted the position in defiance of U.S. administration while risking his army pension. Einseln is now in Visby attending a Baltic Sea defence seminar.
