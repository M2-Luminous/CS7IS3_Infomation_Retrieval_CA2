In a statement to AL-RA'Y, 'Amr emphasized the importance of Arab coordination to face the challenges of this stage, particularly before this important meeting. 'Amr also said the PLO will sign an economic agreement with the Egyptian Government within the next few days, and expected that PLO Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi, or Pan-Arab Department head Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, will sign this agreement in Cairo. He said the signing of economic agreements between Palestine and its Arab neighbors is affirmation of its inseparable links with the Arab nation. He emphasized that the signing of the Palestinian-Jordanian economic agreement, and then the Palestinian-Egyptian economic agreement is evidence of the desire of the PLO and the Palestinian people to eliminate the Israeli economic hegemony after 26 years of occupation. 'Amr said the Palestinian objective out of signing such economic agreements is not to gain profits, but to entrench a line that the Palestinian people have been following for centuries, which is that they are an inseparable part of their Arab nation and Arab homeland. He stressed that concluding this economic agreement between Palestine and Egypt is very important due to the past links between the Gaza Strip and the Egyptian Government, especially after the occupation of Palestine in 1948. In an answer to a question, 'Amr said the Egyptian pound will not be the main currency [in the self-rule areas], and said Palestinian technical committees will organize all issues included in this agreement.
