FBIS4-12641 "drnes070yy_94002" FBIS-NES-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks Sha'th on Detainees, Withdrawal, Talks' Status Sha'th on Detainees, Withdrawal, Talks' Status NC1104144094 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1212 GMT 11 Apr 94 NC1104144094 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Cairo, 11 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, President 'Arafat's political adviser and head of the Palestinian side at the Palestinian-Israeli talks currently held in Cairo, said discussion of the release of the Palestinian detainees held in Israeli jails will be completed today. He added that the two sides are close to reaching agreement on a timetable for their release. According to the International Red Cross, the number of the Palestinian detainees is 10,400. Sha'th dismissed reports that the PLO excluded Hamas members from its request for the release of the detainees. He said a timetable will be devised for freeing all the detainees one way or another because the Palestinian negotiators represent the entire Palestinian people. Sha'th spoke about the obstacles impeding progress of the negotiations with Israel, those being fixing a date for withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and signing an agreement in this respect. He emphasized that the timetable of withdrawal is a very complex issue, particularly the starting date, which will coincide with the signing of the accord. He said: We have not yet reached agreement on such a date although we are approaching 13 April. He added that it is difficult to predict a date for signing an agreement this week. In his remarks, Dr. Sha'th said that the Israeli side yesterday submitted a proposal concerning the timetable for the Israeli forces' withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Dr. Sha'th noted that the present proposal is better than the unacceptable earlier proposal they made. However, we must discuss this issue more seriously today, he added. Dr. Sha'th urged the United States, in its capacity as a cosponsor of the peace conference, to do all it can to ensure that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles is implemented. The Palestinian official affirmed that no specific problems currently face the Palestinian-Israeli Legal Affairs Committee. But there are still certain issues to be discussed. Dr. Sha'th maintained that the principal problem of the negotiations is the time factor, because any delay in the signing of the agreement would create further clashes and incidents that could be harmful to the peace process. We want to spare our nations bloodshed as a result of any delay in signing the agreement pertaining to the implementation of the Declaration of Principles, Dr. Sha'th added. Meanwhile, Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, head of the Palestinian side at the Security Committee, has stated that the current negotiations are dealing with a number of basic topics that are necessary to reach an agreement during this round of negotiations. He stressed that no agreement has so far been reached in drawing up a timetable for the release of the Palestinian detainees. In his statement, al-Yahya said: I cannot specify a date for the entry of the police corps vanguards into Gaza and Jericho. He pointed out, however, that serious efforts are currently being made to ovebcome the differences affecting the two sides' views. The Palestinian official expects that Israel will soon lift the security blockade imposed on the occupied territories. Knowledgeable Palestinian sources have told MENA that the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Cairo are facing basic and serious obstacles and that the negotiations are moving in a vicious circle in view of the Israeli side's adherence to its previous stances. The same sources pointed out that the meetings of the committees stemming from the Gaza-Jericho Committee have not made any tangible progress. They said that under the circumstances, the meetings would be a waste of time unless the Israelis change their intransigent attitude. The Palestinian sources added that the Israeli side has so far refused to specify a timetable for the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. The Israeli side also has not submitted an acceptable proposal for the entry of the Palestinian police force into Gaza and Jericho. This is in addition to the continuing differences over the of type of arms to be carried by the Palestinian police force, the sources said. The sources maintained that Israel is trying to waste time and is betting on this factor to create divisions within the Palestinian ranks. Israel is also seeking to achieve gains in the negotiations, but this attempt is doomed to failure, the Palestinian sources said. The Palestinian sources affirmed that there is now a dire need to hold a high-level meeting between the Palestinian and Israeli sides to resolve the outstanding issues. If this is not possible, then those concerned with the peace process, particularly the United States and Egypt, should intercede to resolve the problems, the sources concluded.
