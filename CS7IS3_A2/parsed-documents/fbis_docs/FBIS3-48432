Branding this as a deliberate move to incite hostile feelings against and confrontation with the North and aggravate the North-South relations, a MINJU CHOSON analyst says: It is the South Korean puppets who are aggravating the North-South relations and rendering the situation on the Korean peninsula tense. Entering this year, the Kim Yong-sam group has staged war exercises against the North almost every day and is crying that in case the "Team Spirit" joint manouevres are suspended, it would hold an integrated war game of "Ulchi" and "Focus Lens" on a larger scale with the United States. The puppets are these days zealously resorting to North-South confrontation and anti-communist war racket. This is their desperate attempt to get out of the serious crisis. The Kim Yong-sam group, driven to an acute crisis in less than one year after its seizure of power, seeks to divert elsewhere the attention of the people by a more acute North-South confrontation and frantic anti-communist war racket and keep its power at whatever cost in reliance upon outside forces. North-South confrontation and war adventure, however, cannot be a way out of the crisis. It is as foolish as jumping from the frying pan into the fire.
