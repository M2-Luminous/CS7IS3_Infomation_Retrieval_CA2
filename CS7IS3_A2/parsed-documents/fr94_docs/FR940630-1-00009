FR940630-1-00009 FR940630-1-00003 By letter dated May 24, 1994, (Administrative Record No. TX&hyph;576), Texas submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Texas submitted the proposed amendment in response to required program amendments at 30 CFR 943.16(c) (1) and (2), (d), (f), (j) (1), (2), (3), and (4), (r), and (s) (59 FR 13200, March 21, 1994). The provisions of the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) at 16 TAC 11.221 and the Texas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act that Texas proposes to amend are: 1. Texas Coal Mining Regulations (TCMR) 778.116(m), Identification of interests and compliance information . Texas proposes to add language to require a permit application to include information on violations received pursuant to SMCRA's implementing Federal regulations, all SMCRA-approved Federal programs (OSM-administered Indian lands program and Federal programs for States), and all SMCRA-approved State programs, not just the Texas program, and information on air or water environmental protection violations received pursuant to any State laws, rules or regulations enacted pursuant to Federal laws, rules, or regulations and incurred by the applicant in any State, not just Texas. 2. TCMR 786.215 (e) and (f), Review of permit applications. (a) Texas proposes at TCMR 786.215(e)(1) to require the Commission to consider, as a basis for permit denial, information on cessation orders issued by States other than Texas, and (b) Texas proposes at TCMR 786.215(f) to require that issuance of permits is specifically prohibited whenever the Commission makes a determination that the applicant, anyone who owns or controls the applicant, or the operator specified in the application controls or has controlled surface coal mining and reclamation operations with a demonstrated pattern of willful violations of the Texas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act (TSCMRA), SMCRA, SMCRA's implementing Federal regulations, SMCRA-approved Federal programs, and all SMCRA-approved State programs, not just the Texas program, of such nature, duration, and with such resulting irreparable damage to the environment, as to indicate an intent not to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations. 3. TCMR 786.216 (i) through (n), Criteria for permit approval or denial . Texas proposes to delete TCMR 786.216(i) and to recodify paragraphs (j) through (o), accordingly. Existing TCMR 786.216(i) prohibits permit approval unless the Commission finds, in writing, that the applicant or the operator, if other than the applicant, does not control and has not controlled mining operations with a demonstrated pattern of willful violations of TSCMRA. 4. TCMR 788.225 (f), (g) and (h), Commission review of outstanding permits . (a) Texas proposes to revise TCMR 788.225(f)(3) to allow the Commission, when it finds that a permit was improvidently issued, to suspend the permit until the outstanding violation is abated or the penalty or fee is paid, and to add TCMR 788.225(f)(4) to allow the Commission to rescind such permit under the provisions of proposed TCMR 788.225(g). (b) Texas proposes to add TCMR 788.225(g) to provide that the Commission shall, for a permit found to have been improvidently issued, (1) serve the permittee with notice of the proposed suspension and rescission, and include in the notice the reasons for the Commission's findings, and (2) specify the conditions that must be met in order to prevent suspension or rescission of such improvidently issued permit. (c) Texas proposes to add TCMR 788.25(h) to specify that upon permit suspension or rescission, the permittee shall cease all surface coal mining and reclamation operations, except for specific abatement, reclamation, and other environmental protection measures required by the Commission. (d) Texas proposes to recodify existing paragraph (h) as TCMR 788.225(i). 5. Article 5920&hyph;11, (TSMCRA), section 21(c), Reporting notices of violations in permit applications . Texas proposes to delete from the first sentence of section 21(c) the words ``within the state'' from the phrase ``in connection with any surface coal mining operation within the state during the three-year period.'' III. Public Comment Procedures In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Texas program.
