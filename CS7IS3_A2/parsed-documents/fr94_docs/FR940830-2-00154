FR940830-2-00154 FR940830-2-00067 13. The Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain in the statement of assets and liabilities and the statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent that any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares of a Portfolio, it will also disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares of such Portfolio. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Fund's net asset value or public offering price will present each class of shares separately. 14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply SEC approval, authorization of, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Fund may make pursuant to its administrative 12b&hyph;1 plan, distribution and service plan or shareholder services plan in reliance on the exemptive order. 15. Any Purchase Class with a conversion feature will convert into a Target Class on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion. 16. If the Fund implements any amendment to a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the Target Class shares under the plan, existing Purchase Class will stop converting into Target Class shares unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. If such approval is not granted, the directors shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such Purchase Class shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class. A New Target Class or New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in any manner that the directors reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser and/or the Distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosure in an effective registration statement. 17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act Release No. 16169 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
