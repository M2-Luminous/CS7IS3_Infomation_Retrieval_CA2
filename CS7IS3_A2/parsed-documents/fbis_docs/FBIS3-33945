In an article published today, the paper adds: Iraq has implemented Section C of Resolution 687, as well as Resolution 715 on future monitoring. This requires the immediate lifting of the oil embargo, as well as an all-out lifting of the sanctions. The paper goes on to say: There are no provisions in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions that speak of a "probation period." As for waffler Clinton's talk about democracy and human rights, this is foolish talk. BABIL says: At a time when well-intentioned parties all over the world have continued to make statements on the need to lift the embargo, and when the positions of most permanent members of the UN Security Council on the embargo have undergone positive changes, Clinton, in his report to the Congress, reveals himself as a heretic. The paper adds: Clinton professes to be a staunch defender of civilized conduct at a time when he continues to slay elderly people, children, and women in Somalia. It was Clinton who ordered the missile attack on innocent civilians in Baghdad, causing the death of men and children on the night of 26-27 June 1993, when there were no hostilities between Iraq and the United States. The paper concludes by saying: Iraq's steadfastness, the determination of leader President Saddam Husayn, and the enhancement of the march of construction and jihad will remain the means to end the embargo, whether Clinton likes it or not.
