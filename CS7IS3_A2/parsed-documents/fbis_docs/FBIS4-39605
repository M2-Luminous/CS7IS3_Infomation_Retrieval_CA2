U.S. Plans for Invasion of Haiti"] [Text] Buenos Aires -- A specter is haunting Latin America. The specter of a U.S. military invasion. The head of the U.S. Administration has dusted it down and set it in train. Bill Clinton seems to need to show his compatriots and the world at large that he is a real man and not just an accidental "occupant" of the White House apartments. How can the United States claim to rule the world if it cannot cope with the insolent Haitian dictator General Raul Cedras, who is refusing under any circumstances to return power to Haiti's legally elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide? Pentagon specialists have already elaborated a plan for the occupation of Haiti. It is envisaged that the U.S. Marines would land first and carry out "surgical" strikes on and neutralize the Haitian Army. Having performed their mission, the Americans would leave and their place would be taken by inter-American forces created on the basis of contingents from the Latin American armies. Flying the flag of the United Nations and the OAS, they would be responsible for the main task of keeping the peace on Haiti and ensuring cooperation between the president as he returns to the country by foreign force of arms and the local bureaucracy. Exiled President Aristide has long advocated the U.S. plan. Senor Caputo, UN and OAS representative on Haiti, is in favor of the invasion. But what about the Latin American countries? Will they agree to pull Washington's chestnuts out of the fire? At the moment only one country -- Argentina -- has given its assent. Its President Carlos Menem has long hankered after exploits in the Caribbean in company with Washington. An Argentine frigate is already off the coast of Haiti. The other states in Latin America still remember former U.S. expeditions to Grenada (1983) and Panama (1989). Following the U.S. occupation of Grenada little changed there. Poverty and corruption in the top echelons of power are still the most striking feature of the incumbent democratic regime. The Americans promised Panama they would liberate it from the domination of the international drugs mafia. Some 4,000 civilian lives were sacrificed to these promises. However, General Noriega has long been in jail yet Panama still remains a paradise for the drug barons' operations. But who remembers that today when the occupation of Grenada boosted Reagan's popularity and the Panama operation turned Bush into one of the most popular of U.S. presidents? Today others' laurels are giving Clinton no peace.
