The news conference was attended by responsible officials; local and foreign journalists; journalists from REUTER TV, NHK TV, KYODO, and NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN; and freelance journalist Dominique Faulder. Singapore Prime Minister Mr. Goh Chok Tong said his trip to Myanmar is part of current efforts to assess economic opportunities for Singapore companies. He explained that Singapore is encouraging entrepreneurs and investors to invest in neighboring countries and that he had also visited the People's Republic of China, Vietnam, India, Thailand, and Indonesia in order to assess for himself the economic opportunities in those countries. He said he was also able to familiarize himself with political developments in those countries and that he came to Burma with similar objectives. Mr. Goh explained that the objective is to cooperate with the Government of the Union of Myanmar for investment in Myanmar and to study how to persuade Singapore investors. He said economics and politics are inseparable, and investors would like to know about developments in Myanmar before building hotels, offices, and factories. This is why he came -- to enable investors to discover for themselves, and for himself to assess developments in Myanmar. The Singapore prime minister said he did not discuss the issue of Myanmar's entry into ASEAN during his visit and he believes it is still premature to discuss the issue. He said Thailand, as host of the ASEAN meeting in July, can invite Myanmar if it wishes and there is an identity of views on this matter among the ASEAN nations. He said Myanmar has some delicate problems regarding economic and political affairs. He said that economically Myanmar authorities want to practice a market economy and attract more tourists and foreign investment. He said the Government of Myanmar fully understands the need for foreign investment and is aware of the impact of economic development on politics. He said that politically the Myanmar Government is striving to obtain unity with ethnic organizations. He cited the holding of the National Convention as a government undertaking. He said he discussed this matter at considerable length. In his view, the Myanmar Government has considerable problems in this regard. He said he learned that efforts are being made to improve the situation, and he expressed the hope that efforts appropriate to the time will be undertaken. Mr. Goh explained that he did not discuss human rights, but he discussed Myanmar's political situation extensively with Senior General Than Shwe and Secretary-1 Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt. He said the discussions included matters relating to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. However, as the discussions were private, he could not elaborate. He said Singapore follows the International Declaration on Human Rights and violations of human rights have an effect on the foreign policy of a country. However, he recognizes that human rights situations vary from country to country. He said he believes trade will benefit the people of Myanmar as international trade involves contact with people of other countries and will enable them to understand the procedures involved in international business. Continuing, Mr. Goh said that trade and investment are on the rise in Myanmar and this in turn will greatly benefit Myanmar society. He said he believes trade will benefit Myanmar society in the long term, but he did not discuss the matter of using Singapore as a model for developing Myanmar. The Myanmar Government is increasingly welcoming investment from Singapore. Singapore is interested in some sectors in Myanmar and he believes that the two countries will be able to cooperate for mutual benefit. He said the outstanding success of Singapore can be attributed to factors on all fronts. He said it is necessary to create a correct situation and that in order to create such a situation, an effective government is necessary, and such a government should be capable of organizing the people to obtain a common view. Furthermore, he said Singapore is located in a region which is experiencing accelerated development. He said Singapore is competitive internationally because it is able to organize the strength of the people, although it does not have any natural resources. He said, therefore, that it is necessary to combine organizational skills, national leadership, and the people's strength in order to create positive situations. Mr. Goh recalled that he visited Myanmar for the first time in 1980 and again in 1986. This is his third trip and he noted many changes in the country. He said Yangon [Rangoon] is now cleaner and the roads are wider with new buildings and renovated old buildings. He said these are signs of genuine economic improvement in the city of Yangon. He added that Myanmar desires foreign investment and has become more open. He said he believes prospects for progress in Myanmar are good, but he does not want to compare Myanmar to other countries. He said the ratio of the population to natural resources in Myanmar is very favorable and Myanmar can be described as having the best prospects in the region next to Malaysia. He said Myanmar has many mineral, forest, marine, and natural resources and fallow and virgin lands. He said he views Myanmar as a country very rich in natural resources and the exploitation of these natural resources is still very low. This is why he thinks Myanmar has very good potential. However, he said, it is necessary to create positive conditions for foreign investors. He said Myanmar has remained in self-isolation for many years and the present pressing economic problem is to link its economy to that of the free international market. He said the process will take time. He said there has been no foreign investment because foreign investors are still assessing the situation in Myanmar. Mr. Goh said the Myanmar side has given a practical response to foreign investors' concerns about the foreign exchange rate. He said the Myanmar Government said that entrepreneurs already know how to deal with the issue. He said the Myanmar side recognizes the high value of the kyat and the fact that the Foreign Exchange Certificate rate is based on the free market rate, although it cannot be described as a blackmarket rate. He said there is an official rate as well a free market rate. He said the entrepreneurs know how to operate with these rates. Mr. Goh said that although Myanmar has not officially joined regional circles, it needs to show more openness if it wishes to participate in regional affairs. He said he has encouraged and urged the Myanmar leaders on this matter. He said economics and politics are related and that there can be no economic relations with Myanmar without good political relations. He said the Singapore delegation came to Myanmar as a friend and it is necessary to have mutual benefits in a market economy. He said there should not be a one-sided situation wherein Singapore enjoys 80 percent of the profits while Myanmar only enjoys 20 percent. On the political front he urged Myanmar to return to the international community as he mentioned in his speech. He said at present Myanmar is isolated internationally and he believes Myanmar should make efforts to return to the international community. He said Singapore wishes to assist Myanmar in developing the tourist industry. In the next five years the number of tourists visiting Myanmar will increase from the current 100,000 to 200,000 or 300,000. He said that as the tourist industry develops, there will be more hotels, shops, and economic enterprises. He said Myanmar is a very rich agricultural country and he hopes it can meet domestic demand as well as enter the international market. He said agriculture could constitute a major export sector and expressed his hope that Myanmar's economic undertakings will be successful. Continuing, the Singapore prime minister said he believes the constructive engagement policy of ASEAN is correct. Myanmar remained in self-isolation for many years, but it is now opening itself economically to the world. He said the international community can help Myanmar by holding constructive discussions. He said because Myanmar has remained isolated for a long period, the policy of isolation will not be successful. He said efforts to make Myanmar more isolated will be in vain. He said because of these factors, he decided to visit and hold talks with the Myanmar leaders. He said discussions on some matters were delicate and he could not disclose details. He said Singapore was able to present its views to the Myanmar side and encouraged Myanmar to undertake certain measures. He said the main purpose of his visit to Myanmar this time is to find markets for investment by Singapore entrepreneurs. He said Singapore is well aware of the economic potential of Myanmar, but at the same time Singapore is aware of the delicate political situation. He said he came to Myanmar because he believes that his constructive discussions with the Myanmar leaders will help normalize the situation and that the time is ripe for a visit to Myanmar. He said he did not know whether the actions taken by Western countries match their words. However, countries pay great attention to economic relations. He said he urged Western leaders and entrepreneurs to visit Myanmar themselves because only then can they assess the situation in the country for themselves. Furthermore, what is more important is that they will be able to present their views to the Myanmar leaders. As more leaders and entrepreneurs visit, they will have more opportunities to present their views to the Myanmar leadership and Myanmar will benefit further. He said he discussed the political situation in Myanmar for a considerable time with Sr. Gen. Than Shwe and Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt. However, he said, his discussions were an expression of his views on what should be done in the future and they do not amount to giving advice. He said the discussions were private. He said there was no pressure from the U.S. for improving relations between Myanmar and Singapore. He said even if the U.S. applies pressure it will not bring any results. He said Singapore is an independent nation which practices an independent foreign policy. The news conference ended at 1140.
