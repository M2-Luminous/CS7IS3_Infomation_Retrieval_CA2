The microwave generator used was a highly precise relativistic generator based on a triode with a virtual cathode. The energy of a strong relativistic beam is transformed with an efficiency up to 30-40% into the energy of an electromagnetic field with the oscillatory motion of electrons in a potential well created by the real and virtual cathodes. High-voltage explosive-magnetic generators with interception of the magnetic flux, which are fed by spiral explosive-magnetic generators, were developed for transforming the explosion energy into electromagnetic energy. The matching of the impedances of the explosive-magnetic generators and the relativistic generator, as well as the shaping of the necessary form of the electric pulse, was accomplished using electroexplosive current interrupters. As a result, voltage pulses up to 600 kV with a steepness of the leading edge about 60 ns are sent to the relativistic generator; the amplitude of the current across the triode attained 16 kA. The peak power of the microwave radiation sent into the atmosphere was not less than 100 MW. A model of operation of system elements is proposed. The experimental apparatus is described in detail. It is shown that the theoretical computations are reasonably consistent with experimental data. Figures 6; references 19: 16 Russian, 3 Western.
