Nikolay Yegorov, Russian deputy minister of atomic energy, who attended the consultations, told journalists that there were three possible solutions to the problem: Build a purification complex on the territory of the yard itself; set up the same system in an isolated area of the Maritime Kray; or introduce advanced purification plants. As has already been reported, Russia and Japan have signed an agreement on an allocation by the Japanese side of $70 million toward converting Russia's arms enterprises. There are plans to use part of this money at the Zvezda yard.
