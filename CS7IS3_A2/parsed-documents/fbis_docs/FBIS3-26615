The 20-character principle is to: "Seize the opportunity (zhua zhu ji yu 2119 0145 2623 6657), deepen the reform (shen hua gai ge 3234 0553 2395 7245), open up wider (kuo da kai fang 2368 1129 7030 2397), promote development (cu jin fa zhan 0191 6651 4099 1455), and maintain stability (bao chi wen ding 0202 2170 4489 1353)." This principle is aimed at solving the problem of the relationship between reform, development, and stability from the high plane of understanding and practice. It Is Necessary To Properly Handle the Relationship Between the Three As far as this reporter knows, the senior leadership of the CPC Central Committee hold that the relationship between reform, development, and stability should be as follows: Reform is the motive force of development, development is the goal of reform, and stability is the prerequisite for, and guarantee of, reform and fulfillment of the goal. As long as we can properly handle the relationship between the three, the construction of the entire national economy can take on the normal path of "sustained, rapid, and healthy development (chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455)." Since the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee held last year, two kinds of completely different understanding on a large number of reform measures introduced all at once by the central authorities in 1994, which are vigorous and profound and have great impact, have existed in society: First, some people are doubtful of the full-scale reform implemented in 1994: Are the conditions ripe? Have we been really thoughtful? Have we made full preparations for it? Second, others consider it as the coming of another chance for high-speed development. This situation has attracted great attention from the senior leadership. According to authoritative sources, when discussing the major reform measures introduced in 1994, all members of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau unanimously held that 1994 was a rare and probably the best opportunity. Their reply to people who are doubtful of the measures was: There is a risk in reform but we do not fear it because we have made full preparations. Viewed from the angle of the senior leadership, what they describe as full preparations come from two sides: First, the whole macroscopic environment has created conditions for promoting reform. These conditions include the establishment of Deng Xiaoping's ideological theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the macroscopic economic environment, the experience drawn from reform and opening up over the past 15 years, the establishment of the new system of socialist market economy advocated by the CPC Central Committee, and the extensive support of the masses given to the overall framework of the socialist market economy. Second, the reform measures introduced have been repeatedly expounded and proved. The Reform Package Is More Mature The authoritative sources said: From last May onwards, Jiang Zemin has been personally in command of the design of the reform package and the whole process was divided into two parts. The first part was mainly handled by intellectuals who studied the issue from the angle of theoretical knowledge; whereas the second part was mainly handled by leading cadres with experience in practice who approached the issue from practical work experience. In this way, personnel in charge of the two parts repeatedly studied the issue. During this period, hundreds of meetings, ranging from professional meetings, to CPC Central Committee Political Bureau meetings, and even to Political Bureau Standing Committee meetings were held. At last, the package was submitted to the Third Plenary Session for approval. Hence, the reform package is more mature after long deliberation. As commented by a senior leader: We must be resolute when we have to, we should never hesitate, and we must strive to make a major breakthrough within two to three years. We can turn back and deal with minor problems after the major problems of the system have been solved. In this way, we can create conditions for development. The Scale of Capital Construction Cannot Be Expanded To reform, it is necessary to take risks and to develop, it is necessary to care about conditions. Obviously, the central authorities are critical of the trend of blindly seeking rapid development. Hence, the central authorities call for "promoting development" instead of "accelerating development." As far as the senior leadership is concerned, the 13 percent growth for two consecutive years is a very high pace of development and there will be greater risks in reform if we further accelerate the pace of development, apart from strengthening reform, in 1994. For example, the present high level of capital construction, which has reached 1.2 trillion yuan, is unlikely to scale down. If the central authorities further lay stress on accelerating development, it will heighten the scale of capital construction and will definitely trigger off high inflation, thus causing great problems in reform or even falling short of success for lack of a final effort. Hence, the senior leadership of the central authorities insist on a "soft landing" for economic development this year and keep reaffirming the necessity to guard against overheated economic development and to impose strict control on the scale of capital construction. The central authorities are calling for development, step by step, in a down-to-earth manner. Li Peng Granted 100 Million Yuan in Allowances for Undergraduates Stability is the prerequisite of reform and development. Over the past few years, the senior leadership of the central authorities has always placed stability in an extremely important position and have strived to maintain political and social stability and stable popular support to create a less restricted environment for reform and to lay a good foundation for development. In order to maintain stability, the central authorities paid close attention to every issue, ranging from big issues such as interstate relations to small ones such as whether or not primary and secondary school students and undergraduates had enough to eat. It has been learned that due to commodity price rises caused by high-speed economic growth last year, undergraduates from the hinterland did not have enough to eat even though each of them was granted 100 yuan in food allowance. Unlike their schoolmates from coastal provinces, undergraduates from the hinterland do not have well-to-do families to support them. In order to solve these students' living problems and to stabilize their mood for learning, State Council Premier Li Peng personally granted 100 million yuan to the State Education Commission as special funds for subsidizing students who did not have enough to eat. The authoritative sources said: Decisionmakers at the central level hold that although economic development problems arose in 1993, it was still a brilliant year. In 1994, the overall economy still maintains a very good development trend. In order to maintain this trend, decisionmakers at the central level urge everyone throughout the country, when doing all kinds of work, to be subordinated to the 20-character principle extracted from the experiences and lessons of 1993.
