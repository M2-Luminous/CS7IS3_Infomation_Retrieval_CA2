On this issue, Rawi Hongpraphat, the deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's Information Department and deputy ministry spokesman, said that he did not wish to make a rebuttal, adding that the prime minister's visit clearly demonstrated Thailand's stand: that is, Thailand wanted Cambodia to be confident in the former's attitude toward it, and it wanted to further strengthen relations with the Cambodian Government. To date Thailand has displayed its sincerity, Rawi said. Therefore, he could not understand the reason for the repeated negative news. If there was anything Cambodia had wanted to know, it could have made inquiries through the Thai Embassy, as agreed upon by both sides concerning the dissemination of information and news conferences. In any event, the deputy foreign ministry spokesman is confident that the prime minister's visit will promote a good climate and provide direction for Thai-Cambodian relations. This is because support for the Khmer Rouge is not the policy of the Thai Government or a basis of operations of the Thai armed forces. If there are allegations about any involvement by Thai military officials without the knowledge of the armed forces, it is the duty of the armed forces to investigate.
