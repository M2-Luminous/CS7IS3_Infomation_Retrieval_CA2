One event takes place after another just a chess game. The problem is who ends the game. The climax of Sabah politics is seen in the verdict passed on Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan's corruption case. The court found him guilty of corruption but he was still allowed to run in the state elections and he did not have to quit his post of chief minister. The reason is that he was fined 1,800 ringgit and this saved him from Article 17 (1)(e) of the Sabah state Constitution and Article 48 (e) of the federal Constitution, which would have fined him 2,000 ringgit or put him in jail for one year. This would have disqualified him from running in the elections. What is interesting is that not only the Sabah people, but also PBS [Sabah United Party] leaders and members are speculating that Pairin will quit the party chairman post at the end of his trial. Therefore, rumors have it that several PBS senior leaders, including Datuk Ariyah Tengku Ahmad, Datuk Bernard Dompok, and Datuk Joseph Kurup have been mentioned as potential successors of Pairin as PBS leader. On the day of Pairin's court verdict, a banner saying: "Moyog State Constituency Wants Datuk Bernard as New Sabah Chief Minister" was unfurled on Karamunsing Road. With the sighting of the banner, people had reason to believe that a power struggle within PBS has begun, but this was quickly denied by PBS leaders. Bernard Dompok was assemblyman for the said constituency. Datuk Clarence Bongkos Malakun, PBS deputy leader, who recently became more outspoken in releasing his frustations, disclosed that the party, established in 1985, is being split into two factions. As he spoke in his capacity as deputy leader, his remarks definitely should not be taken for granted. Bongkos said one faction was trying to befriend the federal government or the ruling National Front, while the other faction is opposed to it. What is interesting is Bongkos' assertion that Pairin was actually not the person who masterminded the PBS's decision to leave the National Front in 1990, resulting in the strained relations between PBS and the National Front. Even though Bongkos' remarks may have ulterior motives, what is important is that PBS seems to have an internal rift. However, both the National Front and UMNO [United Malays National Organization] should not be overconfident about the PBS alleged split because it can serve as a trap to make them lower their guard. If they are negligent and enjoy discussing the PBS internal rift, they may have to wait another five years to recapture Sabah. If we look at the issue carefully, we can see that the main cause of the rift is that the majority of PBS leaders want to join the National Front. These leaders have realized that without joining the National Front, the PBS will get nowhere. The proof is easily visible. Ruled by the PBS in the past nine years, Sabah is the poorest state with the highest unemployment rate in Malaysia. Other states in peninsular Malaysia as well as Sarawak have made rapid progress in development. The decision to leave the National Front may be beneficial in the short-term, but the PBS and Sabah people have now begun to realize that this is not true for the long-term. This shows that the decision to leave the National Front just a few days before the general elections in 1990, described by the National Front as a stab in the back, is a very risky political gamble. But now, on the eve of state elections on 18-19 February, rumors are rife that PBS wants to rejoin the National Front and set up a coalition government after the elections. Being aware of the danger of such rumors, UMNO leaders quickly dismissed them. UMNO leaders, including Tan Sri Mohamed Taib and Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as well as Tan Sri Abdul Rahim expressed doubts as to how the PBS can possibly join the National Front when the party has not yet submitted a formal application for such a purpose. Muhyiddin described the rumors as a dirty tactic launched by the PBS to gain sympathy votes. At the same time, Sabah UMNO expressed confidence that it will be able to set up its own state government without having to set up a coalition government with the PBS. Political observers noted that when the PBS is cornered, the party will do anything possible to maintain power in the state. The Chinese community in Sabah is also believed to have realized that under the PBS, they have been put into a disadvantageous position. They said they will follow the winds of change and vote for the National Front, whose leadership style is already proven. There are also talks that Chinese leaders in the PBS are being discriminated against. The fruits of development carried out by the PBS have benefitted one ethnic group only. An undeniable fact is that Sabah has now lagged behind other states in development. To cope with the increasingly exciting Sabah political situation, Sabah UMNO must be united and act in a coordinated way. To play political chess against the PBS, one must be skillful and capable of anticipating its next move. There are times when the PBS looks as if it is losing, but at the critical moment it shows its real strategy and strength and eventually wins the battle. This has happened three times in elections since the PBS has ruled Sabah, namely on 21 April 1985, 6-7 May 1986, and 16-17 July 1990. Therefore, the National Front and Sabah UMNO must be doubly careful and must not allow the PBS to exploit any election issue. The most important mission is that they must hoist the National Front flag on top of Kinabalu Mountain. The National Front must seek ways to win the hearts of the Sabah people and explain the government policies to them so they will not fall victim to PBS propaganda. Everyone knows that the Sabah people themselves will determine what kind of government they want to elect, but those who live in remote and isolated areas must at least get adequate information to enable them to decide what is most beneficial for them. This is the heavy task the National Front currently has to face. Amidst the uncertain and confused political scenario, the National Front must pay attention to the following issues: A. If the PBS is indeed accepted into the National Front on the eve of state elections, will the Sabah UMNO accept the fact? Political observers predict that prominent PBS leaders may not run in the elections so that the PBS will be allowed to join the National Front again. B. Is the PBS going to exploit the issue of Tun Datuk Mustapha Harun, the Sabah Father of Independence, in case he decides to run in the elections, or is the PBS going to nominate his sons against him if he decides to run? C. Are the National Front and UMNO ready to cope with the Sabah tradition of party members changing their political loyalty? D. If Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan, currently under restricted detention in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan, is allowed to run in the elections, are the National Front and UMNO ready for it?
