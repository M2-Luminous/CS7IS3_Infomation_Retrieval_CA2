Although the once-hot fever has now dissipated, we have recently seen a series of achievements in this field. Among them, achievements by Japanese teams announced one after another -- including the preparation of a superconductive single-crystal thin film and the observation of bulk superconductivity at a critical temperature of 150K -- are being marveled at by researchers worldwide. Japan may soon be leading the world in implementing the dream superconductive devices. 30-�m-Thick Yttrium-Based Superconductive Thin Film In a recent announcement, the Superconductivity Research Laboratory (SRL) of the International Superconductivity Technical Center (ISTEC) disclosed the successful preparation of an yttrium-based (YBaCuO) superconductor's single-crystal thin film by liquid-phase epitaxial growth, as a continuation of the study concerning the single-crystal pulling (preparation of a large single crystal through continuous growth), in cooperation with the Nagoya Laboratory and the Fourth Laboratory. The newly prepared, 30-�m-thick single-crystal thin film showed a critical temperature of 86K from its magnetizability after two-hour annealing in oxygen at 500�C. Previously, thin films were prepared by deposition from the vapor phase, e.g., the sputtering method, and it was difficult to prepare single-crystal films. The new method, in contrast, uses a comparatively simple device and permits the preparation of high-quality films to any desired thickness. Thus, the new method is said to significantly contribute to application research of devices, clarification of basic properties, and establishment of an oxide-based superconductivity theory. On the latest achievement of SRL, Director Shoji Tanaka enthusiastically told us: "Despite our having caused a sensation seven years ago, we had been unable to achieve any practical application because of the lack of material technology. Therefore, while the world's attention was focused on ceramics, we borrowed the single-crystal pulling technology from semiconductors. This time we were successful. However, in order to apply single crystals for electronics, we needed to develop thin-film technology, especially, homo-epitaxy technology (using the same material for both substrate and film), in addition to single crystals. In this sense, the successful thin-film preparation this time can be a breakthrough to start the superconducting device era." The newest single-crystal film was prepared by using the SRL-CP (solute-rich liquid crystal pulling) method, which had previously been developed to produce large single-crystal bulk materials, with a substrate of MgO onto which Y[.sub]1[/]Ba[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-x[/] was crystallized from a liquid phase. The experimental apparatus consisted of an electric furnace for heating, and a drive mechanism for the substrate. Oxides of Y, Ba and Cu were blended at a pre-determined ratio, and the blend was pre-baked at a high temperature for 10 hours. The pre-baked powder was melted in an yttria ceramic crucible to produce a liquid phase. The MgO single-crystal substrate, 10 x 10[.sup]t[/] x 0.5mm, while being rotated, was brought in contact with the liquid phase to deposit a single crystal from the liquid phase onto it. The YBaCuO film deposited from the liquid phase onto the substrate was confirmed to have c-axis orientation by X-ray analysis. The thickness of the film prepared by a 15-minute-long deposition process was 30 microns, as determined by microscopic observation, indicating the extreme dense structure of the film. Furthermore, X-ray reverse Laue photography revealed that the film was a single crystal deposited from the liquid phase. Observation of 150K-Tc Bulk Superconductivity Under Ultra-High Pressure About the same time the news on the thin-film preparation was announced, the three-organization team of SRL, the Second Research Laboratory, and the Institute for Solid State Physics, Tokyo University, reported that it had observed the initiation of the Meissner effect at 149K (Tc[.sup]mag[/]) by a mercury-based copper oxide superconductor (Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O) under ultra-high pressure. The same sample showed Tc[.sup]mag[/] of 134K under normal pressure. Thus, the material's Tc[.sup]mag[/] was increased by applying pressure, and the 149K Tc[.sup]mag[/] was obtained under 8.5 GPa (equals approximately 840,000 atm). This is considered to be an extremely important achievement that hints at the possibility of the development of a new superconductor with a critical temperature in the vicinity of 150K. The previous highest Tc[.sup]mag[/] for mercury-based copper oxide superconductors had been 134K, much lower than the temperature observed this time. A spokesperson at SRL told us this: "On 10 August 1993, at the International Cryogenic Physics Society meeting (LT-20), Professor C. W. Chu, University of Houston, reported a Tc of 156K under high pressure of 15 GPa (details are unclear as of this writing). The fact that similar results were independently obtained by two research organizations proves that this substance shows a high critical temperature for superconductivity under ultra-high pressure." The superconductor used for the observation of the record Tc was a Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O-based material with the raw-material oxide powder ratio, Hg:Ba:Ca:Cu, being 1:2:1:3. After blending powders of HgO, BaO, CaO and CuO at the above ratio, the mixture was molded. The green was sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, calcined for one hour at 700�C, and later subjected to post-heat treatment for six hours at 300�C in a flow of oxygen. As a result of X-ray analysis and high-resolution electron microscope observation, the primary phase of this material showed an Hg-1223 structure. Direct current magnetizability measurements revealed that the material's Tc[.sup]mag[/] was 134K under normal pressure and that the material was a bulk superconductor with a Meissner volume fraction of more than 10 percent. This superconductor, along with a coil, was mounted on a cubic anvil-type ultra-high pressure generator to measure the material's AC magnetizability at various temperatures under ultra-high pressure below 8.5 GPa. Tc[.sup]mag[/] values determined from AC magnetizability values varied with pressure as follows. Under pressure below 6 GPa, dTc[.sup]mag[/]/dP was large at approximately 2.0K/GPa, whereas under pressure above 6 GPa, the slope decreased, although Tc[.sup]mag[/] reached 149K under pressure of 8.5 GPa. SRL explains it this way: "We were able to confirm, through the observation under ultra-high pressure, that the Meissner volume fraction with nearly the same level of superconductivity was maintained under the high pressure as under normal pressure (more than 10 percent) and that the material regained its initial, normal-pressure characteristics when the applied pressure was released. The Tc[.sup]mag[/] might have exceeded 150K, if pressure of more than 8.5 GPa had been applied." During the first 60 years, since the discovery in 1911 of the superconductivity phenomenon, the critical temperature increased from 4K to only 23.2K. However, since the discovery of oxide-based superconductors in 1986, the critical temperature (when it exceeds 77K, the cheaper coolant, nitrogen, can be used) began to increase rapidly, and now it is almost at 150K. Advantages of superconductivity include the passage of large currents without power loss, the exclusion of magnetic force penetration to the inside of a superconductor (Meissner effect), and the passage of currents through a thin insulator layer (Josephson effect). Thus, superconductivity is expected to not only increase energy efficiency in an epoch-making fashion, but also be applied in many different fields. While energetic research is undertaken in many parts of the world, the recent achievements in Japan must be extremely significant in spurring practical applications of superconductivity, including applications in the electronic field.
