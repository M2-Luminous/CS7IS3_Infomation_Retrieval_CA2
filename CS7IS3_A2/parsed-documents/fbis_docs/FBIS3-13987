Most of the vehicles seen on the roads belong to the security forces who have their bunkers after nearly every 300 metres. They have also taken on lease most of the cinema halls, hotels and commercial establishments in the towns. The strength of the security forces deployed in the state has doubled between 1989 and 1991, after it was decided to seal the porous borders. In the three-tier system of defence, army jawans man the forwardmost areas; the second line is looked after by the BSF [Border Security Forces] while the BSF and the CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force] are deployed in the towns and villages. The first success came when the infiltration of about 3,500 Pak-trained militants was thwarted. They were forced to spend the winter across the border, with the cordon and search operations in full swing. The crackdown led to the nabbing of Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, the supreme commander of Al Umar. Altaf Qureishi, chief of the Ikhwan-ul-Musalmeen, was killed. And then came Sopore, supposedly a "liberated zone," which has been won back by the security forces, forcing many militants to flee the valley. Around the same time, stray reports of the atrocities of militants on fellow Kashmiris started trickling in. The number of such complaints is on the rise. "A seven-year-old girl and five married women walked into a BSF bunker to escape some militiants who tried to molest them. We were able to catch the culprits and the women became our `cats' (informers). Two of them were later killed but we have given protection and jobs in the CRPF to the others," said an officer. In Srinagar city, as in Sopore, it is the men of the BSF who are "holding on to the land." The bunker walls are made of sand bags, the roofs of tin. The flooring is generally the waterlogged slushy roadside and the air inside stinks, whether it is Chhattarbal, Saida Kadal or Karan Nagar. The freezing temperatures add to the woes of the security forces who have to keep a constant vigil. The shots can come from a window or door of any of the three-storeyed houses in all the four directions. More than the cruel weather, it is the `virtual abandonment' by the government that the security forces lament about the most. "When our soldiers are killed by these cowards who use human shields there is no human rights violation. There is no good word for the restraint shown by us to ensure that no civilian is killed. And then to expect us to sit back and watch our men being fired at, whether in Bijbehara, or Kupwara! Where are our human rights?" asked an officer. The recent killing of Maj Bhupender Singh of the Border Roads Organisation is cited as an example of the government's callous attitude to the man in the bunker. "When the government releases some guys it demoralises us. The pain becomes worse when we see that there is no consistent policy. For five days they were negotiating and bargaining over the life of Bhupender Singh. But he did not seem to matter," said a colleague of his. The manner in which the Hazratbal incident was allowed to drift to has upset the forces. While it may have helped the government as far as world pressure was concerned, it was a setback for them. The militants used the 32-day siege to effect large-scale transfers of their men from one district to another. The `cats' or mukhbirs, who help identify the militants from the suspects rounded up, became helpless after that. The security forces also feel that the government has not planned the anti-militancy drive well. The Punjab government, they point out, had announced big awards on the heads of wanted men, giving a share to the informers as well. Such an incentive would increase the list of informers, they argue. Despite the strong resentment against the government, the forces have been moving around, trying to win back the Kashmiris. The BSF set up a clinic and posted a doctor to provide medical care to women and children in the downtown areas. But those who turned up were threatened by the militants. For the security forces, it is a plain and simple war, where the enemy is well-armed, well-trained and well-funded. "If we die, we may get only an award," lamented a jawan. It was clear that unless other inputs went into solving the Kashmir problem, the majority of the jawans posted to internal security duties would put in their papers at the earliest pensionable opportunity. "Given the fact that 45 battalions are posted in J&K and that we have a two-year posting now (earlier it was four years), we will be back here after four years. For, a third of the BSF is deployed here," explained an officer. *
