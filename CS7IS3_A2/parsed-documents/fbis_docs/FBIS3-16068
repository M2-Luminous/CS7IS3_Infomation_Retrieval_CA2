Defense Ministry press secretary Maige Proom neither confirmed nor denied the information. The Defense Ministry and the Defense Forces general staff have for months held talks with several enterprises that are prepared to manufacture NATO standard 5.56 mm, 9 mm and 7.62 mm ammunition. At least two Estonian companies, the Turi-based Arbalett joint-stock company, one of whose shareholders is the Defense League Foundation, and the Tartu-based state-owned Tarkon, have applied to the Defense Ministry to start production of cartridges. Tarkon's director Toomas Noorem said in an earlier interview with BNS that his company is fully capable of and interested in producing cartridges. Defense Minister Indrek Kannik was scheduled to visit the Tarkon plant today. Defense Ministry Deputy Chancellor Tarmo Molder claimed in an interview with BNS that locally made cartridges would in any case be cheaper than, for example, ammunition imported from Israel. Lieutenant Colonel Romas Zibas, head of the Lithuanian Defense Forces general staff's military training department, told BNS a couple of weeks ago that Lithuania is already producing its own cartridges and grenades. He said his country also plans in the near future to start manufacturing 60 mm and 80 mm mortars and shells. The Latvian Defense Ministry invited bids from domestic manufacturers to start producing ammunition locally.
