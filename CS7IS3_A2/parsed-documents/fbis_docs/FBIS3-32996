[sentence as received] The government of President Bill Clinton this week appointed Richard Lobo to head the so-called Radio and TV Marti stations. Lobo is said to be an ally of the groups that are hostile to the Cuban revolutionary system. "This individual does not have a critical point of view, much less an objective one, regarding those media sources.... He is an extremist, because he would not have received support to be appointed to that position if this were not the case," said Andres Gomez, leader of the Antonio Maceo Brigade in Miami, during a telephone conversation with PRENSA LATINA. The extreme rightist Cuban-American Foundation immediately expressed its support for Lobo and stated the Cuban community should be very proud of Washington's appointment. "No. There is no way the majority in our community approves of this appointment, because we do not even approve of Radio and TV Marti," Gomez added. His organization is part of a moderate current among Cuban immigrants in the United States that promotes a rapprochement with Havana Gomez said he was almost sure Lobo was "a foundation man." This organization was created during the years of the Reagan administration, when the largest aggression against the Cuban revolutionary government was carried out. "Nothing that comes from that stock can elicit my admiration or pride," said Andres Romero of the Cuban-Americans for Dignity Organization, during a telephone conversation from Miami. According to Romero, Lobo's appointment responds to the efforts of political sectors in Washington that are interested in obtaining an "extremist-styled" solution to continue making money with the broadcast of hostile propaganda against Cuba. Since it was first aired in March 1990, TV Marti's broadcasts have been unable to reach Cuban television viewers, but the U.S. Congress approved a budget of almost $22 million to continue the operations of the Radio and TV Marti stations for one more year. Havana authorities have charged those media sources are part of a coercive program to subvert Cuba's internal order.
