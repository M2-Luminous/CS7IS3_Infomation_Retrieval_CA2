Today Karadzic arrived in Moscow to receive the Sholokhov literature prize. During his visit Karadzic intends to meet Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev also but in the words of the leader of the Bosnian Serbs himself he will not raise the question of Russia recognizing the Serbian Republic. At the same time Karadzic voiced the wish that Russian diplomats in the Balkans should be more understanding towards the problems of the Bosnian Serbs. Karadzic also called for expansion of the Russian peacemaking contingent in Bosnia and Herzegovina. [Begin Karadzic recording -- in Russian] We think this would be a necessary expansion because they would be more objective than soldiers from Muslim sides [storony]. We did not resist when soldiers from Muslim sides came but we think there could be big problems if the UN decides to leave and then soldiers from the Muslim sides might stay and then the balance would be upset. [end recording] Commenting on the decision of the U.S. Congress to lift the embargo on arms supplies to Bosnia, Karadzic said in his interview to Radio Moscow Echo: [Begin Karadzic recording] It has to be said that there is no embargo because the Muslims are getting arms every day and sometimes I think it might be in our interests if the Americans lifted the embargo and sanctions on the Muslims and then Russia and the Ukraine and other states around Serbia which have difficulties with the sanctions might lift the sanctions against Serbia.
