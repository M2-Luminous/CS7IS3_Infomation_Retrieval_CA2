The two rims -- one around Beijing and Tianjin, north China's two biggest cities, the other around Bohai Bay, with a coastline of more than 400 kilometers -- are the backbone of the provincial economy, the governor said. About 32 cities and counties in the province, with a population of 18 million, are located in the area of the Bohai Bay Ring, including big and medium-sized cities such as Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, Changzhou and Shijiazhuang. Nearly 300 state-owned enterprises of the province have been set up in this area, accounting for 43 percent of its total. This year is vital in putting into practice the program drawn up last year by the provincial government for further opening up and development of the ring area, the official said. In contrast, the governor said that the great influence of the booming urban economic development was felt by most of the province's counties and towns around the Beijing-Tianjin rim. With the help of the two big cities, rural residents nearby are likely to become better off much faster than those in other areas, he predicted. He said that the province had 52 villages whose total production output of industry and agriculture topped 100 million yuan, and the majority of them are situated around the ring. He added that the production growth rate of the areas around the two rims is also two to three percentage points higher than the province's average. Last year, the provincial gross domestic production value was increased by 16.5 percent, and that of the economic rims accounted for 40 percent of the total. The governor said that 1994 is witnessing a shift to an export- oriented economy in the Bohai Bay rim, attracting more foreign investment to quicken the pace of development zone construction. According to the official, the province has planned to set aside tracts of land totalling 20 square kilometers for a new development zone for overseas investors. The planned area is rich in natural resources such as minerals, and has a favorable climate. Currently, the province has set up more than 1,000 joint ventures, over 80 percent of which center around the rim area. Also built in the area were one major farm and sideline production center and a key base for aquatic products and sea salt, both the biggest of their sort in north China. In addition, the area is strong in development of steel, coal, building materials and petrochemical industries, with its rich natural resources. So far more than 40 minerals have been found in the area. More convenient and efficient traffic and transport networks have also helped to boost the economic growth around the two rims. Apart from a number of main railways, there are over 3,000 kilometers of highways and newly-built expressways. Around Bohai Bay lie north China's three big ports: Tianjin, Dalian (in Liaoning Province) and Qinhuangdao (in Hebei Province). The annual cargo throughput of Qinhuangdao Port is close to 100 million tons, next in volume to Shanghai Port. According to the governor, this year will witness a rapid expansion of the effects of the Bohai economic rim to a wider area of over 39,000 square kilometers. He concluded that the provincial government has decided to build more joint ventures in this area. Local enterprises with educated workforce and good economic returns will be chosen to team up with foreign counterparts.
