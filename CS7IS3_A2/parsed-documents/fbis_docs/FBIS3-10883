Concerning the important issue of recruiting, we interviewed Colonel Jorge Romero Alonso, chief of the Minfar [Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces] directorate: [Begin Romero Alonso recording] The most significant aspect concerning recruitment is that, in comparison with 1992 and despite the situation in our country, we have achieved some progress. For example, recruitment this year was 1-percent higher and of better quality. We have had a better approach to problems affecting personnel, giving better treatment to the men. This means that, notwithstanding the tense situation, people have increased their contribution of that which we already have: the love of work, the dedication, and the care that have characterized our workers. This year we have had to make a tremendous effort concerning recruitment. We had to create a division here in Havana to work 44 percent of the province's arable land. Today we have almost 6,000 men. This was not included in any plan; it was done because of the emergency situation in the country. This will help increase citrus production on the Isle of Youth, under the Giron victory plan, and tobacco production in Pinar del Rio. Thus, the growth of the EJT [Youth Labor Army] has been considerable in helping meet all transportation needs without causing any problems whatsoever for the personnel. [end recording]
