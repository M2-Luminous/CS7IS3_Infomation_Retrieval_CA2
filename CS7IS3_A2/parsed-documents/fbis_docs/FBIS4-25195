C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, June 6 (CNA) -- The Taiwan economy is expected to continue its modest growth in the second half of 1994, the First Commercial Bank reported Monday [6 Jun]. In its report on domestic economic outlook for the next six months, the bank said the domestic economy will benefit from the gradual recovery of the global economy, the depreciation of the new Taiwan dollar, the ongoing six-year national development plan, the government's economic stimulus package, increasing private consumption, and stable consumer prices. Citing estimates made by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), the bank noted that the world economy should grow 3 percent this year as compared with 2.2 percent last year, and said the domestic economy should expand 6.24 percent in the third quarter and 6.30 percent in the fourth quarter. The estimated economic growth for the latter half of the year is better than that of the first six months, which the DGBAS put at 5.58 percent. The bank, one of the three big banks run by the Taiwan provincial government -- the other two being Hua Nan Commercial Bank and Chang Hwa Commercial Bank, also saw some negative factors coming into play in the next six months. These include increasing government debt, sluggishness in domestic investment, a lack of progress in major construction projects, the worsening labor shortage, uncertainty caused by ever- increasing indirect trade across the Taiwan Strait, and stiff export competition from the mainland and Southeast Asian countries, the bank report elaborated. The government's debt level is expected to soar to an all-time high of NT$1.37 trillion (U.S.$50.55 billion) in fiscal 1995, which begins on July 1. Meanwhile, the report saw as a positive sign the expected stable growth of the domestic money supply between July and December. It said the M2 supply should grow at an annual rate of between 14 percent and 16 percent, or near the 15 percent target set by the Central Bank of China. The broadly-defined M2 is the total stock of money in the national economy comprising cash in circulation, checking and demand deposits, passbook savings accout , plus quasi-money (including time deposits and treasury bills). The M2 supply rose by 14.84 in the first quarter, higher than the 14.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993. The money supply increased by a 12-month high of 15.41 percent in April. The expected improvement in foreign trade, growing foreign investment in the domestic stock market, and the lowering of domestic interest rates are expected to help push up the capital demand from the private sector, the report pointed out. Taiwan's foreign trade surplus totaled only U.S.$590 million in the first four months of the year, down 66.9 percent from the year- earlier level, while foreign institutional investors have applied to invest U.S.$9.347 billion in the Taiwan stock exchange since the ban on foreign stock investment was lifted in late 1992. In addition, domestic financial institutions slashed interest rates one after another last week following similar moves in March and April.
