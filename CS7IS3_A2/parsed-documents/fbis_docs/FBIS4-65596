It will be the first set of war games by British troops in a former Warsaw Pact country. The four-day manoeuvre, which will focus on peace-keeping and involve 96 British soldiers, is one of the first concrete signs of the long-mooted military relationship between eastern and western Europe coming to life. In a related move, Germany and the Netherlands yesterday announced an initiative to upgrade the powers of the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. This initiative will be welcome in Moscow and could help to allay growing Russian concerns over ties between its former allies and members of NATO. The German-Dutch proposals coincide with ideas mooted by President Boris Yeltsin during his visit to Germany last week, and they suggest that a tentative compromise is emerging over the extension eastwards of NATO. The proposals would give the CSCE the right to address the UN Security Council, and in some circumstances to intervene in conflicts without the agreement of the warring parties, in other words to impose a settlement. According to a German foreign ministry statement, a decision by the CSCE to intervene in conflicts would be taken "by consensus." This could suggest something short of absolute unanimity among the CSCE's 52 members, which include the U.S., Canada, all European states and former-Soviet republics. Moscow badly wants international approval for a de facto Russian sphere of influence in the Commonwealth of Independent States. The German-Dutch ideas say the CSCE should become involved in "peace-keeping" in the CIS, and in practice this is likely to refer mainly to Russian forces. This week's Anglo-Polish exercise, in the Polish town of Kielce, has been arranged by London and Warsaw bilaterally, but is being billed by Britain as a project "in the spirit of" NATO's Partnership for Peace plan. Poland has been the quickest of the former Warsaw Pact nations to build military ties with Western Europe, both bilaterally and in the context of Partnership for Peace.
