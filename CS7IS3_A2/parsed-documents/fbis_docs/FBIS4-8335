FBIS4-8335 "dreeu071__a94024" FBIS-EEU-94-071-A Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 ANNEX Romania Government Declaration on Anniversary of Holocaust Government Declaration on Anniversary of Holocaust AU1104171394 Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1540 GMT 11 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1104171394 Bucharest ROMPRES English BFN [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- On 10 April 1994, on the occasion of the convening in Bucharest of the annual assembly of the Jewish communities in Bucharest, Doru Dumitru Palade, minister of research and technology, presented the "Declaration of the Government of Romania Regarding the Commemoration of the World Day of the Holocaust," which states, among other things, the following: "We are evoking, with this opportunity, the painful memory of the hundreds of thousands of Jews, many of whom were of Romanian language and culture, and who, living in the territories temporarily snatched away from Romania through the Vienna Diktate, were arrested massively and later on deported to extermination camps with the approval and the active connivance of the occupation Horthyst authorities. Even more painful for the Romanian people is the remembrance of the innocent victims of the legionnaire terror, the remembrance of the pogrom in Iasi, a tragical moment, unprecedented in the history of our people, as well as the remembrance of the mass deportations made by the military and the Nazi field gendermerie from Bessarabia and Dniester, atrocities which Romania did not have at that time the means and capacity to oppose. Although Romania," the statement further shows, "never surrendered citizens of Jewish nationality to the Nazi extermination machine, nor did it organise or tolerate others to effect mass deportations from and exterminations in its national territory, the memory of the attitude of a tolerance fringing on complicity of the then Romanian authorities towards the anti-semitic atrocities, the remembrance of the vexing racial laws which Romania, following a foreign example, but alien to the Romanian traditions and feelings, had to pass in those times, are still burdening, more than half a century after, the conscience of the Romanian people. Unfortunately, like in many European countries, we cannot nowadays speak of anti-Semitism, racism, intolerance and xenophobia only in the past tense; resurgent traces of this bloody insanity are still emerging now and then. We must admit with regret that even in this country there are attempts of rehabilitating the legionnaire movement, against a background of an incomplete description of the World War Two period. The Government of Romania is firmly disapproving of such manifestations, that have nothing in common with the spirit and traditions of the Romanian people. The Government of Romania is hereby expressing, on this occasion, the hope that in the Europe nearing the end of the second millennium the efforts directed to the observance of the fundamental human rights, to the final elimination of any forms of racism, anti-semitism, and xenophobia, will prevail.
