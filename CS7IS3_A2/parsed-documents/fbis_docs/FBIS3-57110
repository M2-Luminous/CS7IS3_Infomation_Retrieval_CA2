He informed correspondents of a forecast, according to which the inflation may run out of control by fall 1994 to reach 50 per cent and the production recession may be equal to 52 per cent of the 1989 level. 1989 was the last year of production increase. Speaking of priority measures against the inflation, namely a possibility to control the inflation at a level of 20 per cent in 1994, Grigory Yavlinskiy stressed the need to bring the dollar exchange rate in correspondence with the inflation dynamics. He said the government should be responsible for the exchange rate dynamics, which means the soonest conclusion of futures deals on sales of hard currency at a certain exchange rate. The economist warned the government against the policy of easy- term credits and direct subsidies. He said they should immediately lower the interest rate under administrative regulation of the credit amount. Another priority is crucial changes of a policy on benefits for exporters. He said Russia cannot allow hard currency to flow abroad. He said 15 billion dollars flew abroad in 1993 alone. He offered the government to cancel the tax on exchange rate difference and said everyone having hard currency accounts should not pay for the inflation, for which they carry no direct responsibility. Yavlinskiy said the cancellation of this tax may help to prevent money outflow. The economist suggested to free statistics bodies from government control. Yavlinskiy told ITAR-TASS his faction is ready to form a government capable of fulfilling this program within eight to nine months.
