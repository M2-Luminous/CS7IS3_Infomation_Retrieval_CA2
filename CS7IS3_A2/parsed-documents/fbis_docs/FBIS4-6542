The statement represents the consensus reached among its members, and is meant to be an appeal to the government's Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters. Keidanren also asked for deregulation to facilitate the effective use of information and communications. In the distribution sector, the report asked for the gradual abolition of the Large Retail Store Law, easing of regulations on retail licenses for liquor, and revamping the distribution system of rice and grain. In the transport sector, it demanded liberalization of fares under a set upper limit for passenger transport by railway, bus and aircraft. There is an upsurge of opinion seeking deregulation in the business sector. This is probably because the businesses have come to truly realize that although the economic recession has hit bottom, there is still a glaring gap between demand and supply; and to get on the track of recovery while undertaking structural reform, it is necessary to grab the opportunity to expand the market through deregulation. With the enactment of the Administrative Procedures Law scheduled for October, some businesses have come out and asked for the "documentation of administrative guidance." This is meant to enable businesses to monitor the ambiguous administrative procedures and instructions of government offices which do not have any legal basis. This can also be taken as a manifestation of the business sector's initiative to open up new markets. Among the consumers, there is also a strong desire for deregulation and clarification of rules. They have come to be more concerned with eliminating the price gap between Japan and foreign countries, and with possible ways to obtain high-quality goods and services at a lower price. We would like the government to seriously consider such pressure from the business sector and consumers to relax government regulations as a "sign of the times." In its "Outline of External Economic Policy Reform," formulated recently as part of the efforts to bring about a breakthrough in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the government pledged to work intensively on a radical review of regulations. It cited the following sectors as major areas to be considered: housing and land; information and communications; import promotion, improvement of market access, and distribution; and banking, securities and insurance. Working groups for the first three sectors have been formed to enable free discussions between experts and the concerned ministries and agencies. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who is also chairman of the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters, serves concurrently as chairman of the three working groups. According to informed sources, with the resignation of Hosokawa, the working groups now have a weakened sense of purpose. If this is true, they will not be able to fulfill the government's pledge to the people. This will be a betrayal of the people's high hopes. It is important to review government regulations intensively. The deregulation being considered in the three areas has the potential of expanding domestic demand, promoting imports, developing new businesses, and improving the people's quality of life. Therefore, we hope the working groups will continue to actively discuss effective measures in their own areas in preparation for the formulation of another deregulation package in June. Of course, followup on the measures already included in the emergency economic package is also indispensable. Another point which we would like to stress here is that the basic thinking on deregulation upheld in the Outline of External Economic Policy Reform -- that "the economy should be free in principle, and regulated only in exceptional cases; and social regulations should be limited to the minimum, in line with the original policy goals"--should be sustained resolutely. Failure to come up with a midterm program for deregulation under such a philosophy will render what Hosokawa termed "Deregulation Year One [Kisei Kanwa Gannen]" only a castle in the air.
