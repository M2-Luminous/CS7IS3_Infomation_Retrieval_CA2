Sucharit said he had contacted Khammouane Province Governor Inpong Sai-gnavong for clarification on this issue. The Thai-owned United Tour Company cited many inconveniences, including the collection of border passage fees by the Lao authorities and the intended monopolization of the tourism industry in the Lao province. The governor of Nakhon Phanom Province said that the provincial authority, together with the provincial Tourism Office, are trying to solve the problem in such a way that relations between the two countries will not be affected. Laos is in the process of changing many policies, and new regulations might be adopted. Phairot Prokkaeo, director of Nakhon Phanom Province's Tourism Office, said that this is the first complaint about unfair treatment of Thai tour agencies by the Lao authorities. His office is waiting for more information from the Lao side. The solution to the problem might require joint efforts by the governors of the two neighboring provinces. Considering the nature of the problem, there could be some misunderstanding between the United Tour Company and the Lao authorities. A tourist industry source in Nakhon Phanom Province revealed that two tour agencies -- namely Siphanom Tour and United Tour Companies -- are operating in the province, while the governor of Khammouane Province plans to set up a provincial tour agency to be officially called the Khammouane Tourism Company. The two Thai companies will be required to maintain regular contact with the Lao company in sending tourists to Khammouane Province.
