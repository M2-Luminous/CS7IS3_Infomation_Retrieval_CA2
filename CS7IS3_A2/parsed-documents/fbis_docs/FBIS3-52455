In a statement to AL-WASAT, he said: "No one party should ask the other to be more understanding because we are in the same boat and are facing the same circumstances and difficulties." Al-'Anani added: "We believe there must be coordination with our Palestinian brothers prior to any agreement with the Israelis, but the brothers in the PLO seem to have another concept. Each side has its own identity and aspirations that do not conflict with one another. We should not allow pressures to have a negative effect on our relations. Coordination is necessary at this stage and is required for sound negotiations. Commonality of interests and the requirements of successful negotiations make us demand coordination which, we believe, has no alternative." He added: "All this does not mean estrangement. Jordan believes that postponement of coordination will not serve any side." Al-'Anani revealed that Jordan and the PLO have reached many agreements on trade, investment, citizens' travel, free zones, transit, movement in the Arab region, security, borders, and water. These agreements have not been signed. Asked about opening branches for Jordanian banks in the occupied West Bank, the Jordanian information minister said that this step would not have been discussed with the Israeli side if it had not already been discussed with the Palestinian side. It was one of the agreements we reached with the PLO. He denounced reports that Jordan decided to exploit the current opportunity to reopen the banks. Replying to another question, the information minister said that the issue of establishing a Palestinian monetary authority still seems to be a possibility. Our negotiations with the Palestinians do not conflict with that possibility, and, if realized, we will hold further negotiations. It is noteworthy that Dr. Jawad al-'Anani was one of the prominent members of the Jordanian negotiating delegation. He is also a well-known economist and held the position of trade and industry minister in 1984 and 1985. It is also worth mentioning that Jordanian officials feel that the PLO wants to put off the signing of the economic agreement with Jordan until the PLO's leadership returns to Jericho.
