FBIS4-51780 "dreas085_d_94023" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 South Korea EU Stops GSP Treatment for ROK Fabric Products EU Stops GSP Treatment for ROK Fabric Products SK2804125994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0818 GMT 28 Apr 94 SK2804125994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- The European Union [EU] virtually finalized a decision to halt generalized system of preference (GSP) treatment for South Korean fabric goods from July 1 until Seoul withdraws its adjustment tariff on foreign products, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday. Industry officials predicted that South Korea stands to lose about 2.6 million dollars worth of exports to Europe due to the EU measure. The decision, apparently in retaliation for Seoul's introduction of an adjustment tariff, needs further approval by the EU council before going into effect but this is almost certain, the ministry said. The EU commission said April 20 that GSP status had been suspended for all South Korean products covered under the multi-fiber arrangement (MFA). In January, Seoul introduced a 19-percent adjustment tariff on fabric imports for 1994 to minimize the impact on local firms caused by an unexpected inflow of foreign products.
