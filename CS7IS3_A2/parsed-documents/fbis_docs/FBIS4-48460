FBIS4-48460 "drafr098_a_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Official Interviewed on Control of Airport RPF Official Interviewed on Control of Airport LD1905150794 Paris Radio France International in French 1230 GMT 19 May 94 LD1905150794 Paris Radio France International French BFN [Excerpts] A shell hit Kigali's hospital this morning, killing 30 people, according to the United Nations. [passage omitted] Yesterday, the United Nations attempted to negotiate with the government forces and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] to gain control of the airport. The United Nations asked for all weapons to be withdrawn within a two-kilometer radius of the airport. Jacques Bihozagara, one of the RPF officials, gives his opinion on this issue. He is interviewed by Adala Benraad: [Begin recording] [Bihozagara] What we are asking is that UNAMIR [United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda] should remove the Rwandan Government forces, which are firing at us, from the airport, so that the airport can be put under its control. [Benraad] Is the airport still a military target for you? [Bihozagara] It is not a military target but we say there are two forces in the airport, UNAMIR and the Rwandan armed forces. The Rwandan armed forces are firing at our positions from the airport. So you do understand that the airport is not completely neutral. [Benraad] So, consequently, after the removal of the government forces you would agree to UN convoys being escorted? [Bihozagara] We are not against the principle of escorting aid convoys, but we say that the airport is now in a dangerous zone and therefore the military should move out so that the United Nations can operate freely in complete neutrality. [Benraad] What does the RPF think of the French proposal for a regional summit with the participation of Zaire, Uganda, and Tanzania to reach a cease-fire? [Bihozagara] This is a proposal from France, which has not approached us to ask for our opinion as a party to the conflict, but we are ready to examine this proposal. We have no problem with the principle of a meeting. [end recording]
