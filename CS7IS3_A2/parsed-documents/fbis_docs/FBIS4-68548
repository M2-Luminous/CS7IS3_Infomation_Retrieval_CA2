FBIS4-68548 "jpusr051___94050" FBIS-USR-94-051 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 29 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS Draft Law on Media's Government Coverage `Astonishing' Draft Law on Media's Government Coverage `Astonishing' 944F0666B Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA in Russian No 17, 29 Apr 94 p 9 944F0666B Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Article by Anna Politkovskaya: "A Dead Season For Domestic Journalism?"] [Text] Any day now, the State Duma is expected to adopt the federal law, "On the Order of Illuminating the Activity of Organs of State Power in the State Mass Media," which seriously limits the capacities of Russia's journalists to carry out their professional responsibilities. The newspapers have already written about this--we are not the first here. Nevertheless, the topic seems to us to be so important and capable of significantly altering the political physiognomy of Russia, that we have decided to return to it once again. The draft law was developed under the direct leadership of Mikhail Poltoranin, who is currently the chairman of the Duma Committee on Information Policy and Communications, Deputy Kirill Ignatyev, and two unknown jurists from some Academy of the Deputy Corps. The first reading of the draft law passed almost unanimously in the Duma, an occurrence which happens there quite rarely. This time they were able to accomplish that which even the president cannot seem to do--the document pleased the overwhelming Duma majority. Let us ponder over what this new law may actually bring to each of our lives. The draft law contains 20 articles. The first names the specific object of regulations--these are the relations arising in connection with the dissemination by the state mass media of materials or announcements on the activity of the agencies of state power of the Russian Federation and its subjects. The second gives assurance that the proposed paper is no more and no less than the ONLY (as if the Law on the Mass Media did not even exist?--author's note) "standard legal legislative statute on the procedure of such illumination." The third article explains that henceforth we should understand specifically as agencies of state power, i.e., those whom we should relate to this caste, which with the receipt of either state position or deputy certification, automatically acquire, in accordance with the articles of the given draft law, a practically unlimited right to speak on the air and to publish in printed publications whatever it, this caste, sees fit. It is proposed that the following should be considered as agencies of state power: The president, the Federal Assembly, the government, the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, the Higher Arbitration Court, representative and executive agencies of the republics, krays, oblasts, cities, autonomous oblasts, and autonomous okrugs. In short, very many people. And all of them receive their piece of the television and radio air time. Even if every other one decides to exercise this right, then we, the viewers, listeners and readers, will have a hard time of it. There will simply not be any time for anything else. Article 7 obligates state television and radio to include in its daily information programs, on the day of the appropriate event, reports on: 1) "decisions and actions entering into the competency of the president or the Constitutional Court, or within the jurisdiction of the houses of the Federal Assembly;" 2) "announcements of the president, the houses of the Federal Assembly, and the government;" 3) "speeches by the chairman of the RF government, deputy government chairmen, and federal ministers at meetings of the houses of the RF Federal Assembly;" 4) "press conferences of the RF President, the chairman of the RF Government, the deputy government chairmen, chairman of the Council of Federations, chairman of the State Duma, as well as press conferences held at the decision of committees, commissions, factions or deputy groups of the houses of the RF Council of Federations"; 5) "other socially significant facts regarding the activity of federal agencies of power." According to Article 9, the specific conditions for airing such announcements are also regulated: "In informational programs of state audio-visual mass media, reports on... (read preceding paragraph--author's note) must be broadcast exclusively as an individual block at the start of the program. ...These reports are not commented upon. The reports must be accompanied by a video series of the given meeting... The priority right to an interview in an informational or informational-educational program on the question of the agenda belongs to the speaker on the given question, the subject of the right of legislative initiative, and the representative of the profiled committee..." Furthermore, the LAW (!) establishes a precise hierarchy, who must follow whom in giving the journalist an interview. The journalist thus becomes that very same microphone holder of communist times--a role which he had so desperately tried to escape all these long years of perestroyka. The draft law intervenes even into the very structure of the television and radio programming: "The duration of a block of announcements in informational television and radio programs on the work of the Federal Assembly houses on the days of their meeting must comprise no less than: 30 seconds--for programs lasting up to 3 minutes; 1 minute--for programs lasting from 3 to 10 minutes; 2 minutes--for programs lasting from 10 to 20 minutes; 3 minutes--for programs lasting from 20 to 35 minutes, and 4 minutes--for programs lasting over 35 minutes." For violation of the numerous principles of the proposed draft, administrative as well as criminal responsibility is introduced, both for journalists who have not fulfilled the requirements of the law, and for editors who have allowed airing, for example, of an interview outside the hierarchy established by the law. Moreover, soon the Duma will already begin reviewing corrections to the Criminal Code, introduced by that very same Committee on Informational Policy, in accordance with which a journalist who has violated the effective legislation in the sphere of the mass media may be deprived of the right to work in his specialty. We must point out that the draft of these corrections concerns all journalists without exception--television, radio, and newspeople representing state, independent, private--in short any--publications, companies or studios. If the editor-in-chief of a publication, company or studio nevertheless decides to continue publishing or airing under a pseudonym the materials of a journalist who has fallen into disgrace, then he, the chief, will also be threatened with removal from his position, and will lose the right to occupy it ever again in the future! In our opinion, everyone today simply must ask himself the question of whether he is capable of working under the proposed conditions. If not, then we must, for the n-th time, show strict corporative solidarity in the face of the real danger of infringing upon our professional rights! And now about the main thing: We may banter as much as we like about the unfortunate, clumsy articles which infringe upon the right of journalists. But what bothers is something else--the sad circumstance that the draft law has received almost unanimous support. And for this there are at least two explanations. First of all, the developers have placed a correct stake on the vulnerable domestic world of those who, having finally clawed their way to the top, want to be and to remain the nomenklatura, having no intentions whatsoever of departing from the political power scene together with the next elections. As we know, the only terrible and real enemy on this thorny path is the journalist. He is today regularly despised not only by the entire Duma, but by the entire Federal Assembly, the government, the presidential administration, and so on, and so on, and so on. The journalist is blamed for the disintegration of the Union, for the collapse of the economy, for the decline of a stable state, for fanning hatred toward Khasbulatov's Supreme Soviet, for the regional wars, and finally for Zhirinovskiy. There is only one way to please this entire motley crowd, and all at once: By bridling the mass media. This is extremely necessary to all political parties and currents, without exception. The second explanation appears although not as superficial as the first, but nevertheless it too has received the right to existence in the current political arrangement. The fact is that in the current everyday dealings of the Duma, that "working moment" which in common language is called "selling out" has become rather widespread. According to the information of a source who, for understandable reasons, asked not to be named in the newspaper--a source who nevertheless engages in direct lawmaking activity--this draft law has become the victim of a deal within the Duma. The Zhirinovskiy followers have agreed not to vote down a law which is important to the democratic and sober minded deputies in exchange for the consent of the latter to share their votes during the voting on the mass media. In short, we--journalists and all our publications, studios and companies--have become a change coin on the political scale. They thought that we would survive anyway. But will we survive? There is still time until the second reading, and that means the final acceptance of the draft law into law. And we are pinning great hopes on this, because it, as we know, is the cure. Perhaps during Easter week those Duma members who owe their emergence on the political scene entirely to the mass media, glasnost and freedom of speech will once again check their own moral scales to see what is dearer for them: A free press or a deal with the Zhirinovskiy followers. We sincerely hope that their common sense wins out.
