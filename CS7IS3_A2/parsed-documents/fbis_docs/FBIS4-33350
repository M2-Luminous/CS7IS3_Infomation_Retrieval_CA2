The Supreme Court justices thus rejected a request filed by the attorneys of [General Manuel Contreras and Brigadier Pedro Espinoza], the former chiefs of Dina [National Intelligence Directorate], who claimed it was unconstitutional not to apply the 1978 Amnesty Law to Orlando Letelier's murder in 1976. The ruling stipulates that the attack perpetrated in Washington will not be granted this benefit. Moreover, the Supreme Court enumerates several other elements in which it reiterates that in not applying the Amnesty Law to this lawsuit it is by no means acting arbitrarily. [Begin prosecuting lawyer Juan Bustos recording] The fundamental thing within a rule of law is precisely to go after and condemn those who commit crimes. The contrary would be something exceptional, something which in general should not occur within a rule of law. [end recording] The defense attorneys for Contreras and Espinoza still have another appeal pending. In addition, they appealed the judgment by Judge Rodolfo Banados, who sentenced the former Dina chiefs to seven and six years' imprisonment respectively.
