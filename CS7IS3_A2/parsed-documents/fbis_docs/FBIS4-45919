The proposal by the Advisory Committee for Energy will lead to a policy shift by the Atomic Energy Commission, the nation's top energy policy board, which is now working on reviewing Japan's long-standing policy of hoarding plutonium. In an interim report to be presented in early June to the minister of international trade and industry, the committee's subpanel on nuclear energy will propose delaying construction of a second plant to reprocess spent nuclear fuel to reproduce plutonium, the officials said. "The commission's review is likely to reflect a policy change by the advisory panel," said a senior official at the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy. The official said the policy change also reflects a glut in global uranium supply and the resulting fall in demand for plutonium as a result of the end of the Cold War. Uranium is a key nuclear fuel. "With uranium prices and demand for plutonium down, it will be hard to make ends meet given the cost of building related facilities," he said. Construction of the plant is a key part of Japan's program to develop widespread use of nuclear technology for fast-breeder reactors that produce more plutonium than they consume. Japan is the world's only country to continue work on development of fast-breeder reactors and has been accused of undermining nuclear nonproliferation as plutonium is a key component in nuclear weapons. Although Japan has flatly denied any intention of developing nuclear weapons, its pro-plutonium policy has spawned speculation that it may build its own nuclear arsenal in the future. The committee's subpanel report will also propose reserving spent nuclear fuel as it is, describing it as "resources which are temporarily reserved" for future use. Plutonium can be extracted from spent fuel. The proposal suggests that nuclear policymakers still weigh the value of domestically processed plutonium and hold out prospects for future use of plutonium. Japan relies heavily on nuclear power for its energy needs, with some 30 percent of the nation's electricity being generated by 42 nuclear plants.
