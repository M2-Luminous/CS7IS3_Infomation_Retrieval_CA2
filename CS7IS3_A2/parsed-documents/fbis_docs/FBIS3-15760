However, none of the officials participating in the negotiations makes a special secret of the purpose and tendency of the talks. The delegations, headed by Kazakhstan's state counsellor Tulegen Zhukeyev and Russian space agency general director Yuriy Koptev, are forging rapprochement between the two countries on the status of the ex-Soviet space port and the rent Russia is asked to pay for its lease. Progress is hampered by Kazakhstan's demand that Russia, the legal successor to the former Soviet Union pay ecological damages caused to the regions bordering on Baykonur throughout the years of its operation. If the negotiations end successfully, the status of Baykonur will be put on the agenda of the upcoming meeting between President Boris Yeltsin and President Nursultan Nazarbayev at the end of March. The two countries will then sign documents on the status and use of Baykonur on a new basis.
