Gligorov said that two treaties on Skopje-Sofia cooperation that were to have been signed -- on the elimination of double taxation and the protection of mutual investments -- have not been signed because of the refusal by Bulgarian officials to sign these documents also in the Macedonian language. According to Gligorov, the Macedonian delegation deemed that the Macedonian language could not be a contentious issue and that the right of every nation is to call the language it speaks as it pleases. However, President Gligorov expressed the hope that talks of this kind would gradually yield results. Gligorov also expressed the conviction that Bulgarian President Zhelev "has an understanding of this issue," but that "they should clarify this matter in Bulgaria on their own." The Macedonian president also said that journalists at a news conference in Sofia were most interested in the possiblity of Macedonia joining a former Yugoslav republic or some neighboring state. According to him, this is an issue that has been decided once and for all, because Macedonia has become a free, sovereign, and independent country and no other option can be taken into consideration.
