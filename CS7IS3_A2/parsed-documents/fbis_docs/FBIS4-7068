However, due to North Korea's refusal, it has been dragged on over a year even without having consultations. According to a diplomatic source on 24 April, then Russian Vice Foreign Minister Georgiy Kudnadze, current ambassador to the ROK, visited Pyongyang in February, 1993. In the talks with North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, Kudnadze brought forth the issue regarding the revision and agreed with the North side to fully revise the treaty in conformity with the current situation. Nonetheless, North Korea has so far showed no reaction. In particular, upon Russia's proposal, Russia and North Korea reached an agreement to abrogate or re-interpret the so-called provision on automatic military intervention which stipulates that a country should automatically render military assistance to the other country that is invaded since the provision is a relic of the Cold- War era. However, North Korea has declined to take up the issue. As regards to this, a government official predicted: "Chances are very slim that the discussions will soon be made on the issue."
