However, they were not arrested for "tactical" reasons in connection with the investigations. This was confirmed yesterday by Herbert Helmrich, justice minister of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, in an interview with DIE WELT. [see item AU0104091894 in previous Terrorism Report] [passage omitted] Justice Minister Helmrich told DIE WELT that an observation group of the Wiesbaden-based Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] was in Bad Kleinen in early June, about 2 weeks before the police operation. The BKA had information according to which several top terrorists of the RAF's command level were planning to vacation in Mecklenburg. With remote-controlled cameras -- one was installed in a trash can, another one in a Volkswagen van -- a suspicious couple was filmed. The cameras provided surprisingly clear pictures. The suspected terrorists were not rounded up because the BKA wanted to get more information. On 27 June 1993, some 90 minutes before the shoot-out at the station, apart from Grams and Hogefeld, another couple was being observed as behaving conspicuously. According to information from Schwerin, this couple has been identified. They were not rounded up either for tactical reasons. The two young people managed to disappear. [passage omitted]
