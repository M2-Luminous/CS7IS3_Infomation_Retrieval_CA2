The team is working at a site near Baghdad and hopes to complete its mission by the end of January, the sources said without specifying the quantity involved. Last month the same group supervised the removal and shipment by air of 33 kilograms (73 pounds) of irradiated fuel from Iraq to Russia. In October, IAEA chief Maurizio Zifferero said that some 35 kilograms (77 pounds) of enriched uranium would be transferred to Russia. The IAEA, a Vienna-based United Nations agency, and Iraq signed an accord in April for the removal of 35 kilograms of uranium. The agreement was reached during a mission of IAEA inspectors led by Zifferero, who said at the time that the operation would cost Iraq several million dollars. Last November the IAEA shipped 12 kilograms (27 pounds) of non-enriched uranium from Iraq to Russia. The transfers are in line with UN Security Council resolutions to disarm Iraq after the Gulf war in 1991.
