Its participation in cross-border raids and attacks such as those on a suspected APLA [Azanian Peoples Liberation Army] base in Transkei last year, are still fresh in the minds of many. But the new Minister of Defence, Mr Joe Modise, is determined to change the role of the defence force. Among his plans is the establishment of a service brigade. "A lot of thinking has gone into the creation of a service brigade," said Modise in an interview in Pretoria." This brigade will be funded by the Government and the community." Initially, the new SA National Defence Force (SANDF) will provide vocational training for those who cannot become part of the standing force of between 67,000 and 70,000 soldiers. Those who lose their places in the SANDF as a result of rationalisation will be given vocational training to prepare them for civilian life. "At the same time, they will also play a major role in the Reconstruction and Development Programme," said Modise. "After dealing with ex-servicemen, the service brigade might also bring in young people who are in the streets and train them to play a part in the economy." He said similar brigades were successfully established in Taiwan and in the United States. In South Africa, they will be managed by the SANDF but not be part of it. "It will be more or less an auxiliary body with a lot of emphasis on preparing people to participate in our economy," said Modise. They will be trained as builders, bricklayers, carpenters, electricians, and later, also as motor mechanics, panelbeaters and spray painters. Some will also get technical training (for example, in electronics) and at a later stage training in agriculture. "We would like this service brigade to carry on indefinitely, like it has in Taiwan," said Modise. "There it has become a very important instrument in developing the economy." "That's the route we want to follow. A service brigade in South Africa could become an instrument of the people that would help to develop our country." The establishment of a service brigade was first hinted at in a review of 1993 published by the then South African Defence Force (SADF) earlier this year. "There are a large number of individuals who have received military training of some sort and who will not be accommodated in the new defence force," it said in its report. "To leave these individuals jobless in the streets is to invite trouble." This is where the SADF saw a role for a service brigade. "This brigade could be used in non-military tasks, like building projects," it said. "After a period of service in the brigade, they can leave and make a living in the private sector." The old SADF saw the new defence force playing an increasing role in socio-economic development. "The SADF has considerable ability in this area," it said. "Although the SADF should be designed primarily for conventional operations, pragmatic considerations dictate that it may sometimes be used for non-military tasks. "The driving principle should be that the return on investment in the SADF (now SANDF) should be maximised by putting its community utility value to good use without impairing its primary role," the report said. The SADF pointed to the role of the military in the United States during the Great Depression of the 1930s as an example of what it envisaged. "The vast pool of management skills and knowledge that is inherently part of any defence force was used, rather than military equipment per se, for upliftment projects," the SADF said. "Some military personnel with the necessary expertise were seconded to other state departments for use in the socio-economic environment. "This ensured that military equipment, which is needed for war and developed at great cost, could be reserved for its original purpose. "Knowledge and expertise that had public application, for which the taxpayer had in any case paid, thus became available for use to the advantage of the country as a whole." In South Africa, the report said, qualified personnel from the SADF could be sued to help teach science and mathematics in schools where there was a shortage of qualified teachers. Medical orderlies could also be used to teach and promote basic hygiene and primary health care. Like Modise, the SADF also saw a role for the new defence force in preparing youth who were not adequately trained to pursue a career or profession. "A possible partial solution to this problem is to develop an organisation that can equip these people with the necessary skills to enable them to make a decent living," the report said. "It is foreseen that the SADF can be used to train people for a better future. The organisation has the training facilities, the training expertise and the will to help." These ideas are in line with the aims of the new Ministry of Defence. "We are in the process of reorganising our army," said Modise. "We have always had problems with the defence force playing a military role inside the country." In the short term the SANDF will continue to help maintain stability inside the country. But further down the road, it is clear that there will be a major shift in the role of the new defence force. "We are now building a national defence force," he said. "The force is now being legitimised. This is the people's own force. They must do everything in their power to support it because it is their own instrument of protection," Modise said.
