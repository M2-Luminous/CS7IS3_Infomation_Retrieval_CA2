Mr. Han, who left for the United States on Thursday, said he finished the first edition of the China Labour Bulletin last weekend. A "contact" was to take the first 1,000 copies to the Chinese capital. From Beijing, the magazine would be distributed to a network of workers throughout the mainland. Another 1,000 copies in English would be sent to the 155 members of the International Federation of Free Trade Unions. "We hope workers who see the magazine will learn what is happening in the China labour movement," Mr. Han said. "We also want the workers to think of themselves and the harsh conditions they are working under." The China Labour Bulletin is funded by the Hong Kong Christian Council and its Christian Industrial Committee. Legislator Lau Chin-shek, director of the committee, hired Mr. Han to edit the bulletin last month. Initially, Mr. Han expects to produce one edition each month. Eventually he hopes the magazine will go bi-monthly. Mr. Han said future editions would tell workers "how to agitate for their rights". He said several dissidents in China had also agreed to submit articles.
