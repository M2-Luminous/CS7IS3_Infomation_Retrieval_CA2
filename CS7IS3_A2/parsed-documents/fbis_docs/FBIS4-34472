Civilian Household Minister Henrique Hargreaves has also decided to maintain a prudent distance. Hargreaves, Castro, and Itamar Franco are disheartened by the campaign committee. On 9 June the president complained to Cardoso over the phone. This happened just as Vox Populi polls are showing that government support is helping the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] candidacy. The palace group is upset over the treatment it has received from some members of the Brasilia electoral committee and feels its efforts to curb the wave of dissatisfaction have not been duly recognized. Hargreaves said: "I am a minister of the Itamar Franco government, and I am not campaigning for anyone, although I may consider Cardoso the best candidate and will help him individually, but not as member of the government." Over the past few weeks Hargreaves has traveled around Brazil. He has confessed that those trips have worn him out. He went to Bahia, Sao Paulo, and Para in an effort to politically adjust some tremors which were beginning to undermine the foundations of the alliance, namely the PFL [Liberal Front Party]. Hargreaves has also been trying to stop the exodus of a group of PFL senators who, as holders of a large number of votes, consider inadmissible the way they are being treated by the top PSDB leadership. These senators feel neglected, overlooked, and rejected; not just from the campaign but from the central decisions as well. Many are considering giving up Cardoso's campaign, especially because they feel better treated by the entourage surrounding Leonel Brizola or Orestes Quercia than by the PSDB group. Over the past few days Hargreaves has been seeking appeasement. So far no one knows if he was successful or not. Last Friday Jose de Castro was getting ready for a similar task. Over the weekend, however, a private conversation was held at Planalto Palace among these and other personalities who reassessed the implicit inclusion into the campaign of some top-level people. They decided it would not be prudent, especially because they interpreted some signs they did not like. They felt within the already organized command there is the impression the new group could cause the loss of authority, changes in direction, and changes in the established goals. Although Pimenta da Veiga, Cardoso's political coordinator, has repeated lately that he does not dispute the "monopoly of victory" and will respect any suggestion, the palace group and former Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes [ACM] do not fully believe it. Thus, they decided to remain, but at a distance. ACM clearly told Hargreaves: "I have many votes to contribute. What I do not have is the youth to fight for a post, command, or power in the electoral campaign." Hargreaves and Jose de Castro share the same idea. They will continue to work for Cardoso, mainly because he is the candidate preferred by them and by Franco, but they do not want any further intimacy with the campaign central committee. They feel the committee lacks the humility to recognize who controls the largest share of votes (the PFL), while there is too much self-sufficiency. Officially, however, the Planalto Palace will not give any explicit explanation for the withdrawal of its troops. It will not give, if there is no demand, any explanation. Nevertheless, the ministers are still working on the campaign and the government is working hard for its candidate. If anyone is really interested in learning the reason for the absence of the palace group from the daily activity of those who seek to elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso, quick answers are available. Jose de Castro will say problems within Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc.] keep him busy at the Telerj presidency, while Hargreaves will argue that he never worked for any committee. He will remain where he has always been, discreetly, at the Civilian Household. Cardoso is aware of the uneasiness. He did as he did with Franco last week; he phoned as soon as he learned that the president was upset because the candidate was not looking for him, was not asking for political counsels, and was no longer visiting the Planalto Palace. It is quite possible that this week he will contact the palace-committee circle to calm down the most excited spirits. If he does not do so, serious rifts may be expected very soon.
