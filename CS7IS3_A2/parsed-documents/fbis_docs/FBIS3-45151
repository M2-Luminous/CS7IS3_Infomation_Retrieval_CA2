The PLA opened its first army unit to foreign visitors in 1955. Since China introduced reform and the open policy, the PLA has continued to open a number of ground force, navy, and air force bases and barracks to foreign visitors. Many foreign heads of state, government leaders, and military delegations have visited PLA bases and barracks. The Academy of Military Sciences and the PLA National Defense University have become important channels for academic exchanges between PLA military academies and their foreign counterparts. Since its founding in early 1985, the PLA National Defense University has followed the principle of "looking toward the world, the future, and modernization" advocated by Deng Xiaoping. It has treated the principle as a principle for developing itself and displayed enthusiasm in opening up. Up to now the university has conducted academic exchanges with army units and military academies of over 50 foreign countries.
