The ATPC believes that the treaty runs counter to the Tatar Constitution, while the 13 March elections showed numerous violations of democratic principles and human rights. Under such circumstances, the ATPC will become a constructive opposition to join the political struggle for power. Until recently, the movement concentrated on developing a mechanism for consolidating the nation and stood aloof from the republic's internal problems. According to Safin, Tatarstan took the moral lead in Russian reform as it struggled for the status of a member of a real federation. However, the treaty reiterated that Russia was a unitary state, and many republics had to follow suit, thus harming Russia as a whole. Positively assessing the fact that such a treaty was signed, the movement pointed out that in fact the document secured the old relations between the center and a raw-material-producing appendage and did not envision equal rights. The ATPC demanded that the Tatar Supreme Soviet assign international status to the treaty and hold parliamentary hearings on the issue. The movement insisted on the denunciation of intergovernmental economic agreements which enslave Tatarstan, according to the ATPC. The movement said it had no confidence in Tatar President Mintimer Shaymiyev, Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev, Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov and the whole of government. The ATPC supported early parliamentary elections and changes in the personnel policy which was rife with nepotism.
