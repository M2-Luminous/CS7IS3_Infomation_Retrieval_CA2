Korea's per capita national income growth was the world's greatest in 1985-1992, with an average rise of 8.5 percent, according to indicators of a creditable institution. Elementary school enrollment rate was 100 percent for Korea, sharing the top place with France, Britain, Japan, China, and 10 other countries. "The World Bank Atlas 1994", a book of comparative indicators of population, economy, and environment of 207 countries with the help of the associated United Nations agencies like the International Labor Organization and United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, was obtained and released Friday by the Finance Ministry. But Korea showed energy inefficiency with its gross domestic product (GDP) per one kilogram estimated at 3.4 U.S. dollars and scored low in most other indicators in comparison with advanced countries.

Illiteracy, in result, was just 4 percent. China topped with the biggest population of 1.17 billion, followed by India with 880 million, and the United States with 260 million. Korea ranked 25th with 44.66 million. Population growth in 1985-1992 was 1 percent, the world's 57th, and average life expectancy was 71 years old, 61th on the rankings. Per capita woman employment rate was 34 percent (68th) and child birth per a woman was 1.8, the world's 16th lowest. Under-one infant death rate was 13 per every 10,000 live births, the world's 42th, doubling the number of five in Japan. Inflation in 1985-1992 averaged 6.8 percent, the world's 68th, and farming share in the GDP was 8 percent (38th), exports portion, 29 percent (66th), and investment accounting for 39 percent (eighth).
