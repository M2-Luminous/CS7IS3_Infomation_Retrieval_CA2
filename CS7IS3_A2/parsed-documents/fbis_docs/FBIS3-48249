Later, however, the myth of Japan's economic growth collapsed, and politics came to a dead end. Will you give your assessment now that nearly 50 years have elapsed? [Miyazawa] Any explanation by me of the last 10 years must include, I think, mention of the end of the Cold War and the demise of Marxism-Leninism. In the realm of foreign affairs, we had hoped that a new peace would emerge following the collapse of the system under which world balance was sustained by the mutual nuclear deterrence of the United States and the Soviet Union. In the short term, however, conflicts have broken out. The United Nations should be in charge of maintaining peace, but it has become apparent it can not do this. And nothing has yet replaced the mutual deterrence. Meanwhile, there is emerging the perception that as Japan has grown into an economic power, it no longer needs to hide behind the United States. I should say these are the major changes that have occurred in the realm of foreign affairs. Their impact on domestic politics is said to have brought the collapse of the regime that ruled from 1955, though I do not agree with that view. I do not see any reason why the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] should have lost power just because the 1955 system disintegrated. I think the collapse of the LDP government was caused by the scandals. [Shimizu] The rise of nationalism is conspicuous. Will you comment on that? [Miyazawa] It may mean that as the Cold War has ended, the habit of thinking within the global framework of the United States and the Soviet Union has disappeared. As a result, people are becoming nationalism-conscious. I do not think it is unhealthy. But what we must not repeat our mistakes. Nationalism is becoming evident in discussions on the question of amending the constitution, for instance. As a result of the soul-searching done in the almost 50 years since the end of the war, people may have started to feel it is not desirable for an independent country to depend for ever on the Japan-U.S. security alliance. I do not think this is a frivolous idea, but I would like to stress that we should not repeat the mistakes of the past. A country which has inflicted pain may forget, but for the countries that suffered the pain, 50 years is not long enough to forget. [Shimizu] You mean we should revise our current policy of emphasizing the economy, but not forget about the mistakes committed in the past. [Miyazawa] Now that nuclear arms no longer have a place and the Cold War structure has gone, I think the Japanese can be proud that the path they have taken so far has brought them freedom and prosperity. The Japanese can walk their path with pride. Events are moving in a favorable direction for them. `Decline' of the SDPJ Regrettable [Shimizu] Fifteen years ago, you remarked, "I think the people want the government to change hands. The reason why there has been no change in power is because people are not sure what the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] [SDPJ], the most likely opposition party to take power, will do." [Miyazawa] I have devoted all my time as a politician to the cause of defeating Marxism-Leninism. It has become clear who has won. The SDPJ will fall unless they can come up with some really good ideas. In a way, though, I think it would be regrettable if the SDPJ was no longer a political force. People may tell me that in politics there should be no complaints as long as everyone gets the same chance, but that is not the case in countries which are fairly economically advanced. I think there should be social justice to help the people who tend to lag behind in competition, to enable everyone to walk together. It is desirable that we have some people who keep questioning whether free competition is the only thing that matters. Given that, I seriously wonder whether the decline of the SDPJ is really a good thing. Multiparties Unavoidable [Shimizu] Do you see any need for the political pattern of Japan to change? [Miyazawa] The needs of the people have become very diversified. It has become just about impossible for any one party to represent 80 percent or so of the public. In advanced countries, you expect that in a multiparty system no party will get more than 30 to 40 percent backing from the people. [Shimizu] In looking back at the government over the almost 50 years since the end of the war, we cannot ignore the influence of the bureaucrats. You have experience of having served as both government official and politician. How do you view the bureaucratic system? [Miyazawa] I may be a little screwy, but I think the Japanese bureaucrats do a very good job. Politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen each played their part to enable Japan to catch up with and outrun Europe and the United States. Such a division of labor is likely to generate collusion among them, but did make it possible for Japan to catch up. However, the moment the country did catch up, that division of labor lost its purpose, and the problems with collusion then started to surface. The bureaucratic system means bureaucrats doing thed same things they have done in previous years. It does not set its own direction. Problems therefore arise if the government fails to show targets to the bureaucrats. If that happens, the division of labor system does not work too well. Some people have complained about bureaucrats, and insist, for instance, the government should have parliamentary vice ministers answer at Diet deliberations. All this makes me laugh. But such views are not so bad if we take them as revealing the belief that politicians should lead bureaucrats. [Shimizu] It is said the bureaucrats now wield even more power since the coalition government came to power. [Miyazawa] The coalition government was formed by parties wanting to enact political reform. On other matters there has never been any policy agreement among them. In such circumstances, the bureaucrats are bound to lead the government. [Shimizu] How do you view the Hosokawa coalition government? I think nothing happens unless Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa orders it. [Miyazawa] Mr. Hosokawa has a fine personality, but he came to power without being prepared for it. There are many people around him, but they are not professionals either. I feel sorry about it. Mr. Ozawa is a very capable man, but it is difficult to head the administration from behind the scenes. It is a very complicated job. He has unique sense of values and is far-sighted too. But old people like me are very aware that we should not repeat the mistakes of the past, such as amending the Constitution, for instance.
