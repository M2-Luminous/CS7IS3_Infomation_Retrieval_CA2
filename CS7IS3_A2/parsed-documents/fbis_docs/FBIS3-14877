The diplomat also referred to his country having no formal obligation to pull its units out from Estonia by that date. Alexandr Udaltsev, official in charge of relations with the Baltics at the Russian Foreign Ministry, said Russia during the talks between the two countries had considered "the possibility to shift forward" the deadline for the troop withdrawal after Estonia, in his words, had failed to abide by certain promises it had given earlier. "The issue, in particular, was about Estonia going to provide 23 million U.S. dollars for the building of houses for the officers to be repatriated," Udaltsev said, adding that there had also been a number of other issues the deadline was linked to. "Not a single one of these has been fulfilled by the Estonian side," he said. "In such a situation, naturally, the (final) date of the withdrawal is, at least, under question," he said. He reminded that Russia had taken upon itself no obligation with respect to the pullout deadline. "The topic of money, to our regret, no longer arises, since the Estonian party has shown itself as not being serious about it," he said. Udaltsev said the main problem that bars way to an agreement on Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia now is the issue of signing a package of accords. Russia is insisting that agreements on social security guarantees for retired Russian military and their family members in Estonia be signed in one single package with the army pullout agreement. "This is our initial position," Udaltsev said. He claimed that such a position on the issue was in compliance with rulings by international organizations, which demand the withdrawal of Russian units from the Baltics to take place "speedily, orderly, and according to the respective agreements." "Our partners in the Baltics for some reason or another are emphasizing only the first of these words, somehow forgetting about the two others," Udaltsev said. The Russian diplomat said it was crucial that at the current round of talks, scheduled to begin in Tallinn Tuesday [1 March], "all attention would be focused" on social security guarantees for the some 11,000 retired Russian military and 30,000 members of their families, remaining in Estonia. Udaltsev was pessimistic about the possibility that Estonia would grant permanent resident's status to these people, saying he feared the Baltic country was unlikely to "take a constructive approach" to the issue. As another issue Russia views is preventing progress toward a solution of the topic of the withdrawal, Udaltsev mentioned reciprocal claims over property and damages. The diplomat said his country suggested a "zero option," when Russia would give up claims for compensation for the property it leaves behind in Estonia, while Estonia would not claim anything for damages inflicted by the Russian army on its soil. The two parties so far have failed to agree on a mutually acceptable formulation for the issue, he said. Udaltsev's remarks today come as an indication that Russia is going to cancel the Aug. 31, 1994, deadline it suggested for the withdrawal of its troops from Estonia at negotiations late last year. Russia then said it would pull its remaining about 2,500 troops from Estonia by that date, but soon declined to present to Estonia a detailed timetable for the withdrawal. Russia said failure at the talks to settle the issue of social welfare and guarantees for military pensioners was the reason of the delay. Estonia at the beginning of this year declared agreeing with the troop withdrawal deadline offered by Russia.
