Like spring wind blowing over the land of Heilongjiang, this thing made all people of the province filled with exultation. We should take this opportunity, turn our eyes inward, deepen reform, expand the scale of opening up, and restore the prestige of Heilongjiang. With rich natural resources, a solid agricultural foundation, and a strong lineup of state-owned enterprises, Heilongjiang is the country's key base for production of coal, timber, petroleum, machinery, and commodity grain and has made major contributions to the country. However, with various contradictions and problems accumulated for a long period of time under the traditional systems, in the past 10 years, the province relatively lagged behind in the economic development, and the industrial development speed was noticeably lower than the national average level. The problems of Heilongjiang being an old industrial base prominently exist among the petroleum, coal, forest, and war industries; grain trades; and large and medium-sized enterprises. The central leading comrades have extremely been concerned with the temporary difficulties ahead of Heilongjiang. For a period of time, six standing committee members of the political bureau of the party Central Committee, namely Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, and Hu Jingtao, successively inspected our province and helped resolve difficulties and problems. The central authorities made such a great determination to help our province solve problems. This was the most favorable condition for restoring the prestige of Heilongjiang. The central authorities fully understand Heilongjiang's difficulties, affirm the contributions made by the people of Heilongjiang the work ideas of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, and place great expectations on restoring the prestige of Heilongjiang. Therefore, changing the cordial concern of the central leading comrades into the real deeds of relying on self-efforts to tide over difficulties is a major task ahead of all people of the province. We should base ourselves on turning our eyes inward; rely on our own efforts to solve problems; and concentrate our work on emancipating the mind, deepening reform, expanding the scale of opening up, and promoting development. To restore the prestige of Heilongjiang, we should proceed from the actual conditions of the province and make efforts to build new industries and economic advantages. To this end, the provincial party committee has worked out a strategic idea for extending five aspects and speeding up two aspects as well as a work idea for following five roads. To realize the strategic idea and the work idea, we must pioneer ways for deepening reform and expanding the scale of opening up. To suit the general target of setting up the socialist market economic system, we should further deepen the reform of the economic system, focus on reforming the property rights of state-owned enterprises, boldly explore ways for setting up a modern enterprise system, enliven state-owned large and medium- sized enterprises, coordinate reform with transformation, vigorously promote technological transformation among old enterprises, grasp the construction of key projects, strive to expand pillar industries, and form new economic growth points. We should bring into play the advantages of opening the border areas to the outside world, extensively invite businessmen and introduce foreign capital to conduct grafting transformation, positively pioneer domestic and foreign markets, and comprehensively promote the development of Heilongjiang. To restore the prestige of Heilongjiang, we should turn our eyes inward, rely on our efforts to make the province strong, work arduously, and quietly immerse ourselves in hard work. The central leaders support Heilongjiang to tide over difficulties. This is an external factor. Only when we concentrate our own efforts will we be able to bring into play the functions of the external factor and to promote a change in Heilongjiang. We should fully use the support of the state, rely on our own efforts, work arduously, and do better the things of Heilongjiang. Practice showed that although the units have the same economic strains, their situations are greatly different because they make different efforts to conduct reform and enhance their internal strength. For example, by pioneering ways for marketing, some of the collieries under Jixi Mining Administrative Bureau have basically not owed the staff and workers' wages. Therefore, we stress the necessity not to wait for or rely on others' assistance but to make efforts to resolve the economic difficulties of various trades in the province. We should vigorously advocate the spirits of doing solid work, immersing ourselves in hard work, and doing pioneering work; set up a work mechanism of doing solid work and stressing real efficiency; and have the daring to do pioneering work, to have a try, to run a risk, and to bravely blaze new trails in doing our practical work. Only when the people from higher levels downward across the province form a good practice of seeking truth, dealing with concrete matters relating to work, and doing solid work will we certainly be able to promote the economic development and restore the prestige of Heilongjiang.
