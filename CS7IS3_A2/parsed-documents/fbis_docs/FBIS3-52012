However, compared with 1992, the year's surplus was positive, $13 billion. (Brasilia Radio Nacional da Amazonia Network in Portuguese 0900 GMT 21 Jan 94) Brazil's foreign exchange reserves at the beginning of 1994 hit a record of almost $33 billion in international liquidity. This is an increase of more than $2 billion compared with November 1993, when reserves stood at $31.01 billion. The surge is due to the favorable foreign exchange rate in December 1993 resulting from the impressive flow of dollars into the country -- $3 billion -- attracted by high interest rates and good returns on the stock exchange.
