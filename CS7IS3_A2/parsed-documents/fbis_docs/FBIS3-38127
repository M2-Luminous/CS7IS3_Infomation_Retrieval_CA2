This was affirmed after talks today in Berlin on cooperation by German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe and his Polish counterpart Piotr Kolodziejczyk. The tried and tested cooperation should be expanded in the spirit of the recent NATO summit decisions and with the goal of future Polish membership in the North Atlantic defense alliance. [passage omitted] "No date can yet be set" for Poland's accession for the time being, Ruehe said. It depends above all on how quickly the necessary "compatibility" of the Polish Armed Forces could be achieved. This includes a common understanding of defense strategy as well as equal standards for telecommunication equipment. Kolodziejczyk said Poland has the "firm intention of becoming an active participant in NATO's Partnership for Peace program," but under no circumstances will it take part in a "race for quick NATO membership." [passage omitted] Commenting on recent developments in Russia, Ruehe said that in the interest of "Russia's internal development and of international stability," he believes it is important to seek to establish intensive contacts and a political dialogue with the Russian military.
