The U.S. delegation was composed of seven senators -- four Republicans and three Democrats -- highly assessed the results of the meeting. "We received enthusiastically the idea of civilian control [kontrol] over nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction," Sam Nunn noted. He stressed that the United States and Russia should step up their work to reduce the risk of weapons of mass destruction being used. The sides agreed that it is necessary to do everything to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and of missile technology. "The United States, Russia, and other great powers have no interest at all in nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological weapons spreading around the world," Sam Nunn noted. Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the Committee for Defense of the State Duma, called the meeting between the parliamentarians of the two great powers a "significant event". During the two-day discussion, he noted, problems concerning external security and defense policy were discussed. The sides stressed that civilian control over the armed forces has great importance for strengthening the system of mutual security. "Joint Russian-American military exercises are the symbol of trust between the two countries," Sergey Yushenkov said. "In this respect, the implementation of other programs in the military sphere, including the Partnership for Peace program, are also of great importance," he said. The two parliamentary defense committees agreed to continue the dialogue which, to all appearances, will take place on the territory of the United States now.
