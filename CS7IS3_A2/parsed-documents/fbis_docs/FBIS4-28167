That day, Foreign Minister Kim said: "We are interested in, and are examining, Russia's proposal." Thus, he indirectly put forth a proposal for discussing North Korea's nuclear issue in the "eight-way talks." The proposal for eight-way talks was put forth by Russia on 24 March. The idea is to find a solution to North Korea's nuclear issue through eight-way talks involving South and North Korea, the United States, Japan, China, Russia, the United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Because the background for his remarks is unknown, it is not certain whether Foreign Minister Kim meant a revision of North Korea's "principle of solving the nuclear issue through the North-U.S. talks" or whether his remarks were ceremonial ones. But, at the present moment, the prevailing view is that those remarks hint of an obvious change in attitude in light of the fact that North Korea's nuclear issue is now in its final stages of discussion at the UN Security Council. [passage omitted] First of all, we can interpret this as showing a change in its attitude because, realistically, the nuclear issue has already lost its value as a bargaining chip in its negotiations with the United States because the issue is now at a cul-de-sac stage when the UN Security Council is discussing the imposition of sanctions. As for North Korea, the only way to break through the present difficulty without suffering from sanctions is to accept the U.S. demand for ad hoc inspections and for a full confession. In this case, because this will be regarded as surrender to the United States, it will be difficult for North Korea to cope with the consequences. Rather, as far as North Korea is concerned, the eight-way talks may serve as an alternative because the talks can lessen North Korea's burden. Of course, many people say that it is unreasonable to regard his remarks as showing a change in North Korea's attitude on the grounds that official media of North Korea are still advocating the solution of its nuclear issue through North-U.S. negotiations. Those who have this kind of view see his remarks to be of a long-shot, public attention-arousing nature, or--in view of North Korea's diplomatic attitude which we have seen thus far--as merely a strategy to earn time to lessen the ever-seething international mood for the imposition of sanctions. If North Korea has really changed its attitude, it is now clear that a new turning-point will be provided in the solution to North Korea's nuclear issue through dialogue--which is now at a deadlock--although the possibility of immediate realization of the eight-way talks is small because the UN Security Council has already begun discussing the issue.
