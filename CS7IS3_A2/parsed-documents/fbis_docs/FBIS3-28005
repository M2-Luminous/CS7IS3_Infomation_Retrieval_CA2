Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and national unification minister, said the government will step up consultations with the United States and the IAEA on ways to have Pyongyang accept inspections by the U.N.-sponsored nuclear watchdog. He made the remarks during a consultation on unification policies between government and ruling Democratic Liberal Party officials. Yi also gave the meeting an analysis of the North Korean Foreign Ministry's statement Monday, where the communist country threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, if Washington continued to demand full-scale inspections and build up its forces in the South. "North Koreans seem to fear that the strengthened U.S. military and intelligence activities in the South may be part of its efforts to accumulate pretexts for international sanctions (against them)," he said. Meanwhile, a senior Foreign Ministry official said it was improper for North Koreans to take issue with the deployment of Patriot missiles in the South, which has nothing to do with the North Korean nuclear issue. Commenting on the North Korean statement, the official said the antimissile missiles are for defensive purposes only and their deployment is part of a plan to improve the joint South Korea-U.S. defense capability. South Korea still expects North Korea, recognizing the inevitability of international inspections of its nuclear sites, to take positive steps to receive the inspections soon, said Chang Chae-yong, the Ministry's director-general for American Affairs. He said Seoul also favors solution of the nuclear issue through dialogue and is closely cooperating with the United States and other countries concerned to achieve it.
