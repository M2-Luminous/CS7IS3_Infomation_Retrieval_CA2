[Lapshin] Many postcommunist states, after the initial stage of tough reforms that were painful to the population, came to a "softening" of the socioeconomic policy. Do you have the possibility of carrying out an adjustment toward "softening" without slipping into the "comfortable" bosom of the administrative-command system? [Yasin] If we were to slip that way we would arrive at either a distributive economy or hyperinflation. When they proclaim the slogan "socially oriented market economy" and, moreover, suggest making this phrase the banner of the reformation, I do not believe in it. Not because I consider it necessary to cast the person who has ended up below the poverty line to the will of fate and not because everything that is being done seems fair to me. But what can we suggest? Increasing pensions and wages? But unless we increase production, all this will end up tomorrow as higher inflation and nothing more. We must be clearly aware that inflation is the most reliable means of fleecing the poor. I will say outright that talk of a social-market economy is cheap demagoguery. [Lapshin] But do you really not think that certain aspects of the social policy must be reinforced? [Yasin] Yes, I think we need serious measures that would contribute to fairer distribution. But this does not mean the onset of a stage of a social-market economy. The latter is the destiny of rich countries. After all, it is no accident that when Erhard conducted the reform in Germany he said nothing about it. Only after the very severe policy had led to financial stabilization, an upsurge of the economy, and an increase in business activity was it possible to begin to speak about distribution. After all, what is a social-market economy? It is above all the principle of distribution. Take from some and give it to others through the state. As for the countries of Eastern Europe, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia have just reached the stage where they have basically achieved macroeconomic stabilization. They are now faced with the problem of production, and they do not know what to do with it. All countries that are in a process of transition from a communist system of economy are experiencing largely similar stages. Achieving macroeconomic stabilization is the simplest thing. But then comes the most difficult task: how to breathe life into this economy, how to make people work, how to make goods appear. [Lapshin] Do you think the Russian economy has reached this point? [Yasin] Unfortunately, we have not yet achieved macroeconomic stabilization. But I think that, while continuing our efforts to achieve it, we must now create the necessary mechanisms, above all financial ones, for increasing the effectiveness of our development. [Lapshin] There is a point of view according to which the economic reform is being conducted in the interests of less than 10 percent of the population of Russia. If this is so, it is almost frivolous to speak about any nationwide campaign for increasing effectiveness. [Yasin] I do not subscribe to the theory of conspiracies against Russia and its people and I do not think that anyone in the government is conducting a policy in the interests of a narrow stratum of the population. Anyone who exploits the conspiracy thesis is a demagogue and a populist. The current policy basically reflects the interests of Russia and its future. Of course one could say that it is turning out to be bad and wrong. But the possibility of changing the policy that is being conducted exists within a very narrow range. I have emphasized repeatedly that any reasonable government of Russia would have to pursue approximately the same policy. There are no alternatives to it. [Lapshin] Let us assume that there are no alternatives. But it is possible and probably even necessary to make some adjustment to the course. [Yasin] We can now begin to focus on the tasks of the next stage, which involves the creation of preconditions for economic growth. We can relax our monetary policy and pay wages to miners, peasants, and scholars, from whom the state (not the suppliers and not the consumers, but namely the state) is holding back payments. This will lead to a certain rise of inflation, but all of these steps must be taken within that narrow range of possibilities I mentioned earlier. In other words, we must set in motion a very delicate and precise mechanism for fine-tuning our economy. And we simply do not have the possibility of making any global changes: If we pursue any true alternative, social explosion and economic chaos are simply inevitable. [Lapshin] Nonetheless the policy being implemented now is also generating mass dissatisfaction among the population. [Yasin] Indeed, it will lead to significant negative social consequences. And we have reached a point where we must regulate it. For example, it is necessary to regulate the growing differentiation of incomes, but only in a reasonable way. Thus if you put the squeeze on the rich again now it will be bad not only for them. Because the appearance of this stratum of people is a positive phenomenon for the Russian economy. If the authorities provide the possibility of investing private capital in the economy, they will do it more quickly and effectively than the labor collectives who have seized a large share of the property of privatized enterprises. [Lapshin] You frequently meet with representatives of our private business circles, what do they absolutely insist on? [Yasin] First of all, personal security. Second, guarantees for their private property. Third, certain tax breaks which they could have by investing capital namely in the Russian economy. [Lapshin] Excuse me, it is impossible to speak about any stage of effectiveness when a decision is being made to unify the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. It would seem, thank God, that the unification process has proceeded, but why should Russia have to pay for it? [Yasin] So far there is no actual agreement. There is some kind of memorandum about intentions. It seems to me that the unification must be carried out in a well-thought-out way, precluding, for example, a "one for one" exchange of the ruble for the "rabbit," having agreed on a single well-controlled mechanism for emission. [Lapshin] Will it not turn out that all your discussions of a new stage of Russian reforms will remain merely good intentions? After all, many citizens of Russia will not take any more, they are tired, and they are ready to believe in another miracle. [Yasin] If we decide to curtail the reforms we will be defeating ourselves once again. I am in favor of applying state power and supporting the reformation. Out-and-out populism is incompatible with the reforms and life without the reforms holds no promise. And if such a policy is begun it is above all the simple people who will have to pay for it.
