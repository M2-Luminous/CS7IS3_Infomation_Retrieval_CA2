FR940727-1-00016 FR940727-1-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;65&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 series airplanes, that currently requires replacement of all attachment screws at the exhaust nozzle plug splice, and a check of nut plates for running torque and replacement of nut plates, if necessary. This action would require modification of the engine exhaust plug assemblies; when accomplished, this modification would terminate the need for the currently required replacement and check. This proposal is prompted by reports of loose or missing attachments at the splice joint of the engine forward and aft exhaust plugs, and loss of the rear exhaust plug following an engine bird strike. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent reduced integrity of the engine exhaust plug installation, which may lead to separation of exhaust plugs from the airplane, and create a hazard to persons and property on the ground. DATES: Comments must be received by September 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;65&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;65&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;65&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On January 17, 1983, the FAA issued AD 83&hyph;02&hyph;05, amendment 39&hyph;4544 (48 FR 5539, February 7, 1983), applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 series airplanes, to require replacement of all attachment screws at the exhaust nozzle plug splice. That AD also requires a check of nut plates for running torque and replacement of nut plates not meeting the minimum run down torque of five inch-pounds. That action was prompted by reports of loose or missing attachment screws at the plug splice joint. In one reported incident, the exhaust plug nozzle separated from one engine while the airplane was in flight. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent separation of the exhaust nozzle plug from the engine. Since the issuance of that AD, three operators have reported four incidents of loose or missing attachments at the splice joint of the engine forward and aft exhaust plugs. These discrepancies were found on airplanes subsequent to the accomplishment of AD 83&hyph;02&hyph;05. One operator reported loss of the rear exhaust plug on one airplane after the engine sustained a bird strike. Investigation revealed that the cause of these loose or missing splice joint attachments was attributed to higher temperatures and vibration effects of the engine exhaust. Operators also reported loose nuts at the forward plug-to-engine turbine flange attachments. The cause of these loose nuts has been attributed to high temperature and incompatibility of the nut threads with associated threaded studs.
