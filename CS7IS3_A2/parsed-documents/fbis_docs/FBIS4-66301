Since 1979, main emphasis in the systematic reform of the tax system had been placed on effectively dealing with the relation between state and enterprises in matters of distribution, and the readjustment of the relations between central government and local government finances had been neglected. It is for this reason that the current system of tax management lags behind the reform of the tax system. This is the cause of much confusion in actual practice, and is one of the primary reasons for the prevailing vague delineation of rights and responsibilities as between the central authorities and the local authorities. As a result, it is now an extremely widespread occurrence that local authorities exceed the limits of their own administrative authority and infringe on central authority domain. This, in turn, adversely affects the central government's ability for macro-regulation of the national economy, and also restricts the full development of the very function of taxation. It has therefore become even more urgent to initiate a system of tax assignments. Which Specific Form of Tax Assignment System To Select? We may select one of the following forms for the intended tax assignment system: 1) the form in which all tax categories are clearly divided up; 2) the form in which the various tax categories are divided up, but which also includes some that are jointly shared. The method of sharing the joint categories may be either by separate collections, by proportionate distribution, or by surtaxes and refunds; 3) the form of mainly separately sharing in tax rates. The first form may be considered the unitary system, and the two other forms may be called mixed forms. Generally speaking, adopting the form of completely dividing up all tax categories would be the most thorough way to do it, as it would make it possible, through the division of the tax sources, to clearly establish the income distribution between central authorities and local authorities. It would also make it possible, by adhering to the principle of unison of financial rights and responsibilities, to improve the dismal state of central finances. One may, however, counter that this is only good as an abstract theory, and that it is almost impossible in actual practice to truly effect so clear a division. The reason for this is that there is a multitude of factors that cause changes in revenue and expenditure of public finance. Generally, it is easier to adopt a mixed form, as these forms will have a certain elasticity in the division of tax revenue. Looking at the actual conditions in China, we see that, on the one hand, it has been customary for a long time to share revenue, and, on the other hand, that any division in the tax system is beset with many practical difficulties, because the tax sources cannot all of a sudden be divided up thus clearly. It is therefore my opinion that adoption of a form that provides for common sharing would be more feasible and more appropriate. As to which specific pattern to choose among those available in this kind of a form with common sharing, no preference can be claimed by any one of them, but the pattern of proportionate sharing comes closer to Chinese usage. How To Resolve Regional Differences? For the resolution of regional differences, there are the following alternatives: 1) The method of "large unison with small differences." That would mean, the norms for tax sharing would be more or less the same for the whole country, and economically backward regions would have to use other means, such as subsidies, preferential treatment, etc. to achieve in effect a policy of due differentiations in regional treatments. 2) The method of "small unison with large differences." That would mean, that districts throughout the country would be classed as high, medium, and low categories, according to disparities in economic development, and that different methods would then be applied to the different categories. In my opinion, the first method would be preferable. This method would have the system appear as much more unified, and it would also avoid making the system excessively cumbersome and complex. It would help keep the whole tax management system appropriately simple and be more convenient in the actual application of the new system. Adopting the method of subsidies would conform to international practices, and would, compared with China's traditional method of large disparities, give full scope to the redistribution of financial resources. It would also strengthen the supervisory powers of the central authorities over this part of the funds and would also impel the local authorities to properly use these funds. In the opposite case, if the second method would be adopted, it could engender in its actual execution--judging by the performances of the past--much imitation, mutual rivalry, and evasive compromises, while it would be difficult to appropriately decide on the particular categories of the districts. Establishing a Scientific System of Indices The greatest difficulty in every past attempt to reform the management system of public finance was the determination of the base figures for regional revenue and expenditure and determining the proportions to be shared by central and local authorities. The main causes for this appear to have been the lack of a rational system of indices and of subjective will, and the dominant position of vested interests. Normally, the figures in the final accounts of revenue and expenditure of a certain year or of several years were taken as reliable data for the determination of the base figure, and based on these, the proportions of income to be shared by central and local governments would be determined. Because these figures are subject to fortuitous changes over short periods of time, this method lays the seeds for future fights over base figures and proportions between central authorities and local authorities, and leads--in fact did so for a long time in the past--to unending wrangling during the process of demarcating revenue and expenditures, which then had also each time adversely affected the results of the reforms. The tax assignment system that is now being planned must absorb the lessons of the past several attempts at reforming the system of public finance, and must first provide a scientific system of indices, and on that foundation rationally demarcate the tax revenue for the various levels of governments, so as to ensure feasibility as well as stability of the new system. Appropriate Delineation of Levels of Tax Management The ultimate purpose of the delineation of levels of tax management is the accurate division of responsibilities and limits of authority as between governments of different ranks. Judging by the successful experiences in other countries with the tax assignment system, tax management levels are to be always identical with the levels of political administration; commonly there are three levels of administration. In view of the actual situation in China, it should also be considered to differentiate, in conformity with the levels in public finance administration, between the three administrative levels: the central authorities, the provinces (autonomous regions, centrally controlled municipalities), and the counties (cities), each with its own tax sources. Taxation at the latter two levels would then constitute local taxation. This kind of demarcation would essentially conform to the levels of political administration in China, would be comparatively clear, and also convenient in actual management. However a few points must be explained here: 1) Village finances, even though one level of financial administration, need not be a separate and independent level, because village governments have very limited responsibilities and authority, and bear almost no economic functions. Their affairs could therefore be administered unifiedly at the county (city) level. 2) Delineation of the limits of administrative authority of the provinces is extremely important, because the provinces bear the heavy responsibility of dealing with a dual distribution relation, namely between central authorities and provinces and between provinces and counties; they must have a considerable scope of authority. 3) Because cities with provincial status enjoy administrative authority equal to that of provinces, their revenue and expenditure is not connected with those of the provinces. They can therefore be administered in the same way as provinces. Moreover, even though these cities have a lot of tax revenue -- most are one of the supporting pillars of their provinces -- according to the guiding idea of the "great unison," they can also only adopt the same indices, just as throughout the entire country, in the delineation of tax revenue. This may also promote their even faster development. Specific Designs for the Intended Tax Assignment System The key question in designing the tax assignment system is the renewed determination and demarcation of financial authority and financial resources as between the central authorities and the local governments. This touches on the interests of both sides. On the one hand, the principle of unison of financial authority and executive power should be upheld; on the other hand, however, it is also necessary to consider a series of other factors, such as the macro strategic objectives of the state, social policies, and the functions of local governments. Determination of financial power and financial resources between the various levels of government must mainly be accomplished through the delimitation of tax categories, tax rates, and tax management. The idea of demarcation of tax categories. In the demarcation of tax categories, i.e. in the question of how to select the tax sources of the central government and those of the local authorities, one may adopt different models. At present, different opinions are held by different circles of society. In my opinion, a choice has to be made between the following two models: First Model: The starting point in one's considerations must be the need to ensure revenue and to ensure the central authority's ability to effect regulation and control. According to the special characteristics of the tax revenue structure in recent years, the first consideration must be to preserve the financial resources required by the central government for its normal functions. Second consideration must be to distribute between central and local authorities when tax revenue increases. Third consideration must be the degree of difficulty encountered in levying and administering the taxes, because for some tax categories collection and administration may be a dispersed affair and posing great difficulties in administration. Such taxes must not be made tax categories of the central authorities, but may be administered by the local authorities. According to the above-stated principle, product tax, value-added tax, special activities tax are tax categories that should be assigned to the central authorities. Income tax of enterprises, social security tax, and business tax are tax categories whose tax sources are closely linked to economic development and which are characterized by great unevenness. These tax categories may be commonly shared by central authorities and local authorities. Most of the remaining tax categories may be made local tax sources. Second Model: Dividing up tax categories according to their nature into those to be tax sources of the central authorities and those to be tax sources of the local authorities. First, customs duties, which are needed to maintain the sovereignty of the state, and the salt tax, which is best unifiedly administered by the state, must be designated central authority taxes. Second, high-rate product tax, which the state uses as a means to prevent duplication of production, the fixed asset investment tax for the regulation of investment activities, also taxes on relevant activities of a special kind, must be assigned to the central authorities. Third, in the case of large items of tax revenue, which ensure the financial resources of the central authorities, such as value-added tax, it may be considered to assign a large proportion of them to the central authorities as their revenue. Some other taxes, directly related to production and circulation, may be assigned, because of their rather wide fluctuations, to both the central authorities and the local authorities for common administration, so that both may have benefits from them and also commonly bear the risks. Tax categories that are of less value, for which collection and administration is scattered over a wide area and that have a local character, may be left to be the fixed revenue of the local authorities. Delineation of the limits of authority in tax management. Authority in tax management comprises the right to legislate on tax matters, the right of interpretation, the right to adjust tax rates and tax items, and the right to reduce taxes and exempt from taxes. This delineation is closely liked to the demarcation of tax sources. As the levels to which the tax categories belong differ, so differ the levels of authority in tax management. The basic demand in the demarcation of tax management authorities is to appropriately expand the administrative authority of the local governments, always on the precondition of ensuring the central authorities' ability to exercise macro-regulation and control. It is possible to prescribe in general that governments of all levels shall enjoy authority to manage their own tax categories. In this way, the legislative power in matters of central authority taxes is exercised by the National People's Congress. The State Administration of Taxation is responsible for interpretations and for the promulgation of enforcement provisions, which will then have to be enforced by tax bureaus at all level. The legislative power in tax matters of governments of the provincial level is exercised by the provincial people's representative assemblies, and tax rules are interpreted by the provincial tax bureaus, who will also promulgate enforcement provisions and enforce the tax rules. Taxation at the county level is handled similar to the procedure at the provincial level. At the same time, the local governments have certain rights with regard to taxation initiated for new tax categories. All legislative power concerning tax categories that benefit both the central authorities and the local authorities rests with the central authorities, so as to ensure revenue for the central authorities and to strengthen the central authority's control over the local authorities. However, the enforcement authority may, according to different circumstances, be assigned to both to exercise in common, as this may be beneficial for raising enthusiasm among the local authorities. To bring the above plan closer to realization, the authority in tax management may be assigned in the following administrative forms: Central authority taxes are to be legislated and enforced by the central authorities, and the entire administrative authority over them is centralized in the central government. In the case of taxes benefiting jointly both the central authorities and local authorities, the central government is to legislate and the State Administration of Taxation is to interpret and to determine specific enforcement provisions. The right of adjustments and the right to reduce taxes and exempt from taxes shall be exercised separately by either the central authorities or the local authorities. The province- and county-level governments shall each separately have authority in the administration of most of the local taxes, and the central authorities shall not have the right to interfere. Province- and county-level governments, acting within the sphere of their jurisdictions, may, as circumstances demand, initiate taxation in new tax categories. Administrative authority over these tax categories shall completely be exercised by the local governments, so as to have the local authorities enhance their financial resources, raise enthusiasm for revenue increases, and also because it will be beneficial for greater involvement of the local governments in the local economic activities of their own localities.
