We would like to share with you our assessment of today's events in response to the measures the government took last night concerning fuel prices and the decision to instruct the Government Ministry on the preservation of public order. The response has definitely been positive and the situation is returning to normal. We see the people are starting to return to work and their other activities little by little. [passage omitted] I am going to allow Construction and Transportation Minister Pablo Vigil to speak because he has been monitoring the transportation situation throughout the day. He will now speak to you. [Vigil] Good evening, Radio Nicaragua listeners. As Dr. Pereira noted, we assessed the development of the transportation situation nationwide. At this time we can confirm, from touring Managua and based on reports we have received from the regions of the country, that the police have guaranteed unobstructed transit on all our roads and highways in a very normal way, except for a few points in Managua, near the facilities of the Parrales-Vallejo Cooperative. We have observed that citizens have been able to freely move about and drive the streets of Managua and the highways today. The police have maintained constant patrols. We noticed great calm. Certain routes of urban and interurban bus lines have started to operate. There was greater activity in the afternoon. We noticed a normalization in activities. We think this is a positive response by citizens to the measures the government announced on 25 January. We urge carriers who have not yet returned to work to do so tomorrow because we think that to increase production and progress we must show support and solidarity with those who have made great efforts to reach their workplaces. Fortunately, people have found solutions to their transportation problems. This has prevented an interruption of most economic activities in the country. Therefore, I urge the people in general, those who have not yet returned to work, especially the drivers, to do so on 27 January. Of course, as the government, we are always willing to talk with all sectors. As representatives of the transportation sector, we are always willing to negotiate and talk with the various members of a sector as important as this one. We must clarify that the fuel problem is not the only one facing the transportation sector. It is essential we maintain a dialogue, and an attitude that will allow us to find alternatives to ensure the citizens have adequate transportation. Radio Nicaragua, thank you very much. To the Nicaraguan people, we say the government is very determined to find solutions to all problems to ensure we will have a better Nicaragua in the future. Thank you very much.
