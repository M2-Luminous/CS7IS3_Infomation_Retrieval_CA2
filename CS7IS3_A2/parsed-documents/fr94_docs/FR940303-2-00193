FR940303-2-00193 FR940303-2-00096 USIS officers in participating countries will facilitate the issuance of visas and other program-related material. Programmatic Considerations Thematically, the program should: Analyze the current status of public administration in the participants' countries of origin and determine, in conjunction with USIS posts in these countries and with the administrators selected as participants, the needs to be addressed by the exchange; provide the participants both a general and a specific overview of the administration and management of public service-providing organizations in the United States, beginning with an historic perspective and a survey of the evolution of the civil service system in the context of a socially diverse and politically democratic country; conduct for the participants a short, intensive course, combining lectures with discussion, site visits, and interviews, in public administration theory and practice. This course should also offer an intensive orientation to the concept of public service as an indispensable building block in the structure of democratic society and to the perception of a public office as a public trust; and place the administrators in month-long internships appropriate to their fields of specialization and responsibility in their home countries. Pursuant to the legislation authorizing the Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs, programs must maintain a nonpolitical character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. Beyond the immediate goals of this exchange, USIA is also interested in supporting programs which will lay the groundwork for new and continuing links between American and Middle Eastern educational institutions and professional organizations and which will encourage the further growth and development of democratic institutions. The grantee organization will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include organizing a coherent progression of activities, providing international and domestic travel arrangements for all participants, making lodging and local transportation arrangements for visitors, orienting and debriefing participants, preparing any necessary support material, and working with host institutions and individuals to achieve maximum program effectiveness. To prepare foreign public administrators for this project prior to their arrival in the United States, E/P encourages the grantee organization to develop material to be sent to USIS offices overseas for distribution to participants. This material might include a tentative project outline with suggested goals and objectives, relevant background information, and information about American institutions and individuals involved in the exchange. At the beginning of the U.S. portion of the program, the grantee should conduct an orientation session for the visiting participants which addresses administrative details of the program and provides general information about American society and culture which will facilitate the participants' understanding of and adjustment to daily life in the United States. At the conclusion of the program, the group should meet in a symposium to review what has been presented to and experienced by the participants and to consider how that which has been learned can most effectively be applied upon the participants' return to their home countries. Plans for the second component of the exchange should also be discussed at this time, and nominations should be accepted from the participants of American specialists who will be invited to conduct follow-up activities overseas. Additional Guidelines Program monitoring and oversight will be provided by appropriate USIA elements.
