[Al-Hasan] Our view is that Israel's chief aim in negotiating with the PLO is to terminate it. Because we represent an Arab-affiliated patriotic Palestinian movement, we are not seeking to abolish the PLO. That would only go along with the Israeli scheme. At the same time, the PLO's current political line contradicts its original aims and charter. For this reason, Palestinian officials opposed to the Oslo agreement are confused and face complex contradictions. Our proposal is this: The first task must be to reform and change the PLO's political line, not abolish the PLO itself. The PLO continues to represent most Palestinian factions and to advocate its abolition would serve Israeli objectives. Our primary duty is to adhere to the PLO Charter while criticizing its current policy and the Israeli enemy who occupies our land. [Farran] If we think of the agreements that have been concluded and the concessions that the Palestinians have made as representing the end of the negotiations, can we say that 'Arafat is finished? [Al-Hasan] The interim solution that has been reached is a prelude to the final solution and determines its shape. We in the opposition have lost some points but won others. We have lost because the general framework of the final solution has been drawn. However, we have made two important gains so far. The first gain is the growing opposition within and outside the PLO. Major intellectuals and the patriotic press have mobilized our people against the political line pursued in the negotiations. This is why the latest Cairo Agreement was coolly received, unlike the reception accorded to the Oslo agreement and the first Cairo agreement. The people had the illusion that the agreements called for the return of 800,000 displaced Palestinians, that the Israelis were going to withdraw from the occupied territories, and that a Palestinian state was going to be established. This illusion has dissipated. Our second gain is in our ability to prevent, so far, the ratification of the mutual PLO-Israeli letters, which included mutual PLO, Israeli recognition and offered a pledge to overturn the PLO Charter. We declared that if PLO institutions ratified those letters we would adopt a course other than dialogue. This means we would seek the people's support for more far-reaching measures. The Palestinian people's reception of the second Cairo agreement offers hope that the public response will be even stronger. The danger lies in the final solution. The result of our struggle against this solution will determine whether in the future we will live in an Israeli era marked by Israeli hegemony or in an Arab-Israeli era that has some form of balance. [Farran] You suggest that there is a possibility for reforming the political line. Knowing that the second Cairo agreement prohibits provocation [al-tahrid], how do you see this as a possibility? [Al-Hasan] We do not see the deployment of Palestinian police as a negative development. Nor do we see it as a historic achievement. It is an event with no historic significance. The economic agreement and Israeli hegemony have a negative historic significance, however. We are faced with two major achievements of the Zionist scheme: The political annexation [ilhaq] and economic annexation [of Palestinians] to Israel. Economic annexation undermines the most important victory of the intifadah. The latter made our people self-reliant in the face of the Israeli blockade. Because of the intifadah, our people developed their agricultural and industrial resources. Under the intifadah, agricultural production went up 11 percent and industrial production by 4 percent. The recent economic agreement, however, restored economic interdependence because it treated the West Bank, Gaza, and the land occupied in 1948 as one open trade zone with one tariff system. With some exceptions, the tariff system is basically unified. Economic interdependence does not lead to independence but to closer unity. Political annexation is clearly manifested in the tasks of the legislative council that will be elected. The recent Cairo agreement states that the legislative council will examine bills referred to it by a joint Israeli-Palestinian committee. Once the council makes a decision, the bill will be referred back to the committee. If Israel agrees, it will go into effect, otherwise it will be overruled. Several matters will be decided upon in the near future. Most important of these is the future of the land. This will be a test of whether economic and political annexation will be temporary or permanent. The issue of land and the issue of Jerusalem and its future are matters that will shape the final settlement. We have to prepare ourselves to fight the battle concerning the final settlement on the following principles: First, we should resist the economic annexation introduced by the Paris agreement. The agreement involves practical measures and we should call on our people to resist this annexation. Secondly, we should resist political annexation. The agreement says that the Israelis and Palestinians on one hand will meet with the Jordanians and Egyptians on the other hand to discuss ways of promoting cooperation. This means that Palestinian relations with the Arabs have become an Israeli-Palestinian, not a Palestinian, matter. Furthermore, Israel does not want to withdraw from the West Bank. It wants to legitimize its presence in the West Bank through a Palestinian-Israeli agreement that would keep the Israeli Army in the West Bank as an allied army. We seek to unite Palestinian and Arab efforts to prevent Israel from taking the land. We want to reverse the imminent military annexation. We have to understand that we will only defeat the Oslo agreement through defeating the Israeli concept of a final settlement, that is, through establishing economic unity between Palestine and Jordan first and then between Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. [Farran] You still hope that 'Arafat, despite all the concessions he made, will lead the battle for a final settlement? [Al-Hasan] The Palestinian people and their political forces are divided. The split appears in every Palestinian organization. Therefore, I think that we should not waste time on secondary issues. [Farran] Such as? [Al-Hasan] Such as discussing the pattern in which Palestinian decisions are made, because this pattern will not change. Not that we support this pattern, of which I am one victim. But focusing on this issue will not do us much good. The battle for the land, however, can rally the people. Defending the land, defending Jerusalem and the right of return, staying firm on matters that fire up the people, these are matters that will rally the people and entice them to defend their rights. For example, the farmers in the al-Mawasi in Gaza, an agricultural area of 13 square km, shouted foul when the recent security agreement gave their land to the Israelis. The Israelis, they noted, have not taken this area since Gaza was occupied in 1967, why should the Cairo agreement give it to them now? Worrying about the interests of the people makes our movement acceptable. Our battle is to address the people and create new facts that will help our people restore their rights. [Farran] Would you say that questioning 'Arafat's leadership and seeking to replace him is a marginal issue? [Al-Hasan] Handling an issue politically, that is, seeking to alter the political line, does not mean marginalizing it. I believe that in politics a marginal issue is one that you cannot settle, even if it is a real task. If we focused on merely important issues rather than actually vital ones, we would be serving the Oslo policy line. The really vital thing is to seek the public's support. The opposition cannot make internal changes because current Arab and international circumstances do not help it to do so. The important thing is to seek the people's support, who will be encouraged by our opposition to demand their rights. I will give you an example. A large number of personalities were invited to the second Cairo agreement signing ceremony. Some 93 of them, including 25 important figures living inside the occupied territories, did not come. The absence of Hanan 'Ashrawi, Sa'ib 'Urayqat, Ahmad Rashid, Bassam al- Shak'ah, and Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, and the cool popular response to the latest agreement are good signs. They will help us wage the struggle for the final solution. [Farran] Don't the Fatah oppositionists intend to find a replacement for 'Arafat? [Al-Hasan] No such thing is being considered. [Farran] You used to be a nominee to replace 'Arafat. Is this matter still in the cards? [Al-Hasan] At one time the various opposition forces thought of forming an alternative PLO. There were discussions about its structure and so on. Personally, I do not think this is the answer. What is coming will be worse than Oslo. What is coming is a proclamation of a Palestinian state based on an Israeli-Palestinian military alliance. The Israelis want a barren Palestinian state that will be an economic, political, and military annex of Israel. In articles I wrote I described it as the illusory state. Why wouldn't the Israelis accept such a state? What we must do is alert the public to future possibilities. We must create facts that will prevent these possibilities. I want to raise a basic point here: The battle is no longer between two sides alone because the solution will be part of a regional arrangement. What happens in the West Bank will affect the interests of Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria because the agreement will be general. For this reason, I hope and wager that these countries will have an opinion on what will happen to defend their interests. [Farran] Which Palestinian opposition factions agree with your views on how to confront the Gaza-Jericho agreement? [Al-Hasan] I do not think that there are great differences between me and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC]. I also believe that the brothers in Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], following their recent political declaration, have only one course of action open. They -- together with the PFLP, DFLP, and the PFLP-GC -- will have to escalate the confrontation with the enemy, explain the issues to the people, and mobilize them against concessions pertaining to Jerusalem, other territories, and the right of return. They must turn the confrontation into one between all the people and the Oslo policy, not between a group of oppositionists and a group in Tunis. [Farran] Can you be active abroad or will you return to the territories? [Al-Hasan] I will not be a member of the authority that is being established, although my name is being proposed. It is not reasonable for me to be part of an authority whose current policy I oppose. [Farran] You will stay abroad then? [Al-Hasan] Probably. [Farran] Is there a deal between 'Arafat and Hamas? What does it call for? [Al-Hasan] I do not think there is a deal between Hamas and 'Arafat. Nevertheless, it is illogical to allow Palestinian internal strife for two reasons: The public would not accept it and it would serve Israeli interests. The situation in the Gaza Strip is different from the situation in the West Bank. In Gaza, where Israel has withdrawn from 70 percent of the territory, there is a strong Hamas presence and there will be a large deployment of Palestinian police. I do not believe that local conditions in Gaza encourage conflict between the police and Hamas. We must wait and see how things will develop, however. The PLO Executive Committee is sending envoys to all local forces to ensure no infighting occurs and to encourage dialogue. [Farran] Will Faruq Qaddumi be part of the Palestinian Authority? [Al-Hasan] The Political Department is not supposed to be part of the authority. Furthermore, Israel will not allow Abu-al-Lutf (Qaddumi), who is actually opposed to the Oslo agreement, to enter the territories as head of the Political Department. He might become part of the Civil Authority and be given another post. [Farran] Is Qaddumi's name being proposed? [Al-Hasan] Regrettably, we have reached the stage where Israel is deciding who will enter and who will not. Personally, I do not know what is happening exactly, but I do not believe that brother Abu-al-Lutf will be part of the Palestinian Authority. [Farran] Does this mean that he is an actual opponent of 'Arafat? [Al-Hasan] He is among the opposition but has a special way of doing that. He does not agree with my way of presenting issues. I believe that all issues must be submitted to the people to let them know what is happening. I wager on the people and their role in defending their interests. Abu-al-Lutf, who is Fatah Central Committee secretary, has a different view. Nevertheless, he is really opposed to the current policies. [Farran] Will two Palestinian axes appear, one in Gaza and the other in Tunis? Where will you stand on this? [Al-Hasan] This is what we began our dialogue with. I do not believe it will happen. We will not adopt stances on behalf of the people. Let the people themselves adopt a stance. Without a definite stance the people will not be able to do anything. Matters are very complicated now. The people are asked to vote in elections, although the autonomy authority in the West Bank will not take over the settlements, Greater Jerusalem, or the large Israeli Army's deployment areas in the West Bank and the Jordan Valley. The Palestinian authority will not take over more than 40 or 50 percent of the West Bank's territory. The remainder, inhabited by more than 250,000 Palestinians, will remain under Israeli sovereignty. Is this not a major problem that requires much thought? In Gaza the situation is different because the Israeli settlements are border territories, not Palestinian population centers. In the West Bank the situation is very entangled and the implementation of autonomy will be plagued by frictions. In actual terms there will be a canton in Gaza, another in Jericho, a third in Hebron and the villages around it, a fourth in Nablus and its villages, and a fifth in other Palestinian populated areas whose status will not be discussed until the final stage. Add to this that an Israeli autonomy already exists in the settlements themselves. In this complex situation the people will discover that they cannot travel from one point to another and that Israel controls two-thirds of the water resources, which will make it difficult for them to develop their agriculture. In view of all this, shouldn't we explain these problems to the people and invite them to adopt the position they wish to hold? [Farran] Can 'Arafat go beyond the articles of the agreement and endorse the Palestinian people's will to fulfill his demands? [Al-Hasan] The question should be whether the counteropinion will succeed in making the Palestinian people force their leadership in Gaza and Jericho to stand by them rather than by Rabin if a dispute develops with him. If they fail to do that, the people will have their say. We wager on the people. If we fail to develop grassroots support to undertake that task, we will turn into mere commentators on events. Our task today is to find ways to cope with future eventualities. I am optimistic because this agreement bears the germ of contradiction. Welcome to these contradictions. If a day comes on which Rabin says to hell with the agreement, we will have a unique point of accord with him. [Farran] Then you do not think that it is probable that these axes will develop? [Al-Hasan] I do not favor a dispute among various axes. I prefer to push the people to take a stance. Hence the role of popular instigation, which is done by confronting the enemy via propaganda, the media, and organization. [Farran] But the agreement leaves no room for instigation? [Al-Hasan] The current political line and events have given birth to two or more stances and the process continues. What you call axes I call generated stances. The question is will matters be handled through conflict at the top level? This is what some brothers in and outside Fatah believe. I believe that a conflict at the top will not stop the Oslo agreement. What will stop the Oslo agreement is doing what we believe will stop it. It is the people who can do that. The conflict among the various stances in Tunis is a conflict within closed rooms that achieves nothing. Therefore, we have to clarify matters and draw up a plan. Since the agreement bears the germ of contradiction, let us try to exploit these future contradictions. [Farran] What is the role of Faysal al-Husayni in Jerusalem? [Al-Hasan] Al-Husayni's failure to attend the signing ceremony in Cairo affirms that he has returned to himself and realized that an agreement was being signed while Jerusalem was still under siege and that in a few months it would become clear that Jerusalem had nothing to do with autonomy. This is exactly what 'Abd-al-Shafi discovered. Al-Husayni is going in the same direction we are. But he is not coordinating with us because this will shower him with curses. This certifies that the opposition has succeeded in turning its words into deeds to the extent that the leaders who are living among the people are now obliged to take the popular stance into consideration in their areas, without having to pay much tribute to Tunis. The growth of these powers and figures will prompt us to bolster them and demand a popular referendum on the issues they raise. [Farran] Can 'Arafat rule democratically? [Al-Hasan] Personally, I do not believe the Palestinians are being offered a democratic rule. I therefore refuse to discuss the issue of Palestinian agricultural and industrial development as long as there is an occupation. I think that the most serious thing that the Palestinians were lured into was discussing these issues under occupation. For instance, elections will be held to guarantee democracy for the Palestinian people according to the Oslo agreement. I want elections that ensure my right to self-determination; I do not want elections for democracy. What kind of democracy is that exercised under occupation? Therefore, we have to focus on the central issue of ending the occupation before we discuss things like agricultural or industrial development. Development under occupation consecrates the idea of integration with the occupation. [Farran] You don't support the elections? [Al-Hasan] Elections under occupation will not achieve their goal. If the council that will be elected will only discuss the decisions referred to it, it will not be completely sovereign. I am not opposed to the principle of elections. I believe in democracy and in the people's right and their rule. I believe that an expanded parliament has the final say, but we must obtain sovereignty. I will not state my final view of the elections until after the elections law that is being discussed in Washington has been endorsed. If a party is deprived of participation in the elections because it was not a party to the Oslo talks, we will then state our stance on these undemocratic elections. This is because, as we have seen today, to be released from jail a detainee must sign a paper affirming his agreement on the Oslo talks and pledging not to carry out terrorist operations. So what is this independence, democracy, and freedom of expression? In this respect I support the appointment of all members of the Palestinian authority from inside [the occupied territories]. [Farran] You were threatened with dismissal from the Central Committee at its latest meeting in Amman. Have you prepared yourself for such a situation? [Al-Hasan] My dismissal was discussed and I was surprised at the number of those who defended me and rejected this measure against me inside the Central Committee. Since I enjoy this great support, there is no fear. I do not think of this issue. [Farran] Do you think of establishing a legal office as Hanan 'Ashrawi has done? [Al-Hasan] I greet my brothers in the Legal Committee that was formed by important figures. We have full confidence in them and that they will defend Palestinian human rights. [Farran] Can the self-rule authority control the contradictions in the situation and how? [Al-Hasan] We believe that it will not be able to control the situation because it is overlapping. The Israelis phased the negotiations to enmesh the Palestinian Authority in these contradictions so that they may impose new conditions because they do not want to leave the West bank. In addition, the size of the opposition inside [the occupied territories] is large and reaches 60 to 90 percent. [Farran] Which organizations inside [the occupied territories] are more embarrassing to Yasir 'Arafat? [Al-Hasan] Fatah first and then the Islamic trend represented in "Hamas" and "al-Jihad." Both these groups are organized and perform social work in addition to confronting the occupation. It is no coincidence that they managed to gain support from other forces. However, we will compete with them and try to restore our positions. Let the rivals compete. [Farran] If you believe that the concessions that 'Arafat has made violate the logic of the revolution and of Palestinian rights, do you think this justifies a call for his trial, given these concessions and the U.S. and Israeli statements that his personality is moody and unbalanced? [Al-Hasan] I will not answer this question because it is useless. [Farran] Do you believe that the United States has a replacement for 'Arafat? [Al-Hasan] I have no answer.
