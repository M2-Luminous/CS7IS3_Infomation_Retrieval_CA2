The aim of the meeting was to find an acceptable consensus on the issue of the so-called road-sign bill. At the last council meeting, representatives of Hungarian parties suggested that the list of villages with bilingual place-names include 13 villages named after Slovak personalities. Other members of the council disapproved of this proposal. The deputies' clubs of the coalition parties were to take a stance on the matter by today. Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik briefed journalists on the results of the meeting. Ivan Samel was present on behalf of Radiozurnal. [Samel] At the beginning of the briefing, Jozef Moravcik announced the result of the Coalition Council deliberations. Today, once again, its members failed to agree on a joint stance on the road-sign bill. They will discuss a possible course of future action on 17 June. The prime minister added: [Begin Moravcik recording] At present, it seems that it would be appropriate to submit the bill in the form that has been discussed and voted on [as heard], and, if 76 deputies sign this bill, we will submit it to parliament. It is not clear yet whether we will succeed. [end recording] [Samel] When speaking about 76 deputies, Moravcik is counting on the votes of all Hungarian representatives. He went on to say that the controversial 13 villages remain a stumbling block. According to the prime minister, it is unlikely that a consensus can be reached on this point. In the event that the representatives of the coalition parties fail to reach a joint stance and the bill fails to obtain the 76 votes needed for the road-sign bill to be adopted, the solution to this issue will remain the responsibility of the future parliament.
