The toll seems to be quite high, Christophe Boisbouvier: [Boisbouvier] Yes, according to several sources, this, the most violent clash in a year, took place in a village of 3,000 inhabitants, called (Tiama), in the Air mountains, about 200 Km north of Agades, on Monday afternoon. The army, equipped with machineguns, and a rebel unit of (Mohamed Anoko's) Popular Front for the Liberation of the Sahara were involved in the clash. The toll is not yet clearly established, but according to rebel sources 24 were killed on the government side and 16 on the rebel side, eight of them being killed after being captured, but it is impossible to confirm these figures at the moment. This incident looks as though it could relaunch the war in these mountains in northern Niger after several weeks of relative calm. However, the two sides appear to be still prepared to sit at the negotiating table, perhaps in Paris in mid-June. It is true that after the latest talks in Ouagadougou no cease-fire was concluded.
