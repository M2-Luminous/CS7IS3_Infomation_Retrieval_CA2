[Kozyrev] In Latvia, judging by everything, there has occurred a most flagrant provocation, perpetrated by armed representatives of the land guard [okhrana kraya], that is, the government forces. But today towards the end of the day we received an official apology via the Embassy of Russia which intervened in this situation and it is possible that it is a question of a provocation also against the line of the Latvian authorities themselves, the President. And the factual aspect is very simple and crude. These armed gangs surrounded and blockaded military facilities which they claim constitute a threat to Latvia, but which in actual fact involve a stadium, a swimming pool, and the residence of the Russian ambassador in Riga, which of course cannot in any way constitute a danger to anyone. The two generals which were sent by the Russian command in order to assess the situation on the scene were subjected to insulting behavior, virtually arrested, taken somewhere into the forest, subjected to threats, they were even handcuffed. This is absolutely impermissible, intolerable behavior towards representatives of the Russian Armed Forces which have been placed on heightened combat alert. The embassy immediately undertook measures to clear up the situation. And we must with all resoluteness warn that Russia will take all necessary measures to protect her citizens especially those in military or diplomatic uniform, indeed simply any of her citizens, from such attacks and once again I repeat, we expect, at a higher level, a more extensive explanation, apology, and punishment of those guilty for this incident.
