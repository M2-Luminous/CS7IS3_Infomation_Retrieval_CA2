[passage omitted] In a communique issued in Brussels, the "Zairian Opposition Committee of the Forces Supporting Change" (COFAZAC) condemns the complicity of some members of the international community and calls on the opposition to regroup around Etienne Tshisekedi, the prime minister elected by the CNS [Sovereign National Conference]. For its part, the USORAS (Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition)- Benelux thinks that "Zaire is at a crossroads faced with the delaying tactics of Mobutu and his men," and refers to "USORAS' right and duty to have an armed force for self-defense and the protection of the people."
