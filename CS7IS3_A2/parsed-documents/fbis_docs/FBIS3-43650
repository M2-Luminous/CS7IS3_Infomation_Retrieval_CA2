Good evening General. [Viljoen] Good evening. [Kruger] We have just heard that the Ciskei government is fully prepared to cooperate with the Transitional Executive Council. Can one infer from this that there is a split in the Freedom Alliance? [Viljoen] No, I don't think that we should regard this as a split. Brigadier Oupa Gqozo did meet with alliance leaders and he explained his position to us. He is in an unenviable position, in the sense that he is isolated and is experiencing pressure and threats from the government and the ANC [African National Congress]. What is obviously not a very level playing field is causing Brigadier Oupa Gqozo a lot of hardship. For example, he is pressured by his own officers, who say that they will not be integrated into a future defense force because the South African Defense Force told them that unless their leader decides to participate in the transitional councils, they will not be eligible for selection for the future defense force. So within the Ciskei there is this intense pressure on Brigadier Gqozo. He is in a very difficult position. He did explain it to us. It will probably be discussed at the forthcoming leadership meeting on Friday. [Kruger] Do you expect more parties to follow Ciskei's example? [Viljoen] No, I do not think so. I think a very clear stand has been taken by the Freedom Alliance. We have, without doubt, walked down the road of negotiations. Recently we declared that we are fully prepared to negotiate. We even said that if negotiations are successful and if everything goes well, then we will consider, if our controlling bodies approve, to participate in such an election -- in the process -- so I do not think there is any danger of people walking out. I think we should first see if we can solve the negotiations issue. As you know, we are a negotiating alliance and only when the negotiations issue is solved, then we will consider the possibility of forming a political or other alliance. [Kruger] General Viljoen, thank you.
