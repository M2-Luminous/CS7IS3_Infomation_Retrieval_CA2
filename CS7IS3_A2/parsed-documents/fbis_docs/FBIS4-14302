It is called the "declaration of principles" statement. The U.S. Administration submitted it for approval by the participating states during the multilateral negotiations steering committee meetings in Ottawa on 6 February. The proposed declaration lays the foundations for the shape of political and economic cooperations among Middle Eastern states. The meeting of the Gulf foreign ministries' experts was held to discuss developments in the multilaterals and the meetings of their five committees and ways of coordinating positions in this connection. The Sultanate of Oman last week hosted the meetings of the water committee arising from these negotiations. Qatar is scheduled to host the arms control committee meetings next Monday. And Bahrain has offered to host the environment committee meetings scheduled to held next fall. The GCC states showed interest in the draft "declaration of principles" proposed by the United States because of the clauses related to political conditions in Middle Eastern states and the future of relations among them; the declaration urges working "to develop a view of what the region will be like after the achievement of peace at the bilateral level, and to develop the regional institutions which the region might need." Gulf states are concerned that this statement might impose on it material and political obligations they do not need. This is why despite their participation in the meetings of the multilateral committees, they do not want any future obligations to be imposed on them. Hence the experts' meetings in Riyadh are important to the foreign ministers. As is known, Gulf experts for the multilaterals met on 26 March and sent a report containing their view to their foreign ministers during their meetings in the Saudi capital in the first week of this month. The ministers decided that the experts should meet again.
