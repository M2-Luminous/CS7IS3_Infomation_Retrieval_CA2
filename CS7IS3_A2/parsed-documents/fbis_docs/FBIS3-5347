Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON in a by-lined commentary says it is the scream of a fool reckless of his position. The paper continues: With the agreement on four immediate steps of simultaneous action for a package solution of the nuclear issue at the DPRK-USA contact in New York, a prospect that the peaceful solution process of the nuclear issue may be again on the right orbit has opened. The traitor Kim Yong-sam is trying to get rid of his secluded position by excusing himself for failing to participate in the DPRK-USA talks for a resolution to the nuclear issue. However, his attempt only betrays his ignorance of the outbreak of the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and the way of its solution. For a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue as well as improvement of the North-South relations, such a fool as the traitor Kim Yong-sam must be removed without delay.
