The recommendations state that there is no special need to restrict market entry into the class I communications industries currently covered by NTT and Shindenden "because enormous capital investment requirements preclude the easy entry of new participants merely for the purpose of acquiring vested rights." Keidanren will work with the government to provide for incorporation of its recommendations in the government's information-communication deregulation plan to be completed by the end of June. Keidanren also compiled an opinion paper concerning the construction of optical fiber cable networks in which the government is attempting initiatives which calls for "construction of optical fiber cable systems by private industry as a matter of principle" and for the government to provide assistance in the form of loans. It appears that the government's Electrical Communication Council will complete a report in June which calls for the government to play a central role in the building of an optical fiber cable network for use as a new information communication network.
