Auto and auto parts are at the center of ongoing bilateral talks on a new trade framework through which Washington aims to pry open Japan's markets to rectify the chronic bilateral trade imbalance. U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade Jeffrey Garten is leading the U.S. negotiating team, while Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister of international trade and industry for international affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs, are representing the Japanese side. The negotiations follow working-level talks held in Washington last week when the two sides failed to iron out differences over "quantitative criteria" demanded by the U.S. as a way to measure progress in opening markets. Japanese negotiators say the U.S. is not seeking binding targets, but it is still looking for quantitative standards on the number of dealers handling imported autos, and the import volume of autos and auto parts. They say Tokyo cannot accept any request that would bind any future action. The U.S. first demanded "numerical targets" to measure progress in market access, but dropped the demands to revive the framework talks which had been stalled since February when then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton failed to reach any market-opening agreements.
