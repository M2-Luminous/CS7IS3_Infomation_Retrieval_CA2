After talks with Douglas Hurd and Hikmet Cetin, his British and Turkish counterparts, Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel underlined in Ankara today Turkey's role as a factor for stability in the region. Kinkel and Hurd stressed Turkey's increasing importance as a country "on the border between Europe and Asia, between a disintegrating communism and an Islam that has regained strength." Turkey should therefore be supported in its regional role, which is important for the stabilization of conditions in the region, Kinkel said. Kinkel, who also met President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller as well as the national-liberal opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz, reminded Turkey to speedily implement the reform of the judicial system and improve the human rights situation. Turkey must conduct the struggle against the militant Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) in line with democracy and principles based on the rule of law. "We are not speaking with an admonishing finger, but with a well-disposed view of Turkey," Kinkel said. Cetin said Turkey is conducting the struggle against the PKK in line with democracy and human rights. He confirmed that Hurd and Kinkel also raised the situation of the Orthodox Christians in southeastern Turkey. "However, it is not Turkey but the PKK which drove the Christians out of their villages, and the Christians themselves are calling on us to help them return to their villages," Cetin said. Kinkel and Hurd confirmed their adherence to the inviolability of the borders of the states in the region. "What we want is not new states, but cultural autonomy for the Kurds to enable them to preserve and cultivate their identity," Kinkel said. He spoke in favor of supporting Turkey in overcoming its problems and bringing it closer to Europe as a politically, economically, and culturally important partner. Other topics in the trilateral meeting, which, according to Turkish information, will be repeated in London this year, were developments in the Caucasus and in the Balkans.
