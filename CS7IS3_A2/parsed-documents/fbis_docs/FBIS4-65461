Engelen: "The Balladur Government Is Resolutely Reducing the Influence of the State"] [Text] Paris, 14-15 May -- In an interview with HANDELSBLATT, French Economics and Finance Minister Edmond G. Alphandery said that at the next G-7 summit in Naples in several weeks, Russia, being the "greatest challenge of our time," will be the dominant topic. In his view, the medium-term strategy to restore stable economic growth that Germany and France have jointly pursued since the monetary crisis of August last year, has been successful. He said the new joint course between Bonn and Paris, which is aimed at stability and growth, has increasingly proved to be an important cyclical pillar for Europe and the world. His counterpart, Theo Waigel, is seeking a real growth for Germany of 1.5 percent. The French Government is expecting a real growth rate of 1.4 percent in 1994. These are "the stages of a German-French conversion program that are strictly being observed." The program -- with budget consolidation as its core -- was jointly presented and defended in Paris on 3 August last year, and was subsequently also expounded before the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers in Brussels. Colbert Has Been Dead for Many Years When the Balladur government took over government responsibility in April 1993, "the French economy was in the most serious postwar recession, with a reduction in overall economic output of 1.2 percent in real terms in the preceding six months and short-term interest rates of almost 11 percent in nominal terms and 8 percent in real terms," says Alphandery. The recovery in the German economy will also help France achieve the much higher growth rate of 2.7 percent in real terms fixed for 1995. According to Alphandery, economic recovery in France is attributable to various factors. In the second half of last year, exports improved by 4 percent. This year, industrial investment has increased between 3 and 4 percent, whereas in 1993, it decreased 15 percent. From July 1993 to January 1994, construction increased 40 percent. This year, between 30 and 40 percent more cars have so far been sold than last year. Short-term interest rates, which are less than 6 percent, have reached the lowest level in 20 years. Since the monetary crisis in the summer of 1993, the business barometer of French entrepreneurs has increased by 70 points. The image of French industry and banks being dominated by the state -- an image that still prevails in Germany and the Anglo-Saxon countries -- must be drastically revised. The economics and finance minister, who is assessed as a liberal and conservative politician, stresses that "Colbert has been dead in France for a very, very long time." First, a look at the privatization that the Balladur government has carried out is sufficient to put the facts right. In the past six months, the government implemented privatization projects totalling 100 billion French francs (almost 30 billion German marks). In view of the widely ramified holdings -- meaning secondary and tertiary privatization effects of former state-run concerns -- which are included in privatization, the state's influence at various levels of the French economic sector has been reduced. "Judging by the vehement criticism voiced by the Socialists, they have realized how successfully we have set the course in the direction of privatization." Second, the high capital influx to France indicates the country's continuous attractiveness for foreign investors. This could hardly be compatible "with a strangulating governmental influence." In 1992, Great Britain and France shared the top place among Western industrial nations. Third, analysts would be surprised if they compared the assets controlled by foreigners -- as measured by GNP. Neither Germany nor the United States, and even less so Japan, "could cite as high a share held by foreigners as France, which is open and must remain open." As in many other areas of international and European policy, "France and Germany are pulling together on the great task of supporting Russia in transition to democracy and the market economy." According to Alphandery, this is of crucial importance in the G7 and on the European stage. However, the French minister left it open whether the formal step to the "G-8" -- including Russia as another member in the club of the economically powerful countries -- could already be made at the summit in Naples. At the Naples summit, the heads of state and heads of government would also discuss in detail the labor market problems in the Western industrialized states, on the basis of the recommendations given at the Detroit employment summit. In this respect, Alphandery is amazingly optimistic: "Just as France must do more to overcome high youth unemployment, Germany continues to be confronted with the serious structural problems on the labor market in the new laender. I am optimistic that France and Germany will jointly master their specific structural weaknesses in the next few years through higher economic growth and a certain amount of flexibility and innovation." Bundesbank and Bonn Offended Alphandery, who has been in office for about a year, had a really unfortunate start, in particular in the relationship with Germany. By making awkward remarks on "planned steps to lower interest rates, that were coordinated with the Bundesbank," Balladur's new man for the Finance Ministry provoked sharp protests from the Bundesbank and his Bonn counterpart, Theo Waigel, and the unusual cancellation of a German-French meeting. After that, Alphandery made himself suspicious because he "had not been invited" to take part in crucial talks held by Waigel and Balladur at a critical stage during the European monetary turmoil early in August last year. Asked about his "wrong start," Alphandery reacts calmly: "I think there are many misunderstandings that I am eventually planning to clarify in a book. What is important, however, is that this period is over. We, Waigel and I, with the support of Larosiere (the former president of the Banque de France) and Trichet (chief of the Treasury), did a very good job in August. We made the right decision by widening the bands in the European Monetary System. I coordinated the measure closely with Balladur. We had a long talk in the Matignon on Sunday morning. Subsequently, we had difficult negotiations in the afternoon and evening."
