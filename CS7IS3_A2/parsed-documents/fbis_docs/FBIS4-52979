He said the PHWR in Wolsong which the South Korean puppets claim to be a "commercial" reactor and the multi-purpose research reactor in the Taedok complex which they call a "research" reactor were designed to develop nuclear weapons. "The Buddhists, who consider killing as the blackest crime against mankind and peace as the greatest charity, will never tolerate their nuclear arms development for plunging the nation into a nuclear disaster," he declared. "The KBF Central Committee calls on the Korean Buddhists in the South and overseas to actively join in the struggle for checking the South Korean puppets' nuclear arms development and getting the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons withdrawn from South Korea, thus fully discharging the mission and duty of Buddhists, who consider avoiding sin of killing any living creature most important in the Buddhist commandments.
