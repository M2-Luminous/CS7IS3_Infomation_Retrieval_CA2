One of the main reasons is purely economical. In plain language, 'there is nothing in it for NATO members.' After NATO, led by U.S. forces, attacked the Iraqis and expelled them from Kuwait, U.S.-based multinational corporations got the lion's share of the lucrative contracts awarded by Kuwait for rebuilding that country. Other Western countries, depending on the pecking order, also claimed their share of the spoils of that war. Crude oil has existed under the Kuwaiti desert for thousands of years. Luckily, this precious commodity does not spoil even if left underground for many more centuries. When U.S.-led forces liberated Kuwait, the country was devastated but its wealth was almost intact prompting Western politico-military investment in its liberation. Bosnia-Herzegovina has also been totally devastated, but in contrast to Kuwait, it has no natural resources to speak of, ergo the Western delaying tactics in evicting the aggressors from this beleaguered and newly independent country. The West, following one of the basic tenets of Capitalism and applying its usual double standards, considers the cost of its involvement in the Bosnian-Serb crisis to be too high and its financial rewards too little to make it worthwhile. However, in order to keep up appearances in world forums, the West has to find a way of wiggling out this mess without accepting any blame. This is where the Russian factor comes into play. The United States introduced the Russian trump card exactly at the juncture when the world public opinion demanded UN-NATO action to end Serbian aggression against Bosnia. All of a sudden Russia had to be brought into the NATO decision-making process. The United States and its allies insist that there can be no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina unless the Russians are allowed to participate in NATO's plans to end the Serbo-Bosnian war. This logic indicates that the West considers Russia, despite its diminished stature, to be an important military power deserving of being included in the resolution of global conflicts. However, when the U.S.-led UN forces attacked the Iraqi army, the opposition of the all powerful Soviet Union was totally ignored by the U.S. and its allies. Russia, for its own domestic reasons, needs to pretend that it is still the same menacing `bear' it used to be before it disintegrated. But the successors to the Communist Empire must realize that by promoting the Serbian `cause' they are playing right into the hands of the Western political puppeteers who plan to sit this war out and blame their inaction on Russia's opposition to the use of force against the Serbs. Russia must realize that if it allows itself to be used as an excuse for Western duplicity in Bosnia, it will do irreparable damage to its already fragile relations with Muslim countries and their more than one billion collective population.
