Also today, representatives from the Freedom Alliance which won last month's elections -- Forza Italia, National Alliance and Northern League -- began meetings to hammer out a consensus for new speakers for the Senate and House, which will be seated on Friday. Speaking to an assembly of Forza Italia candidates elected to parliament, held in the spa town Fiuggi outside Rome, Berlusconi said "I absolutely want to separate the private interests I have as shareholder in Fininvest from the public activities I will perform in the interests of all." Berlusconi and his family own total control of his holding conglomerate Fininvest which has interests in such areas as broadcasting and the printed media, publishing, advertising, insurance, money management, insurance, retail outlets and the first division soccer team AC Milan. Answering press questions on the compatibility of his business and public interests, Berlusconi replied "We have no problems about examining this question. A law (already) exists which deals with this problem very precisely, only no one has brought it up, except for some members of the press." "We have no problem reopening the question," the Forza Italia leader continued, "but it is not easy, given that we are dealing with 40 thousand people, put together through a creative and business effort of over 30 years. There can be no quick answers," Berlusconi added, "although one answer has already been given, concerning the separation of my interests in the activities of Fininvest, from which I have already stepped down. We are now examining how to best offer guarantees for this matter." After stating how experts in international law and antitrust regulations had been given the task of finding a solution, Berlusconi turned his attention to speculation that parts of his empire were to be sold off. "There are certain areas of Fininvest which could be sold if the opportune offer were made. But one cannot make public the content of any such offer for this would diminish." The "blind trust" formula is practiced by American businessmen who take public office. The subject declares all his or her interests which are then placed in a trust fund to be administered independently by an especially appointed board which, while proposed by the subject, must be approved by federal authorities. Turning his attention to the issue of federalism, Berlusconi recalled how "Before the elections we ascertained the need to decentralize the state administration. After the elections, the League exerted pressure on us to make a commitment to change the constitution in the federal sense. From the start we have voiced out openness on the question and have requested information on it from the League. Our position has not changed since then.... We are open to what is in the interests of the nation." Looking towards the next Italian government, Berlusconi was careful to recall how a mandate must first be given by head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, and then stressed how the winning alliance represented a break with the past, a break he would personally guarantee if given the government mandate. The man most seen as the next premier then went on to reiterate how his would be a government which holds the central ground of the political spectrum, which could see support from the center-right but also the center-left. The first step towards a new government will the election in parliament, to be seated on Friday, for the speakers of the Senate and Lower House and while Berlusconi was in Fiuggi, his representative met with their counterparts from the winning alliance to discuss candidates. For the Senate, where the Forza Italia-led coalition does not hold an absolute majority, the current speaker, Giovanni Spadolini, is considered by many to be the front-runner. His candidacy, however, is opposed by the Northern League of Umberto Bossi, which wants its outgoing Senate whip, Francesco Speroni, to take the chair. Spadolini is considered by observers to be an "institutional" solution, one which neither Forza Italia nor the National Alliance oppose. Coming out of today's meeting, Raffaele Costa of the Centrist Union told the press "We believe conditions exist for the speakers of the House and Senate to be from the (government) majority and decided upon on Saturday." Costa, the outgoing transport minister and secretary of the Liberal Party, went on to confirm Speroni's candidacy but would not rule out other names. For the House, Costa expressed his preference for fellow Liberal Alfredo Biondi and reiterated how, in any case, the next speaker would be from the winning alliance. Political discussion today also looked at the possibility of Radical Marco Pannella's group joining the future government coalition and Pannella, who failed to win election, even being appointed as foreign minister. His candidacy was not frowned upon by the Northern League, with Number Two Roberto Maroni recalling how the League had originally proposed Pannella as foreign minister because of his staunch federalist views. The idea of Pannella as foreign minister is opposed by the National Alliance, with its leader, Gianfranco Fini, also taking a dim view of the League taking over the Interior Ministry.
