Compared to carbon fibers made from acrylonitrile or viscose, these fibers are made from a low cost and readily available source using an effective fiber-forming method (from a melt) and an ecologically clean method of production of the carbon fiber at high (75-80 percent) product yield, and the possibility of developing a fully mechanized technological stream of high unit capacity. A simple and effective method for activating carbon fibers made from pitch has been developed under laboratory conditions. An experimental set-up, developed for studying the dynamic characteristics of the sorption process on activated fibers, was used to study the porosity of the fibers (pore volume, specific surface, and pore size distribution). Based on this study, the process was optimized for producing sorbent samples capable of sorbing up to 600 mg benzene per gram of fiber. Pore size of the samples did not exceed 35 Angstroms, the average being 10-15 Angstroms. The fiber has a strong activity towards both polar and non-polar substances: benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, acetone, and ethyl cellosolve. The goal of further research will focus on the development of a technological process for activating carbonaceous materials made from pitch and its related equipment design.
