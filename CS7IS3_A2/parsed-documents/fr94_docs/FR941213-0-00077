FR941213-0-00077 FR941213-0-00018 While NHTSA believes the statute gives the agency ample discretion to determine that glazing parts are ``major parts,'' it has concluded that the cost of such marking would make the cost per vehicle of marking parts likely to exceed the statutory maximum. An important rationale for NHTSA's proposal in the NPRM to require marking of glazing parts was that it perceived the cost of marking glazing as relatively low, when considering the lower theft rates shown in certain vehicles with marked glazing. 49 U.S.C. 33105(a) limits the per vehicle cost of parts marking to $15 (in 1984 dollars). In 1993 dollars, the per vehicle costs of marking may not exceed $20.86 (see 59 FR 8021, February 17, 1994). Since the experience of Prospective Technologies appeared to show that marking of glazing would cost about $5.00 per vehicle, NHTSA believed that even if it specified marking of glazing parts, the per vehicle cost of marking would not exceed $20.86. The public comments, however, questioned whether marking of glazing could be done for as little as $5.00 per vehicle. GM noted that marking glazing would add approximately $6.25 to the cost of marking each GM vehicle, ``nearly doubling'' the per vehicle costs of parts marking. GM further noted that the $6.25 costs do not include items such as accidental glass breakage or glass replacement due to inadvertent VIN error, or the costs of stencil cutter maintenance or stencil cutter replacement. Although Toyota did not provide specific dollar figures, it stated the $5.00 per vehicle cost of marking glazing was not feasible, and that ``it is certain'' that the cost increase to mark Toyota lines would be more than $15.00. Nissan, the company which manufactures the Nissan 300ZX, whose windows were marked by Prospective Technologies, estimated that the current costs of marking vehicle parts (not including glazing) is between $14 to $20. In contrast to Prospective's figure of $5.00 per vehicle, Nissan estimated that the present cost of marking glazing on its 300ZX line (at the port of entry, and using a chemical treatment process) is $25.00 per vehicle. Volkswagen stated that the 1990 cost of marking a Volkswagen vehicle was 25.02 Deutsche marks, or approximately $15.77, to label all parts, except for the engine and transmission. NHTSA notes that if the cost of inflation since 1990, the cost of marking the engine and transmission, and (using Prospective Technologies' figure of $5.00 per vehicle) the cost to mark glazing were all added to the $15.77 figure, Volkswagen's cost of marking a vehicle would exceed the $20.86 limit specified in section 33105(a). Based on the public comments received, NHTSA believes specifying glazing parts as major parts, may make the costs of parts marking for some manufacturers exceed the $20.86 limit specified in section 33105(a). Additionally, Ford noted that windows are rarely stolen as replacement parts. NADA stated there is no evidence in the record suggesting that vehicles are stolen for their glazing materials. Thus, in this final rule, NHTSA is not specifying any glazing as a ``major part'' under 49 CFR 541.5(a). 4. Parts Marking of Non-High-Theft Lines Ford disagreed with the agency over how to distribute vehicle lines between appendix A (high-theft lines) and the new appendix B (non-high-theft lines that must now be marked). In Ford's view, appendix B should include up to half of the vehicle lines that fall below the median, regardless of whether such lines had previously been listed in appendix A. The agency had proposed to exclude from appendix B any below-median vehicle line that had been previously listed in appendix A, and to base appendix B on up to half of the remaining below-median vehicle lines. Under Ford's proposed method, up to 54 car lines would be listed in appendix B, but many of these would be lines already included in appendix A and therefore already required to have their parts marked. Under the agency's method, 28 vehicle lines were proposed to be listed in appendix B, none of which had previously had their parts marked. After considering Ford's comment, NHTSA has concluded that the agency's proposed method carries out ACTA's purpose more faithfully than does Ford's method. As codified, section 33103(a) directs the marking of parts on ``not more than 50 percent of the lines not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines.'' Section 33104, in turn, states that vehicle lines that were subject to marking under the pre-ACTA law (i.e., the lines listed in appendix A) continue to be subject to the requirements of the section. Read together, the provisions support the agency's view that vehicle lines previously listed in appendix A should continue to be listed in that appendix and not in appendix B. The agency has adopted the procedure as proposed and has determined the vehicle lines in appendix B accordingly. However, Ford's comments have caused NHTSA to reexamine the lines it proposed for inclusion in appendix B. The agency found 6 vehicle lines placed in the bottom quartile of the 1990/91 final theft data. The 6 lines, the Ford Aerostar and Explorer, the General Motors Oldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser, the Volvo 240 and 940, and the Volkswagen Audi 80/90, will be removed from appendix B. NHTSA will also remove the Daihatsu Rocky MPV from appendix B, since the Rocky is no longer sold in the United States. The final rule lists the 21 remaining vehicle lines. 5. Definition of ``1990/91 Median Theft Rate'' In addition to the foregoing, NHTSA proposed to include a definition of ``1990/91 median theft rate.'' Based on 231 vehicle lines, the 1990/91 median theft rate was 3.5826 thefts per thousand vehicles produced. Since NHTSA received no comments on ``1990/91 median theft rate,'' it is adopting the definition proposed in the NPRM.
