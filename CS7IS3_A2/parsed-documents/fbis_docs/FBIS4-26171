Other Chinese Communist Party and government officials, including vice-premiers Zou Jiahua and Li Lanqing, took part in the meeting. Instructions from Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the current flood control and relief work were passed on at the meeting. Participants also listened to reports about the present anti- flood and relief work from departments such as the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Meteorological Station. In April and May, serious floods occurred in east China's Jiangxi and Fujian provinces, and in central China's Hunan Province. Entering June, the most serious floods were reported to have occurred on the Xijiang River of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Beijiang River in south China's Guangdong Province and Xiangjiang River in Hunan Province. A large number of areas have been affected. Premier Li said the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council were paying close attention to the flood situations in these areas. Party and government departments of all levels in the affected areas are all mobilizing the cadres and ordinary citizens, the Chinese [People's] Liberation Army men and the armed policemen to help prevent and control floods, as well as to provide relief in disaster-hit areas. To make a success of flood control and disaster relief work, the meeting has also decided to send special working groups, formed by Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, Wen jiabao, member of the secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, and State Councillor Chen Junsheng, to join local officials, army men and local people in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan and Jiangxi in flood control and disaster relief work. The Chinese premier stressed that the priority of current flood control work should be to guarantee the safety of the grand embankment along the Beijiang River and embankment projects in Zhujiang (Pearl) River delta, to rescue residents besieged by floods as quickly as possible, and to ensure that people in flood-hit areas have enough to eat and wear and to prevent epidemics breaking out. The premier also urged local officials to help people to resume production as soon as possible and rebuild their communities. The flood control work of this year has just begun and the main flood season starts in late July and early August, while serious droughts were also reported to have hit some other areas, said the premier, urging that different localities must be well prepared for major floods and the most serious droughts.
