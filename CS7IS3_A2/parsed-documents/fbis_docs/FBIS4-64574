Is this upswing not coming too early? Reforms might not take place because the pressure is easing off. [Hax] We cannot hope for stagnation to continue just to force us to do what is necessary. We must also be capable of introducing painful reforms during more prosperous times. In times of incipient recovery, the labor market will keep reminding people to do their homework. Nobody can ignore 4 million unemployed. [Reiermann] Who will have to stay in to do their homework? [Hax] The state has a lot of catching up to do. It has to tackle budget consolidation at all levels with much more determination. What is missing is a reliable indicator of when tax breaks will be introduced -- for the taxpayer in general and for companies in particular. This can be done in spite of the public spending deficit, if only saving is taken seriously. In addition, the state should do more deregulating and privatizing. [Reiermann] Are you content with the wage round partners? [Hax] Companies and trade unions have acted in a responsible manner this year. This must be continued by all means, even if the economy picks up again. [Reiermann] Trimming in prosperous times? [Hax] This is difficult. The trade unions in particular should realize that they cannot simply demand compensation later for the present cutbacks. One thing must be clear to everybody: The employment level depends on the wage level. [Reiermann] Companies seem to have achieved the biggest progress. [Hax] That is right. But so far, companies have only dealt with the destructive part of structural changes: severe cuts in costs and jobs. Now we need the creative part. [Reiermann] What does that mean? [Hax] They must set the course for future-oriented growth, develop new products, open up new markets. [Reiermann] But this can only work if the framework conditions are right. [Hax] Sure, otherwise production moves. In this case, Germany would no longer export products, but jobs.
