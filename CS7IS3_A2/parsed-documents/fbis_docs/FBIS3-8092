[Gligorov] We discussed the more general problems of the Balkans and above all our confrontation with Greece! The problems caused us by the Greek trade blockade. I must note with satisfaction that the German Government was absolutely categorical about the illegal nature of these measures and the dangers they pose for stability in the region. At this point, I would like to thank German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel for the relevant remarks that he recently made in Athens... [Kharvalias] Have you gotten any specific commitments of political or economic support from the German side? [Gligorov] First of all, we noted our mutual desire to strengthen bilateral relations, particularly economic and trade relations, as well as technical aid. However, we did not discuss any specific plan for economic support by Bonn. We pointed out once again the stated desire by the German side to help the "Republic of Macedonia." [passage omitted] [Kharvalias] However, it appeared last spring that Greece and Skopje, with the exception of the name, had reached a significant rapprochement--a compromise on the emblems, the flag, and so forth. What has happened since then? [Gligorov] After the adoption of the relevant Security Council resolution, which was a particularly positive development, there were exceptionally useful discussions at the United Nations under the auspices of Cyrus Vance and David Owen. I believe that substantive progress was made at those talks, there was a substantive rapprochement between the two sides. But after that, the elections were held in Greece, the negotiations stopped and later, instead of resuming them as would be natural, the new Greek Government announced their suspension! Moreover, it set the three well-known conditions! I believe this is not a creative approach for two neighboring countries such as Greece and "Macedonia," which are not facing very serious problems. Instead of understanding, we have a unilateral embargo without a Security Council decision having been made in advance as was the case with Serbia. I must stress that we have not resorted to any countermeasure and so far people and goods from Greece enter our territory without any restrictions. [Kharvalias] But Greece is the only country that guarantees your territorial integrity. What are you doing as a goodwill gesture? [Gligorov] But we have made goodwill gestures! We have amended our Constitution with a clause that says that we do not have territorial claims against any of our neighbors and, moreover, we added the provision that we will never interfere in the internal affairs of neighboring countries. In addition, even in my recent letter to Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou I stated that we are prepared to sign a treaty with Greece on the inviolability of borders which, if necessary, could be guaranteed by the European Union and/or the United Nations! I remind you that during the former embargo by the Konstandinos Mitsotakis administration we did not resort to countermeasures. We do not have the slightest intention to take reprisals against neighboring Greece. We merely view the whole situation with regret because we seek friendly relations with Greece and the Greek people. [passage omitted] [Kharvalias] By any chance did Alternate German Foreign Minister Helmut Schaefer urge you to make another goodwill gesture toward the Greek side? [Gligorov] We were not given such advice or recommendation. I believe that most of the European Union ministers realize that we have already made many concessions. The dialogue will have to begin at some time. [Kharvalias] When was your latest contact with a Greek politician? [Gligorov] I am very sorry because I have never had any contacts with Greek politicians, although at the first moment of the crisis I sent a letter to Athens for a meeting with then Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis. I have never received any answer. [passage omitted]
