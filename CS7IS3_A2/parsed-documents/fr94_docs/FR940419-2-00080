The device is indicated for daily wear for the correction of visual acuity in not-aphakic persons with nondiseased eyes that are myopic or hyperopic. The lens may be worn by persons who may exhibit astigmatism of 2.50 diopters or less that does not interfere with visual acuity. The tinted lens contains the color additive listing provisions of 21 CFR 74.3206. In accordance with the provisions of section 515(c)(2) of the act as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, this premarket approval application (PMA) was not referred to the Ophthalmic Devices Panel, an FDA advisory panel, for review and recommendation because the information in the PMA substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by this panel. On January 24, 1994, CDRH approved the application by a letter to the applicant from the Acting Director of the Office of Device Evaluation, CDRH. A summary of the safety and effectiveness data on which CDRH based its approval is on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and is available from that office upon written request. Requests should be identified with the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.

A petitioner may request either a formal hearing under part 12 (21 CFR part 12) of FDA's administrative practices and procedures regulations or a review of the application and CDRH's action by an independent advisory committee of experts. A petition is to be in the form of a petition for reconsideration under ยง10.33(b) (21 CFR 10.33(b)). A petitioner shall identify the form of review requested (hearing or independent advisory committee) and shall submit with the petition supporting data and information showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact for resolution through administrative review. After reviewing the petition, FDA will decide whether to grant or deny the petition and will publish a notice of its decision in the Federal Register . If FDA grants the petition, the notice will state the issue to be reviewed, the form of review to be used, the persons who may participate in the review, the time and place where the review will occur, and other details. Petitioners may, at any time on or before May 19, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) two copies of each petition and supporting data and information, identified with the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received petitions may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. This notice is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 515(d), 520(h) (21 U.S.C. 360e(d), 360j(h))) and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (21 CFR 5.53).
