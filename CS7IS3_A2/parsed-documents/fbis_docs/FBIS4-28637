Carter is visiting the two Koreas as head of his private peace center. He meets with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and President Kim Yong-sam before passing through the heavily fortified truce village of Panmunjom into the North Wednesday [15 June]. He is expected to meet North Korean leader Kim Il-song, who is reportedly waiting for Carter to deliver a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton on his proposal for defusing the current nuclear tensions. The former president will return to Seoul June 18 via Panmunjom and hold a press conference before heading back to the United States the same day. Carter goes to Pyongyang as the U.N. Security Council prepares to circulate a U.S.-drafted resolution seeking punitive sanctions against the communist state for reneging on nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
