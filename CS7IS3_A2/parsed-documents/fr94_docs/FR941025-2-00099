FR941025-2-00099 FR941025-2-00063 The Company requested that the Department review its certification for workers of the subject firm. New information from the company shows worker separations at various field offices in several states. The findings show that workers at Billerica, Brighton and Lawrence produced the same adversely affected product_computers. Other findings show that some of the workers at Billerica transferred to Brighton or Lawrence, Massachusetts. The findings show nearly a 3-month coverage gap that prevents workers who transferred from Billerica to Brighton or Lawrence from collecting TAA if they were separated during the coverage gap. The intent of the certification is to include all the workers at Bull HN Information Systems who were adversely affected by increased imports of computers, including workers in the various field offices. Accordingly, the Department is terminating TAA coverage for workers filing under TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,860 and TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,860A and including them under TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,522ZA and TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,522ZB, respectively. The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,522 is hereby issued as follows: All workers of Bull HN Information Systems, Inc., Billerica, Massachusetts; Lawrence, Massachusetts and Brighton, Massachusetts and at various field offices in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin engaged in employment related to the production of computers who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after February 4, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974. I further determine that certifications TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,860 and TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,860A are terminated effective October 11, 1994, because the workers are covered under TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,522ZA and TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,522ZB effective October 11, 1994. Signed at Washington, DC, this 17th day of October 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
