While roads are getting wider and skyscrapers are rising higher, trees and lawns are becoming rare in this capital of south Guangdong Province. Even kapok, the city flower that once bloomed into a beautiful vision of red all over Guangzhou, is taking a good search to find. Sources from the city bureau of parks and woods said the number of kapoks totals a mere 1,200 in the old town. Most of them are in streets and lanes too out-of-the-way to be seen by visitors. The expansion of Dongfeng Road is regarded as one of the biggest and most successful projects in urban construction. It now runs from the east to the west end of the city and makes traffic much smoother. However, walking, cycling or driving right under the scorching summer sun seems to be as irritating as sitting in the bygone traffic jams, and makes citizens long for the cool shadow of the trees that had lined the road for more than 25 years. The sources said that more than one-third of the trees in the old town have disappeared in road expansion works in the past few years. Experts from the bureau complained that the government and city planners seem to regard trees and lawns as mere decorative touches that can be easily obliterated whenever they come into conflict with construction. For nearly ten years, the city's annual spending on the green cause has stagnated between two to three million yuan, which falls far short of a reasonable necessity, the experts claimed. Considering that many Chinese cities are facing the same problem, the experts urged that China's city planners and officials should learn more from their foreign counterparts, and give more space to green land in the concrete jungle. The experts estimate that Guangzhou will need to invest over 500 million yuan before it can provide each citizen with five square meters of green land, as it plans. Understanding that the city government alone can hardly supply all of the money, the experts called for all sectors of society to take actions before the green deficit becomes a green crisis.
