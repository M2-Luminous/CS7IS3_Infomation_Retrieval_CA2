Horn said that raising the idea of a future liberal-conservative coalition does not show any political foresight. In his view, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is not in danger of finding itself in quarantine and it will find coalition partners if it achieves good results at the elections. [Szombathy] According to our information, on 3 January, you talked to Miklos Nemeth for two and a half hours, and the dilemmas of his political return were the topic of the conversation. [Horn] It is true that we held a long discussion with Nemeth. We agreed that we would soon jointly inform the public on the result of our consultation. [Szombathy] Is it correct to assume that your joint statement will end the speculations over his possible return to Hungary? [Horn] Presumably, yes. [Szombathy] It is not the first time it has been suggested, and not only by [Federation of Young Democrats, FIDESZ, Chairman] Viktor Orban, that the MSZP should again be refused the chance to form a coalition in 1994 by the parties of the former Opposition Roundtable. In your view, after four years, what are the chances of isolating the MSZP, which certainly appears to be on the rise? [Horn] If I took the suggestions of Orban and others seriously, then I would also like to ask some questions. For example, the liberal parties have very strongly criticized the government's policy over the past four years; in fact, many of their prominent representatives stated that this executive power should be replaced in 1994. In this case, how do they imagine new cooperation with the government parties? How seriously are we to take everything that they have said over the past four years? In the event of cooperation of this type, the two liberal parties would join in some kind of continuity with the current coalition: If this is so, then they will have to explain this to their own supporters and voters. Why were the other two parties of the liberal bloc left out of this assumed alliance? It was the FIDESZ that said that the liberal coalition of four parties would be able to win the elections. Finally: Is it really so important for them to get into power by all means? In my view, these plans, which even preceded the calling of the elections, are distasteful. We can hear little about the program that the liberals want to implement. The remaining four months will be a serious challenge to the country: Raising this kind of proposal at this moment does not show political foresight. [Szombathy] Is there a real danger to the MSZP in this kind of possible "quarantine attempt"? Can a more or less united bloc be established to oppose the MSZP? [Horn] We ended the previous regime four years ago and the MSZP played an important role in this. In democracies, parties do not normally get excluded from cooperation; this is usually done in dictatorships. I do not wish to make predictions, but it will be very difficult for the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and the FIDESZ to cooperate without losing their own political image. The leaders of the SZDSZ are much more cautious in their statements on this issue; presumably their views will become clearer by the time of the elections. For me, the important question is whether the liberals can agree on the social and economic issues that are important for the country. [Szombathy] Do you expect that, in the event of an MSZP victory at the elections, the other political forces will firmly refuse to form a government with the Socialists ? [Horn] A kind of evolution has taken place in the way in which the parliamentary parties treat the MSZP: At first, they were condescending toward us, then they spoke about a left-wing danger, and now they are alarming the electors by saying that it is a waste of time to vote for the Socialists because the MSZP would not become a part of the government anyway. In my view, if we achieve a good election result, we will find coalition partners among the current parliamentary parties. I do not think that we will be short of coalition partners. In my view, the important issue is what kind of agreement can be made with the partners as regards the government's tasks. The current nervousness comes from the danger of losing power on one side and from the hope of gaining it on the other. The MSZP is not suffering from either of these illnesses. [Szombathy] Do you consider it a possibility that the MSZP will be forced to turn down the mandate to form a government? [Horn] I do not deal with this issue. In January 1994, I find it early and somewhat comical to talk about forming coalitions. The MSZP does not want to commit itself on possible coalition partners or its prime minister candidate. [Szombathy] According to some people, one of the reasons that you have not named anyone as your prime minister candidate is that the MSZP does not really have any "marketable" prominent people apart from yourself. [Horn] An increasing number of prominent politicians are appearing in the party; I could mention at least eight to 10 names. Unfortunately, the opposition is in a difficult position in presenting its politicians on Hungarian Television, which has the greatest effect. [Szombathy] Failing all else, can we arrive at a situation where the MSZP names [SZDSZ Parliamentary Group Leader] Gabor Kuncze as its nominee? [Horn] I would like to affirm that Gabor Kuncze will not be our prime minister candidate. Whether the MSZP will support Kuncze after the elections is a different issue. It is also to be seen whom, in case of a certain result, the SZDSZ would support for prime minister from the Socialists.... We will draw up our national list in February, but we would not like to commit ourselves to anyone. The country is bound to have a coalition government. For us, it is not a key issue that the leader of the new cabinet should come from the MSZP. The structure of the new government must not be decided by loyalty to a party. I do not exclude the possibility that the next prime minister will not be a leading party politician. [Szombathy] Does this mean that we can be certain that you will not nominate a prime minister until the elections? [Horn] Nothing is certain in politics. However, there are no rules that say that the leader of the national list has to be a candidate at the same time. We will maintain our current view on this issue and I do not think that the sensible public will fail to understand this. [Szombathy] The view can often be heard that the MSZP is not at all interested in getting into government. Is it possible that you will be a constructive opposition with a 20 to 25 percent result? [Horn] We do not want to get into government by any means: We would not participate in a coalition that does not agree on certain basic economic and political issues, and does not state that people living on wages and salaries cannot be burdened forever with the costs of the changes. However, it was probably our opponents who concocted the story that we are not seriously thinking of taking on a governmental role: All serious parties work to this end. The new government will only have a chance to fulfill its four-year term if it seeks ways for social reconciliation. [Szombathy] MSZP members often say that stability can only be preserved if the left wing and the trade unions are involved in power. In your view, would a left-wing opposition increase the chances of a government crisis? [Horn] The new executive will definitely have to come to an agreement with the trade unions. The left wing, which fosters the best relations with them, has the best chance to do this. However, our relations will probably have their problems. [Szombathy] The MSZP's popularity is increasing. The question is, how much will your individual candidates be able to achieve, coming from different strata of society and entering into the competition from different backgrounds. A larger parliamentary group can also expect conflicts similar to those of the MDF.... [Horn] It is certain that people whom we do not welcome have also appeared around the party, but the party's leadership was not able to influence the selection of the candidates. However, I am not aware of any nominations where the expertise and honesty of the candidate was not taken into consideration. I can only welcome such a broad range of people. Presumably, after the elections, the MSZP's group of deputies will be much larger: The professional structure of the parliamentary group will be important. Naturally, the number of conflicts increases in a larger community. It is a lie to claim that there are any people at all among our candidates who returned as former leaders after turning their backs on politics in 1990.
