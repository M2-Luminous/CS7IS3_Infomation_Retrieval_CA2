It is common knowledge that the CBM's package, mainly the question of the resettlement of Maras [Varosha] and the reopening of Nicosia International Airport to passenger and cargo traffic, has been the priority issue on the UN representatives' agenda for some time. The list of CBM's that the UN Secretariat submitted to the two sides in Cyprus in 1993 contains 12 other measures in addition to those on Maras and Nicosia International Airport, measures which call, among other things, for cooperation to improve water resources, equal use of foreign aid by the two sides, and cooperation to improve health services and the protection of the environment. The introduction of the CBM's package brought to light various shortcomings in the effort that was required to realize it. A group of UN experts studied the situation in Maras and Nicosia International Airport and drew up reports to remove the shortcomings. Their reports clarified to a certain extent the benefits the two sides stand to gain from the opening of Maras and Nicosia International Airport. Although their reports failed to fully satisfy the technical questions the Turkish Cypriot side had put to the UN Secretariat earlier, it is a clear fact that they should have been regarded as an important resource for the effort that was made for a reconciliation between the two sides on the matter. However, it is common knowledge that the Greek Cypriot side said that the reports are not binding on them in any way and that they refuse to agree to have them either added to the CBM's package or converted into official UN documents. Obviously, the Greek Cypriot side's approach has had a negative impact on the effort made to clarify administrative, political, and technical matters related to the implementation of the package. We Agree in Principle To Maintain the Talks The Turkish Cypriot side informed the UN secretary general some time ago that it agreed in principle to hold talks on Maras and Nicosia International Airport. In his letter to the sides dated 3 February 1994, the UN secretary general welcomed their decision to agree in principle to discuss the package and called for the commencement of talks to prepare the modalities [previous word in English] required for the implementation of the measures. The points the UN secretary general urged the sides to keep in mind during that process are as follows: 1. Neither of the sides will move with the intention of establishing political advantage over the other. 2. The sides will remain committed to the stipulations of the package. 3. Initiatives that may obstruct the realization of the package will be avoided. 4. The package will not be regarded as a substitute for a comprehensive agreement. Consequently, the two sides moved to hold talks on the modalities. A seven-point list of provisions was drawn up during the contacts the UN officials held with the two sides early in February. The list would later be regarded as the agenda of the indirect talks. It was related to matters such as the UN administration in Maras and travel to and from that area, the timing of the transfer of Maras to UN officials and the reopening of Nicosia International Airport, conversion of Maras into a special trade and contact area, establishment of rights related to flights to and from Nicosia International Airport, establishment of security for operations in that airport, entry and exit of passengers and cargo, and the implementation of the other UN measures. As I briefly mentioned earlier, the other CBM's were outlined in 12 points, that is, other than those related to Maras and Nicosia International Airport. The objective of the indirect talks, which were initiated by Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative, on 17 February, was to have the two sides agree on the way the CBM's package should be realized. It will be recalled that the UN secretary general submitted a report to the UN Security Council informing it that the positions of the two sides were established through the contacts that were made with them from January to March and that the UN representatives would make suggestions to them for the implementation of the items on the agenda of the talks. Acting in accordance with the UN secretary general's report, Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's assistant special envoy, submitted draft suggestions and a paper, which was described as a non-document, on 9 and 21 March. The assessment that was made of the documents revealed that the reports that were drawn up by the UN experts on Maras and Nicosia International Airport were not regarded as a resource as a result of the Greek Cypriot side's pressure, a deviation was made from the essence of the original CBM's package to satisfy Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis and the Greek Cypriot side, a deviation in the form of additions to the CBM's package, and various elements in the original package were overlooked. For example, the gains referred to in Paragraph 44 in the UN secretary general's report, dated 1 July 1993, were not included in the non-document. That showed that the reference that was made to them was merely words. While elements were introduced to satisfy Mr. Kliridhis and the Greek Cypriot side, only a number of superficial promises were made on the question of the registration of the Turkish Cypriot side's economic gains and evident rights. Meanwhile, it was observed that even those promises were conditional. That development created a new situation which failed to satisfy the criteria on equality and simultaneous benefits, on which the Turkish Cypriot side has maintained a sensitive approach right from the beginning. Obviously, the inclusion of additional elements within the framework of the talks in order to satisfy the Greek Cypriot side will create a difficult situation in the negotiations process. The Turkish Cypriot side cannot be held responsible for the present situation because the Greek Cypriot side has indicated that it regards the CBM's package as a process on Maras. As a gesture of goodwill, President Denktas submitted a new document to Gustave Feissel to prevent a deadlock in the talks and explain the Turkish Cypriot side's stand on the matter a few days ago. His document guaranteed that the Greek Cypriots would be able to safely enter and leave Maras freely and without formality or restrictions. The Turkish Cypriot side maintains a sensitive stand on the equal benefits and opportunities the CBM's package will provide for the two sides. That the gains of the Turkish Cypriot side should be equal to those of the Greek Cypriot side, that they should be simultaneous, tangible, and durable, and that they should be concrete and guaranteed is essential. However, the changes that were effected in the package with a view to pleasing the Greek Cypriots have upset the parameters of that package both from the point of view of its contents and from the point of view of its presentation. Regarding the Turkish Cypriot side's gains, a promise was made to the effect that the necessary arrangements are to be made particularly on matters related to the airport. However, the question of the recognition of those gains has been left to the third countries. Those gains must be effectively guaranteed. The Original Spirit of the Package The Turkish Cypriot side has stressed at every opportunity that it is prepared to discuss the modalities related to the application of the package, provided that the problems that conflict with the original spirit of that package and the promises that have been made to the Turkish Cypriot side are resolved. We hope that the UN representatives will maintain a sensitive approach for the successful application of the agreement that will be reached on the basis of political equality. We also hope that they will carefully create and protect the sensitive balances that will enable the package to satisfy the interests and expectations of the two sides. Within that framework, briefly recalling the UN secretary general's report, dated 4 April 1994, will be useful. It outlined the Turkish Cypriot side's views on the non-documents. That is a positive aspect in that report, regardless of the fact that it mentioned the Turkish Cypriot side's views very briefly. Another positive aspect is the fact that it pointed to the need for the maintenance of the talks. A negative aspect of that report is that it failed to mention that certain matters that the Turkish Cypriot side cannot accept have been included in the non-documents, regardless of the fact that they were not included in the original package. What have been excluded from and added to the original package constitute an unacceptable deviation from the promises that were made to the Turkish Cypriot side. I believe that reiterating the following will be useful: The Turkish Cypriot side is prepared to hold talks on a package that will comply with the original text, spirit, and structure of the CBM's package and with the basic principles and concepts in the UN secretary general's reports. The Turkish Cypriot side is also prepared to submit the final agreement that will be achieved after a positive result is attained through the talks to the approval of the TRNC Republican Assembly and the Turkish Cypriot people.
