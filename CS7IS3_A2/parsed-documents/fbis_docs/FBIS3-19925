KHARAVYI, mouthpiece of the communist party AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] comments in a 175-word column on page five entitled "Forward, Not Backward," under the general banner "Aggressively." The writer says: "The U.S. ambassador was right in what he said to the Turkish Cypriot Rotary Club. This continuous recall of the past by the Turkish Cypriot leadership and the arguments such as the one that the Greek Cypriots seek union with Greece, or plan to exterminate the Turkish Cypriots, is a deceitful argument to justify the policy of division and the unacceptable status quo. The new negotiating effort seeks the reunification of our homeland through a federated system for the establishment of a better future that would allow the civilized cohabitation of all its citizens. Life goes on, though, and as sweeping changes take place throughout the world, Cyprus cannot live in the past. For this place to move ahead, it needs leaders with vision and goodwill. It needs leaders who look forward, not backward." Right-wing nationalist I MAKHI carries on page three a 150-word column entitled "No, Mr. Boucher," under the general banner "Struggling Comments." The writer says: "Speaking in the occupied area, U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher claimed that the Greek Cypriots no longer see their future in their dependence on Greece, but in their accession to the European Union. We think that Mr. Boucher does not interpret correctly the feelings of Cyprus' Hellenism. That is because he does not know how much the Hellenism of this victimized place is connected and dependent on Mother Greece. The U.S. ambassador and his government and all other foreign diplomats and their governments should know that this place, which has been Greek throughout the centuries, will not, under any circumstances, break off from the national stem. It will not betray its origin, neither its roots nor its ideals and principles. It will, of course, continue its efforts for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, but this is a different subject. Cyprus' bonds with Greece will never be broken because Greece is the source of light for Cypriot Hellenism's hopes and expectations. This Cypriot Hellenism replies to the U.S. ambassador: No, Mr. Boucher, you have not understood correctly the Greek Cypriot's heartbeat for Mother Greece."
