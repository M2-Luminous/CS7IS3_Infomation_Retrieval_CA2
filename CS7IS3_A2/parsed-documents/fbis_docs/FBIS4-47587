An analysis of the data from the Ukrainian National Registry on 61,066 persons, including 44,724 adults and adolescents, is presented, and the relocated population morbidity dynamics are summarized for 1987-1991. The findings shows that the proportion of healthy vs. examined patients reveals a steady declining trend: 56.68, 51.58, 44.09, 35.3, and 28.8%, respectively. It is noted that to date, the relocation program has not been fully implemented although the doses received by the residents of Pripyat average 3-5 cSv, reaching 12 cSv for some individuals, vs. 20-50 cSv for the approximately 1,000 persons living within the 30-km zone. An analysis indicates that due to the combined effect of radiation exposure and stress, morbidity has increased annually from 265.0 thousand cases in 1986 to 1,037.8 thousand in 1991. The morbidity structure changed too: in 1986, circulatory (34.1%), digestive (21%), skeletomuscular (9.6%), respiratory (8.9%), and nervous and sensory (7.9%) diseases were the leading causes of illness whereas in 1991, the nervous and sensory system (18.4%), respiratory (17.6%), circulatory (16.7%), digestive (14.8%), and skeletomuscular and connective tissue (9.17%) diseases became the leading causes of illness. The findings indicate an annual rise in morbidity for all classes of disease, especially the endocrinic system and neoplasms and show that morbidity among women is higher than that among men in all age groups, especially for the endocrinic, nervous, and hematopoietic systems.
