Turkey announced that preventing the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] terrorist organization activities is above all the requirement of international law. A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry notes that blaming Turkish citizens is an unacceptable stand. The statement further notes: We have no doubt that the Belgian authorities are responsible for the incidents when they granted the PKK supporters permission to hold a demonstration in an area heavily populated by Turkish citizens, totally disregarding their feelings. Belgian authorities prepared the groundwork for this incident by not following Germany and France and banning the PKK. Above all, preventing PKK terrorist activities is a requirement of international law. It was indicated in the statement that high-level initiatives were undertaken in Ankara and Brussels to communicate all the above stated points to Belgian authorities. The Foreign Ministry statement further expresses the wish that Belgian authorities adopt a position which is in accord with international regulations and in accord with the friendly relations it has with Turkey.
