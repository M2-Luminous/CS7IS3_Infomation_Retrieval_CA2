A policy reversal by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] made the decision possible and the sources said the items are now likely to be included in the draft budget for fiscal 1994 starting in April. The Finance Ministry is scheduled to announce the 1994 draft budget plan Thursday. The Defense Agency has pushed for four AWACS planes to boost its information gathering capability and has already concluded contracts to obtain two from the United States in its 1993 budget. The AWACS is a surveillance system which uses aircraft with radar and sophisticated communications equipment to detect airborne and seaborne targets and control weapons systems attacking such targets. A single AWACS plane costs 55.4 billion yen but since the 1994 appropriation is for 550 million yen, the remaining sum will be covered by subsequent budgets. The Patriot missiles, which will cost a total of 35.2 billion yen, will boost Japan's capacity to oppose an airborne or missile attack. The 1994 budget allocates 140 million yen for their purchase. The SDP, which espouses a policy of disarmament, had strongly opposed the purchase of the AWACS. But since the majority of the coalition favors their purchase, the sources said the party's leaders have expressed a desire not to further destabilize the coalition at a time when it is trying to survive a threat to its existence caused by disagreement over a proposed tax reform package. The sources said the SDP has decided instead to push for a reduction in the rate of increase in the defense budget compared with the previous year's rate. The SDP has also released a statement in which it said it will consider the issue of the AWACS and missiles within the context of a revision of the overall defense plan. The decision is consistent with the previous Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) government's defense policy, which included the purchase of two AWACS planes in the budget for the 1993 fiscal year as part of the midterm defense buildup program. Despite a cabinet decision in December to approve a cut of 580 billion yen in the 1991-95 defense buildup program, the then-LDP cabinet allowed the agency to proceed with its original plan to purchase the AWACS system. The midterm defense buildup program, with a total expenditure of 22.75 trillion yen, includes provisions for the purchase of four AWACS planes.
