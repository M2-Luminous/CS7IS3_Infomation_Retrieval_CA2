FR940810-0-00132 FR940810-0-00021 The authors found that approximately 97% of the asbestos structures observed during all analyses were less than 5 microns in length (and would therefore not be seen by PCM). They concluded that ``Concentrations were low during low speed scrubs and burnishing of freshly built-up, new floor finishes. High speed scrub results were highest on the worn floor but dropped to approximately one-fifth this level on freshly built-up surfaces.'' The authors noted that although high speed scrubs and burnishing operations used the same machine and pad, the fiber levels observed in high speed scrub operations were higher than during burnishing. They hypothesized that this had been due to condition of the floor tested or that ``the limited amount of cleaning solution causes the higher values observed during high speed scrubbing operations.'' They expressed serious concern about the elevated TEM measurements during some of these operations and called for more extensive study. S. Wong, Director of Environmental Health and Safety Branch of the Los Angeles Unified School District submitted a report of a study in which fiber levels were measured by TEM during various floor maintenance activities (Ex. 7&hyph;11). Using a pass-fail criterion of 5 samples less than or equal to 70 structures per square millimeter (the AHERA clearance level), she found that 5 of 7 stripping pads failed. She also found that use of a brush with a rotary powered scrubbing machine passed and that various stripping solution used in conjunction with the brush also passed. Repeated use of a pad which initially passed, continued to do so. In a final test using one of the stripping solutions and 7 other brushes, all failed. However, neither the OSHA PEL nor action level was exceeded. The report concluded with several recommendations: (1) all VAT floor maintenance using powered equipment be performed using wet methods exclusively; (2) that use of aggressive pads results in release of fibers from previously applied wax (They found 5% fibers in the old wax scraped from baseboards.) and their use should be discontinued; (3) schools continue to use only the off-white or pink pad which passed for buffing; (4) recommends discontinuance of use of power equipment to strip wax from floors unless they do not contain asbestos; and, (5) alter maintenance program to perform frequent damp mopping and less frequent stripping. Both studies cited above were conducted after the A.F. Meyer study discussed in the proposal, which was conducted in October 1989, and which showed slightly elevated asbestos levels after routine buffing (with standard red buffing pad and standard buffing solution) and stripping. No levels, however, exceeded OSHA's proposed PELs. Two methods were used for stripping: (1) standard stripping mixture mopped on and standard black stripping pad, and (2) mist spray of stripper solution and standard black stripping pad. As noted in the proposal, the stripping conducted using a mist spray of stripping solution and the more abrasive pad resulted in significantly higher asbestos fiber airborne concentrations than the first method. On January 25, 1990, in response to the A.F. Meyer study, EPA published a ``Recommended Interim Guidance for Maintenance of Asbestos-Containing Floor Coverings,'' (Ex. 1&hyph;108) outlining its analysis of the Meyer's findings. The Agency concluded that, although there was ``no clear evidence'' that ``routine'' stripping significantly elevated levels of asbestos fibers, it observed that higher levels did occur after a stripping machine was used on a relatively dry, unwaxed floor. Work practices recommended by EPA in the same guidance memo emphasize the same precautions contained in OSHA's final standards: viz. that the least abrasive pad be used for stripping, and that low speed equipment be used for stripping of floors. OSHA notes that ACCSH's recommendations for work practices in floor maintenance also echo the themes of wet stripping, using the least abrasive pad for stripping, limiting the speed of the machine and prohibiting floor sanding, which are the core requirements in this standard. (Ex. 1&hyph;126). In a change from the proposal, OSHA is permitting high speed buffing of finished floors containing asbestos material. A number of participants pointed out to OSHA that buffing, although performed at high speed, is done on 3 to 5 layers of wax, unlike sanding, and that the wax, not the tile, is polished in this process. (Ex. 7&hyph;19, 7&hyph;80, 7&hyph;84, 7&hyph;90, 7&hyph;100, 7&hyph;107, 7&hyph;123, 7&hyph;142, 7&hyph;188, 125D, 147 and Tr. at 3599). Michael B. Wheeler Chief Executive Officer of Essential Industries Inc., stated that: Stripping is expensive, labor and material-intensive, and, in the context of vinyl asbestos tile something we wish to keep to a minimum. Ultra high speed maintenance techniques allow workers in heavy trafficked stores to strip their finished floors every 10&hyph;18 months as compared to every 2&hyph;3 months using older low speed techniques. (Ex. 7&hyph;188). He went on to explain that these high speed techniques also reduce the labor requirements by at least half. He cited studies using low speed spray buffing techniques on finished VAT which yielded fiber levels ranging from 0.015 to 0.025 f/cc and quoted the WRC-TV report that ``just buffing an already waxed floor does not throw up any asbestos from the asbestos tile.'' In addition, ISSA described additional floor maintenance procedures which increase the glossiness of the floor_spray buffing (done at 175&hyph;300 rpm) and burnishing (done at 300&hyph;2,000 rpm). ISSA stated that if there is finish on the floor surface, these procedures do not generate unsafe levels of fibers because they do not contact the floor itself. They oppose OSHA's proposed changes prohibiting speeds of more than 190 rpm in floor machines, particularly due to increased costs in time and money. (Ex. 136D).
