ACTION: Interim regulations with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing interim regulations concerning the political activities of Federal employees to reflect changes resulting from the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993, which President Clinton signed on October 6, 1993. The scope of these interim regulations is limited to matters concerning exemptions for employees residing in certain localities, from the prohibitions specified in the amended 5 U.S.C. 7323(a) (2) and (3) on candidacy for partisan political office and on soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions. DATES: Effective date: February 3, 1994. Comments must be received on or before April 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to Lorraine Lewis, General Counsel, Office of Personnel Management, room 7355, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jo-Ann Chabot or Gail Goldberg, (202) 606&hyph;1700. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(B) of title 5, United States Code, the Director finds that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking. The notice is being waived because of the limited time in which to issue regulations, and OPM's desire that current partial exemptions for the Federally employed residents of designated localities continue in effect without interruption. The Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;94, specifically authorize OPM to issue regulations on the political activities of Federal employees with regard to the matters specified in 5 U.S.C. 7325, as amended, concerning Federal employees' participation in local elections of certain localities in which they reside. Section 12(a) of the Reform Amendments provides that the regulatory authority granted by the amended 5 U.S.C. 7325 shall take effect on the date of the enactment of the Amendments. The title of Part 733 has been changed accordingly to reflect that the interim regulations concern the political activity of Federal employees who reside in designated localities. The authority statement also has been changed to show that OPM's authority to issue these regulations is 5 U.S.C. 7325, as amended. Section 733.101 of the interim regulations includes definitions of ``employee,'' ``political contribution,'' and ``partisan political office'' which correspond with the definitions in the Reform Amendments. The definition of ``employee'' further reflects that employees of the United States Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission specifically are covered under the Reform Amendments. The Reform Amendments permit active participation in partisan political activities but prohibit employees from seeking public office in partisan elections. Although the Reform Amendments authorize OPM to issue regulations permitting employees to run as partisan political candidates for local office, section 10 of the Amendments reflects the intent of the Senate that employees should not be authorized to run for a local partisan political office, except as expressly provided under current law. The Hatch Act, at 5 U.S.C. 7327, currently authorizes OPM to prescribe regulations permitting the Federally employed residents of designated localities to participate actively in local partisan elections, and does not require employees to run as independent candidates in these elections. However, regulations promulgated under the Hatch Act included this requirement. In view of section 10 of the Reform Amendments, OPM believes that candidacy for partisan political office in local elections should be limited to independent candidacies. Paragraph (a)(1) of ยง733.102 of the interim regulations accordingly permits employees who reside in designated localities to run for partisan political office in local elections, but only as independent candidates. Paragraph (a)(2) of ยง733.102 permits these employees to accept or receive political contributions in connection with partisan elections for local public office. In view of the intent of the Senate that Federal employees should not be permitted to solicit political contributions from the general public, OPM has prohibited the solicitation of political contributions from the general public in paragraph (b). Paragraph (c) specifies that candidacy for, and service in, a partisan political office shall not result in neglect of, or interference with, the performance of the duties of the employee or create a conflict, or apparent conflict, of interest. Paragraph (d) specifies the conditions under which OPM may designate localities in which employees may participate more actively in local partisan elections, and also incorporates the existing list of designated localities. Although the Reform Amendments permit most Federal employees to participate actively in political management or in political campaigns, Federal employees in specified agencies and offices are prohibited from such participation. Therefore, ยง733.103 of the interim regulations excludes these employees from coverage under part 733. Finally, subparts B and C are removed from the part 733 because they clearly are outdated. Subpart B concerns violations of the Hatch Act by excepted service employees, and subpart C applies the Hatch Act's prohibitions to Postal Service employees. E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they relate to internal personnel matters within the Federal Government.
