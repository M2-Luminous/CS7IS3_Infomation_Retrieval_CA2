FR941222-0-00079 FR941222-0-00013 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR National Park Service 36 CFR Part 6 RIN 1024&hyph;AB95 Solid Waste Sites in Units of the National Park System AGENCY: National Park Service, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The National Park Service (NPS), in accordance with 16 U.S.C. 460 l &hyph;22, by this rule restricts the creation of new solid waste disposal sites in units of the National Park System and controls the operations of such sites, in existence as of September 1, 1984, so as to minimize adverse effects to the environment and visitor enjoyment in units of the National Park System. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations will become effective on January 23, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Shawn Norton, National Park Service Engineering and Safety Services Division, 800 North Capitol Street, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 343&hyph;7040. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In 1984, the Congress enacted legislation, Pub. L. 98&hyph;506 (98 Stat. 2338) codified at 16 U.S.C. 460 l &hyph;22(c) (the Act), to prohibit the operation of ``solid waste disposal sites'' within units of the National Park System except for those ``operating as of September 1, 1984,'' or those ``used only for disposal of wastes generated within that unit so long as such site will not degrade any of the natural or cultural resources'' of the unit. The Act went on to direct the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations to ``carry out the provisions of this subsection, including reasonable regulations to mitigate the adverse effects of solid waste disposal sites in operation as of September 1, 1984, upon the property of the United States.'' The regulations implement those statutory provisions. Further authority for the restriction and controls on operations of existing solid waste disposal sites is found in the Act of August 16, 1916, as amended, (NPS Organic Act) codified at 16 U.S.C. 1 and 3. Summary of Comments These rules were published in proposed form for public comment on December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65141&hyph;65149) with a comment period of 60 calendar days. The comment period closed at the end of business, February 11, 1994. The National Park Service received seven timely comments regarding the proposed regulations. Because Federal offices in Washington, DC were closed on February 11, 1994 due to a snow emergency, and the NPS could not accept comments on that day, the NPS accepted comments received on Monday, February 14, 1994. Comments were received from two States, two individuals, one organization, and two offices within the National Park Service. Of the seven comments, three were either fully supportive of the rule or advocated further restrictions. The other four comments questioned both the scope and the meaning of the rule. Analysis of Comments Section 6.2␣Applicability and Scope The regulations are generally applicable to any solid waste disposal site operated in, or proposed for operation in, units of the National Park System. Two comments sought clarification of this rule and how it coincides with State regulations. The States, under the overall aegis of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are the primary regulatory authorities for solid waste disposal sites on all lands within the boundaries of National Park System units, including Federal lands (See Resource Conservation and Recovery Act at 42 U.S.C. 6961). This rule does not duplicate existing State regulatory controls for solid waste disposal sites in units of the National Park System. Rather, this rule governs the conditions under which a solid waste disposal site may exist within the boundaries of a National Park System unit, not whether the site meets the standards of EPA and State regulations. The National Park Service does not intend to displace the States by administering the standards of 40 CFR parts 257 and 258, Solid Waste Disposal Facility Criteria, to sites within the boundaries of National Park System units. One comment asked what action the National Park Service would take should the appropriate unit of State or local government fail to apply the standards at 40 CFR parts 257 and 258 to a solid waste disposal site within a National Park System unit. In such cases, the NPS Regional Director for the unit involved would notify the EPA and the appropriate States to secure enforcement of regulations by the proper entity. Where an operator of a solid waste disposal site is governed by a National Park Service permit under 36 CFR 6.4, 6.5, or 6.6 of this part, the Regional Director may, among other things, revoke a permit to operate under §6.12 of this part for operator failure to comply with EPA or State regulations governing solid waste disposal. Language has been added to §6.12 of the final rule to include noncompliance with State regulations or standards at 40 CFR parts 257 and 258 as a basis for which permit revocation, forfeiture of bond, or penalties may be applied. One comment requested that the rule also apply to solid waste disposal sites adjacent to units of the National Park System. In the context of Pub. L. 98&hyph;506, the Service concludes that the regulation of existing sites and the prohibition of new sites apply only to lands and waters within the boundaries of a National Park System unit. Therefore, the final rule does not extend its reach beyond unit boundaries.
