[passage omitted] After reviewing the achievements scored by the province in reform, opening up, and economic construction last year, Sun Weiben said: 1994 is a year critical to the invigoration and development of Heilongjiang. This year, the economic structural reform begins to enter the most difficult stage of pressing ahead comprehensively and making breakthroughs in key areas, and economic construction is at the critical period of readjusting structure and improving efficiency. During this new year, we should accelerate the pace of building the socialist market economic structure and the pace of developing the productive forces of the countryside and the county economy in an effort to further expand the scale of opening up. During this new year, we should actually build the socialist spiritual civilization, build the party, and build democracy and the legal system so as to create a fine legal system environment for reform and development. Sun Weiben emphatically pointed out: During this new year, we should do more good and practical deeds for the masses. Based on developing the economy, we should strive to increase the practical income of urban and rural residents, strictly control the increase margin of commodity prices, improve the people's living standards and living quality, show concern for the masses' weal and woe, and adopt all effective measures to make appropriate arrangements for the livelihood of the people in poverty-stricken areas and the livelihood of the workers and staff of the enterprises that have been closed down, suspended production, and gone bankrupt. We should actively press ahead the housing system reform and seek to basically solve the housing problems for the households with special difficulties by the end of this year. We should maintain close ties between the party and the people and consolidate and develop political stability and unity. Sun Weiben said in conclusion: In this new year, opportunities and challenges coexist, difficulties and hopes coexist, the burdens on our shoulders are even more heavy, and our tasks are even more arduous. To fulfill the tasks on reform, development, and stability, we must depend on the concerted efforts of party and government organizations at all levels, all economic organizations, all military organizations, and all institutions in the province. At the same time, the vast numbers of party members and cadres and the people of all nationalities on all circles should unite as one and strive for development towards a same goal. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should closely rally around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, and work hard with one heart and one mind to push forward the province's reform and construction.
