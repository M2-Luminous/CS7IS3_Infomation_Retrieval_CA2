This may be the most acute issue at this time. Unfortunately, nobody has the answer--neither the people's deputies, nor the Ministry of Finance, nor the director of an enterprise that has been forced to give one employee in three leave without pay. Where are we to get money? They come with this question to the commanders of military units--not just officers, but by now also women with children. However, the commanders have nothing to say in response, to say nothing of accommodating them. Where are we to get money? Our readers bring up this question in almost all their letters to the editor. If NARODNA ARMIYA knew the answer or could show the way out of this difficult situation, it would have done so long ago. However, what are we to say, esteemed reader, if the supreme officials of the country are not in a position to say something specific in response to the "question of questions...." Therefore, we will only paint the picture that has now emerged with regard to the provision of funding for the Ministry of Defense. We hope that you will understand the situation. Toward the end of December of last year, the minister of defense of Ukraine, General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy, wrote yet another letter to Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, the acting prime minister of Ukraine. The letter said that "the 472.0 billion karbovantsy allocated as of 27 December made it possible only to issue pay and allowances to servicemen for November and, in part, December. An emergency situation is developing in sustaining the routine activities of the troops. The absence of financing makes it impossible to settle with energy suppliers for electricity, heat, and gas used. As a result, the supply of electricity, heat, and gas to military settlements has been turned off (Kotovsk, Desna, Sevastopol, Kharkov, Pervomaysk...)." An endorsement by Yukhym Leonidovych appeared on this letter, owing to which 200 billion karbovantsy were allocated for foodstuffs and 140 billion karbovantsy for wages. (Incidentally, the Ministry of Defense was supposed to get them in early December.) However, the minister of defense had sought 700 billion karbovantsy to overcome the crisis situation. This was the minimum, he said. This was by no means satisfactory, and as early as 5 January, Major General Ivan Shtopenko, chief of the financial directorate of the Ministry of Defense, wrote a memorandum for the minister of defense recalling that "a critical situation has developed with regard to funding priority payments. Repeated appeals by enterprise directors, army collectives, people's deputies, and trade union organizations addressed to government organs with regard to the emergent situation have been forwarded to the Ministry of Defense, instead of being considered and instead of practical measures being taken. The requirements to meet the priority needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for January of this year come to 1.313 trillion karbovantsy, of which 743 billion karbovantsy is for pay and allowances for servicemen.... Besides, it is necessary to pay back the arrears of 720 billion karbovantsy for 1993." [The above quote is rendered in Russian in the original] How is the military department provided for following the many appeals to the supreme officials of the country? We find the answer in a letter from Major General Ivan Shtopenko and Major General V. Krokhin, chief of the directorate of foodstuffs supply of the logistical headquarters of the Armed Forces, to Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Valeriy Shmakov: "As of 21 January 1994 the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine received funding in the amount of 25.0 billion karbovantsy, which comes to 1.0 percent of the needs for January of this year.... Military collectives and the families of servicemen are finding themselves on the brink of ruin." What can we add to this.... Major General Ivan Shtopenko said in a conversation with a NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent: "Letters are just what they are, but you cannot help matters just with letters. The minister of defense begins virtually every day by visiting either the Cabinet of Ministers or the Ministry of Finance. We use every opportunity to get yet another portion of funds." Incidentally, Ivan Ivanovych himself sets out for the same addresses every morning. When a NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent was talking to him in his own office, the Ministry of Finance called. At the other end of the line they joked: "We have already allocated a room for you here...." You may have grown tired of reading excerpts from official documents. However, we deliberately cite them so that you will first better understand the state of affairs and second, so that nobody will get the impression that the military department headed by General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy is sitting on its hands. This is why we offer yet another letter, this time to President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, which was signed by the minister of defense. "I report that the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine submitted, at the appointed time, substantiated calculations of the minimum need for monetary funds in 1994 in the amount of 63.7 trillion karbovantsy to the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine and the Commission for Issues of Defense and State Security of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The above notwithstanding, the Ministry of Finance, without coordinating this with the Ministry of Defense and without grounds, included the limit of outlays of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the amount of 14.7 trillion karbovantsy in the draft 1994 State Budget, which comes to only 23 percent of real needs." The letter goes on to say that the proposed amount "will make it possible to ensure only the issuance of pay and allowances to servicemen, wages to the personnel, payments for foodstuffs, clothing, and related gear (10.9 trillion karbovantsy), which comes to 74 percent of the envisioned quota, and what remains (3.8 trillion karbovantsy) does not even cover outlays to meet the vital needs of the Armed Forces (fuel and lubricants, municipal utilities, and so on). With this budget the Ministry of Defense will not be able to sustain the program to maintain the combat readiness of weapons and military materiel and lay the foundation for the programs of development of promising weapons and military materiel models." The minister of defense sent this letter to the president on the eve of consideration of the 1994 budget. (Similar letters were also sent to the chairman of the Supreme Council, the acting prime minister, the chairman of the Supreme Council Commission for Issues of Defense and State Security, the minister of finance, and others). Certain things were factored in, but.... The chief of the financial directorate of the Ministry of Defense reported to General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy: "In keeping with the 1994 budget approved by the Supreme Council of Ukraine and the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, in January 1.6 trillion karbovantsy should be transferred to the Ministry of Defense in January, and 1.2 trillion karbovantsy in February. Actually, 169.3 billion karbovantsy were received in January and 99.0 billion karbovantsy in February, or just 9.6 percent of the amounts due which were approved by the Supreme Council of Ukraine to fund the troops...." [Above quote is rendered in Russian in the original] This is the way it is.... What is the way out? The chief of the financial directorate of the Ministry of Defense believes that the issue of financing for the Armed Forces of Ukraine should be raised promptly at an extraordinary meeting of the Defense Council of Ukraine. Do they really fail to understand there that the people with the weapons should not go hungry?... Let us believe that this will be beneficial. However, it is impossible to overlook the main point: Life will not improve until the economy begins to work and a strict financial and credit system is established. Therefore, nobody will give us an answer to the question about "where we are to get money" tomorrow morning. Let us look the truth in the eye: Things are not going to get better in the immediate future, including pay and allowances for servicemen. We have to be prepared for that and not expect new "presents" from life. Unfortunately, we are not finishing these notes on an optimistic note. One cannot spread butter on bread with lines from quoted documents or buy apples for children with them. We will repeat that there is just one thing we want: We should demonstrate understanding for all this and not resort to extreme measures, as some are proposing.
