In a statement to an IRAQI NEWS AGENCY correspondent, the governor said: Recently, there have been tendentious rumors circulated by hostile propaganda sources. These rumors are aimed at undermining the legendary steadfastness of the good Iraqis who have proudly stood fast for three and a half years under an unfair and cruel embargo, which was imposed by the forces of evil and tyranny. These forces are still boasting about their defense of human rights. Al-Takmaji added: These rumors include reports on the Iraqi currency. Some parties alleged that there is an intention to replace the present currency with another currency worth one-tenth the present currency's value. The evil ones also say that the state will possess 90 percent of the public's balances deposited in the Iraqi banks, as well as other vicious rumors. Al-Takmaji continued: These rumors-- which are circulated by familiar trumpets whose approaches are well known--are not reasonable, and I vehemently deny all these rumors. I also affirm that there is no intention to influence the legal value of the Iraqi currency or change its denominations, knowing that there are rumors that claim that the government intends to devaluate the dinar to one-tenth of its value. He added: On this occasion, I would like every citizen to thoroughly examine these rumors. After our perseverance for more than 40 months, the dinar cannot be devaluated to one-tenth, and the people can be assured about their deposits in the banks. Al-Takmaji continued: Some people who circulate these rumors try to compare Iraq with some former Soviet states or some East European states. However, such a comparison should not be made, and these people know this fact better than others do. Even if these people cite the current exchange rate of the dinar, they are also well aware that this exchange rate does not reflect the dinar's real value; it is only a reflection of a situation dictated by temporary circumstances. This situation will inevitably change when the embargo ends, God willing.
