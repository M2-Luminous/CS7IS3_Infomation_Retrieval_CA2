FR941202-2-00167 FR941202-2-00098 2.0␣Performance Evaluation Testing Program 2.1␣Enrollment in PE Testing Program Each laboratory must enroll in a performance evaluation (PE) testing program that meets the criteria detailed by the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP). The laboratory must participate in an approved program or programs for each field of testing for which it seeks accreditation. Participation shall mean the analysis and reporting of all test samples. Laboratories shall participate in PE testing for all fields of testing at a frequency determined by the NELAC standards. The laboratory must notify the accreditation agency of the NELAP-approved program or programs in which it chooses to participate to meet PE testing requirements. For those tests performed by the laboratory for which PE testing is not currently available, the laboratory must establish and maintain the accuracy and reliability of its testing procedures by a system of internal quality management. For each field of testing for which the laboratory seeks accreditation, it must participate in the designated, NELAP- approved PE testing program for at least twelve months before designating a different program. The laboratory must notify the primary accreditor before any change in designation. Laboratories shall bear the cost of any subscription to a PE testing program required by NELAP. Each participant must authorize the PE testing program to release to the primary accreditor all data required to determine the laboratory's compliance with the criteria. The primary accreditor shall make individual performance results available to all requesters. 2.2␣Approval of PE Testing Programs In order for a PE testing program to receive approval, the program must be offered by a Federal or State agency, or entity acting as a designated agent for the Federal or State agency. A Federal or State program seeking approval or renewal for its PE program for the next calendar year must submit an application to the NELAP director providing the required information by July 1 of the current year. The program must provide technical assistance to resolve problems that the participants experience such as anomalies during analysis of the samples, lost samples, or receipt of broken sample containers, etc. In addition, the PE testing program must, (a) Assure the quality of test samples, appropriately evaluate and score the PE test results, and identify performance problems in a timely manner; (b) Demonstrate to the primary accreditor (or NELAP) that it has: (1) The technical ability required to: i. Either prepare samples or evaluate samples purchased from manufacturers, who prepare the samples in conformance with the appropriate good manufacturing practices; and ii. Distribute samples with at least two levels of analytes. Rigorous quality control must assure that samples mimic actual environmental samples when possible and that samples are homogeneous and remain stable over the period of testing. Stability shall be verified by routine testing on stored samples, within the time frame for analysis by PE test participants. Samples shall be maintained by the PE testing program to retest laboratories with unsatisfactory performance, or which have significant changes in accreditation status;
