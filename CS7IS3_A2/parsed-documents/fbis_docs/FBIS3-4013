Jiazi Town is located in the southeastern coast of Lufeng County, bordering on Hong Kong and Macao. During this year's Spring Festival, some smugglers, taking advantage of the festive occasion, covertly employed some workers from outside the province to manufacture barges in an attempt to "enliven" the already-halted smuggling activities. Upon receipt of crime reports by some people, the town antismuggling group immediately organized personnel, and on 27 February it impounded 10 barges being manufactured in the local port and arrested 18 law breakers involved in manufacturing the barges. Now this case is under further investigation.
