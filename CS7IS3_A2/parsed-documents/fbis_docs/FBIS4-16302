The device was developed using so-called `red mercury.'" The report goes on to give further details and concludes with the following note "from the Editorial Office": "IZVESTIYA's correspondent Nikolay Burbyga turned for an explanation to ministries and departments involved with armaments. "`Needless to say, we have some secret developments [razrabotki],' the Russian Defense Ministry reported, `but what the British TV reporters are claiming is completely absurd -- it is shameful to even comment on it.' "Equally categorical answers were obtained at the Kurchatov Institute. Specialists connected with future scientific arms developments claimed: `People have been talking about "red mercury" for a long time. But nobody has even seen it or "touched" it, because substances with these characteristics simply do not exist in nature....'" Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 0956 GMT on 15 April, in a Mirniy (Arkhangelsk region)-datelined report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin, adds: "Reports about a `new Russian miniature bomb', allegedly developed with the use of `red mercury', are absolutely groundless," ITAR-TASS was told today by Lieutenant-General Yuriy Zhuravlev, chief of the state testing ground of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces. "Russia is not making or testing new types of nuclear weapons," he stressed.
