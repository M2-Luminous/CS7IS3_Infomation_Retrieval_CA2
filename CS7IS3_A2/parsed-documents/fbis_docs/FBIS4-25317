More than 250 cases flooded the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (Cietac) by the end of May. Cietac predicts it will handle nearly 600 cases before the year is out. Cietac handled 486 cases last year more than any other international centre. "More and more Chinese and foreign companies are willing to resort to Cietac for settling their business disputes," said Zhu Jianlin, deputy secretary general of Cietac, at a briefing for the upcoming International Commercial Arbitration Legislation Conference. The conference, to be held in Beijing on June 22 and 23, should further link China's business arbitration with international standards. Decisions made in China are now honoured and enforced in more than 90 countries and regions. In the past, many foreigners fled to other international arbitrators whenever disputes arose about things like wording in joint-venture contracts or poor shipments of materials. Now the world is focusing on particular Chinese mediation practices because of its increasing importance in international commercial arbitration. China has successfully combined arbitration with its traditional thinking of mediation. Chinese arbitrators help the disputing parties come to mutual agreement and reconciliation, easing tensions rather than furthering the anger. But in many nations, arbitrators must decide who wins and who loses, no matter how furious a party might be. The international conference will provide the foreign experts with a perfect perch for examining the Chinese experience. More than 300 Chinese and foreign arbitration and trade experts will attend the conference, the first of its kind in China and the entire Asia-Pacific region. China hopes the event will help its re-entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt); other parts of the world will see at first hand the progress China has made toward meeting international norms in economic activities. The conference is being organized by Cietac and the International Council of Commercial Arbitration.
