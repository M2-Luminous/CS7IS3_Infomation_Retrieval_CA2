The Gradacac Information Center says that "after a very quiet morning, practically without a single bullet being fired, the [Serbian] enemy suddenly opened fire at a vehicle carrying the Nordic battalion of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. At 1020 the enemy fired several 120-mm mortars from Skugric at the peacekeeping forces on regular patrol of the region of Vida. The vehicle went up in flames but the soldiers managed to escape in time, so that -- at least according to the latest information -- there are no wounded." The report says that "at the moment NATO planes are constantly flying over Gradacac." Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac that "the Serb aggressor has continued his attacks on the defense lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, Hasin Vrh, and Barakovac, and the members of the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomy have also stepped up their attacks on the free part of the Bihac region. After continuous artillery and tank attacks overnight, this morning Karadzic's terrorists again tried another infantry breakthrough on Hasin Vrh. In collusion with the chetniks, the so-called autonomy army continued to attack in the area of Krivaja in the Cazin commune. Several of our fighters were wounded in these attacks, and three were unfortunately killed. More of our fighters were killed in the bestial chetnik pounding of the defense positions." He said that "according to incomplete information, nine people were killed and several dozen wounded overnight and today." Reporting from Bugojno, Atif Agic says that "this is the third day that the general alarm is constantly in force to warn civilians of the chetnik shells. Five people have been wounded so far as the town has been subjected to sudden shellings."
