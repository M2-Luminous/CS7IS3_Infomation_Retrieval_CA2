Dzambazovski: "The Two Currents Against the Center"] [Text] The PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] Congress should take place by 15 January this year and the Preparatory Committee is intensively engaged in it, claiming that there will be no postponement this time. Menduh Taci, the leader of the so-called "hard" current and president of the Tetovo branch, has also become a member of the Committee. By the way, the delegates and ministers consider Taci an illegitimate president of the so-called new party leadership constituted at the Gostivar meeting last month. As a reminder, toward the end of last year the PDP's breakup came to a head. The "hard" current did not give up its request for a change in the leading structures, which resulted in the collective resignation of the central Presidency, "in the interest of consolidation." The group headed by Taci received support from official Albania, which resulted in a meeting organized in Gostivar, where the new leadership was nominated, which was then proclaimed as illegitimate by the group of delegates and ministers. However, it seems that a kind of a compromise has been reached by making Taci a member of the Preparatory committee. His nomination was made in his capacity as president of the Tetovo branch, although the Committee considers his office illegitimate. We discovered from well-informed sources that such a decision was reached in order to avoid a deepening of the conflict situation, and it was emphasized that the Tetovo assembly was not held, and if Taci had not been elected president of the branch, and a delegate as well as a member of the Central Assembly, the Tetovo assembly would not participate in the Congress. The same sources told us that there is a growing sense within the PDP that the collective Central Presidency resignation was a political error and nonsense, because there was no perception of further activities. The division within the party was deepened, and there was interference by official and semiofficial political circles in neighboring Albania, thus causing total confusion within the membership. The most surprising thing that happened was the support that Albania gave to Menduh Taci, who stated in Tirana that the new leadership (elected in Gostivar) would represent a factor of stability in Macedonia, (as if the old one had not been such a factor), while his assessments in Macedonia were that the old leadership was too mild, announcing a radical change in the party national policy concerning the state institutions. It was also estimated that the division caused a loss of confidence among the membership regarding the different currents of the power struggle and that the so-called center of the party, which, according to these sources, stands firmly on an election course, is in practical terms without a partner. Allegedly, the "hard" current does not have a precise political platform and its campaign stems from a superficial criticism. The group of delegates and ministers have been deeply involved with the authorities and policy, and, allegedly, they do not reflect clearly the wishes of the membership. Concerning the Congress Preparatory Committee, which has the role of temporary party leadership, it is now headed by delegate Abdurahman Aliti, the documents are being prepared by delegate Naser Ziberi, and the member of the resigned Presidency, Mahi Nesimi, is engaged in the preparation of the program, and is also going to be in charge of the press service. The well-informed sources claim that Abdurahman Aliti is going to be the new PDP president. [Box, p 4] News Conference Scheduled but Not Held Yesterday a news conference was scheduled in the headquarters of the PDP, organized by the former Party President Nevzat Halili. At least that was the information delivered to the press. The journalists were there at the scheduled time, but Halili did not appear. The people in the PDP headquarters were surprised at the presence of the journalists, and nobody could give any explanation. It was either because of false information given on Halili's behalf, his inability to send information to the PDP headquarters or his being unable to arrive at the scheduled time -- or was it perhaps a totally different reason?
