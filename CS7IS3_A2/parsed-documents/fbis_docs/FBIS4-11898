In a memorandum sent to Arab foreign ministers, the grouping pointed out that the regime has obstructed the Constitution, dissolved parties and democratic unions, and launched ethnic war against the south. This, the grouping added, threatens Sudan's unity and invites foreign intervention. The grouping accused the regime of harboring and training terrorists in Sudan.
