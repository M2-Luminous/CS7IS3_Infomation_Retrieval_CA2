The final vote--which was due to take place on Tuesday, 31 May--was finally postponed by one day after Assembly Speaker Philippe Seguin noticed both the absence of the defense minister from government benches and...the failure of the electronic voting system. Only the Communist deputies voted against the bill, with Guy Hermier (Bouches-du-Rhone) expressing the view that France "is wasting a historic opportunity to take a decisive step toward disarmament and peace." Two absentees were noted: Jean-Pierre Chevenement who had announced his intention of abstaining, as did Jean-Pierre Michel, his friend from the Citizens' Movement; and also that of Julien Dray who did this to express his opposition to the text and its approval by the PS [Socialist Party]. In the forthcoming issue of the weekly pamphlet GAUCHE SOCIALISTE [Socialist Left] which they edit, Julien Dray and Jean-Luc Melenchon, (PS) senator for l'Essonne, write that "voting in favor of this law is stupid, politically dangerous, and militarily ineffective." Welcoming the "support" of the country's three big political forces for his bill, Defense Minister Francois Leotard reaffirmed the government's position on nuclear tests. France, he said, intends "to maintain its nuclear effort, and that includes tests if they seem necessary."
