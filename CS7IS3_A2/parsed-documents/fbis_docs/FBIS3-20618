The production of this equipment marks China's entry into products for the coming century. In order to stand tall in a fiercely competitive market, this plant set its sights on the world's best and relentlessly went after high-capacity, low-consumption, and high-level turbogenerator products, and set a new pattern for product development. During the "Seventh 5-Year Plan" alone the factory manufactured over 20 new products, including 50MW, 200MW, and 300MW turbogenerators which have been a boon to industry and are well regarded both at home and abroad. Thereafter, the plant leadership realized that to keep up with the rapidly growing economy the country would need even bigger and better thermal power equipment, and looking ahead to the next century, they joined with the Hitachi Corporation in 1991 to design and produce a 600MW turbogenerator. Undaunted by the size and the cost of the task, the plant rounded up a large task force, materials and money, and got into the development and research manufacture of the "600MW unit." Early last year, a "600MW office" composed of the best people, was set up, and they completed the conceptual design and made changes to the large and sophisticated Hitachi blueprints, grappled with the design, process and raw materials, made four adjustments to the new contract grid plan, and improved the technical training of plant personnel. The plant is now fully prepared for the trial production of the 600MW turbogenerator, which will be the factory's ticket for entry into the coming century.
