Three of these projects will be assigned to biology and three to engineering; two pertain to the natural sciences and one to economics. Thus, from 1 January 1994, the DFG will be supporting 196 special research areas in 52 institutes of higher education. "Signal recognition and transfer on cell surfaces" will be investigated by scientists at the Free University in Berlin, the Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine, and the Institute for Plant Genetics and Cultured Plant Research in Gatersleben. This is intended to clarify the molecular basis of signal recognition on the surface of cells, their transmission into the interior of the cell and reactions stimulated in the process. Inflammations, differentiation among embryos and the development of tumors are closely linked with signal transmission. Researchers at the two Munich universities and the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry in the same city will investigate the "molecular and bioorganic basis for secondary metabolism." Secondary materials are considered to be those which are formed by plants or microorganisms but which are not absolutely necessary for their metabolism. They are characterized by complex structures and are often used in pharmacy. Using modern techniques it is hoped to shed light on their mechanisms and to produce new therapeutically effective substances. Scientists from the Max Planck Institute and the university in Goettingen are participating in the third biological project along with the Brunswick Technical University and the Hannover Medical College. Their subject area, developmental biology, has had an explosive career over the last 10 years: It has been possible, using new techniques, to identify those genes which control the development of an organism out of an egg cell. Now the question is how the activity of the genes is regulated in a particular developmental program. Investigations in various animals ought to facilitate a general understanding of molecular strategies and blueprints in the animal kingdom. Researchers from the Hamburg-Harburg Technical University and the GKSS Research Center in Geesthacht plan to concern themselves with an area of engineering which has been neglected in this country, the "micromechanics of multiphase materials." In view of the increasing need for innovative materials in industry, knowledge about the inner mechanism of materials is growing in importance. The behavior of metallic alloys, ceramics, or plastics must be known so that they can meet safety standards. Two more special research areas in engineering have been assigned to the Aachen Technical College. Ergonomists, electrical engineers, and mechanical engineers will study "autonomous production cells." In the process systems should be developed which perform complex processes substantially independently and without interruption. Human beings should once again play an appropriate role in the factories of the future as "machine directors." The heart of the "integrative material modeling" project is computer supported development of materials. Transcending the traditional classification of materials, the program ranges from the raw material to the finished components. The results will be important not only for basic research but also for business, since modeling is increasingly replacing expensive experiments in the production of components. A third special research area is being set up in Aachen. This deals with "asymmetrical syntheses using chemical and biological methods." Too little attention has been paid to the fact that in chemical syntheses "chiral forms" arise as mirror images of a compound. These differ in their biological activity, e.g. in medications or plant protection. One of the forms is unnecessary or even dangerous. Thus techniques are being sought by which pure natural substances and hormones can be produced. Scientists at Leipzig University will study "molecules in interaction with boundary surfaces." These surfaces control processes which are important in nature and technology and mark off functional spaces. Molecules change their characteristics when they come in contact with boundary surfaces and simultaneously have an effect on the behavior of the surfaces. The explication of fundamental relationships is important for new procedures in optoelectronics, sensorics, and informational technology, and also for medicine and environmental research. Economists and mathematicians from the Humboldt University in Berlin will apply themselves to the "quantification and simulation of economic processes." In this study economic, mathematical, and statistical procedures are to be combined to evaluate the dynamics of economic processes.
