There are about 600 of them. They have the best deal, since only French planes can land and take off from Kigali airport. On the contrary, the Belgians and the Americans are making their nationals leave by road. So far, 246 French nationals have already left Rwanda. Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin hopes all French nationals will be able to leave by this evening thanks to the rotation of the five Transall planes. This is possible, but it all depends on the ground situation in Kigali. This is what the person in charge of the Belgian UN soldiers in Rwanda, Colonel Marchal, told Benoit Colombin: [Begin Marchal recording] The duration of the evacuation depends directly on the number of available planes. For the time being, only France has started to evacuate. No other country has started to evacuate, at least with planes. The United States is preferring to evacuate by road. Since yesterday, convoys have been heading toward the south of the country through Butare to reach the other side of the border, Burundi, and in all likelihood to wait for the situation to stabilize and to return to normal here. [end recording] This is unfortunately far from being the case. Indeed, violence between Hutus and Tutsis is continuing in Kigali. This violence is extreme. Listen to a report by Jean Helene, who is with Radio France Internationale: [Begin Helene recording] The church square is smeared with blood. In the aisles, two rescue workers collect an unconscious, wounded man. The man has been lying in a room under the nave for 24 hours, dying. He locked himself in there with four other people, but assailants threw a grenade through the basement window. He is the only survivor. Nearly 100 people took refuge in the church. Just after yesterday's service, dozens of armed militiamen invaded the mission. They jumped over fences, and the slaughter started. There was nothing else we could do, an eyewitness says. Those who fled into the street were systematically butchered. The mission employees buried nearly 70 bodies this morning, and the ICRC came to collect almost 30 wounded, including many who will not survive. At the hospital, the situation is not safe. Soldiers came into the wards yesterday and executed seven wounded people. This morning, they came and beat up the wounded in the MSF [Medecins Sans Frontieres] dispensary and threatened to come back in the evening to kill them. The march of the RPF troops on Kigali is making soldiers increasingly nervous. If the RPF tries to take the capital, the survivors of the massacres will probably be finished off. Jean Helene, RFI, Kigali, for France Inter. [end recording] According to the Red Cross, the RPF rebels have just arrived in Kigali. The Meridien Hotel, which has been housing the foreign nationals about to be evacuated, was bombed. It is impossible for the time being to know whether any foreigners were still there.
