Asked about conditions to introduce peace-makers in the conflict zone, Zatulin stressed it should be separating and not occupational troops. "The introduction of peace-makers in all Abkhazian areas would be an insult for a party to the conflict, since it would entail the side's recognition as incapable de facto on its territory. Bearing in mind the principle of equal responsibility of the sides, this would also result in the introduction of troops in Georgia," said Zatulin. In his opinion, a plan to stabilize the Abkhazian situation should include the introduction of separating peace-making troops in the area of the Inguri River, presence of international observers in the conflict zone and a possibility of flexible reaction in case of a threat of conflict resumption. "I hope that the upcoming negotiations will manage to bring closer together the Georgian and Abkhazian stands on the issue," said the committee chairman.
