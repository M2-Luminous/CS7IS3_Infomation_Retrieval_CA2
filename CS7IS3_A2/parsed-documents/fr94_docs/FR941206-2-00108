FR941206-2-00108 FR941206-2-00074 [Release No. 34&hyph;35031; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;56] Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Granting Partial, Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Transfer of Customer Accounts November 30, 1994. On October 12, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). 1 On November 9, 1994, the NASD filed with the Commission Amendment No. 1. 2 The proposed rule change will amend the NASD's rules to provide for three business day settlement of securities transactions and will amend the NASD's rules on the transfer of customer accounts between broker-dealers. The Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the Federal Register On November 18, 1994. 3 No comments have been received on the notice. As discussed below, the Commission is approving on an accelerated basis that portion of the proposed rule change relating to the transfer of customer accounts. 4 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 Letter from Suzanne E. Rothwell, Associate General Counsel, NASD, to Mark Barracca, Branch Chief, Over-the-Counter Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (November 8, 1994). 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34966 (November 10, 1994), 59 FR 59802. 4 The Commission is not approving by this order the portion of the proposed rule change relating to three day settlement of securities transactions (proposed amendments to Sections 5, 6, 12, 46, and 64 of the Uniform Practice Code and Article III, Section 26(m)(1) and Article III, Section 1 of the Rules of Fair Practice). I. Description The proposal amends the NASD's Uniform Practice Code (``UPC'') Section 65 which sets forth the procedures for the transfer of customer accounts from one broker-dealer (``carrying member'') to another broker-dealer (``receiving member''). The proposed rule change for Section 65 was developed in conjunction with the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC''), and the Securities Industry Association Customer Account Division. Under the proposed language of Section 65, upon receipt from the customer of signed account transfer instructions a receiving member must immediately submit the transfer instructions to the carrying member. The proposal will reduce from five to three business days the time frame for the carrying member either to validate or to take exception to the transfer instructions for all accounts including retirement plan accounts. 5 The proposal will require that the carrying member complete all transfers in four rather than five business days after validation of the transfer instructions. The proposal also (1) will more clearly define the reasons why the carrying member may take exception to account transfer instructions, 6 (2) will require the use of an automated facility for the transfer of mutual fund positions and residual credits when both the carrying and the receiving members are participants in a registered clearing agency which has automated facilities for such transfers, (3) will set forth time frames for the resolution of claims, 7 (4) will require that partial transfers be processed through the automated facilities of a registered clearing agency when both the carrying and receiving members are participants in a registered clearing agency which has automated facilities for such transfers, and (5) will require that for a minimum of six months after an account transfer is completed residual credit balances must be transferred within ten business days after accrual. 5 Currently, the time frame for validating or taking exception to transfer instructions for retirement plan accounts is ten days. 6 A member may take exception to a transfer instruction only if: additional documentation is required; the account is flat and reflects no transferable assets; the account number is invalid; it is a duplicate request; it violates the member's credit policy; the receiving member cannot identify the client; the client rescinds the instruction; the social security number or tax identification number does not correspond to the carrying member's records; the receiving member's account title or type does not correspond to that of the carrying member; there is a missing authorization signature; or the entire account is in transfer to be delivered directly to customer. 7 When a member receives a written claim letter relating to an account transfer, the member must resolve the claim within five business days from receipt of the letter or respond in writing to the claiming member setting forth specific reasons for denying the claim.
