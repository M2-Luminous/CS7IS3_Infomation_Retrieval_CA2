This idea was advanced at a recent conference of the industries. Shaposhnikov did not object to cuts in military spending but said that "the principles of sufficient reason as well as reasonable sufficiency" had to be observed. In his view, the proposed cut (to less than one fifth of the 1993 figure) of spending for military contracts might harm the scientific and industrial potential of the country. Shaposhnikov thought that the rocketry, air force and other services using high technologies could be the worst hit. In a more intelligent approach, Shaposhnikov thought, "the number of design boards and factories specializing in development and manufacture of the same products" could be cut. This kind of competition would make it possible to preserve and consolidate the most efficient producers while less fortunate competitors could turn to other activities, probably for peaceful purposes. The defense industries must have better guidelines, he thought. Four specific state programs had to be adopted, of weapons production, reduction and utilization of non-promising production lines, conversion to peaceful uses and weapons export. "Even though I am with a mediator organization engaged in sales of weapons, I don't think it fair that military hardware producers cannot participate in exporting their products. They must have the right of direct access to the world market so as to enable them to use part of their proceeds for their immediate needs and increase the national budget revenue by paying taxes," Shaposhnikov said.
