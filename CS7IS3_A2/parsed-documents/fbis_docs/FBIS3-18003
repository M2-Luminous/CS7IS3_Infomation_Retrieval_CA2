At the moment the prime minister is on his way home from Slovenia. We inform our listeners that the recorded conversation will be about Lithuanian foreign policy. Therefore, apart from the prime minister, Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys is also taking part in the conversation. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] The first question is to the prime minister: what are the objectives of the visit to Slovenia. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Now concerning the recent uproar which is felt here in Lithuania -- the Selma [construction company] case, the purchase of weapons, searches carried out in people's houses, and so on. Why does Russia show such a great interest in all this? Why such reaction? [Prime Minister Slezevicius] The reaction, which was first of all voiced by Mr. Matochkin and Mr. Yegorov during their visit here, is about Russia's concern that the construction of houses in the Kaliningrad region may be discontinued. This is the official pretext for their concern. During our meeting and during our visit to the Kaliningrad region we made assurances that, as far as Lithuania is concerned, there would be no obstacles toward the construction being continued. [passage omitted] The comments which appeared in the Lithuanian press concerning this criminal case is rather categorical, saying that the case is leading to high-ranking Russian officials, therefore it is only understandable that this causes them concern. I think that such allegations do not help in the normalization of our mutual relations. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Could you comment on the military transit from Kaliningrad and back? [Slezevicius] The location of the Kaliningrad region is rather unique indeed. It is an enclave. Therefore, naturally it causes certain problems both to Kaliningrad and Lithuania, because in spite of our categorical attitude to this issue, the transit through Lithuania is unavoidable and therefore it is our task to determine the procedure with regard to how the transit of foreign transport should proceed through our country. [passage omitted] [Foreign Minister Gylys] [Passage omitted] There is yet another question. I would like to clarify a report by the Baltic News Service concerning motor vehicle transit. Russia indeed wants some priveleges for motor vehicle transit. However, our state has...[pauses] Being aware on the one hand, as the prime minister has already mentioned, of Russia's right, perhaps a wish, to have access to the enclave, however, we have to be in control of all this movement. Therefore, the BNS report claiming that an agreement has already been reached on motor vehicle transit is premature. The problem is very complex indeed. [Correspondent] The following rather pressing question is about relations with Poland. Here is the recorded voice of Augustinas Rimkus [not further identified] from Vilnius. [Rimkus] Why is the text of the treaty with Poland being made secret? The article in the treaty concerning the occupation by Zeligowski should be confirmed not only by the representatives of the government but by the entire nation. All this should be condemned, however all this is being made secret. [end recording] [Correspondent] There are more listeners voicing their concern that the texts of inter-state treaties are not made public in advance. [Slezevicius] [Passage omitted] There is one point, however, whereby I can assure that this treaty fully corresponds to the interests of the Lithuanian state. Any attempt to aggravate inter-state relations is not wanted. We had to find mutually acceptable formulations which would satisfy both sides concerning the evaluation of the historical facts and, of course, ensuring the inviolability and integrity of our territory. These general principles have been recorded. The treaty has been initialled by Mr. Gylys, who is taking part in this conversation. It is clear that in the second half of next month the visit by Polish President Walesa is to take place, during which the treaty will be signed, and of course, following this, the treaty will be made public. [Gylys] It is of interest to note that when I arrived in Poland I was acquainted with the materials [not further specified] and I noticed that the formulations and statements by the radical forces are similar to those here in Lithuania. The Polish radical forces -- it is true that they are not as numerous as they are in this country -- say that with this treaty Lithuania has forced Poland to go down on her knees. Something similar is hear from the side of our radicals. [Slezevicius] The initialling of the treaty, in spite of the radical voices mentioned by the minister, has been received essentially very positively. This will be a very positive step toward the normalization of our mutual relations. Following this an agreement on free trade, upgrading the border regime, joint work by the customs houses, and other steps must follow. The political treaty will become the foundation for the acceleration of our further economic relations. [Gylys] The world community reacted positively to the step taken by us. Yesterday, I received a letter from U.S. Secretary of State Christopher. We also received a letter from France and we also expect more support. The world understands that relations with neighboring countries should be normalized. [Slezevicius] [Passage omitted about the assistance given by the Scandinavian countries] [Correspondent] I would like to ask you about Lithuania's relations with Germany. [Gylys] Germany made a significant step by inviting the foreign ministers of the three Baltic states to the capital city. We had a five and one-half hour long consultation session on all issues. The main issue was our integration into Europe both in the economic, security, and political sense. We believe that Germany has adopted a very clear stance; Germany is our ally and demonstrated this unequivocally. [Slezevicius] I would like to mention that Germany is our biggest trading partner in the West. Half of all the trade volume with the West is comprised of trade with Germany. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] What are relations like with other European organizations, including NATO? [Slezevicius] After 14 May last year, our dialogue with the European Union has been developing rather dynamically after the Maastricht Treaty. These are very important stages: our aspiration for a free trade agreement, an intensive dialogue, and consultations on this issue are taking place, much hard work is to be carried out by us. There is also the Partnership for Peace signed by the president. Our aspiration is to set up a peace-keeping battalion together with our neighboring countries, which would be the first serious step -- apart from the Partnership for Peace -- toward integration into the NATO defense structures. We are aware that our gaining membership of NATO is a long process. Therefore, while being aware of this, we have to set up the basis for this in various aspects, which include the standardization of weapons, using the same methodology, and so on. [passage omitted] The confirmation by Germany that compensation will be paid for the damage [inflicted on Lithuania during World War II] has been reached. It is evident that the process of negotiations on this issue should be accelerated, and of course it must be specified in which way and by which dates this compensation will be met. [end recording]
