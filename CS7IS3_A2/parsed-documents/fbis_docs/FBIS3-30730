[Begin Krajisnik recording] We do not have any information at present. The only thing that we know is that the Serbian side did not do it. However, we have some indications, suspicions, that there is even a possibility of this having been committed by a third side, neither the Serbian nor the Muslim side, but a side that does not want an agreement to be reached between the Muslims and the Serbs. We had been on a very good way to signing a document similar to the document and the statement signed between the Serbs and the Croats, and just at the time of this rapprochement, we found ourselves in the situation of these talks being undermined. We cannot say what forces these are. There are too many interested parties that would want the war to continue here and that do not want rapprochement between the Muslims and the Serbs.
