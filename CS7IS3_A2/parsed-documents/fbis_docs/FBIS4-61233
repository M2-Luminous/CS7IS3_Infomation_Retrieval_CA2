The parliamentary decree recognizes that the government decisions and presidential edicts according to which the agrarian reform is being carried out "are often contradictory and sometimes simply wrong." As a result of the economic policy of the last three years "the country's agro-industrial complex is in the grip of an extremely grave crisis." The Ministry of Agriculture and the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences were instructed to carry out additional work on the program within one month, placing the emphasis on specific protectionist measures for the agro-industrial complex. But that will either happen or not. As yet one thing is certain: Peasants will not learn before the end of the sowing campaign what kind of policy they can expect from their state in the fall.
