Comrade Kim Chong-il is directing deep attention to strengthening the motive force of the socialist movement.

He published in recent years his works "The Workers' Party of Korea Organizes and Guides All the Victories of our People", "Our Socialism Centred on the Masses Shall Not Perish" and "On the Fundamentals of Revolutionary Party Building" in which he put forward fundamental principles that should be maintained in the building and activities of the working-class party to build a new revolutionary party capable of rebuilding the socialist movement and the ways for their implementation and gave correct answers to many theoretical and practical matters arising in the international arena, thus making undying contributions to the development of the socialist movement. The Workers' Party and the people of Korea now under the guidance of Comrade Kim Chong-il are determinedly defending and maintaining the Korean-style socialism and bringing the advantages and vitality of socialism into full play with the might of the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses.
