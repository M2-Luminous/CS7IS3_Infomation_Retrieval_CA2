A 40-year-old man died of the disease recently. The symptoms of the disease which has claimed victims in the age-group of four to 50 years, includes mild fever and loose motion. Lack of adequate staff at the only health centre here has deprived the villagers of medical aid and they are forced to rely on quacks. Many of the better-off Villagers have deserted their homes fearing the disease, which is suspected to be meningitis. Meanwhile, some 10 persons have reportedly died of dysentry in the nearby-Parlakhemeundi town recently. Official sources, however, put the death toll at two. Some 200 persons, including children, are said to have been affected.
