The meeting reviewed results of the one-year pilot project in which Ha Giang was picked by the government as a socioeconomic development model for the mountain region. After listening to the reports of Ha Giang leaders on the implementation of socioeconomic programs in the past year, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Khanh, and representatives of government ministries and sectors discussed socioeconomic programs for Ha Giang in 1994. They suggested concrete measures for these programs stressing the need to deploy local resources in the effective use of central government-subsidized capital. On a per capita basis, this province receives among the highest subsidy for provinces. The delegates also discussed the responsibility of government ministries and sectors in helping the locality achieve its socioeconomic targets in accordance with government directives. Prime Minister stressed that last year's achievements attested to the great efforts of the party organization and the multi-ethnic people to overcome all the difficulties a newly formed province faces in using government assistance effectively, and in coordinating with central ministries and sectors. From the Ha Giang experiment, other mountain provinces can learn leadership and management at every level, the division of responsibilities, and coordination between localities and ministries and sectors at the central level. On orientations for future economic activities, the prime minister suggested that Ha Giang Province move from a self-sufficient and self-reliant economy, and develop manufacturing in 1994 as a solid base for further progress. The province should establish areas that specialize in high-value and high-yield plants, trees, or livestock. It should also set a dateline to complete the settled-home and settled-farming campaign for some 500 households, which are still living and practising nomadic lives and farming, and for over 2,300 households who have now settled down, but are still practicing nomadic farming. Slash-and-burn farming should be prevented, reforestation on empty land and bare hills and mountains should be sped up, and about 2,000 hectares of poor forest need to be replanted. Small and medium-scale industries should be developed, especially manufacturing and processing. The prime minister also reminded the province to develop small hydroelectricity projects to exploit local energy sources for industry and daily use. On social and cultural aspects, the prime minister has urged Ha Giang to quickly develop the people-initiated education model, especially in the building of schools. This is so that in the next two or three years, all local schools would be properly built structures with tile-roofing and would be able to take in 60 percent of the children of school-going age who are not in school at present. In each particular ethnic group, there should be an appropriate model to promote hygienic living and eating habits, and family planning. Party cadres and members and youth federation members should be models. These criteria should be used in cadre and party member assessment. The province should also also strive to solve the water shortage affecting nearly 100,000 people, especially for those living in mountainous areas. Cultural activities should be brought to the grassroots level. The indigenous, cultural characteristics should be maintained, while obsolete and superstitious practices that cause losses and wastage should be done away with. On direction and management, the prime minister has requested the relevant ministries and sectors at central level to work out separate programs for Ha Giang Province in their respective areas. They should form a specialized team for each specific area and learn from their experiences. Various agencies in Ha Giang should work closely with cadres at district and village levels. Each cadre of the party committee should be assigned to be responsible for one hamlet or tribal village. The most capable cadres should be assigned to be responsible for the most difficult tasks. There should training be and advanced programs for ethnic cadres selected from mass movements, especially in remote and inaccessible areas.
