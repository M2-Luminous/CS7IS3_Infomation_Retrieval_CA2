It, in particular, says that despite the initially realistic nature of the sides' approaches to the fleet's quantitative indices at the negotiations in Sevastopol, the Russian side was trying to understate the numerical strength of the personnel of the Black Sea Fleet ships by more than two times. A well-reasoned stand of the Ukrainian military allowed to coordinate the quantitative parameters, including the lists of the Black Sea Fleet amphibious means, ships, and vessels that are to become part of the Ukrainian Naval Forces. At the same time, the problem of the temporary basing of the Russian Navy on the Ukrainian territory failed to be solved, says the statement. The Russian side was insisting that the Russian Navy should be based at all the facilities in Crimea while Ukraine's Naval Forces should be based beyond the borders of the peninsula. The Ukrainian delegation provided a well-reasoned proof of the fact that a functioning naval fleet cannot be created without the Crimean bases. However, Russia's approaches remained unchanged. Moreover, says the statement, showing no wish to pay attention to common sense, to understand the legitimate stand of Ukraine regarding the basing of its own naval forces on its own territory, the Russian delegation terminated the negotiations and disappeared without any explanations. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry press service is authorized to declare that the Ukrainian side regrets such a behavior of the Russian delegation, which does not comply with the norms of the international negotiations ethics. Ukraine's Defense Ministry places all the responsibility for the breakdown of the negotiations upon the Russian side and reports its readiness to continue the disrupted negotiations at any time.
