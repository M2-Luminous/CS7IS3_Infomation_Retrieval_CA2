There Is No Money and No Work"] [Text] Krasnoyarsk -- The situation in the military-industrial complex' Siberian domains is becoming explosive: The many-thousands-strong collective of one of thje biggest production facilities in the Russian defense industry -- the Krasnoyarsk Machine Building Plant, a state enterprise upon which an order has been conferred -- is in a state of turmoil. The missile builders are taking a tough stand and demanding money and work. On the last working day of last week around 500 people "besieged" the plant's management, and by evening practically the entire shift at the Krasnoyarsk Machinebuilding Plant was participating in an emergency meeting. General Director V. Gupalov was taken to hospital for intensive care, suffering from an attack of angina pectoris. The disturbances spilled over from the territory of the secret plant onto the streets; workers went off to see the governor in search of the truth, threatening to blockade the kray administration building and seal off the roads if he did not help immediately. There was another meeting on Monday where, as the "Krasmash" directors informed IZVESTIYA, the collective by and large agreed with the proposals made by the plant's leadership for stabilizing the situation. Gupalov flew to Moscow. It has been said that the government has allocated money. But this money has not appeared yet. So a new outburst of passions may occur at any moment. "Krasmash's" customer -- the Ministry of Defense -- has failed to pay the missile manufacturers 11.3 billion rubles [R] for the state order carried out last year. Wages have not been paid for four months, and there is no money for the absolute essentials. Technical Director L. Kovrigin told IZVESTIYA that the plant leadership has appealed to the president, the premier, the Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Finance. At the end of December V. Chernomyrdin gave instructions for the debts to be paid off during January. Security Council Secretary O. Lobov reported that the president wrote the following resolution on the appeal from the missile manufacturers: For immediate and strict implementation. Nevertheless, the plant has not received the money. The director's order on the closure of the assembly shops as of 15 February for six weeks -- as it stands at the moment -- has added fuel to the flames. Those who have not taken enforced leave will work three days a week (until now the plant has had a four-day week). The point is that in recent years, the Ministry of Finance has not only not been in a hurry to settle its accounts, but even to conclude contracts with the plant. Under the law on the state order, "Krasmash" should obtain a contract two years before the manufacturing deadline, since the cycle of manufacture of the articles takes up more than one year. The plant was meant to have been given an advance by 1 February for the purchase of vital materials. The contract has still not been signed and the money has not been transferred. This practice has become the norm. Others would doubtless interpret it as the fact that their services are no longer needed. But "Krasmash" has continued to selflessly forge the motherland's missile shield. The conversion of the leading brains in the military-industrial complex is a very difficult matter. Judging by his behavior, which is not consonant with the economic situation, the general director is continuing to be more worried about the Russian defense capability than about the fate of the labor collective entrusted to him. The director has remained a general, but has not become an entrepreneur. Which may be pleasant to the state, but not to the workers, the reserves of whose selfless devotion have run dry. At the moment it is the local authorities who are settling up for the debts to the military-industrial complex. Governor V. Zubov has allocated 1 billion to the machine builders. This will be enough to pay October's wages and part of November's. The missile builders have received assistance from the budget by dint of their strength, although the situation of other groups in the population is scarcely much better. Workers in high schools, colleges, and universities are in a state of combat readiness for mass protest actions. The list of enterprises in the kray which have come to a standstill or are working at half-strength is breath-taking. The ship-building plant has just stopped carrying out the military order, and its workers have been sent off on a three-week vacation. The trade union committee has, of course, put forward some demands... The professional guardians of the people are increasingly feeling that they are "in their element." The unforgettable appeal to the proletariat to unite is in use again. Communists are proposing to extend the spheres of influence of the strike committees, and the executive committee of the "Trudovoye Krasnoyarye" movement is appealing for the formation of a united city strike committee. The revolt at "Krasmash" has been brewing for a long time and seems to be entirely natural. At one time the empire of the missile builders had been divided into six plants, and in a single year of their free existence, matters took an upward turn for capable people. But in 1992, under pressure from the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Industry, the State Committee for the Management of State Property scorned the laws, the opinion of the labor collectives, and economic expediency, and drove five plants into the stable of the military-industrial complex once again, thereby placing them under a single boss. Having glued together an unviable monster, the state has not nevertheless even determined whether it needs "the most important strategic output," on whose production "Krasmash" has the monopoly. No money is being found to pay for it. Well, if even the instructions of the president and the prime minister are not being carried out, should the basic production be carved up for scrap? After all, in principle it cannot respecialize. Or does Russia still need ballistic missiles for submarines and other complex military output? Why does the state allow chiefs of shops and workers and officials at local level to be tormented by these questions? In the past we use to be called Upper Volta with missiles. I don't know about the Volta bit, although I suppose there is a similarity, but all the indications are that it may be tough as regards the missiles.
