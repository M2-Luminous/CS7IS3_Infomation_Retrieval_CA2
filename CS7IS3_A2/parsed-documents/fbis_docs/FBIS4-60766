Einseln participated in a meeting of commanders of armed forces of the countries of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC]. The meeting discussed ways to develop the NATO Partnership for Peace program, and also, the formation of a Baltic peacekeeping battalion, Einseln said at a press conference in Tallinn today. The peacekeeping company to be set up in Estonia under the joint Baltic force scheme will be ready to participate in joint maneuvers of the international peacekeeping forces in the Netherlands, due in late October, the Estonian general said at a meeting of the NACC peacekeeping group in Brussels Thursday [28 April]. A unit of 20 will be sent to participate in the joint maneuvers from Estonia, the country's commander in chief said today. "If we want to join the NATO some time in the future, we must start taking part in such kind of events as early as possible," he said. At a joint neeting of the armed force commanders of NACC and the NATO Committee for Military Issues on Wednesday, Einseln expressed hope that the Baltic peacekeeping battalion will be ready to fulfill its tasks from November 1995. Einseln told reporters today that the formation of the Baltic battalion had gained great support. There exists a readiness to come in with assistance in training, and possibly, also for the part of equipment, he added. According to information obtained by BNS, Einseln has submitted to the Defense Ministry a draft ruling on the creation of the detached peacekeeping company, or the Estonian part of the joint Baltic force. The ruling had to be adopted by the government. The draft says the company would be set up as a separate legal entity under the Estonian Defense Ministry, with its own seal and symbols. The draft foresees that the ministry would draw up the lists of the new company's structure and composition, and submit to the government for approval a draft budget of the new unit. The ministry and the Central Staff must see to it that the unit be manned in due time. The Foreign Ministry will formally apply to the UN Headquarters for authorization of the new peacekeeping unit and its submission to the UN peacekeeping force. Estonia now has also its representative, Lieutenant Peeter Lans, at the NATO headquarters in Brussels to oversee the country's cooperation with NATO and activity under the Partnership for Peace plan.
