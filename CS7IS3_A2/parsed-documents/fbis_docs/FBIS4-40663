A long, open, and interested conversation about the plight of the Republic, responsibility of the authorities, and the nation's unity took place. Without these things there is no way out of the crisis and no well-being for the people. The president told the veterans about the situation in the Republic, about the authorities' efforts to lift the country out of the economic crisis and stabilize the situation. Akayev paid special attention to such a worrying tendency as a growing rift between the representative and Executive Branches of power, between the president and the Zhogorku Kenesh. Dangerous political gambling, intrigues, blackmail, and hysterical witch-hunting by certain media will not result in anything good. They threaten to divide society and bring about a situation similar to those taking place in Tajikistan or Russia. The president asked the veterans to use all their wisdom and lifelong experience to persuade both deputies and public opinion that a course towards confrontation, elucidation of relations, and discredit is fruitless and dangerous. I have quite a few compromising materials on some of the deputies, the president said, and I could have used them at the sessions of the Zhogorku Kenesh. But I would not like to resort to this. I would not like to discredit the deputies' corps. Let law and order enforcement bodies deal with investigations of such materials. Our parliament has turned into an investigation commission. The veterans supported the president. They demanded he make state power stricter. The heads of local administrations should be controlled tougher. The veterans promised [words indistinct]. Rustenbekov, state secretary and head of the presidential apparatus, and Sapubek Begaliev, president of the assembly of Kyrgyzstani peoples, attended the meeting.
