FR941005-0-00004 FR941005-0-00002 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Parts 34, 35, 50, 73, and 110 RIN 3150&hyph;AF19 NRC Library; Address Change AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is amending its regulations regarding the availability of material approved for incorporation by reference to make a needed change to the address provided for the NRC Library. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael T. Lesar, Chief, Rules Review Section, Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Telephone (301) 415&hyph;7163. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is revising those portions of 10 CFR chapter I that reference the availability of materials that have been approved by the Director of the Office of the Federal Register for incorporation by reference. This amendment revises the text of 10 CFR chapter I to indicate the current location where this material is available for inspection. The material that has been approved for incorporation by reference is maintained and available for inspection at the NRC Library, which is now located at 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852&hyph;2738. Because this is an amendment dealing with agency practice and procedures, the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). The amendment is effective upon publication in the Federal Register . Good cause exists to dispense with the usual 30-day delay in the effective date because the amendment is of a minor and administrative nature dealing with an address change. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this final rule. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval numbers 3150&hyph;0007, &hyph;0010, &hyph;0002, and &hyph;0036.
