The National Directorate Council (CDN) of the social democratic organization of which Perez is one of the founding leaders made the decision in a meeting that began with violent incidents in which one participant was injured. The party organization, comprised of 289 members and delegates, thus ratified a statement issued and adopted by the National Executive Council [CEN] on 19 May, a day after Perez' incarceration. He is charged with misappropriation and embezzlement of secret funds in 1989. In statements to the media prior to the session, the former president, one of AD's founding leaders, attributed his expulsion to a minority of party leaders and asserted: "No one will be able to expel me from AD members' hearts." When the forum began, a group comprised primarily of young leaders who support the former president angrily protested the exclusion of one of their members from the list of CDN participants. This resulted in a squabble during which chairs were thrown. The proposal was presented by Secretary General Luis Alfaro Ucero, who controls the party machinery, and it was opposed by the members of the so-called renewal groups within the organization, led by former presidential candidate Claudio Fermin. Spokesmen of that faction insist that the rank and file do not support the measure, adding that this goes beyond the "Perez case" because Alfaro Ucero's actions are directed against Fermin's plans to run for secretary general. This would pave the way within the organization for leaders shaped by the former president. These people demand that the party's internal elections, scheduled for November, be held immediately.
