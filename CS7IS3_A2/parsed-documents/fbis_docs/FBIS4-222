This is not the checklist for a family hike. It's a sample of the AWB's [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] list of precautions to ensure that members will be able to deal with the pandemonium it predicts will erupt around the time of the election. The full list, which includes ensuring that there are sufficient weapons and ammunition for all family members and enough food for all pets, was distributed at schools in the Pretoria area this week. Its more extreme entries are enough to inspire bunker-building activities among rightwingers, frantic shopping for canned food among DP [Democratic Party] supporters and a lot of gun-cleaning in the northern suburbs. "In the time which is approaching it will be wise to be prepared at all times. Herewith the guidelines which will ensure you will not be caught off-guard," begins the four-page document. First up is to ensure you have enough water. That means protecting all water sources and getting plenty of chlorine pills. Food supplies should be canned or preserved and not require water for preparation, it says. Pick 'n Pay group marketing director Martin Rosen says sales of non-perishable foods soared countrywide this week. "People are certainly stocking up, especially on things like tinned foods, long-life milk and milk powder. "Each of our stores is several million rands up on budget -- up to 50 percent -- for March as a result," he says. The frantic buying is fairly evenly spread around the country. Rosen says supply problems have been compounded by strikes which have affected some of the grocery chain's suppliers. If the pamphlet's medical hints are anything to go by, do not expect to be able to get on to any first-aid courses in the next three weeks. Antibiotics, pain killers and stomach medication could also be in short supply. Its communications suggestions will likely result in a lot of neighbourly visits and improved cellular phone sales. Despite intimations that the list is not "the alpha and omega", its author says only those who are prepared will survive. An AWB head office spokesman said the phamphlet was probably compiled by one of the organisation's local committees, which were responsible for ensuring the safety of their supporters.
