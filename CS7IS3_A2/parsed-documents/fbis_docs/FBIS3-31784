Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "there is not a single inch of territory on the forward defense lines running from the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin Vrh, and Grabez to the barracks on Grabez that was not hit by at least one shell. Since the morning hours, Bihac and its outskirts are being destroyed by howitzers, mortars, multiple rocket launchers, and Bofors. The material damage is immense and there is a significant number of casualties." He says that the members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps have today stopped fresh chetnik attacks at Grabez and Hasin Vrh, which were directly supported from the area of the so-called Serbian autonomous province of Krajina. "In addition to this," says Sadikovic, "provocations intensified on the demarcation lines with the remains of the para-army of the so-called Kladusa autonomy.

The consequences of this cowardly shelling are several lightly and seriously injured citizens, two of whom are Croats. The material damage is immense."
