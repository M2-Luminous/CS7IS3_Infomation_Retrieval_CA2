Our correspondent has carried out an interview with him in connection with his visit: [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Please tell us what issues were discussed between you and the Bosnian authorities during your visit to Sarajevo. [Velayati] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. We wanted to go on this visit for the last few months. But, the preparatory work that was to be carried out by the United Nations was not done. They informed us during the last few days that the United Nations had agreed. In our talks, the issue of opening the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy in Sarajevo, bilateral relations, and the recent changes between our relations and Croatia were discussed, taking into account the fact that the expansion of our relations with the Croatia will make a great contribution toward our relations with Bosnia. During the last two years, the intention of the Islamic Republic of Iran has been to pave the way for reconciliation and cooperation between Croats and Muslims. Today, both the Croats and Bosnian Muslims know that the tripartite relations between us, the Croats, and Muslims have turned into such organized and secure relations, that the more these relations consolidate the more the chances of our cooperation and through us, that of other Islamic countries increases with the Bosnian Muslims. Mr. Izetbegovic, in his talks, in his official talks, clearly specified and said that Iran has played a very crucial role in the destiny of Bosnia and this will be recorded in history later. But, Mr. Izetbegovic said, that what I can say that if it was not for Iran, Bosnia would have had a different destiny. The Islamic Republic of Iran's embassy was opened in the presence of Mr. Izetbegovic. [Correspondent] In general, how do you describe the situation in Sarajevo, and how much of a positive effect the assistance given by the people of Iran will have on the spirit of the people of Sarajevo? [Velayati] The destruction that has remained from the long-term aggression of the Serbs is an obvious sign of an all-round oppression that has been inflicted on the Muslim people of Sarajevo who up to now are under the full siege of the Serbs. However, the people enjoy a very high spirit. One can feel very easily the belief and devotion of the people to Islam and freedom of Bosnia among the people of Bosnia. Concerning Iran, as I have mentioned, the people are united in their views that the Islamic Republic of Iran is their most honest defender and supporter. They do not mention this from an analytical viewpoint, but they say it plainly if anyone asks the people and officials of Bosnia. [end recording]
