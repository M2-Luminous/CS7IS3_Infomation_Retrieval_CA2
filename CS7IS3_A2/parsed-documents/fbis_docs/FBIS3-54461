FBIS3-54461 "drnes016__s94002" FBIS-NES-94-016-S Document Type:Daily Report 25 January 1994 * Voice, Vision Response to Majles Inquiry 94LA0040A Tehran JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI in Persian 8, 9, 11 Nov 93 94LA0040A Tehran JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI Language: Persian Article Type:CSO [8 Nov pp 14, 15] [Text] News Service. Following the publication of the critical report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group of the Majles on the activities of the Voice and Vision, the public relations office of this organization sent a 31-page response in answer to the first part of the criticism of the Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group, the full text of which is as follows. Response [Part I] Because there are many nonfactual points and ambiguities in the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, which was read on 11 and 12 Aban [2, 3 November] in the Majles, in order to clarify matters for the public, especially the honorable deputies of the Majles, we declare the errors and accusations as follows. Before entering the discussion, it is necessary to make a few points by way of a preface. A) The issue of inquiry and investigation: 1) The procedures for the absorption and employment of the revolutionary, Hezbollah forces in the organization. 2) The activities of the honorable director of the Voice and Vision organization, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, and the procedure for the selection of subsequent directors and their activities in spreading Islamic culture, in accordance with the ratified policies of the organization. 3) Procedures to conform the programs of the Vision with the standards of the sacred religious law. 4) Reason for broadcasting scenes from the Vision of the Islamic Republic that show Western culture and result in the creation of an unsuitable model among various strata, particularly the young. The members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group were Mr. Movahhedi-Savoji, Dr. Hasan Kamran, Mr. Seyyed 'Ali Akbar Parvaresh, Mr. Mohammad Reza Mavalizadeh, Mr. Mohsen Kuhkan, Mr. 'Ali Yusefpur, and Mr. Lotfollah Zare'i-Qanavati. Holding more than 50 official meetings, this group spent more than 150 hours and ultimately in the session on 19/05/1372 [10 August 1993] approved the report with a majority vote. The points of the Voice and Vision organization concerning this part of the report are: The management of the organization finds it necessary to thank all the self-sacrificers of the organization who in the course of eight years of the imposed war and the bombing of cities, with their active and unassuming presence on the front lines of the battle front and offering dozens of martyrs and the broadcast of thousands of hours of war programs, immortalized the epic resistance of our brave and courageous people. In the inquiry and investigation report, not only is no mention made of this, but also with hurtful sentences it interprets all that effort and self-sacrifice as lack of solidarity with the war. 1) During the first days of the formation of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, even before the decrees had been issued officially by the honorable speaker of the Majles, or at least the copy of the decrees had not been sent to this organization, Mr. Movahhedi-Savoji in a written invitation invited the director of the Voice and Vision organization to take part in a meeting of the group. The director of the organization went to the Majles at the appointed time to take part in the meeting. Upon his arrival, it became clear that the members had not expected the presence of the director of the Voice and Vision. The understanding was that the invitation had been extended for the presentation of a written document, but no cooperation ensued, and from the members of the group only five persons were present at the meeting. Mr. Movahhedi-Savoji expressed his thanks and announced: Since we did not know whether you would attend or not, some members, such as Mr. Parvaresh, went on a trip and some were not informed. In any case, after the usual pleasantries, Mr. Movahhedi-Savoji, as the chairman of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, asked Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, the director of the Voice and Vision, to make a statement. In this meeting, thanking the Inquiry and Investigation Group, Mr. Hashemi made the following points: 1) You know that during his life the Imam paid special attention to the Voice and Vision, and, according to the supplement to the Constitution, it is operated under the supervision of the grand leader. Therefore, it has always been the organization closet to the religious guardian and leader. 2) The Voice and Vision, as the mouthpiece of the Islamic revolution, has numerous supporters and opponents. At the head of the supporters of this medium are the Imam, God rest his soul; the grand leader; the honorable officials of the regime; the Hezbollah nation; and the Muslims of the world, and at the head of the opponents of this medium are the counterrevolutionary groups and those damaged by the revolution, such as the hypocrites, the leftist minigroups, the Hojjatiyeh Society, the supporters of the United States and Israel, the monarchists, etc., who have frequently tried to destroy this organization under various pretexts. 3) Even though inquiry and investigation is one of the duties of the Majles, it is an issue that is judiciary by nature, and in the Islamic judiciary system, the most important qualifications of the judge are that he be just and impartial. Unfortunately, with the presence of Mr. 'Ali Akbar Parvaresh in the Inquiry and Investigation Group, given his past history in the Hojjatiyeh Society and the opposition he expressed from 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] with regard to the management of Mr. Hashemi, and especially in the course of the events of 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] in the Voice and Vision, which resulted in the dismissal of the general manager by the Supervisory Council at the time and the reappointment of Mr. Hashemi by the late Imam to his position, Mr. Parvaresh and some like-minded persons said many things against the interference of the Imam and his family, which so upset the Imam that in his letter of 4 Tir 1362 [25 June 1983], he wrote: "It should be mentioned that it has been heard that some in my household do things contrary to my knowledge. Because this is not true, the person who has said such things must repent before God..." Mr. Hashemi added: The presence of Mr. Parvaresh, with such a history, in the Inquiry and Investigation Group has compromised the "impartiality" of the group. At this point, the present members, expressing that they had no knowledge of Mr. Parvaresh's past history and the events in 1362 in the Voice and Vision, referring to their own past, promised to observe impartiality and not to allow anyone to influence their vote. 4) The Voice and Vision broadcasts annually about 82,000 hours of radio and 12,500 hours of television programs throughout the country in more than 19 languages. During the period under consideration by the group, from 1360 [21 March 1981-20 March 1982], when Mr. Hashemi took over the responsibility, it broadcast more than 1 million hours of programs. To examine 1 million hours of programming and express opinions about them, for that matter responsible opinions, would be very difficult, and considering the opponents and supporters of the Voice and Vision, the iNquiry and Investigation Group cannot base its judgment on what it hears. Rather, in every case that it intends to express its opinion, it must examine it directly and look at the documented evidence. 5) In regards to religious issues, the announcement was made that since the late Imam, in addition to being the owner of the revolution and the founder of the sacred regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran, was a qualified religious jurist and a proven source of emulation, we have acted in accordance with the jurisprudential opinions of the Imam in the religious issues of the Voice and Vision, such as the way women appear on television or in music, and in such cases the committee cannot make a judgement based on its own views. Rather, it must announce its opinion on the basis of religious decrees and the opinions of the late Imam concerning the above-mentioned issues. In conclusion, he announced that in order to avoid any sort of doubt about lack of cooperation by the organization that can be misused by individuals with ill will or those who want to create doubt, all the information and documents needed by the committee should be requested in writing, and the Voice and Vision organization will send the information to you in writing. 6) From the date of 14/07/1371 [6 October 1992], Mr. Movahhedi-Savoji, the head of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, in several correspondences requested information from the Voice and Vision on 88 cases. All the requested information, which consisted of about 8,000 pages, was forwarded to the Inquiry and Investigation Group. In the report that the Inquiry and Investigation Group broadcast on 11 and 12 Aban [2, 3 November] of this year from the Majles podium, except for one or two cases (which will be referred to later), not only is no mention made of the documents sent, but also the reporters of the group most unfairly have stated in several places in the report "despite lack of cooperation by the organization" or "given the lack of cooperation by the organization..." 7) When reading the report, Mr. Parvaresh announced that despite the lack of cooperation of the organization, the Inquiry and Investigation Group obtained its information through tangible and intangible ways. 8) In the course of the year that the inquiry and investigation activities were under way, a great deal of information about the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group were given to the Voice and Vision organization, which, due to compliance with the directives of the late Imam and the grand leader and in consideration for our belief and faith, we have avoided revealing. But we will implicitly refer to one or two points that are very effective in the analysis of the report of the group, because lack of attention to these points may seriously compromise the facts. A) In addition to Mr. 'Ali Akbar Parvaresh, who was active in the Hojjatiyeh Society, and we have referred to his ideological foundations, some of the other members of the organization also have had a history of cooperation with and activities in the Hojjatiyeh Society. B) One of the members of the group married the wife of an executed Hypocrite as his second wife and presents her as the wife of a "martyr." But later it became clear that first she was the wife of an executed Hypocrite, and Second it was the same wife who had drawn her previous husband into the Hypocrite group. Hence, the ideological foundations of some of the intangible elements of the Inquiry and Investigation Group become clear: the "Hojjatiyeh" and the "hypocrites." Also, the views of the "Hojjatiyeh" and the "hypocrites" concerning the late Imam and the grand leader and the supporters of the Imam are quite clear and requires no further explanation. With attention to the above-mentioned points, we will now deal with the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group that was read from the podium of the Majles on 11 and 12 Aban this year. In concluding this preface, the management of the organization finds it necessary to thank all the self-sacrificers who in the course of the eight years of imposed war and bombing of cities, with their active and unassuming presence on the front lines of the battle, offering dozens of martyrs, and the broadcast of thousands of hours of war programs immortalized the resistance of our brave and courageous people and to which in the inquiry and investigation report not only is no reference made, but with hurtful sentences all that effort and self-sacrifice interpret it as lack of solidarity for the war. The management also expresses its appreciation to all the committed managers and employees of the organization who, despite the shortages and minimal resources, in the most critical conditions operated the Voice and Vision organization in the best possible manner and were praised frequently by Imam Khomeyni and the grand leader, Ayatollah Khamene'i, and who are presented in the inquiry and investigation report as frightened and alienated people, for certainly the munificent, just God will never let their efforts go unrewarded. In the preface, the Inquiry and Investigation Group states: "The Voice and Vision programs can be produced in three ways, negative programs, neutral or indifferent programs, and programs in support of the revolution and Islam." Voice and Vision's response: This kind of categorization is a creation of the Inquiry and Investigation Group. In the general categorization, in terms of goals, the Voice and Vision programs have the following objectives: 1) Guiding-instructional 2) Information-educational 3) Entertainment-recreational Unfortunately, the nation that follows the Imam, on 13 Aban [4 November], the day of death to America and the day of the exile of the Imam, must hear from the mouth of one of the Majles deputies the theory of the "deviancy" of the "Crocodile Tears" serial. If this is not an actual example of cultural invasion for the enemy to speak against the opinions of the Imam through the mouths of the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group at the start of 13 Aban, then what is it? In regards to the "Crocodile Tears" serial, the content of the "Crocodile Tears" serial was against the liberals and the agents of the United States and was approved by the late Imam. The program has a guiding-instructional goal, that is, presenting the message with the intention of educating the society in the long term, and is based on a single point and the value foundation is in Islamic principles and beliefs. Programs with this goal, through instruction to do good and prevent doing evil, reminders and warnings, result in discussing the preservation and strengthening of the virtues and negating evil and prohibited acts both in internal and in social and general forms. In the programs with information-educational goals, information is presented in news and general forms. General information results in an increase in the general knowledge of the audience and is necessarily not tied to time. News information is the kind of information that is particularly important and is tied to time. Educational programs in classic and nonclassic forms. Classical education is education that is somehow related to the official education of the country or assists it, such as lessons in philosophy, ethics, decrees, mathematics, physics, etc. Nonclassical educational programs are those which result in the competence of various people in the society in connection with various issues, such as: Programs related to the Fire Department, driving and traffic, health, planting trees, repairing household appliances, security, work environment, children's health, etc. Programs with entertainment-recreational goals: Presenting messages with the purpose of creating happiness, joy, peace of mind, and creating a possitive attitude in the audience, and also creating readiness to accept individual and social responsibilities and preventing the waste of people's leisure time. Hence, the categorizations or definitions given by the Inquiry and Investigation Group have no basis in the Voice and Vision organization and have the goal of merely showing the programs in a negative light. After this rather erratic preface, the Inquiry and Investigation Group examines the films and serials and writes, in other words, from 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985] to 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], about 900 films and serials have been broadcast from Networks 1 and 2, of which number about 700 were foreign films and serials, which were produced highly technically and artistically and subsequently are very attractive and effective...and of these 700 cases, it only refers to one motion picture, "Billy Bud," and concludes that all these films were corrupt and spread Western culture. Voice and Vision Response First, according to Paragraph 2 ratified by the Majles, the subject of inquiry and investigation was the activities of the general manager of the Voice and Vision, Mr. Hashemi, who was appointed on 15 Mordad 1360 [6 August 1981] as the general manager of the Voice and Vision. It is not clear why the Voice and Vision in this examination started from 1363, whereas the general manager of the organization started his work from 15 Mordad 1360. Second, according to the lists that were sent to the Inquiry and Investigation Group, from 1360 [21 March 1981-20 March 1982] to 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], in Vision Network 1 alone 1,552 domestic shows were produced and the names of all the serials were sent to them. With the method of the Voice and Vision in rerunning programs, that is, broadcasting a serial once every three years, on the average, each of these segments has been shown twice in 10 years. Moreover, serials and shows that are produced in the provincial centers must be added to these numbers. During the period under examination, about 3,500 cases alone were domestic serials and shows broadcast from the two television networks. It is unclear to the officials of the Voice and Vision why the Inquiry and Investigation Group, despite having the names of all the programs and the production statistics, has reduced this number to one-seventeenth of what it should be. Clearly, what they meant to do was to show the number and percentage of foreign programs as large and accuse the television of propagating Western culture. In this area, the second very important point is that in the years after the victory of the Islamic revolution, the sources for the procurement of foreign programs of the Voice and Vision have been mostly Eastern and Islamic countries, such as Japan, China, India, Egypt, Algeria, Syria, and Indonesia, and Western sources have been used less often. Japanese programs have had the largest share in foreign programs. Among the foreign serials, those such as "Ezzoddin Qasam," "Tariq ol-Qods," "Seyyed Jamaleddin Asadabadi," or films such as "Mohammad (Prophet of God)," "Fire Under the Ashes," etc., [Paragraphing as published] exist, the subject matter of which is 100-percent Islamic and epic, or serials such as "Away From Home (Ushin)" and "The Teacher of the Island," which were not only not educationally misleading but also, with dubbing and modifications, have been very instructional. Now, why the Investigation Group in mentioning foreign programs only chooses to analyze one or two examples or why it considers all the programs "Western" is unclear to us. The Inquiry and Investigation Group, after quoting several errors and lies, concludes that "therefore, in the 14 years that have passed since the Voice and Vision was established, our young people have benefitted from foreign culture 75 percent and our own culture 25 percent!" In other words, an average of 14.12 percent is the share of the foreign programs in Networks 1 and 2. With the above description, although many of these programs have been produced in other countries, they have values acceptable and respected by our society. It must be noted that this situation of 14.12 percent concerns Networks 1 and 2, which broadcast about 6,000 hours annually. Also taking into consideration about 6,500 hours of television programs in the provincial centers, the foreign share of which is nearly zero, the share of foreign programs in the programs of the Vision is reduced to about 7 percent. And if we add to them the radio programs of Tehran and the provincial centers that have no foreign programs, the broadcast of about 54,000 hours of programs annually, the share of foreign programs in the Voice and Vision programs is about 1.3 percent. Let us review the sentence by the Inquiry and Investigation Group on this matter: "In other words, after 14 years since the Voice and Vision was established, our young people have benefitted 75 percent from foreign culture and 25 percent from our own culture." However, as was stated, in the total of programs of the Voice and Vision broadcast domestically, the share of foreign programs is only 1.3 percent, and the share of our own programs is 98.7 percent. If the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group were not the deputies of the people in the Majles who have promised on the Koran to sign this oath: "I take an oath on the Koran before Almighty God to guard the sanctity of Islam and preserve the fruits of the Islamic revolution of the Iranian people and the foundations of the Islamic Republic; to guard what the nation has entrusted us with as a just trustee; to observe trustworthiness and piety in carrying out my duties as a deputy;, and always to be steadfast in the independence and victory of the country and preservation of the rights of the people; to serve the people; to defend the Constitution; and in my speeches, writings, and opinions, to keep the independence of the country and the freedom of the people and their interests in mind." We would not say to them: Gentlemen, you who are sitting in a position of judgment and have spent a year, how and with what conscience and piety did you allow yourselves to increase 1.3 percent to 75 percent and reduce 98.7 percent to 25 percent? Is this an example of your piety and your commitment before the Koran and Almighty God? In the continuation of the same discussion, the Inquiry and Investigation Group states: "And this is provided the 25-percent programs of our own are not cut by the quality control blade. For example, the serial `The Active Neighborhood' ridicules the revolution and the regime or the serial, `Crocodile Tears,' which was made at unbelievable cost but many parts of which were omitted due to deviant problems and the segments which were broadcast were the target of widespread protest by the people due to deviant problems...!" Voice and Vision response: In the preface, we said that among the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group are those who were active in the Hojjatiyyeh Society and have Hojjatiyeh ideologies and also those who have married hypocrites, the wife of an executed Hypocrite. Also, Mr. Parvaresh in the events of 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] of the Voice and Vision was among the opponents of the general manager, Mr. Hashemi, and was one of those who had accused the Imam's family unjustly concerning the reappointment of Mr. Hashemi by the late Imam. One of the issues that in those days was the source of conflict was the serial, "Crocodile Tears." The content of "Crocodile Tears" was against the liberals and in a most appropriate manner exposed the liberals and those affiliated with the West, especially the criminal United States. Some elements of a mind like that of Mr. Parvaresh, who in those days had sensitive positions in the Voice and Vision, opposed the serial "Crocodile Tears" vehemently and wanted to prevent its broadcast in any way possible. When the fourth segment of the serial was being broadcast, they had a petition signed to request that the serial be stopped: Mr. Mohammad Hashemi (the general manager of the organization at the time) visited the Imam and asked his honor for instructions in regards to the issue of the petition and the stopping of the serial. The Imam said: "In my opinion, the liberals have deceived those who have signed the petition. The broadcast of the serial should continue." The Imam's opinion was reported in the organization and it was decided that the serial be continued. But a group of a like mind to Mr. Parvaresh, who were influential in those days in broadcasting in Network 1, could not tolerate more than six segments, and after the broadcast of the 9th segment, the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th segments of the serial, which in fact contained the harshest attacks on the liberals and the supporters of the United States, were summed up in one segment under the pretext of antireligious scenes and the announcement was made that the serial was ended. The Imam, God rest his soul, summoned the general manager at the time (Mr. Mohammad Hashemi) and announced that the production and broadcast of the other segments of this serial were to continue and in response to those who have raised questions in regards to the religious aspects of the serial said: "Experts were consulted, they said that there may have been religious violations in the production of this serial, but its broadcast was not in violation of religious law." This announcement was broadcast at that time, after the broadcast of the last segment of the serial from Network 1 and the Vision. Unfortunately, now the Inquiry and Investigation Group has placed its finger on a few instances out of 1,552 domestic production programs, one of which is "Crocodile Tears." Mr. Parvaresh and those like-minded people know well that the Imam approved this serial despite the opposition at the time, asked that it be continued, and neutralized the conspiracy that was instigated by him and those like-minded people in declaring the serial in violation of religious law! Unfortunately, the people who follow the Imam, at the start of 13 Aban [4 November], the day of death of American and the day of the Imam's exile, must hear from one of the deputies of the Majles the opinion that the "Crocodile Tears" serial is "deviant." If this is not an actual example of the cultural invasion of the enemy expressed from the mouth of the members of Inquiry and Investigation Group on 13 Aban against the opinions of the Imam, then what is it? The Inquiry and Investigation Group writes in the continuation of this discussion: "Serials are produced at high cost but with such internal problems that after production they are declared unsuitable for broadcast, for example, the serial "Ziba Beauty Salon" or some of the films that are protested to and declared unsuitable for broadcast, such as "Haji Washington" and "The Death of Yazdgerd." Voice and Vision response: First, the broadcast time of the serial "Ziba Beauty Salon," when it was produced, was projected to be Fall 1372 [1993]; several segments have been broadcast so far and no changes have been made to it. Hence, the tangible and intangible sources of the Inquiry and Investigation Group here, too, have acted cleverly and mischievously and forced them to present an untruthful report. Second, as it was said, the period of inquiry and investigation is the time of management of Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, that is, from Mordad 1360 [23 July-22 August 1981]. However, the production of the films "Haji Washington" and "The Death of Yazdgerd" began in late 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979] in Italy and reached Iran about 1358 [21 March 1979-20 March 1980] and they were never broadcast on television. And if they had been broadcast, it would have no relation to the period of management of Mr. Mohammad Hashemi. And if the claim of the Inquiry and Investigation Group is true, that it was broadcast once and then considered unsuitable for broadcast, it must be counted as a positive measure in the management of Mr. Hashemi. But the question that is raised here is, when the Inquiry and Investigation Group reports on the domestic productions of the Voice and Vision, why does it start from 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985]? In other words, it ignores three years of the activities of the management to show the statistics as low, but when it wants to express a negative point, it returns to the activities of three years earlier, that is, 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979] and 1358 [21 March 1979-20 March 1980]. Is this another indication of piety and fairness? God is the best judge. The Inquiry and Investigation Group in continuation writes: "Of course, of the 25-percent domestic production, only 8 percent is made by the Voice and Vision and the rest is purchased from outside the organization." The Inquiry and Investigation Group shows extreme sensitivity toward the program, "The Sinister Conspiracy," and even unjustly accuses one of the main elements. "The Sinister Conspiracy" was a show concerning the appearance of Zionism and is against Israel. This show, due to its valuable content, has been broadcast three times so far. Voice and Vision response: As was stated, first, domestic production is not 25 percent but 98.7 percent. Second, of this amount, less than half a percent is purchased from outside the organization and the rest, that is, 98.3 percent, is produced within the organization. Besides, of the amount that is purchased from outside, except for motion pictures, the rest is produced under the supervision of the Voice and Vision and then purchased. In this case, in truth, we could not understand what objective the Inquiry and Investigation Committee is pursuing in this false report in order to respond to it. Continuing this discussion, the Inquiry and Investigation Group deals with the "Hezardastan" serial and criticizes this serial for not dealing with such clerical heroes as Modarres and Sheykh Fazlollah Nuri and in continuation writes: In this serial, the assassin of martyr Sheykh Fazlollah Nuri, in a cinematic trick, is presented as a brave, free, emotional, oppressed, justice-seeking, antiforeign, mystical, patriotic person. Voice and Vision response: First, the "Hezardastan" serial began in 1354 [21 March 1975-20 March 1976] with the name "The Silk Road," and until 1360 [21 March 1981-20 March 1982], when Mr. Hashemi assumed this responsibilities, it continued under the same name. More than 18 hours were filmed and a great deal was spent on it (the subject of the serial was a presentation of Reza Khan, the bully, as the Iranian silk road). In 1360, the serial was ordered stopped. The Supervisory Council at the time pursued the issue of the serial and appointed a committee to review the parts that had already been produced, study the script, and take the necessary steps to revise the serial in a way that would make it suitable for broadcast. The group selected by the Supervisory Council began its work under the supervision of the council and after months succeeded in changing the subject of the serial totally and preparing it for broadcast in the best possible form and content. Of course, given the characteristics, the serial was not without minor problems, but on the whole, with the efforts of the committee selected by the Supervisory Council of the time, it became suitable for broadcast. The Inquiry and Investigation Group continues: "In the program `The Seventh Art,' where there is a discussion of the former Soviet cinema (the host of the program is a well-known Westernized person who has inflicted blows on Islam for years in the university environment and has been in conflict with religious forces), the reason for the disintegration of the Soviet government is mentioned as the setting of rules for artists and restriction of their freedom, thereby indicating that the artist must be free to create what he wants, and in this way tries to misguide the artists to deviate from serving Islam and the revolution." Voice and Vision response: Apparently the purpose of the Inquiry and Investigation Group from this segment is to unjustly accuse a Voice and Vision host, a retired person from the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance--as he has claimed--who teaches in universities. Of the accusations they have made against him, nothing has been recorded. His activities in the Voice and Vision have been positive and if in an artistic program he has mentioned one of the faults of the dictatorial communist government, that is, depriving artists of their freedom, how can this be criticized? Does the Inquiry and Investigation Group believe that in the Islamic society artists are not free and are forced to make programs under the pressure of the government? Is this not the same opinion and analysis that frequently the Hypocrite minigroup and other counterrevolutionary minigroups made of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran? Have such claims of the counterrevolutionary groups been able to affect the committed artists and prevent them from serving the Islamic society? Today, one of our best propaganda tools is to make use of committed artists. The same artists have created thousands of art works, including beautiful, epic poems to dignified shows after the revolution. It is not clear to the officials of the Voice and Vision why the Inquiry and Investigation Group, despite having the names of all the programs and production and broadcast statistics, has reduced this number by one-seventeenth. Certainly they intended to make the number and percentage of foreign programs large and accuse the television of propagating Western culture. Gentlemen, you who are sitting in positions of judgment and have spent one year, how and with what conscience and piety did you allow yourselves to increase 1.3 percent foreign programs to 75 percent and decrease 98.7 percent domestic programs to 25 percent? The program "The Seventh Art" is an instructive program full of content and attractive for experts. The Inquiry and Investigation Group has not expressed any opinion concerning the content of this program. Under the pretext of this very sensitive program they have tried to show that "artists in the Islamic society do not have freedom," precisely the same accusations that the Hypocrite minigroup and other counterrevolutionary minigroups have made against the regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Examination of the Programs of Vision Network 1 The Inquiry and Investigation Group refers to the programs of two weeks of the Vision Network 1 during the seven years, one the week of 25/12/1363 to 02/01/1364 [16-22 March 1985], that is, the New Year programs, and another the programs of the week of 26/01/1370 to 01/02/1370 [15-21 April 1991], that is, the week coinciding with the four days of holidays (Fetr celebration holidays), and concludes that 45 percent of the programs of Network 1 were in connection with Islam and the revolution and 55 percent of the programs were indifferent to Islam and the revolution. It also adds that in 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985], foreign films and serials made up 24 percent of all the programs and in 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] this ratio increased to 38 percent of all the programs and writes: "Apparently, the Voice and Vision is gradually losing its Islamic and revolutionary motivation and is becoming indifferent and neutral." The Inquiry and Investigation group then examines the programs of the Vision Network 2. In examining the programs of the two weeks out of seven years, it points out: One is the program of the week of 25/12/1363 to 02/01/1364, that is the 1364 [21 March 1985-20 March 1986] New Year, and another the programs of 07/09/1371 to 14/09/1371 [28 November-5 December 1992]. And it concludes that in this network, too, 36 percent of the programs have the Islamic messages of the revolution and 64 percent of the messages are neutral and unrelated to the revolution and Islam. In the conclusion of this section, it adds: If we consider the total programs of Networks 1 and 2, of the 85 weekly programs of the two networks in 1363, 39.5 hours concerned Islam and the revolution and in 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992], out of 92 hours of weekly programs of the two networks, 33.5 hours concerned the revolution and Islam and 58 hours were neutral and indifferent. Voice and Vision response: First, the Inquiry and Investigation Group has examined the programs of one week of one network during the New Year holidays and generalized them to all the programs of the Voice and Vision organization over a seven-year period. Second, in a few lines on the previous page, they had claimed that only 25 percent of the Voice and Vision programs are our own and 75 percent of all programs are Western and anti-Islamic culture. If we compare these figures of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, we realize the contradictions of the group, because if 39.5 hours out of 85 hours, that is about 45 percent of the programs even during the New Year holidays, concern Islam and the revolution, naturally, they were domestic programs. Third, which fair, impartial, and just group would find it logical to examine only the programs of one week and one part of an organization and generalize its findings to cover seven years, whereas they were supposed to examine the activities of 12 years, and apparently they have expressed their opinion concerning 12 years. If we convert this ratio to mathematical figures, the Inquiry and Investigation Group has examined 85 hours out of more than a million hours of programs, and incidentally, for a specific week, and then makes a judgment about a million hours of programming. Is this the meaning of impartiality and precision by the Inquiry and Investigation Group? And is this the meaning of the piety that is cited in the oath of the Majles? Fourth, in categorizing the programs, the Inquiry and Investigation Group mentions the programs to be unrelated to Islam and the revolution or neutral, indifferent and deviant. If we were to make the same categorization about other organizations, what percentage of their activities would conform to Islam and the revolution? For example, what percentage of the ratifications of the Majles are directly related to the revolution? Or what percentage of the school textbooks are directly related to the revolution and Islam? Why should the group engage in such categorization that it would itself find contradictory and not be able to use in any other case? Fifth, as was mentioned, the goals of the programs of the Voice and Vision are guidance related, educational, informational, instructional, recreational, and for entertainment. This program has not broadcast one moment of neutral programs and will not do so. All the programs have a goal and are instructive, and this is not a claim by the Voice and Vision, but the opinion that the Imam expressed in Fall 1366 [1987]. In those days, some individuals in newspapers and some from podiums began to create a climate against the programs of the Voice and Vision and considered the programs indifferent, neutral, and educationally misleading, in violation of religious law. One of the deputies of the Majles from the Supervisory Council asked the opinion of the late Imam in writing concerning the programs of the Voice and Vision. Here, we call to the attention of the honorable audience the question and answer: Honorable Grand Ayatollah, Imam Khomeyni, The Grand Leader of the Revolution and Founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, may his blessings perpetuate. Respectfully, in connection with the broadcast of some foreign films or domestic productions and serials, such as "Fall in the Meadows," "Mirror," and "Influence," as well as the broadcast of music from the Voice and Vision, some complaints are sent from the martyr-nurturing nation, especially the honorable families of the martyrs, self-sacrificers, missing-in-action, and prisoners of war, to the Supervisory Council stating that the broadcast of such films, serials, and music is contrary to the sacred laws of Islam, contrary to the lofty goals of the revolution, inappropriate for the regime of the Islamic Republic, and cause the spread of unveiling and improper veiling and are misleading, not to mention that to spend the budget on their production is considered waste, although they may also be instructional, recreational, and entertaining. In comparing such instances with the existing decrees in the scholarly dissertations and writings of Your Excellency and determining what is allowed and not allowed, there are differences of opinion and explicit and correct answers cannot be given to those who raise the questions. Differences in taste also exist and one does not know what must be done. What must be done under these sensitive war conditions, which is the most important of affairs? Another point is that when the complaints, which are generally from the nation in whom the revered Imam is interested and those who have given martyrs and the Hezbollah, are given to the managers and executive officials they say: "The Imam sees all these programs and listens to the music; if there are problems, he will mention them." Since "investigating the complaints and responding to them and taking rapid steps to eliminate the deficiencies" is one of the legal duties of the Supervisory Council, please write your blessed opinion concerning the above-mentioned issues in order for us to be able to carry out our grave religious and legal duties properly and not be responsible before that revered imam and the divine nation of Iran. Greetings to you and may the blessings of God be yours Esma'il Ferdowsipur Member of the Voice and Vision Supervisory Council <graphic> <titl> The opinion of the Imam and the letter is as follows:</graphic> In the name of the Almighty: Viewing such films and plays is not inappropriate from a religious standpoint and many of them are instructive and their broadcast also is proper. Also, films on sports and music are also mostly appropriate. Sometimes, rarely, the opposite happens, and more care must be taken. However, two points must be observed. First, those who apply makeup must be an intimate [one with whom marriage is prohibited]. A stranger is prohibited [religiously] from doing this. Second, the viewers must not perceive these works as lustful. Ruhollah Khomeyni. Once again, note the question and answer: The person posing the question writes: "The broadcast of such films, serials, and music is contrary to the sacred laws of Islam, contrary to the lofty goals of the revolution, inappropriate for the regime of the Islamic Republic, and causes the spread of unveiling and improper veiling and are misleading, not to mention that to spend the budget on their production is considered waste, although they may also be instructional, recreational, and entertaining." The Imam responds: "Watching such films and plays is not a problem from a religious standpoint and many of them are instructional and their broadcast also is no problem. Also, sports films or music are also mostly no problem. Sometimes, violations are seen, rarely, and more care must be taken." Gentlemen of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, this opinion of the Imam is from 29 Azar 1366 [20 December 1987], that is about seven years of the period during which you examined the Voice and Vision programs. Honorable gentlemen, in the first meeting of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, the director of the Voice and Vision organization announced the opinion of the Imam to you and you expressed your lack of knowledge. Then he sent you a copy of the questions and answers with the text of the Imam's statements and the text of his reverence's decree in letter No. M/2300/569/5160, dated 21/07/1371 [13 October 1992]. Gentlemen of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, in the joint meeting with the director of the Voice and Vision organization, you announced that you are all emulators and followers of the Imam. What is the meaning of such conflict between your views and those of the Imam? The Imam said many of the programs are instructive. You say they mostly have neutral, indifferent, or deviant messages. The Imam said there is for the most part no problem. You say it is mostly problematic. The Imam said violations are rarely seen. You say, except for a small percentage, the rest are in violation. Still you claim to be emulators, obedient, and followers of the Imam? Honorable gentlemen, the day that Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, the director of the Voice and Vision, reminded you that with the presence of Mr. Parvaresh, with his history and his opposition to the views of the Imam concerning the Voice and Vision, the group has lost its "impartiality," you claimed that the members of the group are all obedient emulators and followers of the Imam and do not allow anyone to influence their opinion and votes. Was this your impartiality and being followers of the Imam? In continuing its examination, the Inquiry and Investigation Group writes about the Vision Network 2: "Network 2 has translated four plays into Persian at high cost and produced them as television serials, for which 100-percent similar foreign ones existed, such that one might well imagine they were imported from abroad. And this is while 79 percent of films and serials are foreign and Network 2, instead of producing films and serials in defense of Islam and the revolution, still has added to foreign problems. Voice and Vision response: Certainly the dear audience does not know which plays and films the Inquiry and Investigation Group is referring to. In order to clarify the matter, we will mention the name of one film and one play. One of these films is "Conspiracy," which in a beautiful way shows the criminality of the Americans, even in hospitals and in regards to patients. This film was broadcast about a year ago from Baku Television, "Azerbaijan," and was strongly protested by the Americans. The government of Baku at the time was strongly questioned by the U.S. Ambassador for broadcasting the film. One of the plays that was referred to is "The Inspector Enters." This play very beautifully questions and exposes the judicial system and Government of England. Indeed, it is not clear to us why the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, out of 1,552 domestically produced shows whose names were given to them, place their fingers on a few specific cases which have upset the Americans and British as well as, as will be described later, the Israelis. Indeed, why? In order for you to see these programs that are contrary to the revolution and are deviant, soon we will broadcast the film, "Conspiracy" for you from television. You can judge whether the film is against the United States and contrary to the revolution. We believe exposing the criminal United States is the duty of every revolutionary Muslim today. In the conclusion of this section, we provide the combined chart of the goals of the Vision programs and also the combined chart of the domestic and foreign programs of the two networks. As you can see: In terms of the goals, the programs are produced and broadcast with the three goals of guidance-education, information-instruction, and entertainment-recreation. Hence, no program has a neutral, indifferent, or deviant message. In the charts of the composition of the domestic and foreign programs of the two networks, as can be seen, 14.12 percent is the share of foreign programs of the two networks and 85.82 percent the share of domestic programs. These statistics include all the programs of the two networks, including children's programming, shows, films, and serials. Hence, it can be seen to what extent the claim of the Inquiry and Investigation Group and the statistics that they have presented are untrue and contrary to the facts. We emphasize, these percentages merely concern the programs of the two television networks. If the programs of the Voice and Vision of the provincial centers and Tehran radio are included, the ratio of foreign programs to domestic ones is about 1.3 percent. In other words, 98.7 percent of the programs of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic are domestically produced by ourselves, and 1.3 percent of all the Voice and Vision programs are imported from abroad, whereas the Inquiry and Investigation Group, as was mentioned, states this ratio as 75-percent foreign and 25-percent domestic. God willing, God will grant us the ability and fairness to see the facts and judge accordingly. As it was said, the Voice and Vision organization during the period under examination by the Inquiry and Investigation Group produced 1,552 shows domestically, almost every segment of the program was broadcast twice, and the names of all the programs were sent to the Inquiry and Investigation Group. The Inquiry and Investigation Group has shown sensitivity to the following programs: 1) Concerning the serial "Crocodile Tears," the content of the serial "Crocodile Tears" was against the liberals and the supporters of the United States and approved by the late Imam. 2) In regards to the motion picture "Conspiracy," produced by Vision Network 2, the content of the motion picture "Conspiracy" is against U.S. crimes, even in hospitals and in regards to patients. When this film was broadcast from Baku Television, the U.S Ambassador in Azerbaijan strongly protested the broadcast of this film. 3) The Inquiry and Investigation Group showed sensitivity to the show"The Interrogator [as published; previously `Inspector'] Enters." This progra questions the British judicial system beautifully and shows the criminality of the British. 4) The Inquiry and Investigation Committee has shown extreme sensitivity to the program "Sinister Conspiracy" and even unjustly accuses one of the main people involved. The series "Sinister Conspiracy" concerns the appearance of Zionism and is against Israel. Because of its valuable content, this series has been shown three times so far. 5) The Inquiry and Investigation Group shows sensitivity towards the serial "Primrose." The producers of the serial "Primrose" had the honor to meet with the grand leader, who expressed his praise for them. Also, the honorable head of the Judicial Branch, Ayatollah Yazdi, in a letter to the Voice and Vision organization, expressed his praise for this group. The honorable speaker of the Majles at the time also met with this group and praised them. 6) The Inquiry and Investigation Committee has shown sensitivity to the programs that the organization has produced and broadcast in connection with the war. The reporters and narrators of war programs were frequently commended by the high ranking officials of the sacred regime of the Islamic Republic, and last year these dear ones received a Koran and other prizes from the grand leader for their beautiful programs. The Inquiry and Investigation Group has shown sensitivity to the show "The Interrogator Enters." This series very beautifully questions the British judicial system and shows the criminality of the British. 7) The Inquiry and Investigation Group has shown sensitivity to the serial "The Lesson in the Mirror." Those mainly involved in this serial were commended by the grand leader and other high ranking officials of the country. For the officials of the Voice and Vision this question exists: Why out of 1,552 show segments has the Inquiry and Investigation Group shown sensitivity to programs that were approved by the Imam, the grand leader, and other high-ranking officials of the regime, and for which they have been commended, or those that have been against the United States, Israel, England, and the liberals. They have shown sensitivity as best they could. Of course, it can be accepted that the Inquiry and Investigation Group has not been aware of some of those instances, but in some instances, certainly the group, or some of its members, were aware. Here we find it necessary to make one point, which is that the officials of the Voice and Vision have never claimed that no criticism of the programs of the Voice and Vision is warranted, but have always asked experts to announce to us their opinions in order to improve the quality and content of the programs. It has been due to such care and solidarity that the programs of this organization have always been growing and continue to grow, and for this reason the organization has been able to gain the trust of the Islamic nation such that people devote 88 percent of their leisure time to its programs. We ask God Almighty not to abandon us, even for a moment. Amen, Oh Lord of Two Worlds.

The Voice and Vision organization has always protected and supported the Basij institution located in that organization. Any organization that itself, as a storming army on the front line of the battle of right against wrong, has always propagated Islamic values and reported the bravery and courage of the self-sacrificing combatants in the best possible manner could not have been successful in this grand mission without the sufficient support of the organization. In the course of the imposed war, the Basij of the organization have been able to have the following activities by making use of the sufficient resources of the Voice and Vision. 1) Attracting and organizing forces to train and dispatch to the front in individual and collective from in most general and personnel dispatches. 2) Ideological instructions, culture, the Koran, emergency and other instructions for the Basij forces. 3) Holding of great ceremonies on the occasions of the blessed 10 days of Fajr, Basij Week, Sacred Defense Week, Unity Week, the passing away of the Imam, holidays, mournings, etc. 4) Dispatch of propaganda and cultural teams and showing of films in the course of the eight years of sacred defense to the fronts in the west and the south. 5) Dispatch of 50-member teams of employees of the organization to visit the front frequently. 6) Sending cash and material help and collections from employees and the organization in people's aid convoys to the front, for example, six tractors. 7) Holding of 12 military training courses for 5 percent of the employees of the organization in accordance with the circular letter of the government in the Balal Mosque and the barracks for 1,700 people. 8) Implementation of ideological, cultural, and political competitions for all the employees of the organization. 9) Establishment of a Basij unit for the sisters throughout the organization. 10) Holding exhibitions of pictures, posters, films, and books on various occasions. 11) Close relationship and constant active presence in all the programs and ceremonies announced by the Center for the Basij of offices and factories of the Guard Corps and coordination with that institution are among the activities of this headquarters. Active presence in the Basij ceremonies and moral and psychological support of the honorable deputy director of the organization is not unknown to any of the Basij members of the organization, and this issue is encouraging for the members of the Basij. The sufficient support of the organization for the Basij has always continued without any problem through the honorable administrative and financial deputy director and the honorable director general for the expenditures of the activities. The honorable deputy director for provincial affairs and Majles affairs of the organization has always strived to create close relations between the Basij stationed in Tehran and the Basij bases in provincial centers and to create resources to establish new bases in provincial cities. At the present, about 18 Basij bases are active in the Voice and Vision of provincial cities and seven bases of resistance in Tehran. Membership in the logistics headquarters of the war in the organization was achieved on the recommendation and emphasis of the director of the organization personally, and the responsibility for secretary of this headquarters was conferred on a member of the Basij Council of the organization by him. At the present time, a number of managers are members of the Basij of the organization. On the whole, all the managers of the organization, including the most senior to the middle-management level, have always helped the Basij in advancing its actions toward the sacred goals of the regime and participated and still participate in the seminars held by the Basij. The latest example is a seminar that will be held in Aban [23 October-21 November] in the holy city of Mashhad in which managers from various levels will participate. Also, the members of the Basij are all employees of the organization and in addition to usual salary and benefits for this work enjoy all the legal benefits for combatants and self-sacrificers. [9 Nov p 14, Part II] [Text] Following the presentation of the honorable Inquiry and Investigation Committee in the financial divisions of the Voice and Vision organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which was read in the open session of the honorable Majles, it is necessary to announce certain issues in order to inform the public concerning the issues raised. Unfortunately, due to lack of sufficient experience and work in evaluation and determining the efficiency of the systems, methods, and activities of the government institutions and lack of a tradition and history of scientific inquiry and investigation in Iran, the result is the presentation of the existing report and the judgment of those who prepared the report. The report indicates that not only have the persons who were chosen to conduct inquiry and investigation of the organization not had sufficient experience in auditing and evaluation of financial issues, but they also have not even been aware that the expression of opinion concerning the activities and evaluation of an organization such as the Voice and Vision organization with all its complexities require efficient, effective, and economic cost auditing. If the Inquiry and Investigation Group had the slightest familiarity with auditing procedures, they would know that the result of evaluation is effective and successful when all three aspects mentioned above are simultaneously examined, evaluated, and judged. They would then not engage in presenting only a select few items in the accounts in a most "public deceiving" manner and would not misguide the path to auditing, evaluation, and control that is going through the initial steps. What is important in regard to the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group is that despite the fact that the committee had access to the detailed information of the organization, they never asked for an explanation from the related officials of the organization concerning their interpretations and criticism. Perhaps the explanations of the officials of the organization could eliminate some of the ambiguities and questions of the Inquiry and Investigation Group. Considering the preface, the main points in the report are referred to. 1. Lack of Cooperation by the Auditor At the start of the report by the committee, reference is made to lack of cooperation by the auditor with the committee. This claim and the statements were based on predetermined specific goals. The text of the presented report, which involves the most minor financial issues and instances and accounting documents and gives opinions about them, indicates the fact that the committee was given full cooperation in presenting the information requested, and never has any direct contact with the auditor received a negative response. 2. Verification of the Balance Sheet of the Organization of the Supervisory Council The duty of the financial affairs unit is to prepare and regulate the balance sheet and the list of annual revenues and expenditures. In recent years, based on the existing documents and records, the financial records every year, prior to the appointed time in a form and content better than the previous year, and as usual approved by the honorable director of the organization, have been sent for the approval of the Supervisory Council of the organization. If the balance sheet is not approved by the Supervisory Council, it would have nothing to do with the duties of the financial and executive affairs of the organization. Should the organization activities, the financial operations, and recording and transfer of account balances from one year to another stop because the balance sheet of the organization was not approved by the Supervisory Council? 3. The Structure of the Organization The structure of the organization, including the financial affairs organization, was approved by the Supervisory Council of the organization at the time and the creation of the "financial activities evaluation unit" in the financial affairs complex of the organization was done with the approval of the Supervisory Council. Later, in order to carry out the above-mentioned duties, the internal auditing unit was projected and approved within the authority of the director of the organization. The Inquiry and Investigation Committee has not carefully studied and examined the laws and regulations governing the Voice and Vision organization and its ratified organizations. Hence, it has presented incorrect and untrue information in its report. 4. Income Tax of the Organization According to Article 1 of the law of administration of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran ratified in 1359 [21 March 1980-20 March 1981], the Voice and Vision organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran is an independent "organization" and... As you can see, contrary to what the Inquiry and Investigation Committee has understood and interpreted, the goal of the legislature was not to create a government company. In Article 138 of the general national accounting law, the Voice and Vision organization has merely regarded a "government company" in terms of the implementation of this law. Hence, in terms of the implementation of direct tax laws and other laws, the organization cannot be considered a "government company." Ultimately, as is clear by the name of the "Voice and Vision organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran," this is a government organization that is subject to any law, provided it is mentioned by name. According to Paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the direct tax laws ratified by the Majles, government ministries and establishments and organizations whose budget is provided by the government as well as city halls and establishments affiliated with the government and city halls which have been established in a form other than a company in accordance with the laws are exempt from taxes. The Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran receives more than 95 percent of its financial resources from the general budget of the government and in the form of aid and, based on its legal form, which was referred to above, is not subject to payment of taxes. 5. Inspection and Auditing of the Activities of the Organization The report of the Inquiry and Investigation Committee states that after the revolution, the activities of the organization have not been injected and examined by any authority. The honorable committee has not even paid the slightest attention to the matters presented in its own report either, because at the beginning of the committee report reference is made to the efforts of the Accounting Office concerning auditing and examination of the accounts of the organization. Also, the National Inspection Organization has established a special office in the organization and carries out the necessary inspections of the various activities of the organization in Tehran and the provincial centers of which the reports are available. Also, the "Auditing organization" has been in charge of auditing the financial activities of companies affiliated with the organization in the past few years and has presented the necessary reports. Based on the existing laws and regulations, various reports have been presented to the related authorities, including the "auditing and distribution of budget management" of the National Accounting office, Article 49 of the Constitution, "Central office and Centralization and Combination of Accounts and Accounting Methods" of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, the Plan and Budget organization, and the "Economic Accounting Office" of the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 6. Noncentralized System of the Financial Affairs of the Organization The noncentralized financial system of the organization has been devised with attention to the administration system and the organizational plan of units and centers of the organizations approved by the Supervisory Council. This system that is operated in a noncentralized form is an accepted scientific system in financial issues and accounting that has been used to expedite the implementation of activities and prevent bureaucracy and waste of a great deal of time in carrying out the various financial affairs of the organization throughout the country and it is unlikely that this system will be replaced with another financial system, considering the scattered nature of the Voice and Vision centers and also the variety of the activities of the units of the organization. The fact that the report of the committee states that because of this system, no information can be obtained concerning the activities and accounts of 25 Voice and Vision centers and Tehran units is astonishing and questionable, because the honorable committee, the National Accounting office, or any other authorized organization can refer to the financial books of the units and centers to examine the accounts of that unit or the radio and television centers independently. Reference to a number of accounts of "the financial affairs of the program affairs" [as published] and "Tehran Accounting office" [as published] in the report of the committee verifies this matter. It is unfortunate for this organization that the committee, by referring to a small number of financial units of the existing 45 financial units and by relying on oral information by certain persons, has engaged in commenting on the financial situation of the whole organization. The Budget of the Organization The existing records and numerous correspondences that the Voice and Vision had with the Plan and Budget organization in the course of the imposed war years and later indicate the problems stemming from the severe shortage of budget and financial resources of the organization. The following figures show the trend of the change in the ratified cash budget of the organization in the years after the victory of the magnificent Islamic revolution and the year 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Amounts in Millions of Rials | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year |Ratified Budget | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979] |34,303 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1358 [21 March 1979-20 March 1980] |18,681 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1359 [21 March 1980-20 March 1981] |18,756 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1360 [21 March 1981-20 March 1982] |17,246 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] |20,010 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] |24,110 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985] |24,550 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1364 [21 March 1985-20 March 1986] |25,399 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] |26,850 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1366 [21 March 1987-20 March 1988] |21,317 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1367 [21 March 1988-20 March 1989] |26,850 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] |28,562 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] |42,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The above chart shows that the ratified budget of the organization in 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] is less than in 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979] and if only the inflation factor (based on the annual statistical book of the country) is used as the standard in the years after the victory of the revolution, in the same year a budget of more than 110 billion rials should have been ratified. In other words, in 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990], without calculating the very high increase in the activities of the organization compared to 1357, the budget of the organization was ratified at about one-fourth of the needed budget, based on the official inflation rates. On the other hand, the current ratified cash budget of the organization in the years after the victory of the Islamic revolution up to 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] was almost equivalent to the paid salaries and benefits of the organization in these years. The budget shortage in the years referred to created numerous problems for the organization. Among them we can point out the lack of resources for production of serious programs, the creation of obligations and large financial debts, the lack of maximal use of studios and transmitters, deterioration of buildings and equipment, etc. In 1369, for the first time after the victory of the revolution, the budget of the organization was more carefully examined under the supervision of the expert committee of the Plan and Budget organization, and finally a 42-billion- rial budget was ratified. But even this amount has not been sufficient for the program production activities planned by the organization and technical expansion and operations of the organization. Various correspondences in this regard with the Plan and Budget organization and the Islamic Guidance and Arts and Media Committee of the Majles verify this fact. It should be recalled that about 75 percent of the budget of the organization in the years referred to has been spent on paying the salaries and benefits for personnel and only 25 percent of this budget has been unusable in the program production division, maintenance of radio and television transmitters, and other activities of the organization. The increase in the budget of developmental projects during 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] and 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] compared to the previous years was merely due to the increase in the number of developmental projects and the increased coverage of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran throughout Iran and outside the borders. This matter has always been emphasized by the grand leader and the Majles. In 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], due to the budgetary problems of the cultural and media organizations in countering cultural invasion and elimination of deprivation, the Majles ratified the deduction of 1 percent of the total general national budget in 1372 and its allocation to the above-mentioned organizations. It would have been logical for the Inquiry and Investigation Group to pay attention to the proposal of the Islamic Culture and Arts and Media Committee (some of whose members are members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group) and the ratification of the Majles in this regard before protesting the amount of the budget of the organization. 8. Advertisement Debtors and Other Debtors to the Organization A) Concerning the debt of persons and prepayments from about a few years ago in accordance with a plan, these accounts were examined by several groups and every month reports are made and prepared and the necessary calculations are made to settle these accounts, for which all the records are available and can be presented. The debt of persons who have several relations with the organization, especially those involved in the past regime, have all been announced to the legal office of the organization and necessary steps have been taken. Mainly due to lack of access to these individuals or their property, in practice the collection of the rights of the organization has not been possible, and because considering them uncollectible and eliminating them from the accounts is contrary to the protection of the rights of the Treasury, so far they have remained in the accounts as collectible debts to the organization. But sufficient reserve has been taken into consideration for these accounts. Most of the cases that have been considered by the committee under the heading of futile actions include such cases. B) In regards to the advertising debts, prior to the revolution, receiving advertisement in credit form was common in the organization, and most of these debts are from before the revolution. After the revolution, the broadcast of commercials from television and radio stopped for some time, and later too according to the instructions of the organization advertisements were handled in cash in order to protect the rights of the organization. In regards to the settlement of previous debts, steps have been taken in coordination with the legal office of the organization to collect the debts to the organization. A number of advertising agencies have been bankrupt and their owners of the companies have left the country. In regards to debtors who have not been accessible, legal prosecution has been made to collect their debts to the organization and results have been achieved, the documents for which are available in the financial affairs unit of the organization. C) There are also instances that if the organization wants to bring a suit against them in the country or abroad, it would have to spend more than what would be gained. Hence, if the collection of the debts of these individuals is verified, the appropriate foreign currency and rial budget must be placed at the disposal of the organization. D) In regards to the debt of the factories producing television in the country, for fees on the rights of expansion, the following are important. In the law concerning the collection of fees from producers of television reception sets, no special methods have been projected to collect the debts of the companies as well as late-payment penalties. Hence, at various Junectures in the payment of the debt of these companies, considering the economic situation and also financial shortages of these companies, which are mostly under government control, a halt has been created. In regards to the repayment of late and current debts of these companies, the organization has been able to take steps to retrieve its rights through special planning with the consent of the management of these companies. The records of this matter are in the financial offices of the organization. Of course, if a company is unable to meet its obligations, the issue is referred to legal authorities for legal claim, examples of which are available in the legal office of the organization. The last case of a suit was against Pars Electric Company. It should be explained that this organization could sue all these companies, and in the event that the organization would win the case, due to financial problems these companies had to shut down and their factories, which would be sold in order for the organization to be able to gain its rights. The organization accepted the hardship of shortage of resources and the statements in the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Committee, but did not accept ignoring the rights of thousands of the workers of the television manufacturing factories with their closure for the sake of getting its own rights immediately. Ultimately, the organization has made all its effort to collect these debts in a manner that the numerous financial pressures are not imposed on government companies and subsequently their hard-working personnel. E) The Inquiry and Investigation Group has criticized the organization as to why the funds paid to the Central Bank are included in the debit account of the Central Bank, whereas according to accepted accounting principles, as long as the Central Bank has not acted on its obligation in connection with the request of the organization, it must be acted on in this way. At the time the request of the organization is sent, the equivalent of the issued check is included in the debit account of the Central Bank. When the documents concerning the opening of documented credit are delivered to the organization, the equivalent of the amount is taken out of the current account of the organization and transferred to the credit account of the Central Bank. F) The Telfilm Company is one example of debtors to the organization. This company was established prior to the revolution to produce films and has received a great deal of property from the organization. Most of those involved in the establishment of this company have escaped abroad since the victory of the revolution, and the above-mentioned company has practically gone bankrupt. The balances mentioned in 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] and 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] in the debit account of this company are the debts of those involved in its establishment. In regards to retrieving the rights of the organization, legal action has been taken. G) The figure concerning the "release of work" of the organization all stems from prior to the revolution. A major part of the debt to the organization from this person was collected after the revolution in cash, but he suddenly became a fugitive and left the country. From the early years of the revolution, a claim has been made in the Islamic Revolution prosecutor's office of Iran. It is noteworthy that the location of one of the warehouses of the organizations that belong to him is under the control of the organization. With the ruling of the court, the property will become the organization's property toward the payment of his debts to the organization, and it appears that thereby the debt of the person will be collected. H) The foreign currency and real debts of the honorable director of the organization are due to the prepayment of extra pay for assessment and foreign currency revolving funds, and their rial equivalent concern the purchase of coins to be given as gifts to the personnel of the organization. Even though the nature of these payments must not be regarded as his debt, it has been done in this way for accounting purposes. Most of the debts referred to in the inquiry and investigation report have been included in the expenditures account upon the receipt of the assignment report as well as positive documentation in this connection, and the remainder of the documents also have been presented to the Financial Affairs Office and are in the process of being recorded in the books. Of course, other colleagues also have similar debts to the organization. But it seems that the Inquiry and Investigation Committee, with ill intent, has tried to blow this issue out of proportion. I) In regards to the check issued to the Physical Education organization, it must be announced that this check was issued upon the order of authorized officials of the organization for the purchase of land from the Physical Education organization and placed at the disposal of the Legal office of the organization to sign the contract. But because the Physical Education organization refused to accept the contract, the check was returned to the Financial Affairs office of the organization, and according to document No. 2858, dated 07/06/71 [29 August 1993], it has been returned from the related accounts. It can be seen that the date of the investigation by the Inquiry and Investigation Group is after the above-mentioned date. Hence the question in this regard was improper and because of lack of familiarity by the Inquiry and Investigation Committee with financial issues, they were obliged to merely use the report of the organization, which was prepared earlier, and have therefore made an error. J) In regards to the collection of debts from some former manager and officials of radio and television, legal action has been taken and the ruling of the court in this regard has also been issued. But in the court it has been said that the organization must investigate to see if they have land or property in Iran in order to issue the ruling based on its confiscation. In this connection, too, the organization has employed all its efforts. 9. Purchase of Cars From the West of the Country When the opportunity to purchase cars from the west of the country arose and the officials and the related organizations gave permission to do so, the Voice and Vision organization also, like many government organizations, made an effort to purchase heavy and light vehicles needed for itself and affiliated companies. In this regard, after coordination with the center of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Sanandaj, the permission for purchase was obtained through the office of the governor-general of Kurdistan. Considering the unusual procedures for their purchase, the auditor of the organization was assigned by the administrative and financial affairs deputy director to receive the revolving funds and, along with two purchasing officials and experts, to be sent there. This was done and after two or three days and going to the Marivan border the task was coordinated, and after giving the revolving funds to the purchasing officials, he returned. Concerning the purchased vehicles, which include light and heavy vehicles, no personal use has taken place and the Inquiry and Investigation Committee, by presenting a false report and without a meeting with the director of the general accounting of this organization and quoting him, has announced that two of the vehicles were for the personal use of the auditor and the administrative and financial deputy director. The reason for the revolving funds account not being settled was merely due to the existing problems in licensing the vehicles. The reason for the deposit of the funds in the account of the purchasing official was because the Voice and Vision organization did not have a bank account in Marivan. Because of the danger in carrying out cash from Sanandaj to Marivan, the organization decided to open an account in the name of the purchasing official in Marivan. Considering the above statements, the falsity of the information by the Inquiry and Investigation Committee in the following areas can be proven. 1) The administrative and financial affairs deputy director of the organization was never sent on assignment in this regard. 2) The Inquiry and Investigation Committee never met with the director of general accounting of the organization and falsified information from him. 3) None of the cars were employed for personal use. They were not placed at the disposal of the auditor and the administrative and financial affairs deputy director of the organization. 10. Payment of Loans to Employees in the Voice and Vision Organization At the present time in the Voice and Vision organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran loans are granted from two sources. 10.1.) The Savings Fund for Employees, which is provided with 2 percent of the employees' share and 6 percent of the organization share and is administered under the supervision of a board of trustees. Maximum loan paid from this fund is 120,000 tomans. 10.2) The Retirement Fund, which is funded by 8-percent share of employees and 16-percent share of the organization and is administered under the supervision of the board of trustees of the retirement fund. This fund only grants loans for the procurement and repair of housing and the marriage of employees. The maximum loan from it is 500,000 tomans. The inquiry and investigation reporter has pointed out that in the Voice and Vision loans are paid from several sources, but no reference is made to its legal obstacles. Not only has the organization in no law or regulations been prevented from this action, but it has paid loans on the basis of the ratification of the Supervisory Council. Loans paid in the Voice and Vision are paid in accordance with the laws and regulations to official and contract employees and if the borrower is unable to pay the installments of his loan on time, the installments will be collected from the guarantor. Apparently, this matter was criticized by the Inquiry and Investigation Committee as to why no steps are taken to collect the rights of the related fund from the guarantor, and the group has offered no solution in this area. 11. Withdrawal From Retirement Fund Deposits In regards to the payment of loan from Retirement Fund deposits, the issue was examined. The official of the retirement fund said that he was not officially contacted and the information referred to in the report has been placed at the disposal of the committee by individuals who were not responsible. In any case, the payment of loans from the Retirement Fund to the organization has been done on the basis of the regulations of the fund through the board of trustees and their approval, and there is no legal prohibition. Also, the organization has taken steps to repay the loan in question on time. Other instances stated in the Inquiry and Investigation Committee report concerning the Retirement Fund lack any basis or documented evidence. 12. Assignments Abroad The Inquiry and Investigation Group claims that Voice and Vision assignments abroad were not related to its duties and mission, whereas the existing information and figures in the organization indicate that almost all the assignments abroad by the organization have been in connection with news coverage of political events, news coverage of the visits of national officials, participation in technical and international conferences, testing and delivery of purchase transmitters and equipment from abroad, production of programs abroad, and carrying out training assignments for the personnel, and so on. Elsewhere, the sending of the head of the general affairs of programs with a group sent abroad to purchase programs has been criticized by the Inquiry and Investigation Committee. Usually, in the purchasing group, a representative of the legal office and a representative of the financial division for examining the contents of the contracts and ensuring the conformity to the laws and regulations must be sent. The [director of] general affairs for programs on this trip was sent on an assignment as the financial affairs representative of the organization. Due to severe financial shortages and cutbacks in expenditures, the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran has sometimes been forced not to send these two representatives, although legally in sending a group for purchases the legal and financial representatives of the organization must be present. 13. The List of Banking Discrepancies The existence of banking discrepancies between the accounts of every organization and bank statements is inevitable. For this reason, one of the accounting statements that is prepared at the end of every month by the financial affairs unit of the organizations is called the "list of banking discrepancies." In other words, after comparing the accounts of the organization and the bank statement, the discrepancies are identified and steps are taken to correct them. This tactic is done every month by each of the independent accounting offices and for each current account, and steps are taken to eliminate the discrepancies as much as possible. In regards to the claims concerning failure to give issued checks to concerned individuals, it must be announced that this claim is a pure lie, because one of the positive evidences of this kind of documents is the receiver of the check. If in a list the signature of the receiver of the fund or check does not exist, the accounting document of payment is not issued, but the total amount is put in the credit account of the individual. The Inquiry and Investigation Committee has not even presented one example in its report to prove this claim. 14. The Account of the General Treasury In regards to the balance of the account of the General Treasury at the end of 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] in the amount of 21,009,790 rials, it must be said that the balance of this account on one date can only indicate the balance remainder of the account on that day, and this balance does not show failure to deposit the revenues of the organization. Unfortunately, the reporter has lacked financial expertise and, resorting to this balance, has announced that the revenues of the organization have not been deposited in the accounts of the Treasury, whereas the revenues of the organization have been deposited in the related accounts of the Treasury, then, presenting the request for funds from the General Treasury for some of the needed financial resources of the organization, a withdrawal has been made from these accounts. Considering what is stated, the balance figure in the above-mentioned account by no means shows failure to deposit the revenues of the organization. 15. Carrying Out Postponed Affairs and Payment for Additional Work In various parts of the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Committee, certain criticism is made of postponed and unsettled accounts. As was announced earlier, about five years earlier, despite the shortage of personnel and problems in not absorbing forces due to the failure to pay adequate salaries to the expert financial forces, by making use of the existing personnel, the work on examining the postponed accounts began. All the records and related reports in this connection are available in the financial affairs office of the organization. Hence, it seems that carrying out this task, that is, investigation of the postponed accounts, considering the criticism of the Inquiry and Investigation Committee concerning failure to do so in numerous cases in the report requires commendation, not questioning. Undoubtedly, this case, too, has been cited by individuals who have themselves had job and behavior-related problems in the Financial Affairs office of the organization, which, unfortunately, has been reflected in the report of the committee precisely. In connection with the payment of overtime, it must be mentioned that overtime in the Voice and Vision organization is essentially calculated and paid on the basis of a time card. Even in cases in 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] to 1368, due to the shortage of funds there was no possibility of paying overtime, which the organization employees deserved. (The records are available.) Payments of overtime in the organization have been carried out in accordance with the laws, regulations, and internal bylaws of the organization. 16. Revolving Funds The revolving funds of the organization are mainly related to the representative offices abroad. Due to the continuation of their activities, the balance of these offices will never be zero at the end of the year. Funds that are transferred to the representative offices of the organization abroad are all recorded in the revolving fund account of the manager of the office and the equivalent in foreign currency for the documents delivered is sent to the representative office by the manager of the office. Hence, the revolving fund of the managers of the offices will never reach zero, unless a new person is appointed in his place. In this case, after examination and auditing the inventory and giving it over to the new official, the balance is transferred into the account of the new manager. As it has been announced in the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Committee, in some cases, with the written permission of the auditor of the organization, payment of revolving funds over 500,000 rials is also permitted. Hence, all the revolving funds are paid with the permission of the auditor of the organization or agents of the auditor in Tehran and the provincial centers, and there is no legal prohibition in this regard. 17. The Fund and Its Evaluation The nature of the work of the cashier and numerous accounts receivable and accounts payable in the course of a day, week, or month makes the existence of account discrepancies inevitable, and for this reason the cashiers are [extended] extra pay to make up for the shortage of cash. In the Voice and Vision organization, only in a small number of units (considering the nature of their work) is permission given to have a fund, and most payments are made with bank drafts. The accounts of each of the cashiers at various Junectures are examined and counted by the evaluation and financial affairs activities group of the organization, and the shortages of funds are included in the debit account of the cashier and deducted from his salary. Hence, the expression of opinion in this regard, stating that the accounts of the cashiers are never evaluated and audited, is a pure fabrication. (The periodic evaluations and audits of cashiers are available in the [office of] Financial Affairs of the organization.) In very rare cases, considering the volume of the activities of the cashier, the accuracy of his actions and reports of the financial affairs activities evaluation of the organization, within the possible resources, approved funds may be provided as aid for the cashier's deficit, upon the approval of the proper authorities of the organization. 18. Other Cases Health payments of the organization are handled on the basis of the health regulations of the organization. In some cases, because the patient does not have the ability to pay his share, with a social aid report and the approval of a three-member committee on this matter and ultimately the approval of the proper authorities of the organization, his share can be provided from the aid budget of the organization, instances of which do not even exceed 1 percent of patients. Advances for employees in an organization with more than 14,000 permanent and temporary personnel are inevitable, and such prepayments and their procedures are as follows. Salary advances. Considering the issue of advances, they are either deposited all at once after the establishment of the salary of the new personnel from what is owed him or in installments (usually within a maximum period of one year) and deducted from the employee's salary. Assignment advances. Such advances are deposited all at once from the debit account of the official after the assignment report is presented. Payment of loans to employees who have no employment (official or contractual) relations is impossible and contrary to the regulations and internal bylaws of the organization. Hence, the mere claim that it has happened does not prove it to be true. Obviously, for every (qualified) individual to whom the organization grants a loan, in accordance with the regulations, he must present a person as his guarantor. Naturally, the responsibilities of the guarantor are clear in terms of the laws and regulations. The organization is asked why others to whom the organization has debt have not come to collect. As to why a person to whom money is owed has not come to the organization to collect it, it is not the problem of the Voice and Vision organization and its financial affairs to respond. [11 Nov pp 10, 14] [Text] Following the publication of two parts of the Voice and Vision response to the critical report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group of the Majles, now we publish the third and final part of this report for our dear readers. Labor Force Report In connection with the labor force, the Inquiry and Investigation Group writes: "The quantitative and qualitative presence of the prerevolutionary cadre and lack of basic change in the body of the Voice and Vision" [sentence as published]. The group continues: "The Voice and Vision is a center with about 14,000 personnel, most of whom have remained in place from the past regime. Despite the fact that, like other organizations, it has been purged, the composition of the major part of the organization has not essentially changed. Even the absorption of Hezbollah elements, due to the governing climate, has not been able to create fundamental change, and they have either become dependent on the governing climate, have changed, or have chosen to be silent." Voice and Vision response: First, the Voice and Vision in letter No. M/2300/633/5160, dated 13/08/1371 [4 November 1992], had sent the personnel information (list of individuals who left the organization from 1358 [21 March 1979-20 March 1980] and a list of those who have been hired from 1360 [21 March 1981-20 March 1982] to that date) to the Inquiry and Investigation Group. Second, after the victory of the Islamic revolution: About 2,328 people, due to ideological affiliations or lack of the necessary moral and political qualifications for service in the Voice and Vision, have been dismissed from the organization and about 1,844 have been honored by retirement or left the system due to disability or other problems. In other words, about 4,200 persons have left the organization, and during the same period the Voice and Vision organization has hired about 7,500 full-time official and contractual and about 2,000 part-time employees. In other words, of the total of about 14,500 present employees, about 9,500 have been newly employed and about 5,000 are the former employees of the organization, and naturally the new forces are all graduates of the schools, colleges, and universities of the country after the victory of the revolution or from the students of religious seminaries. Also, the remainder of the forces from before the victory of the Islamic revolution are all sincere, committed, Muslim forces, those interested in the revolution and Islam, and those loyal to the sacred regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who have served and are serving Islam and the revolution. Third, nearly all the officials of the regime unanimously believe that those who have been ideologically and politically affiliated with the previous regime have been purged in the first few years after the victory of the Islamic revolution from offices or have left the country and crawled into some corner. In the 15th year of the victory of the Islamic revolution, at a sensitive Junecture when the country is undergoing a period of construction and reconstruction, raising issues such as the forces from before or after the revolution or the new and old will have no results but to create disunity and conflicts in the offices. While so far every employee has been purged for whatever reason for which he should have been purged and those who have remained or those who have been absorbed after the victory of the Islamic revolution by the offices are no different, they have been and are all servants of the people and loyal to the revolution, Islam, and the sacred regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Inquiry and Investigation Group states in its report: "The organization has 14,000 personnel, most of whom are left over from the past regime." Voice and Vision response: As was stated, about two-thirds of the employees of the organization are individuals who have started working with the organization after the victory of the revolution, and the claim of this group is contrary to the facts. The Inquiry and Investigation Group in continuation, while insulting the Hezbollah elements, writes: "The Hezbollah elements have either become dependent on the climate, have changed, or have chosen to remain silent!" It then continues: "Among the managers, proper changes have been made, but sometimes we witness the inappropriate activities of some of these managers who have been influenced by the existing climate in the organization." Voice and Vision response: Considering what was said, about two-thirds of the forces in the organization are forces from after the victory of the Islamic revolution, and according to the Inquiry and Investigation Group among the managers proper changes have taken place. Then, how can this contradiction be accepted, that a minority influences the majority in this way and has changed their ideas? Indeed, why has the Inquiry and Investigation Group tried in its report to weaken the, as it says itself, committed, concerned Muslim managers and committed Muslim employees? Can it not be believed that in this case, too, as in other cases, the group has deviated from the position of impartiality and ignored the facts? But why have they not taken an oath on the Koran before God to observe trust by relying on their honor? The Inquiry and Investigation Group continues: "Old elements, due to their intellectual opposition to the Islamic regime and the revolution, protect the interests of those in the same line, too. In understanding this point, several examples are referred to and in continuation they have reported a few examples that are either untrue or, as they have said themselves, whose occurrence was prevented by the management of the organization, which, contrary to the claim of the group that says Hezbollah elements or some of the managers were changed, proves the sensitivity, decisiveness, and alertness of the committed managers and employees of the organization. For example, they have said: "Two of the hosts of the Voice and Vision, despite their apparent justifiable appearance, have misused their position to receive resources from the organizations and after the exposure of a film from which their immorality is revealed were dismissed and unfortunately rehired in the Vision." Voice and Vision response: These individuals have never misused any organization and have devoted a significant percentage of their lives on the fronts of the battle of truth against falsehood. The film that is referred to was participation in a wedding in which Islamic standards were not observed. As was explained in the newspapers earlier, they have never been dismissed from the organization because they had not committed any crime that would deserve their being fired. Or it has been said that in the program "Friday Morning," a host of the program has been invited who has had relations with SAVAK agents, or they have invited a showman from the tyrant's time and the director of the organization has prevented his entry. The first is untrue and the second shows the sensitivity and alertness of the management. They have shown sensitivity towards one of the actors in the serial, "Primrose," which was explained earlier. They have said: They have purchased a film and because it was antireligious have stopped its broadcast. We do not know if the criticism is due to the preventing of the broadcast and the alertness of the officials of this medium or something else. They have said: An interview was broadcast with a Sunni cleric who, it was later revealed, has had problems. Not knowing about everyone or the future of others is something obvious, and when it was investigated by the proper authorities, it became clear that there had been an error, not ill intentions. They have said: One of the news anchormen did not read the news of the death of the Imam and another read it emotionally, but what they have not said is that the first person was so upset because of this great loss that no matter how he tried, because of his great love for the Imam, he could not read it, rather than "not wanting to read it." And they have said that Mr. Hayati, who read it, was ridiculed and scolded by his colleagues. This is a pure lie. They have said: In the program "Friday Morning," the Prophet was insulted." They have mentioned an example that has never been broadcast from the radio. The broadcast from the radio was, "A person claimed to be God. He was told someone has claimed to be a Prophet. He said, I did not send him." (A similar story is mentioned in martyr Motahhari's book.) And similar to such issues, which are either rare or the reverse or show the sensitivity of the managers, we must say that in regard to some of these cases that have actually occurred, when they have been investigated it has been decided that there has never been ill intent, but the result of an error, and that, moreover, the management of the organization has dealt with the error appropriately at the time. This is an issue that is mentioned in the Inquiry and Investigation Group's report explicitly and in some cases not explicitly. In another part of the report, the group indicates sensitivity to the serial "Ra'na." The audience of the Voice and Vision remember well that the serial "Ra'na" is one of the serials that beautifully shows certain parts of the Islamic revolution, in particular the constructive effect of the Islamic revolution and the Hezbollah on a stratum which paid no attention to the issues of the revolution or in families in which there were people who were afraid of the buried regime of the shah. So, at the end of the serial "Ra'na," the young educated girls of this family choose the "chador" as their veil and also some of the women of this family and men who have given up their previous way of life return to the bosom of Islam and the revolution. In the opinion of the officials of the Voice and Vision, this serial was an actual example of what the late Imam said concerning the mission of the Voice and Vision: "The Voice and Vision is a nationwide public university." Which university can, while filling the leisure hours of the people, show the history of the revolution and create internal change in its students or audience? It is not clear to us why the Inquiry and Investigation Group, despite what the Imam said concerning the responsibility of the Voice and Vision, repeating frequently that the Voice and Vision must work for the revolution and Islam, has divided the programs in its fabricated categorization, "in connection with Islam and the revolution as indifferent, neutral and deviant," when they have given examples and showed their negative sensitivity mainly to programs that were endorsed by the late Imam, the grand leader, the high-ranking officials, and the Muslim and Hezbollah nation or programs that have exposed the crimes of the criminal Americans, the usurping Zionists or deceptive and disgraced British. Here it is necessary to point out that, as the officials of the Voice and Vision have announced frequently from the mass media, including the Voice and Vision, we have never believed and do not believe that no mistakes were made in the programs of the Voice and Vision or that nothing has occurred contrary to other people's tastes, because in an organization that annually produces and broadcasts more than 90,000 hours of radio and television programs to the farthest areas of the country, there are not only errors, but it is also impossible for all the programs to be accepted and not criticized by people with various tastes. Various and numerous statistics and polls show that most of the criticism of the programs of the Voice and Vision is due to different tastes, because the audience of the Voice and Vision ranges from two-year-old children to the oldest members of the society and from the illiterate to the most learned, in short, all the strata and people in the society, as well as beyond the borders, audiences who have different intellectual, political, and social backgrounds. Hence, differences of opinion and taste concerning the programs of the Voice and Vision are obvious, natural, and normal. What is important is that during the 12 years of service of the present managers of the organization, the general direction of the programs not only has been in line with Islam, the revolution, and the Islamic values of the society, but has had a consistent movement towards improvement and reform. With the special attention and continuous and sincere supervision of the late Imam during his blessed and history-making life and now the grand leader, the pious successor of the late Imam, the officials of the Voice and Vision have always been able to correct any error that may have occurred, though rarely, on time and to deal with it. Concerning the leaning of the Satellite Building, which resulted in its destruction and that of much of the satellite equipment, it must be said: Based on the report of qualified technical experts, damage to this building was the result of an earthquake with a vertical strike... With this logic, the Gilan and Zanjan earthquake is also probably blamed on the managers of the Voice and Vision in those provinces. And for this reason they have always been endorsed by the late Imam and the grand leader of the Islamic revolution, some of which are pointed out here: 1) The late Imam, on 17/12/1370 [8 March 1992] in an audience granted to the general manager and the technical and expansion employees of the radio and television network of the Voice and Vision organization, said: "You young people succeeded in shattering the false beliefs." 2) On 15 Mordad 1361 [7 August 1982], when one year had passed in the service of the present managers of the Voice and Vision, in a meeting with the general manager and officials of various divisions of the Voice and Vision, while emphasizing the necessity and importance of reforming the Voice and Vision, he said: "I kept repeating this matter to the individuals who were in charge of these affairs and are at the top of this issue, but later it became clear that they were improper people. They kept making excuses that they are busy with it and are correcting it and it cannot be done and so on. But now, thank God, we see that it is being done, and we hope that with the efforts of this honorable gentleman, `Mr. Rafsanjani,' and the brother of `Mr. Rafsanjani,' God willing, the problems will be corrected and these two brothers, God willing, will serve Islam and its friends. This one in propaganda and the other in everything." In conclusion, addressing all those present, he said, "I ask God Almighty for your health and prosperity and thank you for your hard work and hope you work even harder, work for Islam. We who are from God must use our time for God..." In the events of 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] of the Voice and Vision organization, the Imam, God rest his soul, once again declared his trust in the management of the Voice and Vision. His honor, in his blessed letter dated 4 Tir 1364 [25 June 1985], wrote: In the name of God, the compassionate and the merciful. Contrary to expectations, in the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic conflicts occurred that caused concern. Consequently, I appoint Mr. Mohammad Hashemi as my representative to take charge of the responsibilities as the general manager of the Voice and Vision, so that this large organization will not be without a director; and because the honorable Supervisory Council has some concerns and some of them have written to me, and also Mr. Hashemi has some concerns, it is necessary for the honorable president, the honorable head of the Supreme Court, the honorable speaker of the Majles, and the honorable prime minister to examine the issues of both sides without the slightest connivance, and make the final decision. It is necessary to mention that it has been heard that some in my household have done some things contrary to my wishes or without informing me. Because this matter is untrue, the person saying such things must repent before God. 4 Tir 1362 [25 June 1983], Ruhollah Khomeyni Also, at every juncture and opportunity, the late Imam, while expressing contentment with the programs of the Voice and Vision and emphasizing more effort by the managers and officials, offered destiny-making directives. Finally, on 29 Azar 1366 [20 December 1987], when a number of people were trying to show the programs of the organization as without content, contrary to religious law, unsuitable, etc., this wise sage who always profoundly supervised the programs of this organization said: "Watching such films and plays has no religious problems and many of them are instructive and their broadcast is also no problem and in the same way the music is for the most part no problem. Sometimes, on occasion, violations are seen, so more care must be taken." And here to be offered is an implemental directive: "Those who put on makeup must be among those who are not legally allowed to marry the person; a foreigner is prohibited from doing this." "Makeup" is an implemental issue, but when the Imam was asked how he noticed this problem, he responded: I watched the credits of the program (the word credits is ours, he said a sentence that referred to credits), and sometimes there are men or women actors but there is no mention of the makeup person of the same sex. Of course, most often it is given. Nevertheless, I made a remainder that if "a person is potentially legally allowed to marry the other, it is prohibited." This point shows that the late Imam carefully paid attention to the activities of the officials of the Voice and Vision and when he would see a violation, he would mention and announce it. Hence, in Azar 1366 [22 November-21 December 1987] he announced: "The showing of none of the programs is problematic in terms of religious law and also sports films as well as songs are mostly no problem. Sometimes violations are seen, though rarely, so more care must be taken." This letter by the Imam is a strong endorsement of the activities of the officials of the Voice and Vision for seven years and shows the constant and profound supervision of that late wise sage, the maker of history and founder of the sacred regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran, during his blessed life. As has been stated in the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, the grand leader of the Islamic revolution, too, from 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] to now, "has made 14 reminders to the officials of the Voice and Vision in connection with the programs of the Voice and Vision." The reminders of his reverence are also another indication of the constant and wise supervision of the grand leader of the Islamic revolution, the pious successor to the late Imam. The officials of the Voice and Vision, as they did during the Imam's life, who made every effort to eliminate the problems that were pointed out by his honor and in this way were able to receive the full endorsement of this wise sage for almost all of their programs. [Paragraphing as published] now too use their best efforts to eliminate the problems that are mentioned in the reminders and wise directives of the grand leader and have taken steps in every instance which thank God have been accepted by him. We ask God Almighty for help to be able to sincerely and fully implement his profound directives and in our actions gain the contentment of God Almighty, God willing. Management of the Organization Then the Inquiry and Investigation Group in continuing the report deals with the management of the organization and first says: "Although the managers and cultural directors of the Voice and Vision are well-known cultural figures in the country and at the lower levels too committed and concerned managers are the majority especially in various groups of Networks 1 and 2, the question arises as to why the criticism and protest in regards to the programs of the Voice and Vision are increasing?" Voice and Vision response: First, the managers of the Voice and Vision, on all levels and in all units, including the Voice and Vision, all the deputy directors' offices, headquarter units, provincial centers, offices abroad, and service and logistics units, have been and are without exception religious, committed, concerned, active Muslims, loyal to the sacred regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is necessary here to make a delicate point. When the Inquiry and Investigation Group came to the General Security office to investigate the managers of the organization and asked for the files of the managers, the director general of security placed 150 volumes of files of the managers at their disposal. They began to leaf through them and examine them. When the brilliant history, high education, and especially the volunteer work and active and unassuming presence of 136 senior managers of the organization at the fronts of the battle of truth against falsehood during the imposed war was seen, one of the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group became extremely despondent and kicked the files and said: What sort of records are these that you are showing me? Are you ridiculing us? He then left the room angrily. In connection with financial misuse and moral corruption, the director of security has said: I cannot make up documents as you demand. So the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group became very angry and then the security file placed at their disposal was thrown in some corner. The director general of security became very astonished at this reaction of a member of the group. Why should a deputy of the Majles be so upset by the active presence of the senior managers of a sensitive organization of the country on the war fronts? Have these managers, who on the one hand have worked day and night on the most important propaganda front of the country at the same time used every opportunity to build themselves and repledge with the combatants of the military front against falsehood, have hurried towards them, and have even been proud of doing manual work and any sort of support, caused such reactions in a deputy of the people, even though they have hurried to the front as unknown soldiers to pay their debt on the basis of religious duty and to build themselves in the spiritual circles of the combatants on the front line and their reward is with their beloved [God] and nothing else? What is the meaning of this reaction of a member of the Inquiry and Investigation Group? We remember precisely that when the late Imam instructed going to the front, as the committed managers and employees of this organization declared their readiness and registered hastily for the path of their beloved, there was fear of stoppage and closure of many of the units of this organization. Hence, we had to ask the Imam for instructions, and his honor said to the officials of this medium, especially those who serve in sensitive positions, that they should remain at their jobs and carry out their duties, for this is also a very great duty. Continuing the discussion about the present management, the Inquiry and Investigation Group has regretted the fact in the introduction of which it has praised the managers and in the following pages tries to destroy the managers, and for that matter, with accusations for almost all of which they present no evidence, except probably what they have heard through "tangible and intangible ways." Below we refer to some and briefly respond to them. 1) They write: "Tyrannical artists, in order to prevent the spread of Islamic culture, have revealed themselves to the managers and, until some time ago they had convinced everyone that Islamic cover, that is, the chador, causes technical problems in front of the camera." First, this is a pure lie, because since the early days of the revolution hundreds, even thousands, of programs, interviews, and reports in which women with chadors have been present have been produced and broadcast, which have been witnessed by everyone from the Vision. Second, Islamic cover is not only the chador. Islam has restrictions and limits regarding women's covering, which clearly all the religious jurists by interpreting the Koran have explained in the scholarly dissertations and other religious jurisprudent and Islamic sources. For the informed people it is clear that Islamic covering is not only the "chador"; any form of cover that provides religious covering for women on the basis of the standards of the sacred religious law is Islamic covering. 2) They say: "In the foreign unit of the Voice and Vision, weak management has caused individuals even from the embassies to operate the foreign unit, some of whom have even been spies." Here, too, as in many other instances, they have also lied about the foreign unit and the committed Muslim forces of other countries who serve the sacred regime of the Islamic Republic in this unit without any document or evidence. Unfortunately, due to considerations of the interests of the country and this group of colleagues, we cannot give any more explanation about them, and these dear ones are even "oppressed" in our response. God willing, under more suitable conditions we will be able to introduce them. 3) They have said that the manager of one of the units has made a case against four Hezbollah elements last year and presented it to the Violations Court. The crime of the Hezbollah elements was protesting the illegitimate relationship between several employees and one employee. Voice and Vision response: This issue too, like other cases, is a pure lie. No such record exists in the Violations Committee [as published], and we do not know how, if the Inquiry and Investigation Committee believes in Islamic morality, it can accuse several people of having "illegitimate relations" with one person without investigation and proof. Is the publication of such untrue instances not spreading of debauchery? Is it not a crime punishable from a judicial perspective? Should not the honorable officials of the Judicial Branch investigate such crimes immediately and punish the spreaders of debauchery? God willing, it will be so. 4) They write: "A person who, because of relations with deviant individuals, has been dismissed from the institution (it has not been stated which institution) and then arrested and has had conflicts with Hezbollah individuals is now the manager of the Voice and Vision of one of the provinces. To back this claim, the group has not given the slightest information from any authority to this organization, and hence it is a pure lie. 5) They have written: The manager of one of the offices abroad, apparently propagates deviant ideas and criticizes the ideas of martyr Motahhari... We neither know anything about him nor the sources of information that they have given (the same intangible source which was mentioned), and again it is a pure lie. 6) Without presenting any evidence, they have claimed that financial misuse occurs in the serials. If only they could send us even one document or one example. 7) They have said: In 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991], the property of the Voice and Vision was stolen and after investigation it was found that the related manager had a hand in it. The issued ruling about the related manager who was supported by the director of the organization was not carried out but the secondary elements were dismissed and the related manager was dismissed respectfully after a long time for moral corruption. Voice and Vision response: In this case, we need to explain more than the previous cases: A) The manager who is mentioned is among the employees who has been known for his commitment and being a Muslim from before the victory of the revolution, and in Bahman 1357 [21 January-19 February 1979] during the arrival of the Imam in the country, despite the opposition of the radio and television organization at the time, by using a mobile television unit, directly broadcast the ceremonies of the arrival and the welcoming of the Imam of the people. As the Islamic nation knows, the broadcast of these ceremonies was cut off from the Voice and Vision center, but he provided the pictures for one of the most important events of the Islamic world in motion. B) In the Refah School, the residence of the Imam, he was given an important assignment to create the revolution television channel and directly broadcast the meetings of the Imam with another dear engineer, who in the organization was a student friend of martyr Raja'i and most favored by him, and during the first term of his premiership and presidency was one of the trustees of martyr Raja'i and cooperated with him. He is now the deputy director of the organization. In the inquiry and investigation report he has been the target of much exaggerated unkindness! And every unfair slander for which they have not found a source is ascribed to him. C) Among the other activities of this manager, when the missile attacks on Tehran began and it was decided to keep the schools closed and for the television to produce and broadcast school programs, he accepted this grave responsibility and during the above-mentioned time produced and broadcast educational programs for schools without leaving the organization, which was one of the vital centers and a target of Saddam's supporters for a while. [D)] During the years of the imposed war, he went to the front line frequently and organized numerous reports. E) At the time the late Imam passed away and during the anniversary of these ceremonies, he made every possible effort to carry on these ceremonies in a most appropriate manner. F) In the Hajj ceremonies this year, he broadcast via international satellite from inside Saudi Arabia the ceremonies of the exemption of the infidels most skillfully, intelligently, and cleverly, which is beautifully characteristic of a committed Muslim. First, the Government of Saudi Arabia denied the exemption of infidels, but when its pictures were broadcast on most of the world televisions, including the Islamic Republic, they were forced to confess. The broadcast of these ceremonies from world television angered the rulers of Saudi Arabia and caused the joy of hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world, including the Muslim people of our country. As the group has pointed out, in 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] the organization learned that one of the cameras of the organization was put on sale in a store on one of the streets in Tehran. The director of the organization requested that the public prosecutor of Tehran help find the perpetrators and return the property of the organization. With the help of the Tehran public prosecutor, the elements were identified and the stolen property was all returned. Because the above-mentioned manager was also a suspect, he was introduced to the prosecutor's office and his case was examined in the prosecutor's office. But the cases of the rest of the individuals who were official or part-time employees of the organization were examined by the administrative violations unit of the organization and, appropriate to their crimes, the rulings were issued and carried out. But the above-mentioned manager was acquitted in the court and was obliged to pay 50,000 tomans. At this time, some of the mediating elements who were affiliated with some political currents or some particular persons in the organization as well, protested the issued ruling. The Supreme Court revoked the ruling and the case was sent to another branch for reexamination. In the second court, also, the innocence of this manager was proven, and with a reduction in payment to 10,000 tomans, the case was closed. It is interesting that the camera of the organization was also returned earlier by the prosecutor's office. The officials of the related court observed in the file that the director of the organization has complained about him and requested the organization to declare its opinion considering the present situation of the case. The director of the organization in a letter announced that the organization has no complaint due to fully retrieving the rights of the organization, the case was closed, and the bail documents have been released. Other instances of which he is accused in the report are merely accusations and have not been proven by any authority. He has not even been dismissed for one moment from the organization or his responsibility and continues to serve the organization most sincerely and with continuous effort. Even because of his skills and sincerity, he has been requested for assistance during his leisure time by one of the very sensitive organizations of the country, and this organization, because of its respect for that organization, has agreed to the above-mentioned request. At the present time, in addition to carrying out his previous responsibilities in the organization he spends his leisure time, unofficial time, and even holidays working in the other organization. In the Hajj ceremonies this year, due to the significant efforts in the intolerable heat of Saudi Arabia and because of service to the world of Islam in sending the pictures of the ceremonies of exemption of infidels via international satellite, he was commended by the representative of the grand leader and the supervisor of Iranian Hajj pilgrims. Now, why the Inquiry and Investigation Group has shown such sensitivity towards him and another engineer in the organization (educational deputy director, with a brief description of his services, which was mentioned) and reported untruth is unclear to us. After the publication of the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, those who stir up trouble have called from here and there saying, "You deserve what you get, go ahead and work as hard as you can for this regime!" In the continuation of the report, the Inquiry and Investigation Group discusses the security situation of the Voice and Vision and raises issues that again, like most of the other instances, are accusations and even pure lies or concerning what, for reasons of consideration for the interests of the country and security, we cannot give any explanation. We only refer to one point, which indicates the proper and strong activities of the security unit of the organization, which is, despite the hostility of the enemies towards this sensitive center and despite the fact that in every conspiracy against the regime that has been discovered, the destruction and occupation of the Voice and Vision as one of the vital centers of the country has been among the primary targets of the conspirators, under the auspices of the alertness and active and self-sacrificing presence of the security forces of the organization, thank God, so far none of the conspiracies of the enemies have succeeded in regards to this organization and have all beem stifled and neutralized in their embryonic stages. In this connection, we find it necessary to thank and praise the unknown soldiers of the Imam of the Age. The Inquiry and Investigation Group in the continuation of the report examines and compares the laws of the organization with the statements of the grand leader and says: "Unfortunately, the instructions and directives of his honor have not been implemented." And then it refers to the following few instances. A) In a decree appointing Mr. Mohammad Hashemi as the director of the organization, he was asked to rapidly prepare a bill concerning the administration of the Voice and Vision and present it to the government and the Majles for ratification. So far, it has not been done. Voice and Vision response: The above-mentioned bill was prepared and presented to the government at the first opportunity and the government also in its committee on bills examined and prepared it to be sent to the honorable Majles. At that time, some of the Majles deputies who had learned about the content of the bill hurriedly prepared and offered a proposal with a few signatures to the Majles and told us that in accordance with the internal bylaws of the Majles, the proposal that has been registered first is given priority and until six months after the ratification, no other proposal can be discussed. Because the above-mentioned proposal was prepared hastily, even after correction in the second round of discussions it was ratified with some problems in the honorable Majles, but the honorable Council of Guardians found some problems in it and returned it to the Majles. The Majles refused to accept all the problems and ultimately the proposal was sent to the Council for the Discernment of Expediency. In the Council for the Discernment of Expediency, the proposal was commended and to some extent the problems were eliminated and it was announced for implementation, and it is now being implemented in the organization. We do not know on the basis of which standards indeed they have allowed themselves to make unjust and untrue accusations against individuals. Are there no judicial punishments for these? 2) The Inquiry and Investigation Group has said that from 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] to 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992], in 14 instances the grand leader has made reminders to the Voice and Vision concerning the programs, the most important of which are: A) Misleading and low quality of programs to be broadcast abroad. Voice and Vision response: Careful attention has been paid to the directives of his honor and the necessary steps have been taken in order to avoid the particular instances that were mentioned in regards to misleading. Also, vast efforts have been made to increase the quality of the foreign Islamic intellectual programs. In this connection, it should be mentioned that vast cooperation with about 160 young, active, and virtuous seminary students in Qom has begun and the grand leader is aware of this action. H) [Numbering as published] In regards to the broadcast of blasphemous sentences concerning the Sire of the Pious, such as "Allah, Our Sire, 'Ali," as you know, the poem is by Mowlavi and the organization for the second broadcast of the song has changed the praise to "Our Sir, Our Sire, 'Ali," and then issued permission for its broadcast. 5) [as published] Showing actual persons in the role of the infallible imams. Voice and Vision response: In this case, the Inquiry and Investigation Group has reported falsely, because such an instance has not occurred on television. But the situation was that in a play that was broadcast about his holiness, Imam Mohammad Baqer, the face of the narrator, who was a companion of the Imam, was designed very beautifully and brilliantly, which created doubt for some people that the narrator was in the role of an infallible one and hence they had written to the grand leader. His honor mentioned the matter to the organization and naturally, because in this case actual persons had not appeared in the role of the infallible ones, there was no problem. F) [as published] Not broadcasting repeated sad films in special cases, and the decree of his honor is implemented fully. It can be seen that his honor, too, like his pious predecessor, that is, the late Imam, continuously makes reminders about any problem, even if it is "one sentence," to the Voice and Vision, the total of which, as witnessed by the Inquiry and Investigation Group from 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] to 1370 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] were 14 instances, the most important of which were quoted. It is noteworthy that the Voice and Vision has made its utmost effort to carry out the reminders and directives of his honor in a most expedient manner. The fact that during this period, the grand leader, with his precision and cultural, religious, political, and social competence--and, as it was said, he has not even ignored one sentence that was in violation--shows that of course in personal meetings of the officials, while giving them directives, he has also expressed his contentment. G) [as published] The Inquiry and Investigation Group in the continuation of this section refers to the violation of the laws and regulations of the organization by the director of the organization and says: "According to the head of the Policy Making Council, most of these ratifications are not announced to the concerned units by the honorable director of the organization." We doubt this to be the statement of the honorable head of the Policy Making Council, because immediately and regularly the copies of the announcements are sent to him. Continuing the report, the group says, "In examining the activities of the organization and their conformity with the laws, as well, we come across problems that indicate noncompliance with legal matters, and they are stated in instances 2, 2 [sentence as published], 21, 23, 27, 30, 33, 45, 46, and 62." Because we do not know about these instances, we cannot respond. But in considering the rest of the instances in the report, it is certain that these numbers are only meant to fill paper and serve as a sort of psychological war. The group has referred to some instances of not observing some of the articles of the charter of the Voice and Vision organization, [Paragraphing in the original] which are contrary to facts, because first, the general manager, when the Supervisory Council existed presented the report of activities in accordance with the regulations to the Supervisory Council. Whether the Supervisory Council reported it to the Council of the heads of the three branches or not does not concern the organization. The number of the deputy director areas of the organization is six, but the number of units that are under the authority of the director decrease are combined as need be. In regards to the Sirjan transmitters, it should be said that a detailed report was presented by the officials of the organization during the visit of the deputies, to which the deputies expressed their satisfaction in the location of the transmitter station. However, in the report, the contrary is stated. In regards to the leaning of the Satellite Building which resulted in its destruction and the moving of the satellite equipment, it must be said: Based on the report of qualified technical experts, the damage to this building was due to an earthquake with a vertical strike and if at any time this or similar earthquakes occur anywhere, it will have similar financial and human casualties. Hence, it is not clear why the group blames the officials of the Voice and Vision even in natural disasters. Of course, under this pretext, the Inquiry and Investigation Group has made unjust accusations against the educational deputy director of the organization, who at that time was the deputy carrying out the developmental projects of the Voice and Vision organization. With this logic, no doubt the managers of the Voice and Vision in Gilan and Zarjan are blamed for the earthquake in those provinces. Then the Inquiry and Investigation Group makes false statements under the heading of the security of the organization, to which due to the importance of some of the instances, we shall respond. The Inquiry and Investigation Group claims that the existence of a strong security that can control the actions and behavior of the managers and personnel of this organization is obvious. Among the reports that from various sources reached the Investigation Committee concerning the managers, directors, and producers of mainly the Vision, about 40 of them involved people who are serving in sensitive key positions. The committee prepared a report on their activities and in meetings that were held initially with the Administrative Violations Committee of the organization, the above-mentioned committee stated that they verify the statements that concern the violations and incompetence of the individuals on the above-mentioned list. We know of no case of a sister having first entered the organization and later, as a result to the pressure and the climate of the organization, changed to another kind of veil. It is appropriate, if there is such an instance, that it be reported it to this organization. Voice and Vision response: The statements of the Inquiry and Investigation Group are untrue, because first the Inquiry and Investigation Group has had an unofficial meeting with two members of the Violations Committee. Second, initially, they had mentioned the names of two persons who were dismissed but by the order of the director of the organization were returned to work. When the files of these two people were placed at their disposal, it became known that one case was not returned and the second case was dismissed by the purging committee and returned to the organization in 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983]. It was on the order of one of the elements of interest to the Inquiry and Investigation Group and hence, fortunately, all the discussions in that meeting were recorded. The secretary of the group has the tape and can place it at the disposal of the Voice and Vision for broadcast. The Inquiry and Investigation Group has paid no attention and passed it by. In continuation, the Inquiry and Investigation Group says that in a meeting that they had with the general director of security of the organization, he has verified the reports concerning 40 people and later he has not cooperated. This is also untrue. First, the question of the Inquiry and Investigation Group in this connection was with financial misuse and moral corruption. But since there had been no cases, the director of security had said: I cannot make up evidence based on your wishes. The members of the Inquiry and Investigation Committee became very angry, threw the security file which was at their disposal into some corner and left the room. In the continuation of this discussion, the group states other matters about which, because they are pure lies or due to the consideration for the interests of the country, we cannot comment. Then the group, under the heading of the climate of the Voice and Vision, makes statements that are all untrue. Fortunately, almost all the officials of the regime have seen the work space environment of the Voice and Vision, and there is no need to explain the untruth in the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group. In one case the group points out that the picture of a semi-naked foreign female tennis player was hanging on the wall of the office hall. Interestingly, the picture was a 25x20 color picture of a male tennis player, and it was not on the wall of the office hall but in the corridor of the technical warehouse. It was not a female tennis player, but a male tennis player. The Inquiry and Investigation Group says: "Because the secretaries of the organization from the high-ranking to the lower managers are all women employees, given the relations that these secretaries have with each other, they influence the decisions of the managers of the organization." Voice and Vision response: First, because the members of the group apparently have "eyes for women," they have not seen the male secretaries, or, as it was stated, they saw a male tennis player as a female tennis player. Second, if the decisions of the managers of an organization are to be influenced by the relationship of many of the secretaries of that organization, would this have happened if all the secretaries of the organization were men? Such judgments that on the one hand, "stem from the male-dominated viewpoint of the members of the group" and on the other hand are very inexpert and superficial cannot be accepted by anyone who knows the first thing about the management of a sensitive organization such as the Voice and Vision. Why they have looked at the issues so superficially is unclear to us. Or if it is, we will avoid explaining it further. The group says: The official veiling in the Voice and Vision is a scarf and manteau and there are a very small number who cannot be seen in the organization who use the chador, and unfortunately most of the sisters who had initially gone to the organization with chadors have been forced to use a manteau and scarf as a result of the environment of the organization. Voice and Vision response: First, those who have come to the organization when employees leave or arrive have seen a significant number of women in chadors, which itself is a strong proof of the falsity of the group's claim. Second, in a number of jobs in this organization, the use of a chador is not possible, and hence in the work environment such sisters use very concealing manteaus and facial veils. Third, we know of no instance of a sister having entered the organization with a chador and later changing to another veil due to the environmental pressure of the organization. It is appropriate, if this is the case, for it to be reported to the organization. Fourth, as has been mentioned earlier, in Islam, what is obligatory for women is full covering and not the form of the covering. The Inquiry and Investigation Group in the continuation of the same report says: "As a result of various pressures, which have been imposed on the organization, they allowed a sister to read the news in full Islamic veil (chador). After the second session, she was attacked in the corridors of the organization by a number of female employees. This claim of a group is a pure lie, both in regards to outside pressure and also the attack by the employees on the above-mentioned sister. In regards to the organization, the group has made incorrect statements to which the Basij resistance headquarters has responded and apparently published in the newspaper. So no further explanation is necessary here. Then the Inquiry and Investigation Group engaged in reporting its examination of the college. In the first part of the report, they have spoken of the shortages and inappropriateness of the educational environment of the college and the equipment and accused the officials of the organization over the past 15 years of having taken no steps to create the college. Voice and Vision response: At least in the last 10 years, every year the estimated budget request for the building of the college has been made by the officials of the Voice and Vision. This request has either been omitted by the government or the Majles, and it is apparent that without a budget, it is not possible to build and equip a college. Then the Inquiry and Investigation Group continues: "Since the college is under the direct supervision and policymaking of the educational deputy director, it is necessary to see who is the highest decisionmaking authority and who determines the directives for the training of the most important cultural and artistic strategies of the country. Voice and Vision response: First, not only is the educational deputy director not a policymaker but no deputy director, neither in the Voice and Vision nor any other organization, is. He is the implementor of the policies. Second, in the higher education units, including the Voice and Vision College, all the courses are approved and endorsed by the Supreme Educational Council of the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education and is not related to any other authority. Third, in the Voice and Vision College, the head of the college is the implementor and supervisor of the implementation of the educational and training policies, not the educational deputy director. Under this pretext, the Inquiry and Investigation Group has engaged in making empty accusations against him. For example, it has said that he was in charge of construction of the Satellite Building, which could have been one of the bloodiest accidents. We have already explained about the satellite unit, that first he was not in charge of the construction of the building, but at the time he was executive deputy of the developmental projects of the organization, and one of the projects of the organization was the satellite project. Second, the damage to the Satellite Building was due to the earthquake, and if there is anyone who is guilty, it was not he. The group then continues that he was in charge of the construction of the Zibakenar villas where women and men swam together and drank alcohol. Again, first, the accusations that they say have occurred in the educational complex while serving in Zibakenar are lies, and even if an instance were to have happened, what does it have to do with the implementor of the project? And Second, he was not the implementor of the project, someone else was. Then they say, this complex is not educational but recreational, and they have just called it educational. The number of people who have been trained in this complex since it was opened, not only from the Voice and Vision employees but employees of other executive organizations, is very large. In the past few days a number of organizations which have had their training courses in this complex have asked us why the Inquiry and Investigation Group makes such false statements. They ask: Are they not deputies of the people in the Majles and have they not taken oaths to be their trustees? We have had and have no answer to the question of these people. The group then continues: "His harsh and offensive reaction towards Hezbollah sisters and brothers of the organization is known to everyone. His de-Islamization exceeds his domain of authority and we witness the dismissal of religious persons..." Unfortunately, there are no reasons or evidence of instances of accusations and the group has not presented any documents. We do not know on the basis of which standards have they allowed themselves to make such unjust and untrue accusations against the people. Are these not judicial crimes? If they do not prove it in the court, as they cannot, what is the punishment for such accusations which they have widely published? Will they be punished? In any case, what will they answer to God? The group then continues that he goes under various pretexts on trips and is especially interested in Japan. First, the travel of all the managers, including him, is done when it is necessary. Second, what kind of accusation is this to say that he is interested in Japan? And how have they discovered such an interest? The group then says that in the ski competitions several years ago in Japan, the physical education officials had asked the hosts to have the flag of the Islamic Republic be carried by a man and upon his arrival he insisted that like other countries a woman must carry it, but the host officials did not accept it because there was not enough time for training. Voice and Vision response: First, the flags of the countries are carried by the athletes of the same country and the flag of the Islamic Republic was also carried by an athlete member of the revolutionary institutions. What was told to the group was probably about carrying the placard with the name of the countries, which is carried by a host, and what occurred was precisely the opposite. Continuing this report, the Inquiry and Investigation Group, while insulting a number of professors and claiming not to choose them, states "the educational deputy in a letter asks the director of the organization to eliminate selection from entering students which is agreed to by the director of the organization and protested by the Supreme Council for Selection." Voice and Vision response: These instances are also untrue, because in his correspondence he requested selection to respond within a certain period (three months), whether the applicants are admitted or not, and it was agreed to by the director of the organization. And the reason was that the situation of those admitted must be clarified for registration. The group in the continuation makes unjust accusations against one of the most modest professors who wears a chador, which we are embarrassed to repeat here. The statements of the group in this case, too, are pure lies, and we do not know why this group that in one place defends women with chadors makes unjust accusations here against one of the most modest of women in the organization. We do not know how they want to answer before justice for such contradictions and accusations. God willing, God will protect us from the cursed Satan, Amen, oh Lord of Two Worlds. In the conclusion of the report, the Inquiry and Investigation Group quotes the students of the college concerning the low amount of student and welfare resources. Voice and Vision response: We admit that there are insufficient resources for the students, but the students of the Voice and Vision College are no worse off in terms of welfare and educational aid than those in other universities and higher education centers. We hope that with the increase in resources we will be able to provide the students with more resources, God willing. A Few Points By expressing its disappointment in the content of the inquiry and investigation report, which is full of accusations and slander, the Voice and Vision organization did not have any choice but to respond, because in this connection it may cause anxiety for the public and lack of trust and confidence in the regime and this public university that is the powerful protector of the revolution and Islam. Unfortunately, the inquiry and investigation report was broadcast from the Voice of the Islamic Republic on the threshold of the national and epic day of 13 Aban [4 November], the day of the struggle against the oppressors headed by the United States and was followed by many reactions from the people, officials, and experts. The above-mentioned reaction was the main reason for the organization's response. Today, it has become certain for the self-sacrificing managers and the concerned employees of the organization that the inquiry and investigation report was prepared and devised on the basis of a particular premeditated political agenda and by a small number of the honorable deputies and does not represent the opinion and intention of all the honorable deputies of the Majles. And in spite of our previous wishes we have been obliged to refer to the past history of some of those who elected the valuable deputies to be aware of this difference. Hence, the response of the organization to the accusations was merely and directly to the claims of that small number of deputies, and legally, too, it had to be broadcast from the Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Also, in this connection, the rights of the concerned and sincere employees and self-sacrificing and religious managers of the organization had to be defended, the Basij employees and managers who in these years of destiny, under the shower of missiles and in the middle of fields of problems, due to the enmity of the oppressors and other critical crises, have worked hard and fought day and night in various units of the organization to protect the values and foundations of the Islamic regime and for the people to be able to live with confidence in the regime and trust in the officials peacefully. The other reason was that in order to enlighten the public mind and eliminate the doubts resulting from the untrue content of the inquiry and investigation report that had caused anger and anxiety for the people, the publication of the explanations and responses of the organization and announcing the related truth and facts seemed necessary, because one of the main principles of the work of the organization has always been based on creating a psychological balance and peace of mind in the society, and it is religiously and legally responsible to prevent the broadcast of matters that cause conflict in the society and disrupt public unity and respond appropriately to untrue statements and domestic and foreign problems and various ambiguities that disrupt national unity and the psychological and spiritual peace of the people in order to attain the last will and testament of the Imam and the emphatic recommendation of the grand leader in preserving unity in the society. Hence, the response of the organization to the accusations of the Inquiry and Investigation Committee was for the purpose of enlightening the public and preventing rumors and conflicts, which are the side effects for the people. The response of the organization was also necessary from a different dimension. The accusations were so cowardly and climate creating that they discouraged the self-sacrificing and committed artists and writers and the religious and competent forces of the culture and caused instability and lack of job security for those who have worked hard, truthfully, and sincerely for years and this seemed very unpleasant and hard. If they were not supported and defended on time, it would pose questions to their future service to the revolution and Islamic art and culture, which would have been irreparable. One of the most important reasons for the response of the organization is the heartfelt and religious duty and commitment that we felt in defending the ideas of the founder of the Islamic revolution and the grand leader. The late Imam identified the Voice and Vision as the public university and Ayatollah Khamene'i the protector of the revolution and Islam. Silence with regard to the content of the untrue inquiry and investigation report would be considered treason against the revolution and its leaders, because the cultural policies and the basic goals, principles, priorities and the fundamental policies of the organization have been completed by the grand leader and always implemented. Concerning the cultural principles and the culture-creating events and also cultural pestilence, the Imam said: "Culture is the source of all fortunes and misfortunes of a nation. Leaving the misleading Western culture and replacing it with the instructive Islamic and national culture and cultural revolution in all areas throughout the country requires such work and effort that years must be spent to achieve it. `And the danger of those with stone-age mentality and stupid pseudo-religious individuals...is not small.' In the Islamic Republic, except in cases when Islam and the dignity of the regime is threatened and as determined by a wise expert, no one can impose his opinion on another.... If we are able to present a regime based on the true following of the slogan, "Neither Eastern nor Western" and an Islam devoid of hypocrisy and deception, then the revolution would be victorious." "The way to reform a country is through the culture of that country. Reform must start with the culture. We hope mankind will reach such growth that will change the machine guns into pens. As much as the pen and expression have served mankind, machine guns have not.... The basis is to defend the truth and replace the machine gun with truth and science. Propaganda, which is the same as identifying the good and encouraging people to do them and show evil and the way to escape and prohibit it, is a very important principle of dear Islam. Show the framework of pure Mohammadan Islam, which is in drawing sacred and revolutionary anger, wrath, and hostility against Western capitalism and the aggressive communism of the East and also the path to fight hypocrisy and deception to the people, especially the brave young people. This issue, that the regime is serious in its goals and if the Islamic values are threatened it will deal decisively with anyone in any situation, must be propagated as an unchanging principle for all officials and the people." The above directives that are the fundamental principles and cultural policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran acquaint sincere, God seeking, and concerned individuals with many truths and warns them of the dangers and the intellectual and cultural ideas contrary to the pure and happiness-creating Islamic culture. The warnings of his honor concerning those with stone-age mentality and pseudo-religious individuals must always be kept in mind, and we must take seriously the danger of stone-age mentality, superficiality, hypocrisy, and deception. But, unfortunately, clear and perfect traces of stone-age mentality and superficiality can be seen in the inquiry and investigation report, which seems, when it is placed alongside other recent events, to assume a particularly dangerous meaning and will have improper and inappropriate consequences. This sense of threat can be strongly seen in the reactions of the people--the people who are always present on the scene--to the inquiry and investigation report. A Few Words With the People We thank you for your telephone calls and support. Let us discuss a few points with you. First, you know well that every once in a while attacks are launched by those with a stone-age mentality, superficial thinkers, or those from particular political leanings against the programs and cultural activities of the Voice and Vision organization. If we evaluate them optimistically, we realize that these attacks have been formed due to the lack of awareness on the part of their operators of the ratified principles, policies, and goals of the organization and unfamiliarity with the kind and expansion of the work of this powerful medium and for this reason will soon lose their color. Hence, you can be certain, and there is no room for worry, that the programs of the organization will be as strong as before and will be designed, produced, and broadcast as the most healthy, most moral, and most instructive means to fill your hours of leisure, for strengthening your spiritual and psychological peace of mind and on the basis of Islamic values and your various needs. Second, the organization has always tried to avoid responding to accusations and to not be a slave to the common traps, chaos and psychological attacks that intend to engage the managers and officials and subsequently decrease the production and technical activities, and still, as in the past, it does not intend to respond to any minor accusation or lie published by incompetent people or personal tastes in the press. In the future, too, it will try not to respond to such cases and follow the directive of the Koran, which states: And the servants of (God), most gracious, are those who walk on the earth in humility, and when the ignorant address them, they say, "Peace...." Those who witness no falsehood, and if they pass by futility, they pass by it with honorable avoidance. But since the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Committee has been issued by an official authority and widely spread, with cowardly accusations against the self-sacrificing managers and Hezbollah, committed, and active employees, it was obvious and caused anger, anxiety, and doubt in the society, we were obliged to respond, although we did not wish to do so. Third, in exchange for your encouragement and for your peace of mind, we have some good news for the noble and good people of Iran, especially the majority, who have no video players: The efforts of the active colleagues in the Voice and Vision in planning and operation of the technical system of Network 3 has reached fruition, and in the near future good and appropriate programs will be broadcast for your leisure time. A Few Words With the Press The independent press underwent the test of freedom and adherence to the law of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Islamic morality, and duty well, may God grant them more success. But a dependent newspaper failed the test and was humiliated. This group published the inquiry and investigation report, which contained many accusations, such as drinking alcohol, illicit relations, theft, spying for foreigners, de-Islamization, etc., concerning the serving people in the organization and not only refused to publish the legitimate defense and the response of the Voice and Vision organization, but wrote in defense and praise of the main elements who prepared the inquiry and investigation report and the fabrications of the accusations. Whereas Islamic duty and the legal framework of the press and religious ethics dictated that they publish the response to the accusations to prevent damage to the dignity of the servants and to eliminate doubt. Indeed, "why did they not do so" is an important question. Perhaps the officials of this newspaper did not consider the above-mentioned accusations of drinking wine, illicit relations, theft, de-Islamization, etc., to be violations and regard them as good deeds and hence they did not consider them accusations and refused to publish them. Or perhaps they did not consider it in the financial interest of their newspaper and violated political ethics, the honor of journalism, and the law of the press. If only this group of the dependent newspaper would for once publish for the people their ideological line, group goals, and work ethic in order for the people to become more familiar with their implemental goals. Even in the heathen ideology of Marxism you cannot find such a justification for publishing a letter of insult against a number of active, hard-working, committed people not to respond and defend those who have been unjustly accused. In any case, we say to the grand families of the martyrs, self-sacrificers, and missing-in-action, especially the revered families of the martyrs, self-sacrificers and missing-in-action of the Voice and Vision organization, while praising their self-sacrifice, that we have pledged to God to continue your path on the culture front and not be afraid of any harm. If your dear ones and children fought on the battle fronts against oppression and generously gave their blood and life to help and strengthen the sapling of the Islamic revolution and preserve the values, we too have made a pledge to fight bravely in the cultural front and put up resistance. We have been completely sincere and are ready to sacrifice our life and reputation to strengthen the fruitful tree of the Islamic revolution. Oh God, grant us success in achieving the goals of the Islamic revolution and the directives of Imam Khomeyni and the grand leader. Oh God, grant us success in serving more and step more steadfastly in the path of Your guidance. Oh God, increase our revolutionary resistance and patience in acting on the lofty instructions and carrying out our religious duties. Amen.
