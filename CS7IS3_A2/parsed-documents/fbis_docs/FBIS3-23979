The usual answer to this question is: "We are getting impoverished..." If we are to believe official figures, however, our life is not all that hopeless. And we obtained these figures from the most reliable original source--the Russian Department of Labor, which kindly made available to us the results of a study "On the Situation in the Social and Labor Sphere." So, here is how we lived and survived... First and foremost, the study authors note, despite the measures aimed at strengthening the social orientation of the reforms adopted in 1993, the people's situation remains difficult. The level of social guarantees has dropped, and income indexation lags behind rises in consumer prices. Our poverty had an impact on the demographic situation. Natural population loss (number of deaths exceeding the number of births) was registered in 68 regions in Russia. Life expectancy measured 65.8 years as compared to 69.3 years in 1986. Meanwhile, however, the population's monetary income, taking into consideration those engaged in entrepreneurial activities, increased 11-fold as compared to 1992. Taking into account the consumer price index, income increased by 9 percent. Society is being rapidly stratified into rich and poor. The income of the 10 highest percent of the population exceeds the income of the poorest by a factor of 11 (as compared to a factor of eight in the end of 1992). And this is only according to official data. In 1993, 77 percent of the population had an income of less than twice the size of the subsistence minimum, including 30 percent who had an income below the subsistence minimum. The poorest (income not exceeding the cost of the minimum food basket)--are families with many children, incomplete families, and those with several dependents. Despite numerous indexations, single pensioners and the disabled also ended up in this group. At the same time, a group of "new poor" emerged in Russia in 1993. This is what official statistics call work-eligible citizens whose income has fallen below the subsistence minimum. This includes first and foremost the unemployed (of which there are already more than 1 million), workers at unprofitable enterprises sent on indefinite leave (more than 4 million officially), and young people. More than 10 percent of high school graduates could not find jobs in 1993, as well as more than 70 percent of graduates of elementary vocational schools (!), more than 60 percent of graduates of intermediate vocational schools, and almost 50 percent of college graduates. The highest level of unemployment currently exists in the republics of Mari El, Dagestan, Chuvashia, Adygey, Mordvinia, and Pskov, Yaroslavl, and Ivanovo Oblasts, where there are very few job vacancies. There are between 11 and 33 contenders for each job here. Meanwhile, far from all who have been laid off at enterprises or have left because of not being paid have registered at the labor exchange. The number of those engaged in the nonstate sector of the economy has grown sharply and now comprises 40 percent of the total employed. The number of jobs at state enterprises, on the other hands, continues to shrink. The average wage in 1993 increased 9.9-fold as compared to 1992, which more or less corresponds to the rise in consumer prices. However, by December 1993 as compared to December 1992 it had increased only eightfold, while prices had increased almost 10-fold. There are wages and wages, however. It appears that everybody grasped this axiom in 1993. The past year produced the highest divergence in the size of wages in the state and nonstate sectors of the economy. The gap between high and low wages by the end of the year was measured by a factor of 27. At the same time, while high wages at private enterprises can at least be explained somehow (they are their own masters, and besides, no commercial structure maintains a huge staff), the gap of a factor of 12-15 (!) between the salaries of top managers and regular workers at state enterprises (without any regard to whether they are flourishing or in distress) is harder to explain. It appears that zealous directors direct all their economic acumen to figuring out how to better line their own pockets. Meanwhile, wages are losing their main functions: to provide for normal reproduction of labor force and provide incentives for effective labor. Increases in them have lost any connection with the final results of labor and depend only on price rises. From these statistical data the Ministry of Labor draws generally encouraging conclusions. The runaway decline in the standard of living of the population, which began in 1992, was halted in 1993. Economic reform is proceeding in an environment of relatively low unemployment. At the same time, however, the number of poor not only has not decreased but actually increased, and the number of unemployed (both registered and "hidden") has grown considerably. What to do about it is now being discussed in thick reports by specialists of the ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Social Protection. All we can do is wait, or join those 40 percent who have chosen the nonstate sector as their sphere of interests.
