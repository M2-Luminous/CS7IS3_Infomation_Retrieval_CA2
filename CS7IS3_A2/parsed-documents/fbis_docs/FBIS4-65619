The SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] candidate for chancellor, on the other hand, represents the greatest disappointment to the Greens: "He is continuing," says Spokesman for the Executive Committee Ludger Volmer furiously, "where Helmut Schmidt dropped off--back in the seventies." The Greens are frustrated. Never before had the alternative party believed themselves so close to governmental power as prior to election year 1994. What had played through with mixed reviews in several laender and municipalities appeared for the first time to be a realistic model for Bonn: a red-green government. But the awaited signal from the candidate for chancellor failed to appear. While the Greens tirelessly continue promoting their social-ecological reform alliance, Scharping is making every effort to provide for conservative security demands. For some time the irritated, ecologically minded peaceniks placated themselves with the idea that the SPD chairman was pursuing a well-planned strategy to increase the combined number of votes: Rather than getting in the way of the Greens and their agenda, so goes the benevolent interpretation, Scharping would prefer to try to take voters away from the union. Since then, however, the mood has changed dramatically. Suspicion is growing that Scharping is turning into a true descendant of Helmut Schmidt. For him red-green is not a serious option, but "an accident," as Professor of Political Science Joachim Raschke pointedly put it last week at the presentation of a book on the SPD candidate. "Center-right," suspects Raschke, is apparently "nothing more than a tactic." Scharping has already become all too involved with the union, almost as if he intends to document its indistinguishability from the SPD. This "idiotic self-imposed moderation," grumbles Hesse Environmental Minister Joschka Fischer, is "a fatal signal." Apparently nothing frightens the SPD chairman more than the role of a reformer. True, in the "1994 Governmental Policy Program" a "social and ecological society" created "by a reversal of the economy" was heralded. The policy also speaks of a new energy and transportation policy. But most of it remains vague or safeguarded by clauses, particularly symbolic issues such as the speed limit or a higher mineral oils tax. Rather than writing "time for a change" on his banners, complains Greens Politician Hubert Kleinert, Scharping is contributing "to the onerous atmosphere." How he, as a copy of Kohl, expects to win SPD sympathizers, "to reach 37 or 38 percent" (Raschke), continues to puzzle many. "We are not available as personal reinforcement for a policy of austerity and emergency government," says former civil rights campaigner Werner Schulz, who is currently secretary of the Alliance 90/Greens Bundestag parliamentary group. Of course the ecos have long been aware that no atmosphere of departure reigns in the country, that there is not much left to distribute. And the term market economy is no longer a stimulus for them. At their party conference in February they joined in the economic debate with moderate proposals. The demand initiated during the founding years that society be turned inside-out starting at the bottom has become passe. A number of unrealistic resolutions--withdrawal from NATO, immediate ban on the use of nuclear energy, abolishment of the Bundeswehr--are debatable even for members of the Left, like Volmer. What is important, qualifies the spokesman for the Fundamentalist faction, "is that action be initiated." Realist faction leader Fischer has established himself firmly in politics. If he had first "taken his thrashing," as he puts it, in the party over his project of establishing the Greens as an "FDP [Free Democratic Party] substitute" in the political spectrum, even the party left would now admit that he was right. At one appearance before the Frankfurt Chamber of Industry and Commerce Fischer was received with distrust and was bid goodbye with ovations. And still, gulfs remain. The Greens are under the impression that Scharping, with his dislike for the red-green project, is allowing himself to be guided by his experiences as minister president. In Rhineland-Palatinate he declined a coalition with an unpredictable Greens group and put his money on the Free Democrats instead. The conflict between economy and ecology that has become more critical during the crisis has been worked out, as the Greens were forced to realize, in the older, established parties--and not in their favor. To people who are losing ground socially and as a result of modernization, the SPD again appears as "protector of the little people," in keeping with the Social Democratic formula. From this angle, the desires of the Greens seem like post-industrial luxuries. This also explains setbacks in the red-green models, which appeared to be well established all over the country. "These experiences have, on the whole, had a sobering effect," assesses Volmer. Partly under pressure from the SPD labor union wing, and partly because of their empty coffers, land governments have been forced to very realistically halt plans to reorganize industry and the great transition scenarios for transportation and energy. This has also been the case in Fischer's Hesse home coalition. The Wiesbaden coalition agreement of 1991--like the Hannover agreement--had already robbed the Greens of any illusions. The agreement provides for only "rearrangements" in the land budget for new policy estimates. It goes on to say, "the financial elbow-room, which has been decreased by German unity," will force "the clear establishment of priorities." Even firmly established projects quickly began to slip. The ban on ecologically harmful PVC [polyvinyl chloride] materials in public buildings and dwellings was lifted. As former SPD Social Minister Armin Clauss explained, "In times of recession" his party could not share in such a "destruction of jobs." Transportation policy is almost always a matter of conflict of the highest order. After the SPD's heavy losses in the 1993 municipal elections in Hesse, the party was no longer ready to ban automobile drivers from downtown areas. Allowances for industry and for automobile enthusiasts interfered with the planned change. In Frankfurt, where Greens member Tom Koenigs watches over the finances, the automobile-free city has become stuck in the planning stages, along with the "bicycle-friendly city." SPD head of the Planning Department Martin Wentz is fighting against the green-belt project: "We must decide whether we want to build homes or not." Banning the use of nuclear energy remains a distant objective. At the land level Fischer has been able only to express "severe safety concerns." Still, he succeeded in bringing the old installation used to process plutonium in Hanau to a standstill and in harassing managers at the power plant in Biblis with taxes. Seldom has coalition harmony been completely untroubled. The SPD differs from the Greens, according to a paper published by the left-leaning Hesse-South SPD district, "in that when planning for the necessary ecological restructuring of the industrial society it takes into account the social situation of workers who will be affected." The fact that even mutual support does not protect the Greens from disappointments has become apparent in Lower Saxony, where Minister President Gerhard Schroeder can now govern with an absolute majority following the March elections. It was a partnership of affection. Contact with the state chancellery was brief: "Come on over sometime." From the very beginning, however, the Social Democrat had adhered to a proeconomic policy, in order to appease the traditional working clientele. Again and again Schroeder tested the ability of the Greens to withstand suffering--for example with his weakness for weapons exports or in the removal of the basic right to asylum, in the construction of a testing strip for Mercedes-Benz in swampland or with a pipeline through the mud flats. Not one of the Lower-Saxony nuclear power plants was dropped from the network. After these types of experiences, departing Greens Bundesrat Minister Juergen Trittin doubts that a reform alliance with the SPD in Bonn is a possibility: "What is needed there first is crisis management." Schroeder's neighboring colleague, Klaus Wedemeier, SPD mayor of Bremen, also has little positive support to contribute. In his stoplight coalition the Greens are gaining prestige, as they are in Hesse, to the detriment of the SPD. In the stoplight coalition with the FDP, the Greens were hoping for "a modernization alliance." Instead, "reappropriations and reductions" were agreed upon. Social and cultural projects had to be cut--everything, according to Greens Senator Ralf Fuecks, "is a compromise with reality." It is the same everywhere that is marked by an overstrained fiscal policy: "We muddled through," according to Volmer; "there is no influence in that." After all these frustrations some Greens have rediscovered a desire to be in the opposition. In Lower Saxony, where they will no longer be needed in the government, "many are breathing freely," as the former Minister of Women's Affairs Waltraud Schoppe observed: "Now they can say everything they have been wanting to say all along." In Bonn, too, believes the former Bundestag spokesperson, who hopes to return there in the fall, "we in the opposition can wait until a braver man than Scharping arrives on the scene." That could be quite some time.
