Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, professor, has now been governor of the NBJ for two-and-a-half months, but it is difficult to escape the impression that during the whole time he has been much more concerned with carrying out the economic program than with his job as governor. That is why we asked him at the outset whether a projection of monetary policy had been adopted for the second quarter of this year, since half of that period has already passed. "Let me say first that it is true that I have been involved with all kinds of things, but my legal responsibility is here in the NBJ, and any careful newspaper reader will see that I am very much involved in credit policy, in foreign-exchange policy, and so on. There are certain matters that I cannot fail to be involved with in the light of earlier history, and all those issues are related. You cannot examine credit policy without looking at budget policy, since these are two conflicting requirements," Dr. Avramovic explained. "As for the projection of monetary policy, it was made last Tuesday evening in the federal government, but I am not at all enthusiastic about any projections. Monetary projection is a devilish thing, it depends on the rate of circulation of the money, and no one knows what the rate of circulation is. Accordingly, decisions on this have to be made from week to week, since our total supply of money in circulation is only 7 to 8 percent of the national income. That is about 1,200,000,000 dinars, of which about 360,000,000 have gone to the state to cover the budget deficit, about 300 million to buy foreign exchange, and all the rest to the economy." [Kesic] Can this monetary policy which you are conducting be called "restrictive"? [Avramovic] I have tried not to make it restrictive for the economy. We have managed to drop the interest rate from 30 percent at the beginning of the program's implementation to 9 percent. We will be restrictive when it comes to granting loans to the state, but monetary policy will be absolutely open when it comes to granting loans to the economy. [Kesic] You announced that beginning in July the NBJ will no longer use primary note issue for credit to finance the deficits in the federal and two republic budgets. [Avramovic] There is no primary issue for the state any more! Budgets will be replenished by borrowing on the capital market, but those amounts will be relatively modest. We want to put the state on notice that the NBJ cannot be its permanent banker. We have asked government bodies and agencies to prepare their projections for May, June, and July, and then we will see how to cover those deficits which they have, especially with respect to using commodity reserves. We are not going to kill the state, it is not a question of that, but it is a question of general priorities. I think that our credit policy should bring about a growth of production of 30 to 40 percent, and that will provide a solution to the budget problem, since fiscal revenues will increase 30 to 40 percent. That is the best way of replenishing the budget, not through direct deficit financing. [Kesic] How independent is the NBJ in conducting monetary policy, especially when we know that the Serbian finance minister is a member of the bank's board? [Avramovic] O.K., those are now new things which have come about. The most recent appointments in Serbia have altered relations on the board. It is obvious that now we must think about what we are going to do here next. But so far I have not had problems when it comes to the independence of the NBJ. [Kesic] Is the NBJ board, which conducted monetary policy at the time when we had the highest inflation in the world, at all capable of conducting a policy of a stable exchange rate of the dinar? [Avramovic] That is a hypothetical question. They were not the only people making decisions about monetary policy, there were general circumstances which brought that about. And you will understand me if I do not answer your question now. I can only say that Avramovic is independent in conducting monetary policy and that the NBJ is independent.
