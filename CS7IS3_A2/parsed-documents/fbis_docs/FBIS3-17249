A conference was held in the mayor's office on the emergency situation in the city with respect to medical-sanitary conditions. "By 9 May the city of Vladivostok must be 'licked clean'"--stated new head of administration, Konstantin Tolstoshein, at the outset of the conference. Everyone present agreed with him. Attending the conference were the heads of reinstituted rayon administrations, militia representatives, medical-sanitation inspection personnel, and housing department officials. They reported on the situation and proposed measures for bringing sanitation order to the city. The following measures are contemplated. As soon as the weather brings positive temperatures, work will begin on the repair and asphalting of city roads in disrepair. Commercial stalls and sidewalk vendors--the main "suppliers" of trash in densely populated areas--will be administratively punished for refusal to clean up their vicinity, up to and including removal of business licenses and cancellation of contracts for lease of the land their stalls occupy. It will also be proposed that enterprises of all forms of ownership conduct trash cleanup of their surrounding areas. A problem arises regarding the cleanup of housing unit areas, insofar as residential building maintenance services simply lack the resources to accomplish this. Konstantin Tolstoshein proposed reinstitution of the fine old tradition of subbotniki [days of voluntary unpaid labor], so that tenants--to put it bluntly-- collect the trash around their homes for the city services to haul away to the dumps. As far as the financing of road repair and city cleanup is concerned, according to Tolstoshein, Maritime Kray Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko has promised to assist Vladivostok in this effort. Konstantin Tolstoshein expressed certain considerations of principle at the conference with respect to the future structure of the city's government. "It is not we who must work for the structure. The structure must work to benefit the people of Vladivostok," he stated. Tolstoshein is an "advocate of a city with functionally capable rayons, rayons with a high level of independence." In this regard, there will be a restoration in the rayon administrations of departments for enterprise registration, departments for registration and distribution of housing, and other subdivisions. A definitively new structure of city government will apparently be approved by the end of next week. In this regard, the new administration is compelled to engage in another kind of cleanup. Efforts are presently underway in the mayor's office to repeal certain decrees of the previous administration not conducive to the effective operation of city structures. Numerous legal proceedings initiated against various authorities on behalf of the mayor's office are being revoked. At the same time, the new head of city administration, Konstantin Tolstoshein, has refused to repeal free travel on public transportation in Vladivostok.
