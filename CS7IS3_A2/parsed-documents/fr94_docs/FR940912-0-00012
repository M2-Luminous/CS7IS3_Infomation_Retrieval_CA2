FR940912-0-00012 FR940912-0-00005 On June 4, 1993, the bank and thrift Federal regulatory agencies published proposed regulations (58 FR 31878) to amend the existing real property appraisal regulations. On November 10, 1993, the Federal regulatory agencies solicited additional comments on the database supporting the de minimis level proposal (58 FR 59688). The OCC, FDIC, FRB, and OTS subsequently adopted final regulations, which were published on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29482). The major changes made by the final regulations are: 1. Increasing the de minimis level to $250,000 above which real estate appraisals using State licensed and/or certified appraisers are required. 2. Providing an exception for small- and medium-sized ``business loans,'' including loans to entities and individuals engaged in farming enterprises, with a transaction value of $1.0 million or less. 3. Clarifying the ``abundance of caution'' exception. 4. Providing additional exceptions to the use of State licensed and/or certified real estate appraisers. 5. Clarifying appraisal standards and appraiser independence requirements. B. FCA's Consideration On June 10, 1993, the FCA Board adopted a policy position requesting public comment on possible regulatory burden issues addressing a variety of subjects. This ``Regulatory Burden'' statement was published on June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34003). On July 15, 1993, the FCA Board directed staff to begin considering appropriate revisions of the FCA's regulations and to monitor the progress of the regulatory revisions proposed by the Federal regulatory agencies. The FCA received 15 comment letters in response to its regulatory burden statement from various System institutions and related parties addressing collateral evaluation related issues. The commenters, in general, supported the positions that had previously been proposed by the Federal regulatory agencies. The commenters also expressed concerns with the inclusion of specific standards of the collateral evaluation regulations (i.e., general valuation and personal property requirements) as well as specific requirements of part 614, subpart L, as they pertain to the appraisal requirements for reconsideration of loan denials. In addition, the FCA has received two additional sets of comments requesting that the FCA consider the positions proposed by the Federal regulatory agencies. The FCA responds to the comments received in Section IV, Regulatory Revisions , of this document. III. Historical Analysis The FCA has not identified any System institution that has failed solely because of poor or fraudulent appraisal activities. However, there have been institutions that have failed where poor collateral evaluation practices have been a contributing factor. A review of several of the institutions that failed during the 1980s has indicated that when such institutions failed, they exhibited characteristics such as: (1) Poor credit administration practices; (2) poor internal controls; (3) poor collateral evaluation practices; and (4) lack of credit expertise to handle increased debt levels and loan volume. The majority of the institutions that failed or required some form of assistance did so because of losses experienced in a few large, complex, and/or specialized loans. Poor collateral evaluation practices coupled with one or more of the other characteristics described above contributed to the problems faced by the institutions. With the implementation of the FCA's collateral evaluation regulations, the institutions have been required to establish and implement appropriate collateral evaluation policies and procedures. Such policies and procedures are needed to address collateral evaluation independence requirements and basic evaluation and appraisal standards, as well as educational and qualification requirements. The development of such policies and procedures coupled with appropriate internal controls, credit controls, and underwriting standards (i.e., lending limits, financial and repayment analysis, loan inspections, etc.) will help ensure that past problems are not repeated. The FCA's collateral evaluation regulations require that all System institutions will perform a collateral evaluation on all secured loans and leases. Such collateral evaluations will take the form of a basic valuation or a more detailed real estate appraisal, depending on the loan collateral and the specifics of the loan decision. The basic requirements concerning individuals responsible for collateral evaluations address minimum education, qualification, independence, and methodology standards that are either established by the regulation or must be established by the institution's policies and procedures consistent with the requirements of the regulations.
