The government's forecast for the surplus, as a percentage of gross domestic product, "is not something to discuss" with Bentsen or at Saturday's meeting in Frankfurt of finance leaders from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial nations, Fujii told reporters after a morning cabinet meeting. Fujii said he expects to meet his U.S. counterpart "face-to-face" before the multilateral meeting and will explain the recent 15.25 trillion yen economic-stimulus package, which includes 6 trillion yen in tax cuts. Deregulation and measures such as the tax cuts to stimulate domestic demand "will have a great significance" in the medium term to reduce Japan's surpluses, he said. Some government and ruling coalition leaders have recently hinted that the surplus forecasts could be used as "effort targets" in Japan-U.S. trade talks, which bogged down over targets to measure progress in opening Japan's markets. Instead, Fujii said he plans to explain the stimulus plan to Bentsen. "If there is a misunderstanding" that the 6 trillion yen tax cuts are a one-time measure, Fujii said, he would try to explain that the cuts are to be part of a full-fledged tax reform. Fujii noted that the coalition agreed, and the cabinet endorsed, a plan to enact balanced tax reform by the year's end that will reduce the burden of direct levies such as incomes taxes and increase indirect taxes such as the consumption tax. "As fellow human beings, if we meet face-to-face, I think I can get him to understand how we feel," he said. He said he has been in contact with Bentsen on "various matters" but declined to elaborate. Asked how much understanding he could expect from his U.S. counterpart with reports circulating that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to reshuffle the cabinet, Fujii said he would ask Bentsen to trust him as finance minister. Fujii said the bilateral meeting might take place Saturday morning before the G-7 talks begin, adding that it would be "rude" to ask Bentsen to meet the night before. Asked about the high yen, Fujii repeated that G-7 finance ministers and central bankers have agreed that rapid currency fluctuations are undesirable and that foreign exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals. It is their "common understanding" that drastic swings in a single nation's currency rate are undesirable not only for that country but for the world economy, he said. The major topic of the G-7 talks will be aid to Russia, with discussions to include conditions for disbursement of multilateral aid, he said. Large chunks of already-approved aid funds have been held up over Moscow's political and economic turmoil. Russian representatives are to meet with G-7 finance officials after the G-7 talks.
