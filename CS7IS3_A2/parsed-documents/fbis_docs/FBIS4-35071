The explosion occurred at one of the two reactors [reactores] located in the factory's pilot plant. These reactors are experimentally used to manufacture sulphur resin, which has many uses in the construction industry. The explosion injured six workers, two of whom are reported in very critical condition, two in critical condition, and the rest will be under medical observation for the next 24 hours. Marta Sanchez Castellanos, a chemical engineer and technologist at the corrugated roof factory, was caught in the explosion and suffered third-degree burns, eye injuries, and loss of consciousness. Mario de Armas Ligo, a specialist in mechanical plant plastics, is also in a critical condition in the intensive care burn unit at the Manuel Ascunse Domenech Hospital. Osvel Alvarez Basurto, a chemical engineer, and Angel Miguel Diaz, a pilot plant operator, are in critical condition, according to the team of specialists in charge of them. The two patients who present no major complications are Ricardo Cid Sanchez, an instrument maker, and Carlos Fonseca Pino, a technician in the boiler plant, who was hit by resin particles. The explosion destroyed part of the pilot plant's roof. The reactor's mixing vat, which weighs approximately 20 kg, landed at a distance of 40 meters. The explosion is being investigated, although everything seems to indicate it was the result of poor handling techniques.
