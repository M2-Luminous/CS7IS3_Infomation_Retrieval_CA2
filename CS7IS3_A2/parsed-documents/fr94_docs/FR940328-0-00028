FR940328-0-00028 FR940328-0-00012 Hesperomannia arborescens was formerly known from locations on three islands: Kaiholena and Kukui on Lanai; Pelekunu Trail on Molokai; and scattered populations throughout the Koolau Mountains, from Koolauloa and Pupukea at its northern extreme to Konahuanui at the southern end (Forbes 1920; HHP 1991f1 to 1991f10, 1991f12 to 1991f16, 1991f22). This species is now known from 18 populations totalling fewer than 70 plants on the islands of Oahu, Molokai, and Maui. On Oahu, 15 populations, which total about 50 to 60 individuals, have been observed since 1958 on private, Honolulu City and County, State, and Federal lands at a few disjunct locations over a distance of about 27 mi (43 km). Locations include: upslope of Kahuku, Laie, and Malaekahana; along Poamoho Trail above Poamoho Stream; along Waikane-Schofield Trail near the ridge summit; at Kipapa Gulch; on Halawa Ridge; and upper Palolo Valley to Niu Valley (HHP 1991f1, 1991f3, 1991f5, 1991f7, 1991f8, 1991f10, 1991f17 to 1991f21, 1993a1 to 1993a4; HPCC 1990b1; Marticorena and Parra 1975; Derral Herbst, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991). The Waikane-Schofield population occurs on the boundary of State (Ewa Forest Reserve) and Federal (Schofield Barracks Military Reservation) lands. On Molokai, one population of three individuals was found on State land in Olokui Natural Area Reserve (NAR) (HHP 1991f11; HPCC 1991c; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). A recent discovery in 1989 by Joel Lau of TNCH extends this species' range to the island of Maui, where two colonies totalling three individuals were discovered about 0.3 mi (0.5 km) apart on State land in West Maui NAR between Lanilili and Keahikauo (HHP 1991f23; HPCC 1990b2; J. Lau and S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991). Hesperomannia arborescens, often found on slopes or ridges in association with 'ohi'a, olopua, uluhe, Antidesma platyphyllum (hame), kopiko, Syzygium, and common Melicope species, typically grows in lowland wet forests and occasionally in scrub vegetation between 1,200 and 2,500 ft (360 and 750 m) in elevation (HHP 1991; HHP 1991f1 to 1991f3, 1991f5 to 1991f10, 1991f13 to 1991f18, 1991f20, 1991f22, 1991f23, 1993a1 to 1993a4; HPCC 1991c; Wagner et al. 1990; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1991). The Molokai population grows in lama- and/or 'ohi'a-dominated lowland mesic forest habitat within the same elevational range (HHP 1991f11; HPCC 1991c). The major threats to Hesperomannia arborescens are habitat degradation by feral pigs and goats, competition with alien plant taxa (Hilo grass, Koster's curse, strawberry guava, Tibouchina herbacea ), fire, and impact by humans. Stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to this species' limited numbers are significant threats as well. Lobelia oahuensis, named by Rock (1918, 1919) for the island on which the type specimen was collected, was transferred to the genus Neowimmeria by the Degeners in 1974; a genus not accepted by current authorities (Lammers 1990). Lobelia oahuensis, a member of the bellflower family, is a stout, erect, unbranched shrub 3 to 10 ft (1 to 3 m) tall. The elliptic leaves, which are 16 to 24 in (40 to 60 cm) long and 1.6 to 2.4 in (4 to 6 cm) wide, are typically stalkless and form a very dense rosette at the end of the stem. The upper surface of the leaves is hairless and the lower surface is covered with rather coarse grayish or greenish hairs. The inflorescence is branched 3 to 5 times from its base, with each erect spike 3 to 5 ft (0.1 to 1.5 m) tall and comprised of 50 to 200 flowers. Each flower measures 1.7 to 1.8 in (42 to 45 mm) long and about 0.2 in (5 mm) wide, with a 1.2 in (3 cm) long bract just below it. The linear calyx lobes are about 0.6 in (16 mm) long and 0.1 in (3 mm) wide. The fruits are hairy, oval capsules 0.4 to 0.7 in (10 to 17 mm) long and about 0.4 in (9 mm) wide that contain numerous brownish seeds. Lobelia oahuensis differs from other members of the genus in having the following combination of characters: Erect stems 3 to 10 ft (1 to 3 m) long; dense rosettes of leaves at the end of stems; lower leaf surfaces covered with coarse grayish or greenish hairs; and flowers 1.7 to 1.8 in (42 to 45 mm) long (Lammers 1990; Rock 1918, 1919; St. John and Hosaka 1935).
