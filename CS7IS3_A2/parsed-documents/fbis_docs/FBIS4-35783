The ministers also urged the UN Security Council to consider alternative ways to promote the implementation of its resolutions on Cyprus and recalled the idea of holding an international conference on the problem. Moreover they reiterated their support for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, unity and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus. The final document, adopted by the conference, which ended on Friday in the Egyptian capital, expressed the ministers' "regret that the recent initiative for the implementation of a package of confidence building measures has failed because the Turkish side has not shown the necessary political will, as has been reflected in the report of the UN secretary-general, just published." The UN-led talks on the measures, which included the re-opening of Nicosia International Airport under UN control and the delivery of part of the Turkish-occupied town of Varosha to UN administration, ended in failure this week, nearly a year after they started. Calling for the intensification of efforts towards finding a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem, the ministers "stressed the importance of securing compliance with all UN resolutions on Cyprus" and "urged the UN Security Council to act accordingly." The four-day meeting called for "the withdrawal of foreign troops and settlers" from Cyprus. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied the island's northern third. Turkey has repeatedly refused to comply with numerous UN resolutions calling for the withdrawal of its occupation forces. The NAM document considered the present status quo in Cyprus as "unacceptable" and expressed "deep regret and disappointment that so far no solution had been found." The ministers "welcomed the proposal by President of Cyprus Glavkos Kliridhis for the demilitarisation of the Republic of Cyprus." The extract on Cyprus has been described as a "huge success" because it contains many positions on the Cyprus issue that go far beyond any previous NAM decisions, a statement issued here on Friday said. Cyprus Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis led an eight-member delegation to the meeting, during which he had separate meeting with 30 NAM foreign ministers.
