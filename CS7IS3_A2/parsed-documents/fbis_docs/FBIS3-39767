Mr. Papoulias said: We really live in a period that is fraught with immense dangers from the plunging of the Balkans into a series of wild civil wars. The involvement of foreign forces in these clashes and the impending bombing of Bosnia-Herzegovina constitute a deadly threat to world peace. Mr. Papoulias added: The war flames are burning in our neighborhood, where unprecedented instability and uncertainty prevail. Our homeland constitutes the only oasis of stability in this sensitive region. With a steadfast peace-loving orientation, Greece extends a hand to all its neighbors seeking relations of friendship and cooperation. We do not claim anything from anyone. The only thing we demand is respect for our borders, respect of our fellow nationals' rights, and respect of our history. The foreign minister further said: Unfortunately, certain quarters have interpreted this stance as weakness and began and are still continuing with provocations and claims against our country. The more we assert our stance on the question of peace, the more determined we are to defend our history, our emblems, and national heritage. Mr. Papoulias also noted: We would like to send a message from here in Ioannina to our friends and partners: It is not Greece who is harming European Union [EU] solidarity; it has already been injured by all those who support the intransigence of [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia President Kiro] Gligorov and tolerate his indescribable claims. It is our homeland's inalienable right to protect our national integrity by adopting all those measures that will ensure that our rights are respected. Greece, far from harboring hegemonic intentions, wants the Balkans to become a place of sincere cooperation and mutual respect by all the peoples who live in this [words indistinct] peninsula. We cherish the hope that this prospect will prevail in the end over the disastrous logic of violence and war. We are certain that many of those who now criticize us will finally recognize the righteousness of our policy and our devotion to peace. Mr. Papoulias concluded: The Greek Armed Forces, with their excellent morale, all-round training, and devotion to their professional duty, constitute the most stalwart basis of this peace-loving policy of our government.
