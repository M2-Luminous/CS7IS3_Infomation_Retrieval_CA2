In his New Year address, the great leader presented the militant slogan our people should uphold. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We must effect a new upturn in socialist construction by overcoming difficulties and by displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude more highly. With the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, let us vigorously accelerate the grand socialist march. This is the call of our party, as well as the militant slogan our people must uphold today. Self-reliance and fortitude mean a resolute revolutionary position to carry out endlessly the revolution and construction by our own might, as well as an indomitable spirit of struggle to adhere to the revolutionary banner in defiance of any difficulties and obstacles. The display of the dignity and honor of the country and nation depends on self-reliance and fortitude. Even the way to build the most consolidated and vital socialism depends on self-reliance and fortitude. With the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, let us vigorously accelerate the grand socialist march. This slogan is the militant one that our people must uphold today because we can overcome various challenges and obstructive maneuvers by the imperialists and reactionaries and resolutely safeguard and adhere to socialism of our own style only if we uphold it. As soon as socialism collapsed in various countries throughout the world, the imperialists and reactionaries strengthened their unprecedented offensives in all fields -- political, economic, military, and diplomatic -- to isolate, suffocate [chilsik], and crush [apsal] our Republic, which is advancing under the socialist banner. Because of the enemies' anti-Republic and antisocialist maneuvers, the situation in our country have been aggravated and complicated. Also, a great number of obstacles have been created on the road ahead of us. For all people to accelerate on the grand socialist march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude will be a firm guarantee in smashing challenges by the imperialists and reactionaries and in resolutely safeguarding and adhering to socialism of our own style. Socialism of our own style is the chuche socialism built by our people's own might under the wise leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. This means that we must solve all problems in the socialist construction by our own might and from the chuche stance in any difficult conditions. The people, who highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, can keep their dignity and honor under any adversity, but the people, who fail to display it, will easily give in to the difficulties and trials and be doomed to ruin. Even last year, the imperialists and reactionaries applied pressure on various fields to crush [apsal] our Republic. We accelerated the socialist general march, however, by highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle and by rising as one with firm determination, not yielding to any maneuver, under the wise leadership of the party and the leader. Thus, we defended the supreme interest of the nation and people and safeguarded and protected our-style socialism. Experience shows that when we vigorously carry out the socialist general march by displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle, we can resolutely crush various challenges and disturbance maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries, can staunchly defend and protect our-style socialism, and can firmly safeguard dignity and honor of the nation. "Let us vigorously accelerate the socialist general march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle" -- this is a militant slogan that our people should uphold. Only when we uphold this slogan, can we thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary economic strategy and further glorify our-style socialism. In his New Year address, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forward as a strategic task the implementation of agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy during the three-year adjustment period by giving priority to the coal industry, the electricity industry, and railway transport -- the precedence domains in the national economy -- and continuous development of the metal industry. We will thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary economic strategy during the adjustment period of socialist economic construction, and thus will firmly consolidate the foundation of the nation's self-supporting economy. We will more satisfactorily ensure the people's living standard in compliance with the demand of socialism and will hold a new offensive position to occupy the greater height of socialism. Displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle by our people is an important demand for implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategy. This year we should continuously adhere to the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy. This year, which marks the 30th anniversary of publication of the rural thesis, we should vigorously carry out the struggle to accomplish the historic task of the rural thesis and should effect a new turn in the development of rural economy. Thus, we should attain without fail the lofty target of grain production put forward by the party. At the same time, by vigorously accelerating the light industry revolution, we should effect great innovations in the production of consumer goods and should develop external trade in compliance with changing circumstances. For us to develop agriculture and light industry and to vigorously accelerate the nation's overall economic construction, we should direct our strength to the coal, electricity, and metal industry, and should more satisfactorily establish railway transport. The tasks for implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategy are indeed gigantic. The road for successfully carrying out these grave tasks is to more highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle. Only when we wage the struggle to carry out our party's revolutionary economic strategy based on the revolutionary position to rely on our own strength, technology, and natural resources, can we successfully accelerate socialist construction. This proves that when we advance by highly upholding the slogan on accelerating the socialist general march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle, we can further glorify our-style socialism by thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary economic strategy. What is important in effecting a new revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction under the revolutionary banner of self-reliance is for all party members and working people to fight staunchly with the spirit of adding the speed of the nineties to Chollima. All party members and workers should advance and advance again and should struggle and struggle again with the tenacious Chollima spirit cherished by the working class in Kangson, which produced 120,000 tons of steel billet from the blooming mill with only a 60,000-ton capacity when everything was short and difficult, and with the militant spirit with which they manufactured modern machinery with their own strength through arduous struggle. For all people to vigorously accelerate the socialist general march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle, we should, above all, have firm resolution and determination to safeguard to the last and glorify the socialist banner with our own strength by trusting this strength. Our people will not abandon our independent position even if someone else applies pressure on us, nor will we rely on others in the face of difficulty. Our people's will to nurture the socialist ideal on this land with our own strength, wisdom, and natural resources will not change today and in the future. All party members and working people should more firmly assume the thoroughgoing position to carry to accomplishment the chuche socialist cause to the end with our own strength, and should vigorously accelerate the socialist general march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle.
