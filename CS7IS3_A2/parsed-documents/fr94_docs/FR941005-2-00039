FR941005-2-00039 FR941005-2-00031 Proposed Finding of No Significant Impact; Proposed Tokamak Physics Experiment, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy. ACTION: Proposed finding of no significant impact. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE) has prepared this Proposed Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) on its proposal to construct and operate the proposed Tokamak Physics Experiment. This proposed finding is based on the DOE Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor Decontamination and Decommissioning Project and Tokamak Physics Experiment (TPX) Environmental Assessment (EA), DOE/EA&hyph;0813, August 1994, which evaluates the environmental effects of using the existing Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) systems and accessory facilities in the proposed construction and operation of the TPX. The purpose of the TPX is to develop fusion energy to compensate for dwindling supplies of fossil fuels and the eventual depletion of fissionable uranium used in present-day nuclear reactors. Proceeding with the TPX is contingent on use of existing TFTR systems and appurtenant facilities. Decontamination and decommissioning of the TFTR is an integral part of the scope of the proposed TPX; therefore both projects are evaluated in this EA. Based on the analyses in the EA, the DOE believes that the proposed action is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. Therefore, the DOE is issuing a Proposed FONSI pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations implementing NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508) and the DOE NEPA implementing regulations (10 CFR Part 1021). DOE will consider comments received in making a final determination on whether to issue a FONSI or to prepare an environmental impact statement. DATES: Comments on the proposed FONSI should be postmarked November 4, 1994, to ensure consideration. Comments postmarked after that date will be considered to the extent practicable. ADDRESSES: Written comments on the proposed FONSI and requests for copies of the TPX EA should be directed to: Dr. W.S. White, U.S. Department of Energy, 9800 South Cass Avenue, Argonne, Illinois 60439, (708) 252&hyph;2101. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Requests for further information on the proposed project should be sent to: Milton D. Johnson, Manager, Princeton Area Office, U.S. Department of Energy, P.O. Box 102, Princeton, New Jersey 08542, (609) 243&hyph;3700. For general information on the DOE NEPA review process, contact: Carol M. Borgstrom, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of NEPA Oversight (EH&hyph;25), 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, D.C. 20585, (202) 586&hyph;4600 or (800) 472&hyph;2756.
