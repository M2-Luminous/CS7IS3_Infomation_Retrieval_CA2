Speaking in the open session of the Majles, he said the problem of Palestine was not a merely Palestinian question but rather "an ideological issue for the whole Islamic ummah". He called on world Muslims to actively take part in the Qods day rally which is staged worldwide on the last Friday of the fasting month of Ramadan. "Our message to other Muslims and other Islamic states is that they should take to the streets and express their indignation against the recent crime of the Zionist regime at the Ibrahim (peace be upon him) mosque in the town of Hebron". Referring to the crime of Zionists against a group of Palestinian worshippers, he said the event must have cleared it for world Muslims that if they took a step back, the occupiers would be encouraged to continue their crimes. The Gaza-Jericho accord made Israel so impudent that it embarked on letting the blood of the children of Islam in the fasting month of Ramadan. "The fact that we can not come to terms with the United States today is that the U.S. as the ring leader of the hegemonic powers has the same nature that the Zionsits have," the speaker remakred. The United Nations and the Security Council and the so-called advocates of human rights who interfere in the internal affirs of other countries under any pretexts, have kept silent on the massacre of Palestinians in al-Khalil, he regretted. He said that without a unified and all-out movement on the part of world Muslims the "cancerous tumor" (Israel) cannot be removed from the heart of Palestine. The Muslim people of Palestine should get rid of the Zionists, he stressed.
