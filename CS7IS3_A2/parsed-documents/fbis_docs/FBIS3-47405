The message says that when the allied foreign forces led by the United States invented a "nuclear suspicion" against the North and successively raised hysteric nuclear and war clamours one after another from the beginning of last year on that pretext in a bid to inflict the holocaust of a nuclear war on the territory of the homeland, Pomminnyon lifted up voices of anti-war and peace at home and abroad together with all the fellow countrymen, defending the banner of national independence. The new year 1994 is a very meaningful year, one year to go till the first year of reunification which Pomminnyon declared before the nation when raising the anchor to set sail, the message says, and continues: The new year has come, but reunification will not come by itself for us, and no outside forces will make a present of reunification to our nation. The United States, on the pretext of the invented "nuclear suspicion" against the North, is creating an atmosphere of distrust and confrontation within our nation and increasing the political and military tensions. Taking advantage of it, the South side's authorities are resorting to all despicable means and methods like opening the rice market, on which the right of peasants to existence hinges, to the United States, while persistently trying to maintain an "international cooperation system" to harm and stifle the fellow countrymen. The present-day situation requires that all our fellow countrymen vigorously advance along the patriotic road of reunification, more firmly united than before under the banner of great national unity. The overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon respectfully proposes to the South and North sides to set 1994, the eve year of 1995, the first year of reunification, as a year of great national unity for national reunification and jointly conduct the movement to unite the whole nation as one. We firmly believe that the call of the overseas side proposing the new year as a year of great national unity for national reunification will meet with full support and response from the Pomminnyon organisations in the South and North.
