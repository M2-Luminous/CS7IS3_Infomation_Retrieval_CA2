FR940106-0-00144 FR940106-0-00022 42. Reemployment plans . The NYDL commented that to require monthly reviews of individual reemployment plans, as implied in §617.20(b)(13), would not serve the worker in a constructive way, and to interview every adversely affected worker needlessly would place an unreasonable burden on the agency when there is a minimum amount of funds available for staff costs. The PDLI and the NJDL provided similar comments. Department's response . The Department concurs in the comments. It is not the Department's intent to have State agency staffs review individual reemployment plans every 30 days, as is required for waivers of the training requirement. Therefore, the rule is modified to provide for periodic review and updating of reemployment plans, as may be appropriate, in individual cases. The review of waivers, which is required no less frequently than every 30 days under §617.19(c)(1), is addressed in a new clause (14) in §617.20(b). 43. Work in the ``foreseeable future'' . The UAW, commenting on §617.22(a)(1)(ii), stated the proposed rule provides that training can be denied if there is a reasonable prospect of suitable work within the ``foreseeable future.'' The statute does not include this element, providing instead that there must be ``no suitable employment available'' to the adversely affected worker. The UAW argues that under the proposed rule, a worker could be denied TRA because training was not approved due to foreseeable work, even though the worker had no job to enter. The UCSP provided similar comments and recommended that the last part of the rule be eliminated. Department's response . This provision was incorporated in the regulations to preclude the approval of training when the worker is clearly scheduled to be employed or recalled. For that worker, suitable employment is ``available'' if the employment may occur in the foreseeable future. The purpose of including the provision in the rule is to give meaning to the first criterion of section 236(a)(1) and help preserve limited training funds for use by workers who need such assistance to return to employment. Labor-management agreements frequently provide for worker recall on a seniority basis. When recalls are scheduled in the foreseeable future, workers clearly do not need training in order to return to employment. In such situations, a waiver of the training requirement is appropriate and shall be issued by the State administering agency. Therefore, no change is made in §617.22(a)(1)(ii) of the regulations. However, as explained in item H. above, guidance is added in §§617.19 (b)(1)(i)(B) and (b)(2)(ii)(A) for use by State agencies on the application of recall that will occur in the ``reasonably foreseeable future.'' 44. Suitable employment . The AFL-CIO, commenting on §617.22(a)(1)(ii), pointed out that the term ``suitable employment'' means work at no less than 80 percent of the worker's average weekly wage in such adversely affected employment. Since job benefits such as health insurance and pension entitlement must be coupled with wages to determine the total compensation of a position, this definition should be expanded to include ``and benefits valued at not less than 80 percent of those provided in the worker's adversely affected employment.'' Department's response . The regulation uses the definition in section 236(e), and any change such as that suggested would require a change in the law. Therefore, no change is made in the regulations. 45. Adversely affected wage . The MDLIR, commenting on §617.22(a)(1)(ii), explained that suitable employment is defined in the proposed rule as work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the worker's past adversely affected employment and wages for such work at not less than 80 percent of the worker's average weekly wage in such adversely affected employment. The MDLIR asks why, since there does not appear to be a change in the law, the regulation was changed from average weekly wage to average weekly wage in adversely affected employment? In addition, the definition of average weekly wage in adversely affected employment makes reference to partial separation which, for separations on August 23, 1988 or later, will no longer establish TRA eligibility. Department's response . The Department agrees that the definition of ``average weekly wage in adversely affected employment'' is used appropriately only in the definition of ``partial separation,'' and the definition of ``suitable work'' in section 236(e) does not include the reference to adversely affected employment. Therefore, to fully accord with the statute, the phrase ``in such adversely affected employment'' is removed from §617.22(a)(1)(ii).
