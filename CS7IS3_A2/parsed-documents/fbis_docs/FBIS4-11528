The strike coincides with the closing stages of the campaign by provincial deputies, advisers, and councilmen seeking reelection in the 1 May elections. The unions expressed their opposition to the privatization program in general and in particular as it relates to so-called strategic sectors such as petroleum, electricity, and telecommunications. Recent announcements related to electricity cuts and fuel interruptions have not yet materialized, but the government has announced through Carlos Larreategui, secretary general of the administration, that it could take a tough stance against the union leaders, warning that it could even put them on trial. In the meantime, the Education Ministry suspended classes at all schools and universities throughout when teacher joined the 48-hour strike. Indian groups also decided to support the unions and threatened to block all highways to keep "Ecuador from being auctioned off to foreign interests."
