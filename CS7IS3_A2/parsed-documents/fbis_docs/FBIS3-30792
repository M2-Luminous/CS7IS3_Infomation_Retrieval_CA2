His departure marks the end of a kind of politics of the center, and an attempt at a compromise that was not successful, measured by the number of deputies. It seems that in times of ultra extreme left and extreme right political programs it could not be. When he submitted his irrevocable resignation, Micunovic told the deputies at the DS convention that he wanted to spare them the embarrassment of replacing a man of whom they could not prove the least stigma of guilt. In fact he could not have had such a scar, as in principle he has consistently implemented his party's policy -- somewhere in the middle. After the 1992 elections, it became clear for the first time that the fact that the DS gained only seven seats in parliament was disproportionate to the great investment in the party. Thus, even then, some communal party committees called for a change in the party leadership and even in the policy of the DS. Micunovic, and even Dr. Zoran Djindjic, chairman of the Executive Committee of the DS, did not think the time was ripe. Policy of Compromise Then last autumn Djindjic judged that the time was ripe and he set off almost unstoppably on the quest for the top post in the party and the top of Serbian politics. Although Micunovic had recently been speaking out as a fierce oppositionist and had been demonstrating the high standard of his rhetorical talent, it was already too late. Along with him, all philosophers in the DS as well as in Serbian politics have lost the battle. Micunovic is the embodiment of sublime political contemplation, as well as of political activity that is not in coordination with that contemplation. Djindjic has come to the top because, having stepped out of Micunovic's shadow, he began to give the impression of being an extremely practical man who knows what he wants and how to get it. This does not necessarily mean, however, a change in DS policy. In fact, he openly says that there will be no changes in the program but there will be changes in action. With the change at the top, the DS appears to be the same creature, but after a course of vigorous "muscle building." Djindjic has confirmed this by saying: "We are a party that has lost fat and gained muscles." In leaving, Micunovic certainly took with him the former policy of compromise, particularly regarding the Socialist Party of Serbia. The question remains of what Djindjic will do now. In this respect, other opposition parties do not consider Djindjic any less suspicious than Micunovic. At the end Micunovic himself accused Djindjic of colluding with the Socialists. As the main evidence of this one usually cites Djindjic's sudden haste in replacing the former leader of the Democrats, who did not have even a full year left to go to the end of his term. Nobody was in any doubt that Djindjic would naturally be the head of the party after that. Moreover, long before the denouement in the DS leadership even started, Dr. Vojislav Seselj, who was still close to the Socialists at the time, announced Micunovic's replacement. It is also a fact that during his election campaign, Djindjic said that Milosevic should not be attacked. What is more, the Democrats have no interest at all in parliamentary posts, but are definitely interested in all talks about a government of national unity. Airing of the Opposition Djindjic considers the accusations of cooperating with the Socialist Party of Serbia to be the greatest slander. Regarding the change in party policy, he says he called for it because there was a danger of the party losing the entire political capital it had built up and of being left without a single seat following some future elections. Secondly, he asks why he would want any posts in the fourth Socialist government when he has shown no interest in the previous ones. "I am not that politically naive and stupid," the new leader of the Democrats says. Djindjic's sense of pragmatism -- something that, without exception, everybody grants him -- will direct his strategy and thereby the behavior of the DS. Namely, the Democrats proceed from the fact that a system can be destroyed only from within, so that the party's possible participation in the government would not be such a great surprise. Djindjic does not conceal the fact that his aim is not to get the votes of the opposition, but the votes of the Socialists, as well as of the undecided. He says very self- confidently that his next aim is 50 seats in parliament. His policy is also to ingratiate himself with the Socialists, something that at one time the Radicals were successful at. It is clear that following the December elections, the electorate is becoming more stable and there is less inclination toward the extremists. With a new man the Democrats will try to occupy as much space as possible in the political center. That is why it is not surprising that the change at the top took place in the party that is the embodiment of such a policy of the center. With the power of the Socialists reduced, the opposition can breathe a little more easily. Therefore, Micunovic's departure may herald the airing on a bigger or smaller scale -- the appearance of new ideas and new people -- in other opposition parties as well.
