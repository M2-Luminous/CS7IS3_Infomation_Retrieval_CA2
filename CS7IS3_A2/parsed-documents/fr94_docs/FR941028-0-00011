AGENCY: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, DOE. ACTION: Final Rule; order on rehearing. SUMMARY: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is issuing an order on rehearing of its order which removed from the Commission's regulations certain natural gas regulations related to natural gas producer regulations that were either obsolete or nonessential in light of the decontrol of wellhead prices. The order on rehearing denies the requests for rehearing concerning the deletion of the anti-circumvention rule in ยง270.203(c) of the Commission's regulations. The Commission finds that, with the decontrol of wellhead pricing, no purpose is any longer served by this rule. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 17, 1994.
