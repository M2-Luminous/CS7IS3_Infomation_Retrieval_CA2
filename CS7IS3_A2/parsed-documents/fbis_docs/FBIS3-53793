The reports were published recently in a section of the Indian press and alleged that the Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] of Pakistan is carrying out terrorist activities from Bangladeshi soil. Speaking in Dhaka today, he said these concocted reports were published in Indian newspapers at a time when both Bangladesh and India are making efforts to forge closer ties between them on the basis of mutual understanding. The spokesman said that such motivated news will obstruct the development of a cordial relationship between the two neighboring countries. He expressed the hope that they will refrain from creating this type of unrealistic propaganda.
