Strictly political matters have already been overcome, but many items remain in the commercial area that must be taken care of lest they deteriorate and acquire undesirable tones. Ambassador Melvyn Levitsky comes with the good disposition of cooperating to find solutions to pending commercial problems, and nothing indicates that he intends to take overly harsh positions. He should find the same open spirit in Brasilia. However, two questions will demand the ambassador's and the Foreign Ministry's best efforts to permit the evolution of bilateral relations to continue unhindered. The first item involves the issue of telecommunications, a market the United States wants to see open to international bidding. The U.S. position could, in principle, be advantageous for Brazilian telecommunications service consumers due to the price reduction that more competition and the exposure to international markets would provoke internally. The problem is that telecommunications was established as a monopoly in the Constitution, and the removal of this obstacle was left for last and then made impossible by the failure of the constitutional revision process. As of last week, constitutional reforms will be possible only with a privileged quorum of three-fifths of all legislators' votes, and it will be useless to bring the issue back to the fore during this legislature. Only next year, after the new deputies and senators are installed, can Congress be sounded again on this necessary change for the country's modernization. The second issue is more pressing. The Brazilian Government promised Washington to have Congress approve a bill on intellectual property rights by 15 June. The government and Foreign Ministry were unable to push the issue in the Senate with the needed speed. Besides, the bill had to be adapted to new GATT rules and even if the Senate passes the bill in time, which seems unlikely, it can only become law after the Chamber of Deputies reexamines it. The 15 June deadline will not be met. The U.S. Government then can, if it does not consider Brasilia's efforts to provide the country with legislation on property rights reasonable, apply sanctions on Brazilian foreign trade. This is something that must be prevented at all cost. Congress has its own problems, such as the mid-year recess and the electoral campaign. But a concentrated effort can be made, as of August, to vote on appropriate legislation quickly. And we should expect Ambassador Melvyn Levitsky to use all his influence to prevent Brazil and the United States from getting involved in some serious conflict.
