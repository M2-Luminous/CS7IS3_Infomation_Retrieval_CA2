[sentence as published] Jia Mingru of the State Council's Bureau of Legislative Affairs said at the forum that the white paper has for the first time systematically expounded China's stand on and attitude toward intellectual property rights in the form of an official publication. He said that China will draw up border measures later this year for the benefit of intellectual property rights protection as well as promulgate laws and regulations to bolster the protection of integrated circuits and flora species. Dong Baolin, a senior economist from the Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said that the implementation of the country's trademark law since 1983 has been followed by a rise in the number of both domestic and foreign trademarks registered in China. By the end of 1993, China had approved over 410,000 trademarks, including some 60,000 items from 67 countries and regions worldwide, the economist said. He added that the application volume in the first five months of this year has outstripped that of the corresponding period of last year. "This has demonstrated China's sincerity and resolution in protecting trademarks," Dong stressed. "It also shows an attractive Chinese market and a sound investment environment in China." Duan Ruichun, an official from the State Science and Technology Commission, said that the white paper will help eliminate misunderstandings about China's intellectual property rights protection situation and promote bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation between China and the rest of the world. Wen Xikai of the State Patent Office said that the state patent law, in effect since 1985, has spurred domestic inventions and foreign patent applications and resulted in a 24 percent annual increase in the overall number of patent applications. By the end of last year, the bureau had received 360,000 patent applications, 13.6 percent of which were from outside the country. "Any fair-minded person should no longer harbor any doubt about China's sincerity and ability in protecting intellectual property rights," she noted. Wang Huapeng, an official from the State Copyright Bureau, said that though the country's copyright law is only three years old, China is one of the few countries in the world to have put computer software under protection. Zhang Yuqing, a senior scholar at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that international trade would be virtually impossible today if there were no intellectual property rights protection. He said that pirated compact and laser discs are still seen in some parts of China. "This has harmed the development of the national music industry," he said. He hoped to see further measures implemented to deal with the problem. Vice-Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Hui Yongzheng said that China's expected economic development will be accompanied by the arduous task of protecting intellectual property rights. "China is always ready to cooperate with other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit," he said. "However, China resolutely opposes any act of interference in its internal affairs under the pretext of intellectual property rights protection."
