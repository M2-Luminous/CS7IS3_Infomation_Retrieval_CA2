The central puzzle remains that of what will happen after the vote and the makeup of any possible government. This problem has pushed the parties to lay siege to the center in order to gain the moderate vote. Mario De Scalzi reports. [De Scalzi] A few days away from polling day, the various political groupings appear to have suddenly realized the strategic importance of the center. It is from there -- if nobody obtains the necessary votes in order to govern alone -- that any political alliance will have to be formed. However, Mino Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian Popular Party] warned that the center ground is already occupied and that his party is not prepared to give up this role. [Begin Martinazzoli recording] If the center were to win, a government would be formed 24 hours afterwards. [end recording] [De Scalzi] Giorgio La Malfa [secretary of the Italian Republican Party] pointed out that there are so many rifts and contradictions within the left-wing and right-wing slates that it is for this reason the center will be strengthened. Whether this analysis is right or wrong, [National Alliance Party leader] Gianfranco Fini today toned down his argument with the Northern League. He said that it would be possible to govern with Bossi if certain conditions were laid down. [Begin Fini recording] We must be absolutely clear on the concepts of unity and national identity, and there must be absolute clarity on the necessity of the politics of solidarity between the north and the south and solidarity between the weak and the strong. [end recording] [De Scalzi] This move toward the center leaves Umberto Bossi completely indifferent. He said in a radio interview that he would never back Silvio Berlusconi's candidacy for the post of prime minister.
