A case in point involves two young women who won a law suit last year for illegal body search by a shopping center which suspected them of shop-lifting. According to Cao Xiaoqi, deputy secretary-general of the China Consumers Association, with the support of governments at all levels, a consumer protection network now covers the whole country, embracing about 40,000 organizations. Meanwhile, the country's first consumer law came into force at the beginning of this year, which stipulates that a consumer may claim for compensation doubling the amount of the goods bought if the goods were found to be false or not up to standards. Now more and more consumers are learning to fight encroachments on their rights, such as short weight, defective or shoddy goods, and poor service, Cao said. He said that since the association was established in 1984 such organizations have spread all over the urban and rural areas. In addition, some far-sighted companies have also set up their own consumer-protection units so as to earn a good reputation. So far, China's industrial and commercial units have set up 25,000 stations to deal with consumers' feedback on their products. Meanwhile, consumers associations closely co-operate with the news media. As a result, a number of enterprises, which have severely damaged consumers' interests while refusing to pay for losses, have been exposed to the public. In line with the nationwide campaign to stamp out shoddy and false goods, the associations make spot checks on a wide range of goods, covering electrical appliances and food, Cao said. During the past nine years the country's consumers associations have handled 1.6 million complaints from consumers, over 95 percent of which have been settled with nearly 600 million (about 67 million U.S. dollars) in compensation for consumers. Offenders have been fined a total of 40 million yuan (about 4.5 million U.S. dollars).
