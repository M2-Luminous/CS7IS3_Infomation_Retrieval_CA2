The 45.4 percent of the survey respondents who are uneasy about the future of Japan is the highest ever recorded in the 24 years of the survey and the percentage of those still optimistic about Japan stood at 29.6 percent, slipping below the 30 percent mark for only the third time. The only other times the belief Japan is "heading in a good direction" dipped below 30 percent was in the 1974 survey and again in 1982. The poll, conducted last December, surveyed 10,000 Japanese men and women aged 20 or older, with a response rate of about 71 percent. The number of people thinking "Japan is headed in a bad direction" has shown an increase each year since 1989 with 49 percent of the pessimists saying they were concerned about employment and labor conditions and another 33 percent worried about food stores. The decrease in the number of people optimistic about Japan reflected a slide in the respondents who believe in Japan's economic power, about 24 percent, and the nation's food supplies, about 10 percent. Both figures are the lowest ever recorded. Following last year's unprecedented high of 70 percent of the respondents saying the government did not reflect the will of the people, this year's figure decreased to around 62 percent. This year's survey indicates an increase of 7 percentage points to 30 percent in the number of people thinking that government reflects the will of the people. For the first time since 1984, the survey also asked about the government's dialogue with citizens regarding social affairs and political matters with 65 percent of the respondents saying the government should talk with the people. Asked about social conditions in Japan, 73 percent of the respondents agreed that Japan has peace but only 24 percent said things are stable, a decrease of 3 percentage points. Only 9 percent said they are living comfortably, another decrease of 3 percentage points, while 12 percent said they did not feel any vitality in their lives -- about double the number of the year before.
