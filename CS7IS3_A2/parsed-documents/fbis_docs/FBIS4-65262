Once again, the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] is being humiliated both by Serb arrogance and the mistakes of its own leaders, that is, for the last few weeks, those of [UN special envoy] Akashi. Once again, diplomatic action is dwindling and there is a feeling that what had been achieved is being whittled away. And once again, also, there is the chronic temptation on the part of Western leaders to give it all up: The temptation, for those who have troops there, to leave Bosnia. Thus in the past few days [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe made several cautious mentions of an impending withdrawal of [France's] "blue helmets," stating that there was a pressing need to "acknowledge" the lack of progress towards a solution. To be fair, Mr. Juppe will probably be the last one to call for a withdrawal of French soldiers from Bosnia. However, he is not alone: Like others, the French Government is divided on the issue, and Mr. Juppe has already had to challenge those inclined to such an abdication of responsibility, both at the Matignon [office of the prime minister] and the Defense Ministry. The more history repeats itself (the deadlock, the UNPROFOR's fetters, not to mention its current state of discredit), the more weariness sets in the minds of those who will give up, both in France and in other contributing countries. Of course, short of a threat to the UNPROFOR as whole, no one wants to be the first to opt for total withdrawal, a decision which public opinion would view as forsaking an imperiled population. But one can hear once again in Paris talk of a "disproportion" between the cost of having soldiers in Bosnia and the precious few results achieved there so far; in other words, Paris is considering a lopsided and ultimately unjustifiable policy: that of partial withdrawal. If Alain Juppe mentions a possible withdrawal of French "blue helmets," it is not only as a response to such internal tensions. His words are also intended for the belligerents as well as France's partners in the "management" of the crisis, that is, primarily for the United States, a few days before a reportedly "important" meeting to be held in Geneva between American, European, and Russian ministers. The French foreign minister already used such arguments on the eve of previous diplomatic encounters. His message to the Americans, which Mr. Juppe will deliver in person on 11 and 12 May in Washington, boils down to this: Either you play the negotiating game straight, or we precipitate the disbanding of the UNPROFOR and you will soon be alone in answering Bosnian Muslims' calls for help. The latest initiative of Western countries in the Bosnian crisis dates back to the aftermath of the Serb's attack on the muslim enclave of Gorazde, over a month ago. Under the insult, the West, i.e., the United States, Europe, Russia, and the United Nations, had finally decided to act by issuing an ultimatum to the aggressors and trying to broker new negotiations between the belligerents. Taking Control Unfortunately, both attempts have now proved utterly futile: The threat of NATO air strikes does not seem to be a valid deterrent any more; once again it highlights the divisions between major powers, as shown by Russia's backtracking late last week at the Security Council with respect to a resolution proposed by the French and the Americans that threatened with air strikes against troublemakers in Brcko. As for joint efforts by "the four" to define a foundation for a settlement jointly with Bosnia's leaders, they achieved nothing: The "contact group" (representatives of the major powers as well as the United Nations) has been fruitlessly shuttling back and forth between Sarajevo and Pale, between Serbs and Bosnians, who remain unwilling to negotiate. Hence the idea, which France has long been pushing and which the U.S. secretary of state has finally agreed to, of taking things one echelon higher, at the ministerial level: In Geneva on 13 and 14 May, the United States, Russian, and European foreign ministers are expected to try to "take control" and at least to define a foundation for a peaceful settlement. This presupposes that they first have to adopt joint positions, which is far from being the case right now. The notion of imposing a real cease-fire on the belligerents stumbles on the problem of the UNPROFOR's limited capacity and the restrictive U.S. policy on this point. As for the (French) notion of developing guidelines for Bosnia's partition (proportion of territory allocated to the various communities, special status for enclaves, etc.), it is blocked by American reluctance, but above all by realities: Those few square kilometers which apparently seem so trivial to French bureaucrats are at the very root of past and future fighting in Bosnia; they give rise to feelings of unacceptable injustice. What France is basically asking the United States to do in the name of realpolitik is to convince the Bosnian Muslims to capitulate. Last, another French notion -- that the Serbs could be made to come round through the promise of a gradual lifting of sanctions against Belgrade -- is also foundering not only on skepticism on the part of the United States, which until recently has still been advocating stricter enforcement of the economic embargo, but also on recent developments in Bosnia: How could France call for an end to the sanctions while 11 of its own nationals are being held hostage by Serb forces?
