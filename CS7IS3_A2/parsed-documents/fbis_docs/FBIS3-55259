In his words, the experts found that numerous provisions of the recently adopted constitutions of Tatarstan, Bashkortostan and Tuva were inconsistent with Russia's Constitution. Twelve other republics, he said, still have old constitutions which are also inconsistent with the new Constitution of the Russian Federation. In particular, by its constitution Mordovia is a Soviet Socialist Republic. Medvedev placed special emphasis on the fact that five newly established republics, Adygey, Altai, Ingushetia, Karachayevo-Cherkessia and Khakasia, do not have their own constitutions. The presidential chief of staff emphasized that, according to Article 72 of the Russian Constitution, the Russian Federation and its constituent parts would establish general principles of organizing systems of state authority and local government bodies. In numerous republics elections to the republican and local legislatures will be held shortly. In this light, the constitutions of the republics must as soon as possible be brought in line with the Fundamental Law of the Russian Federation.
