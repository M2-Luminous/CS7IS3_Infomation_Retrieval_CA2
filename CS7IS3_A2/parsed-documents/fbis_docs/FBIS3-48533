Upon arrival in Phnom Penh this UN envoy announced before the press that he had come to protect the so-called rights of Vietnamese nationals in Cambodia. Our Cambodian nation and people clearly see through the alliance's scheme in sending this man to Cambodia. It is in order to kill our Cambodian nation and race and allow Vietnam to annex Cambodia into its Indochinese Federation, thus turning our Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory annexed by Vietnam]. His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk has been well aware of this dark design of the alliance. This is why he wrote an important essay dated 5 January 1994 entitled: Human rights in Cambodia and the Cambodian People's Right to Live Peacefully Forever Within Their Legitimate Land and Sea Boundaries as Recognized Internationally Between 1963 and 1969. The Cambodian nation and people and the king also well know that the two-headed government has not paid attention to the King's essay. On the contrary, it has welcomed this representative of the bad elements who has come here to kill the Cambodian nation and people. [passage omitted]
