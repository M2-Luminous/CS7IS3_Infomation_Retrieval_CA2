Hosokawa, slated to meet Clinton in Washington on February 11, will point out that improvement in Sino-U.S. relations will contribute to Asian stability, the sources said. The Foreign Ministry expects Beijing to retaliate should Clinton refuse to renew China's most-favored-nation (MFN) status, which guarantees Chinese goods low-tariff access to the U.S. market, the sources said. Clinton has said he will not extend MFN for China when it comes up for renewal in June, unless Beijing makes significant efforts to improve the country's poor human rights record, such as by releasing political prisoners. Washington was also not satisfied with the results of talks between U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Paris last month, which revolved around the human rights issue. Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department in its annual human rights report said that China, despite having made some positive moves in 1993, still falls "far short" of internationally recognized standards. Hosokawa will reportedly tell Clinton that Tokyo considers it unlikely that Beijing will improve human rights in response to U.S. pressure, the sources said. Chinese retaliatory measures in the event of the suspension of MFN would also affect trade with other countries including Japan, the premier will say, according [to] the sources. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, during a recent visit to China, assured the Beijing leadership of Japanese support for China's GATT application. Hosokawa will also advise Clinton not to upset China in order to gain its cooperation in peacefully solving the almost year-long row over North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program, the sources said.
