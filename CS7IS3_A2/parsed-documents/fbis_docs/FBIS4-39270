There is a crisis both in the economy and in the structures of power. Therefore, I fully share the concern of the parliament chairman and his wish to form the Cabinet of Ministers quickly. But we need to take measures urgently to stabilize the work of the national economy complex." The new government, in Mr. Holubchenko's opinion, will have to immediately take untraditional steps, in the first place to adopt a series of decisions on reorganizing production, and not allow 99 percent of enterprises to stop. "The current campaign against inflation, Anatoliy Holubchenko believes, has practically led to the paralysis of enterprises."
