FR941230-2-00083 FR941230-2-00047 B. Effects on Competition Through entry into the market and a series of acquisitions of competitors. Topa acquired the exclusive Virgin Islands distribution rights to almost every brand of distilled spirits in the world market. Topa has retained these distribution rights through continuing contractual relationships, both written and oral, with its suppliers. As a result of its acquisitions, and its retention of the exclusive distribution rights acquired, in 1991 Topa had a market share of approximately 96% of wholesale distilled spirits sold in the Virgin Islands market. The United States filed its complaint because the effect of the contracts in restraint of trade by which Topa obtained and has retained its monopoly position has been to lessen competition substantially in the wholesale distribution of distilled spirits in the Virgin Islands. Retailers are deprived of alternative sources for competing products. Suppliers are also deprived of the benefits of free and open competition, in part because Topa has inherent conflicts of interest in the representation of their distilled spirits products and cannot represent all competing brands equally. III Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment The United States and Topa have stipulated that the Court may enter the proposed Final Judgment after compliance with the APPA. The stipulation provides that entry of the Final Judgment does not constitute any evidence or admission by any party with respect to any issue of fact or law. Under the provisions of the APPA, the proposed Final Judgment may not be entered unless the Court finds that entry is in the public interest. The Department believes that the proposed Final Judgment provides an adequate remedy for the alleged violation and is in the public interest. The term of the proposed Final Judgment is five years. The Final Judgment allows suppliers of distilled spirits to leave Topa if they desire and also reduces substantial barriers to competition in the wholesale distilled spirits market in the Virgin Islands. Paragraph IV.A orders Topa to take no action under any contract or under Title 12A, Sections 131 and 132, of the Virgin Islands Code (the local statute that protects dealers from wrongful termination by a supplier) to prevent its suppliers from canceling their distribution arrangements for distilled spirits, whether written or not, with Topa upon thirty-days' written notice and appointing a new wholesaler instead. If a supplier does cancel its distribution arrangements, Topa must, at the supplier's request, sell back to the supplier all of the distilled spirits Topa bought from the supplier and otherwise assist in the orderly disposition of the existing inventory of the supplier's product. Under this provision of the Final Judgment, any dissatisfied supplier will be free to find an alternative distributor if the supplier chooses to do so, and, moreover, a potential new wholesaler can freely solicit the business of any supplier. The Final Judgment also provides that Topa must waive its rights under the Virgin Islands statute which allows a dealer to sue a supplier for wrongful termination. Topa's waiver of its rights under this statute removes a significant potential impediment to a supplier changing wholesalers, and also removes a major potential problem for any wholesaler trying to take brands away from Topa. Qualified personnel, with the necessary connections with the retail trade, are difficult to find in the Virgin islands. Paragraphs IV.B and IV.C may help an entrant to hire and retain qualified personnel to run a distilled spirits business in the Virgin Islands without undue interference from Topa. Paragraph IV.B orders Topa not to enter into with, or enforce or attempt to enforce against, any officer of Topa, any written contract, agreement or covenant not to compete in the distilled spirits industry in the Virgin Islands; and not to counter an offer of employment to any officer of Topa from any wholesaler with which a Topa supplier has entered into any arrangement to distribute its distilled spirits in the Virgin Islands. Otherwise, Topa may give its officers raises, bonuses and promotions in the ordinary course of business, counter offers of employment from distributors not engaged in the distribution of distilled spirits and take action against its former officers for the unlawful disclosure of trade secrets.
