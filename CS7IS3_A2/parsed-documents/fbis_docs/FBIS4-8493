It is, therefore, too early to draw any conclusions on the political and military effects of this act, which can be considered criminal in every respect. In other words, it is too early to judge what was gained and what was lost lost by different sides. Nevertheless, one could say that all those who believed in a peaceful and quick settlement of the Bosnian conflict are the losers. Moreover, all those who thought that the U.S. involvement in the forced creation of some kind of Muslim-Croat federation serves the peace process are also disappointed. Even the last skeptics must now be clear that this was a simple camouflage for a quick renewal of an anti-Serbian coalition so the Serbs could be militarily pressed and forced, with NATO's help, to accept the dictate of the Western alliance. Those who believed in the impartial and peaceful role of the United Nations also feel deceived. What can be said about those who thought for at least one moment that the belligerent and anti- Serbian hawks in NATO would play peace pigeons here under the trade mark of the United Nations? In other words, that they would keep aside of the interethnic war in Bosnia. The Russians could also be considered political losers. With these unilateral actions by the Americans, they -- to put it mildly -- lost a step on the way back to the Balkan region. Subsequent, unconvincing anger by Russian leaders -- because they were allegedly not informed about NATO's intentions -- was directed more toward, as the U.S. President said, the public at home rather than Washington and Brussels. The only winner appears to be NATO, which, without major upheavals in the international public and, so far, without Serbian revanchism, won a chance to go a step further in its offensive on neutral territory. For the first time in its history, NATO attacked ground targets (?in Europe) from the air. The fact that this was done with a limited, relatively small number of aircraft indicates that this was a trail balloon and yet another forced precedent. This is paving the way for similar actions by NATO in the future in this and some other regions. It would not be superfluous to recall that it was precisely in Bosnia's case that NATO, with the decisive role of the United States, first succeeded in becoming something of an extended hand of the United Nations in the peacetime military operations, then in becoming a protector of the United Nations Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] from the air, and finally in bombing targets on the ground. The right to make decisions on air strikes, which was first given to Butrus-Ghali, then to Yasushi Akashi, ended with the one who Washington and NATO headquarters in Brussels wanted to have it right from the very beginning -- with one of NATO military commanders. Since all these variations were peformed almost without any criticism, let alone resistance by the instrumentilized and deceived international public, and without any reaction by the corrupted and immature politicians, one can rightly expect NATO's next move to be according to the U.S. dictate. This would be the landing and intervention by ground forces that will carry out not only the UN tasks but the orders of the military organization of the Atlantic Alliance. It is not impossible at all that this precedent-variation will be tested and endorsed by the public in Bosnia. Regarding this, the report that the landing of planes with weapons and NATO forces for rapid intervention on Bihac airport is indicative. If this report turns out to be correct, then this would undoubtedly be the beginning of the last, the hitherto untested, but the most dangerous variation of NATO formations' involvement. The Serbs have suspected for a long time, and have now finally seen, that their opponents in the Bosnian war are not only the Croats and the Muslims, but also, to the same extent, NATO and the United States for their own reasons. They finally revealed themselves in the true light of friends of the Serbian enemies. Of course this fact is not easy to take, but it must be faced. If the rest of the world does not realize in time that NATO military involvement in Bosnia is not only a matter or a problem that exists between the Bosnian Serbs and NATO formations, but playing out of all types of possible interventions by NATO for some future actions and some new territories, so much the worse for the rest of the indifferent world. The world will very soon face a military monster that will be a merciless punishing whip for the unsuitable and disobedient peoples in the hands of the protagonists of the new world order. Therefore, the U.S. bombs that were dropped on Serbian targets in Bosnia not only represent an act of aggression and crime toward the Serbian people, but have a much more dangerous and foreboding meaning.
