After the end of the war, instead of paying compensation to the Lao side for the losses deliberately caused by the air bombardments, the U.S. side even pressed Laos and Vietnam, which are still suffering bruises from this war of aggression, to cooperate with it in searching for American pilots. These pilots flew planes shot down by the Lao and Vietnamese peoples while they were dropping bombs on a large scale to mercilessly kill these people. Though the innocent Lao people still strongly resent the U.S. bombing, the government, as well as the ill-fated Lao people, have consistently agreed to cooperate well with the U.S. side in surveying, excavating, searching, and investigating the fates of these airborne pirates, despite the fact that the ill-fated Lao people, who experienced the suffering, have not been given any compensation for the losses caused by that destructive war. The Lao Government and people have cooperated with the U.S. side because they consider the issue a humanitarian one and have taken into consideration the feelings of the American people, who have also suffered due to the policies and secret activities of their official sectors. This cooperation, as has been mentioned many times, began in 1985 and 1986, when Lao and American technical teams excavated crash sites in Paksong District, Champassak Province. From then until late September 1993, the two sides jointly conducted surveys and excavations on 35 occasions in 11 provinces. So far, the remains of some 51 American personnel missing in action have been discovered. The U.S. side, however, has never made any announcements or remarks publicly acknowledging this. It is not known why the deputy head of the Congress of the United States, [title as heard] known as the person in charge of following up and expediting this issue and who has apparently known all about Lao cooperation from the beginning, has not mentioned anything about it. He has only said unconstructively that Laos has not cooperated, and that as Laos has failed to cooperate, it is necessary to put ever more pressure on Laos to do so. To clear up the false accusations of the Voice of America and of the spokesman of the U.S. State Department and to enable peace- and justice-loving people throughout the world determine themselves what is true, what is false, who is right, and who is wrong in connection with this issue, the Lao side deems it necessary to clarify and give the following details about Lao cooperation, particularly in 1993 and 1994 -- from October 1993 until February 1994 -- by reviewing the reports of Lao officials in charge of this issue: The Lao-American cooperation project on American prisoners of war and personnel missing in wartime can be divided into the four following categories: 1. Surveys and excavations of areas around plane crashes. Based on the plan and data presented by the United States at the technical meeting held 16-17 September 1993, the U.S. proposed joint surveys and excavation of six crash sites in 10 provinces throughout the country, namely Attopeu, Sekong, Saravane, Savannakhet, Khammouane, Bolikhamsai, Vientiane, Houa Phan, Xieng Khouang, and Luang Prabang Provinces. These began in October 1993 and will end in late September 1994. From October 1993 to February 1994, joint surveys and excavations were conducted on three occasions. The surveys and excavations on the first occasion took place simultaneously in Sekong and Saravane Provinces. The work lasted 23 days -- from 19 October to 12 November 1993. It was performed jointly by 32 personnel from the U.S. side and seven from the Lao side, excluding local labor. Four helicopters were used. No motorcars were used, because all the sites are on mountains. There were 23 survey points and three excavation points. Eight personnel excavated at point 1530 where a C-130 was shot down in 1968. A number of skeletons and teeth were discovered at that point. Ten personnel worked at point 1600 where a C-130 was shot down in 1971. A number of skeletons and teeth were discovered there. Excavation was impossible at the third point, point 1382, because there were live bombs throughout the area. The excavation was suspended as hazardous to the personnel involved. Joint surveys were conducted on 23 points of plane crashes. The joint surveys and excavations in the second stage, called tripartite cooperation by the U.S. side -- Lao-U.S. and Vietnamese-U.S. cooperation -- were conducted along the Lao-Vietnamese border in Sekong, Saravane, and Savannakhet Provinces. Work was carried out in a radius of 10 km from each side of the borde, the radius which the U.S. side considered a privileged case based on the agreement reached by the deputy minister-level tripartite meeting held in Hawaii on 10 August 1993. The second group of surveys and excavations took place over 16 days -- from 4 to 20 December 1993. A total of 32 from the U.S. side and seven from the Lao side, excluding auxiliary personnel, took part in these. Four helicopters and four motor vehicles were employed in the second stage. There were 17 survey points and three excavation points. At point 1643 a number of skeletons and teeth were discovered, while at points 1719 and 1750, pilots' emblems and wreckage of downed aircraft were discovered. During this second stage, tripartite technical meetings were held on four occasions at the Lao Bao border checkpoint to exchange information. The first meeting was on 4 December, the second on 6 December, the third on 10 December, and the fourth and last on 15 December 1993. In the final tripartite meeting at the Lao Bao border checkpoint on 15 December 1993, Winston Lord, deputy assistant to the U.S. secretary of state [title as heard], accompanied by Major General Thomas Needham, attended the meeting to observe the actual bilateral and tripartite cooperation. After the meeting, the two expressed thanks to the Lao Government for the fine cooperation that it has consistently given to the U.S. side. The third stage of surveys and excavations was conducted in Savannakhet Province. It began on 12 January and ended on 8 February 1994, lasting 28 days. Conducting the surveys and excavations were 32 personnel from the U.S. side and seven others from the Lao side, excluding supporting laborers. Four helicopters and four automobiles were employed. A camp was set up in Sepon District on Route 9. According to the plan proposed by the U.S. side, 26 points on crash sites were to be surveyed and six were to be excavated -- two in Vilabouli, two in Sepon, one in Phin, and another in Atsaphangthong Districts. As of 6 February 1994, the surveys were completed on 17 points. Excavations at 0571 and 1363 have been completed. A number of teeth and skeletons were discovered. At the time this report was prepared, an excavation was conducted at point 9950 in Na Gnom Canton, Vilabouli District, while preparations were being made for further excavation at point 0370. Excavations were conducted on many occasions at point 0018. The U.S. side has requested more excavations at this point, and the Lao side has had no objection. As the operation is still in progress, the achievements in conducting the surveys and excavations of the third stage can not be reviewed and assessed yet. 2. The second category of the Lao-U.S. cooperation project on this issue is the investigation and search for American POWs whom the U.S. side believes to be alive. To show its good intentions and sincerity to clear accusations from U.S. officialdom, which has claimed that there are still American POWs in Laos, despite the denials by the Lao side all along that no more such POWs remain and that there is no reason for the Lao side to keep them in Laos if there were any, the Lao side is willing to cooperate. If the U.S. side has concrete and reliable information on the living POWs, let the Lao side be informed so that a team can be set up to investigate. In fact, in the recent past, the two sides have jointly investigated on many occasions. No facts concerning POWs have been found on any occasion. Examples were the case of Captain Borah, who was later found to be a 60-year-old Lao Theuang tribesman, namely (A-lao), and the case of First Lieutenant (Kha), whose photo was shown to the Lao side to assist with the search. According to American experts, the photo was believed to be a photo of 1st. Lt. (Kha). The Lao side, not expert in this field, said immediately after seeing the picture that the person is not an American and that the picture was not taken in Laos. The Lao side saw the picture as taken in a zoo in Thailand. Some one month later, it was determined that it is not a picture of 1st. Lt. (Kha). It is instead a picture of a German national, named Gunther, who runs a small business in Thailand. Later, on 2 and 4 November 1993, the Lao side took (Gary Smith), an American expert in this field, to Toumlan village in Saravane Province. According to U.S. news sources, an American national was found living in the village. The news was received from a Thai trader working in the province. After an investigation, the person was found to be a physician attached to Medecins Sans Frontieres, which implemented an aid project in Laos. Later, on 25 and 28 January 1994, the Lao side also took (Gary Smith) to Nong Ma Village and Gnommalat District in Khammouane province to further investigate information he received about the detention of Americans at the two places. To make sure, our side granted special permission for him to inspect the Gnommalat prison and interrogate prisoners and people in nearby areas on whatever he wanted to know. But, he found no Americans living in the area. A bad point was that while inspecting the Gnommalat prison, instead of inquiring about the trail of the Americans, the American technician asked why the Lao nationals were detained there. Can this be seen as coming to find fault with the host country, which has cooperated with the U.S. side? 3. Interviews of prominent persons: At U.S. suggestion, the Lao side has allowed the U.S. to interview Sot Phetlasi in Vientiane twice. The second time was on 8 January 1994. The U.S. was also allowed to interview Lieutenant Colonel Khamla Keophithoun in Beijing, China, on 19 December 1993. 4. Probing various war documents and films: In response to a U.S. suggestion, the Lao allowed American experts to examine and list available films on 10 January 1994. This project is expected continue for the rest of the year. In addition, on 26 January 1994, the Lao also granted permission for the U.S. to inspect the revolutionary museum in Vientiane. In general, the Lao Government and people, as well as local administrations and concerned authorities at all levels of the Lao side, have cooperated well with the U.S. all along in dealing with the problem of American POW-MIAs. According to an agreement reached between the two sides, since August 1987 the U.S. Government has given assurance to the Lao side that in return for good cooperation, the U.S. will provide appropriate humanitarian aid to the Lao people. Based on said agreement, the Lao side has, therefore, requested said humanitarian aid from the U.S. for 1993-94. The request, in terms of medicine, small medical equipment, water pumps, generators, and motorcycles for local cadres working in support of the project, was made at the technical meeting held in Vientiane on 16-17 September 1993. So far, the Lao side has not yet received any aid from the U.S., while the surveys, excavations, collection of information about American POWs believed to be still alive, interviews, and the probing of films and documents has been done continuously each and every week and every month to the extent that there is almost no time for rest. What does the U.S. want the Lao to do so as to be seen as cooperating sufficiently? If Lao cooperation given fails to meet U.S. requirements, would it be better for us to stop wasting time continuing to do it?
