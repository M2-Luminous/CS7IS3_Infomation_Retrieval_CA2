You arrived in Washington on the afternoon of 18 January and immediately after that you visited the State Department and Capitol Hill. Can you tell us about that, please? [Reina] The meetings held yesterday were conducted in an atmosphere of true cooperation between the United States and the next Honduran Government. It was freezing cold when we reached Andrews Air Force Base, and we were afraid we would have some problems with the frozen runway. We met with Mrs. (Joan Spill), who is the economic charge d'affairs in the State Department. Afterwards we met with Senator Patrick Leahy, who was decorated recently in Honduras and who has always had an excellent attitude toward our country. At night, we attended a working dinner, where I was very pleased to meet again with such good friends as Francisco Aguirre, who is truly an institution in Washington. [Goldstein] Dr. Reina, we understand that this morning, your agenda begins with a visit to the offices of the U.S. trade representative, where you will meet the deputy official of that organization and the official in charge of the Latin American area? [Reina] We will begin our agenda with a visit to (Charlene Marshkenvitsky) at 0900. We will discuss Central American economic prospects for the next quarter with (Mrs. Marshkenvitsky) and [name indistinct], who is the assistant secretary for Latin American affairs. [Goldstein] President Clinton has issued a very strong statement saying that he will seek a way to prevent Central America and the Caribbean islands being affected negatively by the signing of NAFTA with Mexico and Canada? [Reina] I believe that that topic will be discussed soon, and the results will be the ones we expect: a rapid development of the area. We will continue with a visit to the BID [Inter-American Development Bank], and then we will have lunch with BID President Enrique Iglesias, who was minister in Uruguay during Julio Sanguinetti's administration and has deeply rooted democratic principles. That is our plan for this morning. This afternoon, we will meet with Senator Edward Kennedy and Congressman Steny Hoyer, who are also strong supporters of democratic governments in Central and South America. [Goldstein] Dr. Reina, I would like to ask about the meeting with Senator Kennedy and Congressman Hoyer, who is as influential in the House of Representatives as Kennedy is in the Senate. What do you expect to achieve in this meeting? [Reina] I hope to get to know them directly, exchange and compare views with them. We have always been linked with people who have the highest democratic principles in Washington, and we hope to revitalize those relations. I had the honor of meeting John Kennedy, and I corresponded with Robert Kennedy. Now I will meet with Senator Edward Kennedy, which gives me great satisfaction and will be very beneficial for the rapprochement between Honduras and the United States. [passage omitted]
