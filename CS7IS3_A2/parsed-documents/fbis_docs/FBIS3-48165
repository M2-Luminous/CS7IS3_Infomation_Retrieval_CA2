Most of the 647 delegates expressed their support for the results of the policy of "doi moi", or renovation, that was launched in 1986, but there was sharp debate on how to assess future problems and how to resolve them, it said. The delegates wind up their meeting in Hanoi on Tuesday. Debate, which began Thursday, has focussed in particular on "the importance of ideological work and the pursuit of the communist party's renovation," as well as "more energetic" action against corruption, it said. They also discussed steps aimed at speeding up share-ownership of public enterprises, agricultural development and the state's policy towards rural dwellers, who make up 80 percent of the population. "It is time for Vietnam to enter a new period of development towards industrialisation and modernisation," the delegates said, according to the newspaper report. The six-day mini-congress will also see the delegates elect about 15 alternate members to the central committee, and replace a number of figures who have died, become senile or are in disgrace. The party's politburo last week added four members, including Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, a general and a vice president to national assembly, a move that could herald major changes in the political line-up in the next party congress, in 1996.
