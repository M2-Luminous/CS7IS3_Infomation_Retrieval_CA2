He said in an interview that he would decide in the next few weeks whether the trilateral proposal had any future. That would depend partly on whether the Clinton Administration met EU requests to clarify the fundamental objectives of its trade policy towards Japan. He also said that Mr Mickey Kantor, U.S. trade representative, had assured him this week for the first time that Washington accepted that the Uruguay Round world trade deal would substantially reduce U.S. scope to impose unilateral sanctions on other countries under its Super-301 trade provisions. Sir Leon called the assurance "of very great significance." However, he said that U.S. insistence that it could still legally use Super-301 in some circumstances was "objectionable and unfortunate." He was speaking ahead of a meeting between himself and Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister. At that meeting Mr Hata apparently expressed reservations about the trilateral approach but assured Sir Leon that any agreement with the United States would be extended equally to the EU. Mr Hata was later due to meet Mr Kantor and U.S. Vice President Al Gore. Sir Leon, who first suggested a trilateral initiative to tackle Japan's trade surplus earlier this year, said he wanted to resolve the matter quickly because his personal credibility was at stake. "I do not see that there is any useful purpose served by keeping it up in the air," he said. He expressed impatience at the U.S. failure to explain clearly what it wanted from Japan. Mr Kantor had promised to give Brussels -- but had not delivered -- US papers prepared for the abortive meeting in February between President Bill Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, then Japan's prime minister. The EU planned another effort to discover U.S. intentions soon. If the trilateral proposal proved unworkable, the EU would feel free to criticise the U.S. publicly on issues such as attempts to set targets for a cut in Japan's bilateral surplus in specific sectors. Sir Leon said such targets were "very dangerous" and threatened EU interests. Sir Leon also cast doubt on the prospects for an EU agreeing with the U.S. to free trade in telecommunications equipment. The two sides plan further talks after failing to conclude a deal as part of a package of bilateral measures to liberalise public procurement agreed here on Wednesday [13 April]. He said he was "not really focusing" on telecommunications markets, which were mainly of interest to the United States. "I regarded the whole telecommunications issue as an obstacle rather than an opportunity (in the public procurement talks)," he said. However, he said the procurement deal -- which he had not previously thought possible -- showed that the two sides could settle bilateral disputes.
