Earlier this week, Foreign Minister Vernon Mwaanga resigned and now Princess Nakatindi Wina, the social affairs minister, and her husband, Sikota, the deputy speaker of Parliament, have also quit. All are members of the ruling MMD [Movement for Multiparty Democracy] Party, and they say that they have resigned because they want the government to be able to freely investigate allegations that they were all involved in drug trafficking. From Lusaka, Joy Mwinga sent this telex: Announcing their resignation at a press conference this morning, the Winas said that the Chiluba cabinet was ripe with corruption and challenged seven ministers linked to the misuse of donor funds to follow their example and resign. They accused some cabinet ministers, in particular, of conspiring with the donor community and the independent press to try and bring down President Chiluba's two- year-old admnistration. The Winas' resgination comes only five days after the resignation of Foreign Affairs Minister Vernon Mwaanga, who had been hounded by allegations of drug trafficking. He also claimed that the Chiluba admnistration was infested with corrupt ministers who had enriched themselves at the expense of the taxpayer.

Both Mr. Mwaanga and the Winas dismissed the (Chaila) tribunal report as a piece of political propaganda employed by former President Kaunda as a desperate effort to discredit the opposition. Sources close to President Chiluba say that he is likely to dismiss several ministers over the next few days in response to the concerns of the donor community, but for the while, President Chiluba is facing ever increasing criticism. Opposition parties as well as student groups have said that he can no longer control his ministers and that he himself should resign. Furthermore, there are signs that his cabinet is splitting along tribal lines. The Winas accused several cabinet ministers of hounding them out of office. They say that these ministers are all from the Mambwe tribe from [word indistinct] district who the Winas describe as the [words indistinct].
