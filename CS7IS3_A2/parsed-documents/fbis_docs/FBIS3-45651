The remedy prescribed by Wu Wenying, chairman of the China Textile Federation, on the basis of several days of serious and lively discussion at the conference was: Take the initiative to adjust and deepen reforms. Textiles is one of our country's oldest traditional industries as well as one which moved toward the market early. The abolition of clothing coupons in 1983 was a turning point. To the majority of consumers, it marked the end once and for all of an era of insufficient clothing. To the textile industry, it marked the entry of a period of adjustment and improvement. "Watering flowers with water pumps used previously for large fields"--from this we can imagine the difficulty of the adjustment. Due to specific historical reasons in the transition from the old to a new system, the adjustment and improvement of the industry did not unfold smoothly. This, plus excessive burdens on traditional enterprises, led to years of increasing costs for a textile industry which was once was a great "money earner," and years of falling annual profits and taxes. Some industries, such as cotton spinning, have been losing money since 1991, that is, for the last three years. The year 1993 was extremely difficult for the textile industry. Nationwide, 12 million textile workers worked unceasingly, recovering 9.45 billion out of 11.7 billion yuan in profit reductions, but still failed to halt the trend of sliding economic efficiency. A quarter of national production capacity lay idle or semi-inactive, and 2 million workers had no work or were waiting for employment. But the year was not totally grim. The textile industry in Shanghai adjusted to market demand, increased its efforts at industrial adjustment, and achieved notable results, giving delegates a glimmer of hope of revitalizing the textile industry in these difficult times. Last year, big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Qingdao took the initiative in adjusting their production structures and cutting primary processing capacity. Jiangsu Province has quickened the pace of switching primary processing capacity in cotton spinning from the south of the province to the northern cotton-producing region. Through switching production lines and developing tertiary industry, Shanghai Municipality cut its cotton spinning production capacity by 230,000 spindles and its work force by 110,000. The development of differential land rents in the last year reaped 740 million yuan. Meanwhile, many enterprises were approved as joint- stock companies, shareholding companies with group shareholders, and shareholding cooperative firms; there were active efforts to build a modern corporate system, strengthen firms' operational powers, and quicken the pace of upgrading the industry. "Experience from localities proves that adjustment must be unified with reform for any breakthroughs in thinking and seizing the initiative." Wu Wenying put forward this line of thinking and work focuses for this year's textile reforms: One, the textile industry is a competitive industry. From a long-term view, enterprises owned exclusively by the state can only be a minority, while most state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises must proceed in the direction of diversified ownership and change traditional large-scale production and small-scale operations. Two, state-owned textile enterprises can be reorganized as limited companies or shareholding cooperative enterprises, or they can be contracted out, leased, or rented to collectives or individuals for operations. Three, actively encourage and promote state-owned enterprises to reorganize, integrate, or switch to other industries in structural innovation, and support successfully performing enterprises' efforts to develop large capital-linked business conglomerates engaged in cross-regional, inter-trade, and diversified production and operations in order to promote structural adjustment and strengthen competitiveness in international markets. "Do things according to market laws"--with this loud slogan adjustment in the textile industry has entered a new year.
