Dubinskaya, ``Name Obliges''] [Text] One of the methods of improving the well-being of Moscow's 120 self-financed hospitals is affiliation with commercial structures. Compared to medical service fees abroad (75,000 dollars or higher), 500,000 rubles for two weeks in a boarding house, an examination by one of the medical luminaries--ophthalmologist Academician Arkadiy Nesterov--and treatment or bloodless liver operation using Western practices is a negligible amount. Yet it is still out of reach for 80% of Russian citizens. To improve free service to indigent patients in the hospital's self-financing wards, Clinical Hospital No. 15 in Vykhino found a reliable source of ``off-budget'' financing--the ``Avicenna'' Russian-Syrian joint venture (SP). In 1988, the hospital became its principal stockholder after acquiring 69% of the shares. Here, top-notch service and treatment are offered to the well-off, while the resulting resources ``work'' for the entire hospital complex. The positive impact from such interaction is indisputable. Deputy Director of Moscow's Chief Medical Administration Aleksandr Lukashev commented thus on the outlook for cooperation with commercial structures: ``No obvious disaster with medical service can be foreseen at the capital's hospitals since budget allocations with a 2.5-fold ``padding'' for inflation on a quarter-to-quarter basis amounted to 65 billion rubles during the summer (it was 15 billion at the start of the year--A.D.). Yet despite future centralized shipments of powerful antibiotics, anti-cancer preparations, and equipment to the clinics under direct contracts with various companies, there is still a shortage of anesthetic drugs and ultrasonic and endoscopic equipment. Consequently, we are supporting any form of property in public health--sole proprietorship or joint-stock companies--which provide medical assistance at a proper level and advance Moscow's health services.''
