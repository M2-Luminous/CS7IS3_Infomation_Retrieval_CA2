A number of Burmese fishermen have also lost their lives. Plotprasop said that although Thai fishing boats were guilty of fishing in Burmese waters, Burmese punishment was excessive. The Burmese Government is asked to look into the matter. There should be a standard in punishing guilty Thai fishing boats, not applying violent methods. It is believed that the violent action was committed by low ranking sailors who were patrolling the sea. In any event, Thailand has asked to negotiate the fishing problem with the Burmese Government but there has been no response to date.
