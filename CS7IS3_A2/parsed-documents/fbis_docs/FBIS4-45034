FBIS4-45034 "jpnea031___94002" JPRS-NEA-94-031 JPRS Near East & South Asia 17 April 1994 NEAR EAST ALGERIA Gas Delivery Contract Signed With Portugal Gas Delivery Contract Signed With Portugal 94AF0201B Algiers EL WATAN in French 17 Apr 94 p 5 94AF0201B Algiers EL WATAN French CSO [Article: "Algeria-Portugal Gas Sales Accord Signed"] [Text] The general manager of Sonatrach [National Company for the Transport and Marketing of Hydrocarbons], Mr. Abdelhak Bouhafs, has every reason to feel satisfied. Yesterday morning, when he joined his Portuguese counterpart, Mr. Elia da Costa, president of Portugal's Transgas consortium, in signing the contract to sell Algerian natural gas to Portugal, he "clinched" two of Sonatrach's major objectives. The contract signed yesterday provides for delivery of 2.5 billion cubic meters [m[.sup]3[/]] of natural gas to Portugal over a 24-year period beginning third quarter 1996. The accord is a follow-on to the draft accord signed by Sonatrach and the Portuguese Government on 1 July 1993. With this accord, Sonatrach will have found buyers for all the natural gas it can produce, thus meeting its goal of doubling natural gas exports by 1996. Sonatrach now has firm contracts with commercial partners to sell 58 billion m[.sup]3[/] of gas beginning in 1996, compared to current sales of 30 billion. Yesterday's accord was the final document to be initialed before moving ahead with construction of the great Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline project (GME), which will transport Algerian natural gas to Morocco, Spain, and Portugal starting sometime in the second half of 1996. With the signing last Thursday of two $200-million agreements between Sonatrach and two U.S. banks, Eximbank and City Bank, to finance the Algerian segment of the GME, the last hurdle standing in the way of the project has been overcome. The satisfaction of Sonatrach executives was clearly visible yesterday at the Djenane El-Mithak residence where the contract was signed, all the more since they had been subjected to violent media attacks, in several European (and even American) publications, aimed at discrediting Sonatrach and obstructing realization of the project. The general idea propagated in this denigration campaign was that in the current political and security environment, there is no guarantee Algeria will be a safe and reliable supplier for its clients, or that adequate security be provided for foreign technicians coming to Algeria for the construction phase of the pipeline project. The strong commitments made by the Algerian Government finally won over the Bechtel company (United States)--which is supposed to build the Algerian segment of the GME--Eximbank, City Bank, and ultimately the Portuguese buyer. Sonatrach executives also have every reason to be pleased with the Portuguese Government's decision to allow Sonatrach to acquire a partnership interest in Transgas, the consortium that will operate the Portuguese natural gas distribution system. In brief remarks to journalists yesterday after the signing ceremony, Mr. da Costa confirmed Sonatrach's capital participation in Transgas, predicting the consortium will benefit from Sonatrach's know-how in the natural gas domain. The fact that negotiations between Sonatrach and the Portuguese authorities unfolded "in an almost unprecedented spirit of cooperation and dialogue," as Mr. da Costa termed it yesterday, was doubtless partly responsible for Sonatrach being the first foreign partner chosen to participate in the capital of the Portuguese consortium. Portuguese interests control 51 percent of Transgas's capital, which is also open to other foreign companies.
