However, people still need to show "care, patience, and understanding for each other's life and experiences" in their dealings with one another, Kohl said in his New Year address broadcast by Deutsche Welle. After all, over 40 years of division has "left deep marks." The chancellor warned against any form of national arrogance. In Germany, love of the fatherland and an open-minded way of thinking must never again go separate ways, he said. This is the lesson the Germans must learn from their history. Kohl added: "Those who fan the flames of xenophobia cannot claim to be German patriots." The chancellor once again voiced his support for the process of European unification. The future of the Germans in peace and freedom will always be closely linked with this. Kohl emphasized: "The unification of Europe is a fateful matter for a united Germany." He also affirmed Germany's willingness to make its contribution to safeguarding peace and stability in the world. In future Germany wants to "participate without restrictions in the peacekeeping and peacemaking measures of the United Nations. Kohl added that, despite economic problems and the need to consolidate the budget, Germany accepts its responsibility toward the developing countries. Here the emphasis would be more on the poorer developing countries and states "that are making serious efforts to introduce political and economic reform, and which above all respect human rights." The deep changes in Russia are also a great challenge, the chancellor stressed. Despite all concern and the necessary vigilance with regard to the strong result for extremist forces in the Russian parliamentary elections, there is no reason to change the policy of supporting the reform process in the country.
