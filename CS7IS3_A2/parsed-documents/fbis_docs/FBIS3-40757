Then they "develop" the news into newspaper and television reports which the Zionist lobby, present on the premises of the parliamentary institutions of the US, Britain, and France, seizes, with premeditated planning, to comment upon convulsively and hatefully, as if the reports were true. They want "steps" to be taken against Iraq for having committed these concocted events. They allude to the "measures" they know, which we call "the cowards' opportunity": the call to continue the economic blockade of Iraq, ignoring the humanitarian effects on the proud people of Iraq resulting from the oppressive sanctions. The next phase comes, with is official character, as the official spokesmen in the American White House, the Pentagon, and the British Foreign Office hasten to voice their "disquiet" that Iraq has not "complied" with the resolutions of the international Security Council, then they begin to conspire in the offices and corridors of the international Security Council as the permanent delegates of those countries hold "intensive" meetings with the other members of the Council to "formulate" a new hostile stand against Iraq. There have been media appearances and statements prior to the international Security Council's next bimonthly meeting, indicating that they have reached a draft resolution that they will present regularly and speedily, once it is fully ready. So the Council recently adopted its hostile resolution to continue the economic sanctions against Iraq, without allowing any just voice to ask about the extent of Iraq's implementation of the international Security Council's resolutions, and what is actually required of it to lift the sanctions, besides the publicly announced matters.
