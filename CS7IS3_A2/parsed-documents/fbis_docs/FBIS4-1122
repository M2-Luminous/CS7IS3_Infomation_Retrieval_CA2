Patterton] [Text] Pretoria April 21 SAPA -- The Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] and the Conservative Party [CP] would not participate in the elections, right-wing leader Ferdi Hartzenberg told a press conference in Pretoria on Thursday [21 April]. He said the decision had been taken because the African National Congress and the government would not give guarantees that a "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] would be created if the right- wing obtained sufficient support in the elections. He added that if the ANC and government reacted positively to the right-wing's preconditions, the AVF and CP would be prepared to negotiate about the matter. Dr Hartzenberg said the ANC's Carl Niehaus had said the rightwing would not be granted a volkstaat, whether it participated in the elections or not, while Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer's stance had been that he was not conversant with the content of possible agreements in this regard. Dr Hartzenberg said these developments came after Freedom Front [FF] leader Gen Constand Viljoen asked the AVF and CP on Wednesday to participate in the election on a provincial level in order to prove support for the volkstaat. Dr Hartzenberg said he had told Gen Viljoen that, with no constitutional guarantee of a volkstaat and self-determination being granted if sufficient support emerged, it would not be possible to participate. Dr Hartzenberg said the FF should boycott the elections if these guarantees were not written into the constitution. The FF, AVF and CP could then put pressure on the government and ANC to grant the guarantees. Gen Viljoen's decision to participate without these prior guarantees meant that he was signing away his right to self-determination and placed it in the hands of the SACP [South African Communist Party]/ANC, Dr Hartzenberg said. Gen Viljoen was invited to attend the news conference but did not. Asked what action the AVF would now take, Dr Hartzenmberg said they did not have specific plans, apart from following the "route of resistance", because they were not revolutionary. "That is why we formed the citizens councils to make our demands clear and to force our will on the incoming government." He was unaware of AWB [Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance Movement] mobilisation plans to "secure" the [Orange] Free State and Transvaal. State President F W de Klerk told a separate news conference in Pretoria it was too late for the rightwing to participate in the elections unless they did so under the FF's banner. There was no time for new constitutional negotiations. Mr de Klerk understood that Dr Hartzenberg's requests were subject to preconditions which required further negotiations and this was logistically impossible. The FF, in the meantime, said the following CP-controlled town councils had declared their support for the FF in the election: Ermelo, Middelburg, Secunda, Standerton, Witbank and Meyerton. Other councils were expected to follow, the FF's chief secretary, Joseph Chiole said.
