The Liberal Democrats said that, to the growing surprise and discontent of the fraternal Serb people, the Duma failed to take action on the Yugoslav developments. That damaged the Duma's international image. The Liberal Democrats felt the Duma's strategy for the former Yugoslavia must be based on the message of the numerous addresses and statements made by their leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. They advised the Duma to replace discussions of the Yugoslav developments with resolute moves against barbaric anti-Yugoslav actions by the United States, Germany and other countries. The Liberal Democrats suggested that Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev address, without delay, the State Duma. Depending on what he had to say, the Duma would decide whether he could remain in office. The faction of the Russian Unity and Accord party in the State Duma said, in turn, that mistakes by the Foreign Ministry tended to aggravate the Bosnian conflict. The Unity and Accord party felt Moscow had blundered by hurrying to recognize unitary Bosnia- Herzegovina, favoring the idea of one-sided anti-Yugoslav sanctions and giving the green light to NATO's plans to bomb Serb positions. The parliamentary faction of the Unity and Accord party called for immediate action on President Yeltsin's initiative for an international conference on the Balkans. It said Russia was to be the first to propose the lifting of the "meaningless and unfair anti-Yugoslav sanctions". And if the Croats and Moslems moved to torpedo peace negotiations, Russia must push for the introduction of sanctions against those two communities.
