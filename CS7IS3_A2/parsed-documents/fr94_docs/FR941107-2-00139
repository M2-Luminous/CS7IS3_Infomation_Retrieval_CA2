FR941107-2-00139 FR941107-2-00081 2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? These changes do not involve any physical changes to plant systems, structures, or components (SSC), or the manner in which these SSC are operated, maintained, modified, or inspected. These changes increase the pressure for performing the low pressure test on the HPCI pump from approximately 150 psig to [less than or equal to] 175 psig. Therefore, these changes will not create the possibility or a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Does this change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? The margin of safety is not reduced. These changes increase the pressure for performing the low pressure test on the HPCI pump from approximately 150 psig to [less than or equal to] 175 psig. For reasons stated above, the ability of the HPCI pump to perform at the lowest required pressure of 150 psig has already been demonstrated. A small increase in the pressure at which the performance to design specifications is verified will not significantly delay or affect the validity of the test to determine that the pump and turbine are still operating at the design specifications. These changes effectively extend[s] the initial entry into the applicable condition prior to performing the surveillance. However, this is considered acceptable since the most common outcome of the performance of a surveillance is the successful demonstration that the acceptance criteria are satisfied. In addition, the change provides the benefit of allowing the surveillance to be postponed until plant conditions exist where performance of the surveillance is unlikely to result in a pressure transient. These changes do not affect the current analysis assumptions. Therefore, these changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
