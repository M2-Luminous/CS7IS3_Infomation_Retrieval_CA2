Together with his departmental colleagues, he is attending a session at Plumlov, Prostejov district. He said: [Begin Ruml recording] As for the state border, naturally, the talks must be suspended at the moment because they have been transformed to the level of political talks, that is the level of two governments, two prime ministers. This means that the controversial points must be frozen. The border should be delimited in the places where the border commission was capable of agreeing, and I assume that the next Slovak government will be interested in talking about these matters and that we will agree in the end on the two parts of the state border, above all for the benefit of the people.
