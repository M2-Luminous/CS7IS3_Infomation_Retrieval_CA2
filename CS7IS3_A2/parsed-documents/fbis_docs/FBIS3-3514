Looking at the good trend in economic and trade exchanges between Shanghai and Taiwan, as well as visits by personnel from the two places, the director of the Taiwan Affairs Office was certainly very happy. According to statistics, in 1993 the development of economic and trade relations between Shanghai and Taiwan compared very well with the overall situation of economic development in Shanghai. A total of 805 Taiwan-funded enterprises gained approval for establishment over the whole year, and this means that two Taiwan-funded enterprises established themselves in the municipality every day. A total of $1.5 billion in Taiwanese funds was attracted to the municipality in 1993; there were 249 exchange programs, 54 more than in 1992; and in the area of personnel exchange, 1,304 Shanghai personnel went to Taiwan. Zhang Zhiqun said that in the new year, the first thing to do is to continue to strengthen work in attracting Taiwan-funded enterprises so that more Taiwan-funded enterprises will settle down in Shanghai. Particular attention must be paid to the investment intentions of large consortia on the island. He said that Taiwan investment in Shanghai exhibits four features: Investment projects develop in the capital-intensive and technology-intensive direction; the investment scale has expanded, and there are over 50 large projects each of which involves $5 million; Taiwan businessmen are eager to lease land, among the 200 parcels of leased land in Shanghai, Taiwan businessmen have won over 40; the investment domain has expanded to tertiary industry, and among the 1,000 or so Taiwan firms which have won approval for establishment, over one-fourth have invested in tertiary industry. Zhang Zhiqun also said that full play must be given to Shanghai's overall advantage, to actively promoting various exchanges between the two places, to enabling Shanghai's departments in charge of science, technology, education, culture, sports, and medicine to have more extensive contacts and links with Taiwan's professional sectors; and that overall work in receiving personnel from the two sides of the strait must be done well in order to enable Taiwan compatriots in Shanghai to move and see more. He also disclosed that, in light of the new situation in which the number of Taiwan-funded enterprises is increasing, Shanghai plans to establish an Association of Taiwan-Funded Enterprises this year. The association will organize experts, scholars, and public servants from economic and trade departments and government organs to brief Taiwan businessmen on the relevant policies and regulations on a regular basis to enable them to further understand Shanghai's investment direction and environment. The association will also organize many activities to enable Taiwan businessmen to have a more colorful and richer life in Shanghai; it will also foster ties between Taiwan businessmen and the government, and solve difficulties for Taiwan businessmen when they set up enterprises and make investments. Zhang Zhiqun finally said that, judged from last year's situation, the exchanges between Shanghai and Taiwan played a role in promoting economic development in Shanghai. Among the foreign-funded enterprises in Shanghai, Taiwan-funded enterprises now rank second in terms of number of projects, and based on last year's success, exchanges and interactions between the two places will develop faster and better.
