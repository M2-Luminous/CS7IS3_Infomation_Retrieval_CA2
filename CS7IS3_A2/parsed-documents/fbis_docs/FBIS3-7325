Accompanying us are four members of my cabinet, three senators and two congressmen, the president of the University of the Philippines, and a business delegation of our most prominent industrialists and traders. This trip reciprocates Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to our country three years ago. I regard this visit as one of the most significant I have made. Vietnam is one of our closest neighbors. It is less than two hours away across the South China Sea. Our two countries are alike in terrain, area, natural resources, and population. Our cultural connections date back at least a thousand years, and our struggles against colonialism and foreign conquest were inspired by the same ideals of freedom and national independence. But in the course of history, we adopted different ideological systems for organizing our national societies. The Cold War and the Indo-China [words indistinct] raised even greater barriers between our two countries. Today, mutual goodwill between our two countries have brought down those barriers. Our paths converge again on the road to self-sustaining economic growth, and our two countries today seek national security and regional stability, neither in military alliances nor in accumulating weapons but in friendly consultation and economic cooperation with neighbor countries. With Vietnam and the other Southeast Asian states, our country has a shared destiny. We have found that there is no alternative to peace and economic cooperation among us in this region. Over the next generation, Vietnam is certain to become one of Southeast Asia's most important states and a major force in the regional balance of power. Its incorporation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, is an imperative of Southeast Asian peace, security, and prosperity. In Manila in July 1992, Vietnam acceded to the Bali Treaty of the ASEAN States, which binds iis signatories to settle regional disputes peaceably. Vietnam's full membership in ASEAN is now a matter no longer of policy or principle, but merely of time and procedure. Even now, Vietnam already takes part in a wide range of ASEAN cooperative activities. For instance, it is a part of the ASEAN Regional Forum, to which ASEAN and friendly outside powers consult on regional security. The Philippines took the initiative of wholeheartedly supporting Vietnam's membership in ASEAN and its associated institutions. We have also consistently supported Vietnam's efforts to re-establish normal relations with the global community and to secure membership in international financial and political organizations. Philippine-Vietnamese relations are a critical force for the solidarity of Southeast Asia and consequently for peace and progress of the Asia- Pacific region. I am confident that this visit, the first by a Philippine president to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, will advance this relations substantially. The facets of our bilateral relationships are many and increasing. There are, therefore, important things for my delegation to discuss with Vietnam's leaders. There is the security of East Asia and the Pacific. Its present status can now be enhanced cooperatively by the nations of the region. I shall be exploring avenues of possible cooperation between our two countries in seeking a breakthrough to the multiple competing claims to the Spratlys archipelago in the South China Sea. Perhaps a joint venture in marine research of the islands related to ocean research, weather forecasting, and environmental protection, and participated by all the claimants, for a start of the confidence-building mechanisms that we need to settle these claims for our mutual benefit. [sentence as heard] There are other creative proposals that I intend to discuss with our Vietnamese neighbors. Then, there is the new thrust in economic cooperation which ASEAN has undertaken. Through the ASEAN Free Trade Area or AFTA, to which a talented and hardworking Vietnamese people have a great deal to contribute. I look forward to inform the leaders of Vietnam of the political consolidation and economic reforms that we are undertaking in our country and the results these measures have so far achieved in our overall effort to open our economy to market forces and to global competition. In turn, I hope to learn from them the workings of their own economic renovation or doi moi which has made Vietnam one of the fastest growing economies in the world this past seven years. The lifting of the American trade embargo last month and the American investment it is expected to bring should both speed up the pace and broaden the scope of its economic growth. The increasingly favorable economic situation in Vietnam should also make it easier for our two countries to find a durable solution for the problem of Vietnamese asylumseekers in the Philippines. Great potentials for economic cooperation between our two countries are opening up. My delegation will look into possibilities of counter trade, investments, complimentation, and joint-ventures in each other's economies. We shall offer the Vietnamese the help of our industrialists, managers, and technologists in rebuilding their infrastructure and telecommunications systems, planning their new cities, and managing their tourist facilities. There should also be great room for collaboration between us in education, language training, and training of technical people. We shall be proposing the activation of our joint commission on trade and economic cooperation. The business leaders in my delegation intend to identify with their Vietnamese counterparts specific products that we can profitably exchange in the light of the present low level trade between our two countries and of the prospects offered by the growth and diversification of our respective economies. There are opportunities also in agriculture and in agricultural research. Like our country, Vietnam is a major producer and exporter of agricultural products. We can operate also in promoting tourism, both from our neighbors and from outside the region. There is also much room for collaboration in science and technology, in education, and public health. We have much to learn from each other. I expect to discuss these prospects with President Le Duc Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, General Secretary Do Muoi of the ruling party and the country's other policymakers and its private sector. Finally, I look forward to visiting with a small but growing community of Filipino businessmen and professionals in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. This, then is a historic visit to a very important neighbor, a neighbor destined to become even closer to us bilaterally and in ASEAN. My dear countrymen, we leave our beloved Philippines in a good situation and in good hands. I ask you to pray to the Almighty for the success of our mission and for our safe return two days from now. Long live the Philippines. Thank you very much to all of you.
