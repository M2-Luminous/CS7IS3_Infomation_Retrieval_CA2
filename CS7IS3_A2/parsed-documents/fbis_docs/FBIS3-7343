We cannot but heighten vigilance because the anti-DPRK smear campaign of Japan is getting all the more undisguised at a time when the situation on the Korean peninsula has been brought to a critical phase by the new war provocation moves on the part of the United States and the South Korean puppet clique. As is known, the recent inspection activities performed by the inspectors' group of the International Atomic Energy Agency were sufficient to fully verify the non-diversion of nuclear material at our nuclear facilities and definitely ensure the continuity of safeguards. Yet the paid media of Japan are charging the DPRK with "exclusive use of nuclear technology for arms manufacture" and "gaining time". This is aimed at harming the DPRK by inventing a pretext at whatever cost and isolating and stifling it through international "sanctions" and pressure. By spreading false rumours about the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, Japan seeks a sinister purpose of justifying its ambitious project of becoming a nuclear power. The Japanese reactionaries must refrain from a smear campaign against others, properly liquidate the past, discard the criminal design to make Japan a nuclear power and stop swimming against the trend of the times.
