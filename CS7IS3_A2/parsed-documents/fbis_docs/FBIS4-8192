Serb intelligence sources say that Muslim refugees from Gorazde, who are living in Tarcin and the nearby village of Pazaric, had held the silo under blockade since Friday. The refugees demanded the lynching of the detained Serbs. The Muslim police had the situation under control until Sunday evening when the mob broke into the prison and killed at least 10 Serbs, using firearms and other objects. Muslim Sarajevo radio confirmed that the incident had happened, saying that shooting had been heard amid a totally chaotic situation, after which -- according to the radio -- three prisoners were missing. The radio reporter says that it is assumed that there had been some casualties, but does not give the figure. Nothing is known about the fate of the survivors of the massacre, but Muslim sources claim that the police again took control of the silo-prison. The Serb side has been trying for 18 months now to organize the release of over 200 prisoners from the silo on the principle "all for all" with the Muslim authorities, and with the help of international humanitarian organizations, but the Muslim authorities have rejected all attempts to exchange prisoners.
