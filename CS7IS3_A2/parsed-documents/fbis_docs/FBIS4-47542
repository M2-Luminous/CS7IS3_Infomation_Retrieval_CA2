Proskurina, R.A. Kulman, Ye.I. Deryugina, V.N. Ivanov, Hematology Research Center at Russia's Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow; UDC 576.8] [Abstract] The high cost of imported incomplete Freund adjuvant (NAF) which facilitates the development of ascite tumors with the best properties in mice inoculated with hybridoma cells--the most economical source of monoclonal antibodies--and the difficulty large-scale in vivo MCA production due to the need for large quantities of conditioning reagents necessitated tests of various reagents for conditioning the mice before inoculating them with hybridoma cells. To this end, 15-20 week old 18-20 g female mice irradiated with the help of a [.sup]137[/]Cs source were used. The method of hybridoma cell cultivation and the conditioning reagents are described. The findings demonstrate that with respect to all principal indicators, one of the compounds under study--hexadecane--can match the commonly used pristan. When primed with hexadecane, the proportion of mice with an ascite tumor, its growth duration, and the ascite volume, and the MCA titer were equal to, or even exceed, the same indicators in the pristan-primed animals examined with five different hybridomata. The results make it possible to recommend the relatively inexpensive and accessible hexadecane in place of pristan. Tables 2; references 10: 1 Russian, 9 Western.
