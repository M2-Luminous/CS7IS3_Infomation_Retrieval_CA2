The Croatian Army carried out attacks toward the Gracac part of Mount Velebit and infiltrated a subversive group in the Teslingrad front. According to the general staff of the Serbian army of Krajina, the Croatian subversive group that was infiltrated north of Teslingrad in Lika was neutralized. In the last 24 hours, the Croatian Army carried out attacks with infantry weapons and tanks on Zitnik near Drnis, Otisic in the Vrlika region, and the free part of the village of Kasic near Benkovac. It was somewhat quieter around Otocac, where the Krajina and the Croatian commissions for exchange of war prisoners and other humanitarian issues met under the auspices of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. They agreed on the next exchange, which will take place in 15 days, and exhumation at several hitherto unknown locations where soldiers and civilian victims of the war are buried. They also agreed that exchange include the persons who, as stated, committed classical types of crime. This cooperation under the mediation of foreign observers is thus assuming a new quality.
