FR940610-0-00004 FR940610-0-00003 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;35] Modification of Class D Airspace; Mountain Home, ID AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This action modifies the Class D airspace area at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, by amending the area's effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with the air traffic control tower is required. DATES: Effective date_0901 u.t.c., August 18, 1994. Comment date: Comments must be received on or before August 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the rule in triplicate to: Manager, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, ANM&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;35, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056. The official docket may be examined in the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel for the Northwest Mountain Region, suite 570, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056. An informal docket may also be examined during normal business hours at the address listed above. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James E. Riley, Airspace and Procedures Section, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, ANM&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056; telephone: (206) 227&hyph;2537. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments on the Rule Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the DATES section. However, after the review of any comments, and, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or to amend the regulation. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, by amending the area's effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at this airport. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with this air traffic control tower is required. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to modify this Class D airspace area in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in this area. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The incorporation by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 of the Federal Aviation Administration Order 7400.9A, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, is amended as follows: Paragraph 5000_General * * * * * ANM ID D Mountain Home, ID␣[Revised] Mountain Home AFB, ID (Lat. 43 ○02 ’37 ’ ’ N., Long. 115 ○52 ’21 ’ ’ W.)
