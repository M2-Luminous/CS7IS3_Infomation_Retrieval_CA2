[Crnjakovic] Mr. Degoricija, can the people of Skabrnja return to their village, and who should organize that? [Degoricija] The agreement itself is so global that its function is not only the ceasefire and putting a stop to further hostilities, but it also opens the practical possibility of the return of the refugees. At issue is a great area, stretching over a thousand kilometers, and it will now be necessary to determine specifically which villages the people can return to, if there is an infrastructure there, if they can work, sleep, eat there. The Entire Line Free [Crnjakovic] Who will make all the preparations, and why have they not been made yet? Namely, it would be logical that these plans would be completed parallel to the negotiations. Were they? [Degoricija] Unfortunately, the state institution that would organize the return of the refugees and their life in the villages that have been empty for over two years does not exist yet. At the time, there was the Ministry of Restoration, which had gained very good experience in 1992, when people were returning to Pakrac, Lipik, or Gorice. I really do not know who will be doing that now. For instance, in the area of Jasenovac, or Novska, refugees can return to three villages: Tanac, Ustice, and Visnjica. In sector west, refugees can practically return to the villages behind Lipik and Pakrac now that this agreement on the cessation of hostilities has been signed. Clearly, this can not be done in an unorganized way; these people must have complete protection. Theoretically, refugees can return to Skabrnja, Islam Grcki, Smokovici, and Kasic, since that entire line is now free. The greatest value of this agreement is precisely that -- the process of the refugees returning to their homes beginning. [Crnjakovic] Who is to say when this will happen? [Degoricija] That is what I would like to know! [Crnjakovic] Nothing has been organized in practical terms? [Degoricija] These people need material help. We had offices for return and restoration in municipalities, but I do not know if such offices have been organized in counties. [Crnjakovic] Why has that not been done yet? [Degoricija] No substitute has been found for the former Ministry of Restoration. The government will have to give initiative to some other institution that would take care of all this. [Crnjakovic] You keep mentioning the protected areas. The public is afraid that this is the final "cementing" of the Cyprus syndrome. [Degoricija] The Cyprus syndrome being created in Croatia is out of the question. Croatia has been given all the international guarantees that the normalization process must have three stages, the first relating to ceasefire, which I consider the most important one, and the last one regarding the political solution. The Opening of the Highway [Crnjakovic] How much time will there be between the first and second stage? [Degoricija] The actualization of the second stage will follow within 10 days, or 14 at the longest. It is very important, and it relates to the preparation of the negotiations on economy and infrastructure. Specifically, that means that all the railroads and roads will be open, the electric power supply facilities repaired, and the water supply facilities open. [Crnjakovic] Even the Knin railroad to Split? [Degoricija] Of course! The Zagreb-Belgrade highway, and the Karlovac-Korenica-Obrovac-Zadar road too. There will probably be priorities in the process, as each side has its own, mostly different, priorities. For instance, the Serb side considers electricity important; for us it is the highway; for UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] it is the Zagreb-Knin-Split railroad; the Croatia's interest is to open all the water sources, so that Zadar, Sibenik, and Biograd can be supplied. Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are especially interested in the opening of the oil pipeline. Therefore, in about two weeks, we will decide at the green table on the process of the economic and traffic normalization. When we do that, the third stage, relating to political negotiations, will follow. [Crnjakovic] In your opinion, of all the miracles you have promised, which will happen first? [Degoricija] They are no longer miracles; this is reality. I believe that the highway will open first, and the opening of the oil pipeline will follow, but I think that the water supply will not be late either. It is quite certain that many local roads will open immediately. [Crnjakovic] Are you not afraid that the Serb rebels will stop the passengers, or the workers at the water pumping sites? [Degoricija] Now, the issue is no longer fear, because now the guarantor is the international factor. Sanctions Against Offenders [Crnjakovic] However, theoretically, the possibility that someone will violate the agreement should be taken into consideration. Have provisions been made for this case? [Degoricija] The international factors will impose sanctions. [Crnjakovic] What kind of sanctions? [Degoricija] We will see when the new Security Council resolution is passed, which will happen very soon. At any rate, Messrs. Redman and Galbraith said that the agreement should now be operationalized, and they will not spend too much time on it now that the agreements have been signed. Namely, we are in the "sign it or leave it" stage. [Crnjakovic] Who will have civilian authority in the protected areas? [Degoricija] In the first 14 days it will be UNPROFOR, along the whole length of the separation line, but, at the same time, 200 policemen will be organized on both the Croatian and the Serb sides. These policemen will bear the marks of the international community, and they will be supposed to prevent illegal actions; any crime, any unallowed action. They will act at the invitation of UNPROFOR in the area within a kilometer on each side of the demarcation line. No more than 50 policemen can be in one zone. [Crnjakovic] Who will select them? [Degoricija] Each side will give their list to UNPROFOR. UNPROFOR can erase a certain name or the entire list, or cross somebody off later if they carry out impermissible actions. [Crnjakovic] But that means that, for instance, Serb war criminals can be on the list. [Degoricija] No. UNPROFOR determines who will be entrusted with the task. [Crnjakovic] Where will our army be? [Degoricija] The infantry forces will withdraw 1 km from the frontline on each side. I have already explained the issue of the heavy weapons to the representatives. [Crnjakovic] You said that the third stage was the political solution to the Serb issue in Croatia. Has that not been solved by passing the Constitutional Law on Minority Rights? Is that the most difficult part of the job? [Degoricija] Everybody considers it to be the most difficult problem, but I do not. I believe that the most difficult part of the job was the stage of the preparations and the signing of the cease-fire agreement. It was the precondition for sitting down at the green table and discussing the political solution without being burdened by the war option. The Six-Month Deadline [Crnjakovic] When will the political solution be reached? [Degoricija] I think that the deadline is six months, which is how long the UNPROFOR mandate has been extended for. If we do not reach it by then, the mandate will have to be extended again, for which the world has neither the willingness or the patience. [Crnjakovic] The world does not, but do the local Serbs? They have often counted on this stalling. [Degoricija] This may have been the case earlier, but no longer. If they had not been prepared for a political solution, they would not have sat down at the table and signed the cease-fire agreement. I think that they have the intention and the willingness to achieve peace through political means. The Serbs are prepared for a political solution. [Crnjakovic] Without new conditions and blackmail? [Degoricija] I think so, although I would not rule out the possibility of small corrections being made. [Crnjakovic] We will not talk of a historical agreement, but I will ask you a very specific question: Will the refugees soon return to Glina, Petrinja, Vukovar....? [Degoricija] Absolutely! [Crnjakovic] When? [Degoricija] I firmly believe that it will happen within the next six months.
