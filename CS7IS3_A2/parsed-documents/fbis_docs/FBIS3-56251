A national referendum will be held in the republic on Saturday, January 15, to decide on the extension of President Saparmurad Niyazov's rule by another term in office. This is "the will of the Turkmens", based on the incontrovertible logic dictating that the reforms now underway and the whole programme "10 years of prosperity" should be completed by the president whom the people call "Turvenbashi", father of all Turekmens. Time has shown that Turkmenbashi "is a capable helmsman" who can steer the state free of shallows and reefs, according to the unanimous opinion of all local newspapers promoting the idea of prolonging Niyazov's term of presidency. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the president himself has uttered enough pronouncements about the results of his activity which can be used to effectively sell the idea. Speaking at the first meeting of the cabinet of ministers this year about the results of his official visit to Teheran, the Turkmen leader made clear that he was quite close to translating into life his cherished dream -- to lift the veil of isolation which is shrouding Iran, a great neighbour country with a multi-million population which, according to Niyazov, is making a rapid economic headway and is willing to engage in international cooperation. The Turkmen leader said that having elevated special relationship with "two great neighbours", Iran and Russia, above the common, he now has "new guarantees of peaceful and progressive development", which most countries of Europe and Asia need above all. Niyazov said the same to the commanders of the CIS border troops at their meeting in Ashgabat. Thanks to mutual benevolence and trust linking Turkmenistan with Russia and Iran it becomes possible to solve all problems, including those on the borders, he said. According to him, the existing borders must be inviolable thus strengthening peace and quiet. Talks between Niyazov and President Hashemi-Rafsanjani of Iran showed that the presidents see eye to eye on these and other aspects of cooperation. Niyazov's "own political style" was manifested again in his telephone conversation with Boris Yeltsin during which both presidents confirmed the importance of the latest agreements between Russia and Turkmenistan and agreed on the need to hold a conference of Caspian states. Yet another argument in favour of Niyazov was remembrance day held in Turkmenistan on January 12 to commemorate all victims of violence in the country's history. By decreeing that this day be marked annually, Niyazov added another chip to his extensive popularity in the republic.
