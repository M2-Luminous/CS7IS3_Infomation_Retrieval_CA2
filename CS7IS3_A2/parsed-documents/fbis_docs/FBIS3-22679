This raises the possibility of outpatient treatment with ongoing medical checkups and monitoring of the virus and illustrates our respect for patients as individuals and the protection of their human rights. Reincorporation, which will be only for those who have accepted their condition as HIV-positive, are sufficiently mature and psychologically well balanced, and display responsible social and sexual conduct, will not mean the disappearance of the sanatoriums. The move is part of Cuba's advancing and consistent program for battling AIDS. [passage omitted] Box, p 8] The AIDS sanatorium in Pinar del Rio has 44 patients, although there were 96 HIV-positives in the provinces in October 1993. The rest are in Los Cocos in Havana. There have been 20 deaths since the disease emerged. The sanatorium has 48 employees. Its director, Dr. Angel Fulladosa, says that surveys in college preparatory schools in the province reveal that youngsters know quite a bit about AIDS. Most, however, answer yes to this question: "And if you feel like it, do you have sexual relations even if you know that you are HIV-positive?" [passage omitted] Moreover, drugstores are no longer carrying condoms, and youngsters are not in the habit of using them anyway. The high risk groups in the province are girls 14 to 18 and boys 16 to 20. There are other risk groups as well, though. There is systematic monitoring in the province, and 700,000 tests have been done since studies began in 1986. This enables us to say that there must not be more than a few undetected cases in the province. The young people here can receive visits from their relatives or go home for several days, and this helps their morale greatly. Some sanatoriums have also started gradually releasing patients back into their neighborhoods. They have good relations here with the locals, and friendships are developing. All of this is helping to make the youngsters less aggressive. Proper, humanitarian treatment improves social relations, Fulladosa says, as we tour the sanatorium's new facilities under construction: soon to be completed bungalows among the trees with a maximum capacity of 150. While many governments and health-care systems around the world seem powerless or at least bewildered by the geometric spread of AIDS, Cuba still has an extremely low rate of HIV infection, under 0.01. The containment of the epidemic on our island is often attributed, especially overseas, to the sanatorium policy implemented by local medical authorities. As a result, many will be surprised to hear that Cuba now proposes to provide outpatient treatment to every HIV-positive person who wants to and can receive it. This decision does not, however, imply that the country is even partially giving up on an institution that has proven its effectiveness in containing the disease. BOHEMIA asked Dr. Reinaldo Gil Suarez, who runs the National Program Against AIDS, and Dr. Mariluz Rodriguez Alvarez, the director of the National Health Education Center, to comment on this subject. "The National Program Against AIDS is 10 years old now," explains Gil Suarez. "The first measures were taken in 1983. They consisted of a system of surveillance against opportunistic diseases and a ban on imports of blood products from countries in which AIDS was present. This averted major problems for us. Because we ourselves produced these drugs, with the necessary rigor and care, the number of people who got infected this way can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and concurrently the nation developed its own technology for manufacturing these items. "In late 1985 and early 1986 we looked into the possibility of doing testing with diagnostic kits in spite of their high price on the market. We also decided to fight AIDS as just another sexually transmitted disease, by identifying risk groups, undertaking major prevention and education efforts among the population, and preventing infection through the perinatal route. "Another element in the strategy was the establishment of sanatoriums for those who tested HIV-positive. HIV-positives were thus surrounded by various kinds of specialists to prevent fatal complications, and the chances of the virus spreading among the healthy population were considerably lessened. "As you can see, the system of sanatoriums is one of the pillars of our success in battling AIDS, but it is not the only one." At this point in the conversation Dr. Rodriguez Alvarez remarked that outpatient treatment is not altogether new, inasmuch as several HIV-positive persons have been receiving it for five years, either full-time or taking periodic leaves in the company of medical personnel or a relative who makes sure that their behavior on the street is above reproach. "Outpatient treatment," the director of the National Health Education Center adds, "represents a higher stage in the development of the program and should in no way be related to the financial limitations facing the country. We have been and will be unstinting with resources in battling the disease, and the proof of this is that those who avail themselves of this arrangement will continue to receive medication absolutely free of charge and a special diet that meets all protein and calorie requirements. "Now then," Dr. Suarez Gil says, retaking the floor, "not all sanatorium patients will automatically be reincorporated into society. Each sanatorium has commissions that decide which patients are responsible enough about their own health and that of the community. There is enough background information for a correct decision in each case, because we are familiar with the earlier lives of these persons, their work and social history, their ethical values, the families they came from, and, something very important, their behavior inside the sanatorium, how they are reconciling themselves to the disease, etc. "In addition to the principle of selectivity, there is also the principle of choice. No patient will be forced to accept outpatient treatment even if the medical commission decides that he can. Only those who deserve and want it can receive it. We even anticipate offering them the chance to keep on living in the sanatorium and to study or work on the outside. "They are also guaranteed ongoing specialized medical care, whether at the sanatorium, through family physicians (who have been appropriately trained in this connection), in provincial hospitals, or at the Pedro Kouri Institute of Tropical Medicine," Gil Suarez notes. "As we see things," Dr. Rodriguez Alvarez remarks, "reincorporating HIV-positive people into their families and into society at large will reinforce the prevention and education work that we physicians are doing in various ways. The message will be most effective among young people, who represent the highest risk group, because it will be conveyed by people their own age who dress the same, have the same general tastes, the same psychology, and ways of looking at the world...." "The patients are displaying an admirable willingness to cooperate in this connection. The sanatoriums have done a lot of work with them, and we should underscore their involvement in a prevention system that they themselves have inspired and built in the centers in which they are patients. AIDS patients and HIV-positives are represented on the AIDS national technical commission, and one of them, a physician, is even the head of the prevention section. "I should point out that outpatient care is not granted for a specific period of time. The behavior of the people who can and choose to avail themselves of this treatment will be systematically monitored, and if they are unruly or violate, even in a minor way, the principles on which it rests, they are brought back into the sanatorium permanently." [Box, p 10] Statistics on AIDS in Cuba (as of 16 December 1993) - Total tests conducted: 15,097,284 - HIV-positives detected: 987 (702 males and 285 females) - Estimate of undetected carriers: between 150 and 200 - Two-hundred and thirty of the HIV carriers have fallen ill, and 147 of them have died. - Sexual transmission is most common, accounting for 98 percent of the cases. - The average period for developing the disease, in other words, for an individual to move from asymptomatic to symptomatic, is 11 years. - There are sanatoriums in all provinces except Las Tunas and the Isle of Youth.
