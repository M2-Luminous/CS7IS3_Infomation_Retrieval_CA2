Speaking at a press conference he gave here together with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Mubarak said the U.S. official had briefed him on efforts made over the past two days during his talks with Syrian and Israeli officials. "We are working along with the U.S. for settling the Syrian- Israeli problem," he added. On the situation in Yemen, Mubarak said that he had warned against resorting to force. "Force will not solve any problem," he stressed. In a speech delivered at the beginning of the press conference, Mubarak said that both Syria and Israel are badly in need of establishing peace. "Time has come to solve any outstanding problems hindering establishing peace between the two countries," he noted. Christopher, who arrived here earlier today, spoke highly of Egypt's role in the Middle East peace process. He also said Syria has an important role to play in the process. The U.S. official said he had conveyed Israeli views to Syria on settling their disputes, and is waiting for a solution acceptable to both sides. Christopher is on his third Middle East shuttle since December. Syria and Israel have exchanged proposals for a land-for-peace deal. Under the formula, Israel should withdraw from the Golan Heights it occupied in the 1967 Middle East war in return for recognition, peace and guaranteed security from Syria. Issues of dispute between the two sides include the timing of the withdrawal, security guarantees, the fate of 13,000 Jewish settlers in the Golan, and normalization of relations under a peace treaty.
