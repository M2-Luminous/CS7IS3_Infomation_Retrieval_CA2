Foreign Minister Celso Amorim believes that if this happens, and if new rules are imposed on countries having cheap labor, a new form of protectionism would have been created. Speaking at the seminar entitled "New World Trade Map" sponsored by this newspaper, Amorim said: "Instead of contributing to improving social conditions in developing countries, this would result in rich countries exporting unemployment to poor countries; that is, in the former transferring to the latter an untenable social burden." This new method of pressure known as social "dumping" is one of the new issues raised at the end of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations. Trade issues concerning the environment, and policies on competition (rules governing competition among countries) are other topics that are emerging on the new agenda through the pressure exerted by the developed countries. Ambassador Luiz Felipe Lampreia, the Brazilian representative to GATT, has contended that the WTO is not the appropriate forum to discuss either the social "dumping" issue or the connections between trade and labor standards. He said: "The International Labor Organization (ILO) has already concluded 200 conventions regarding this issue." Lampreia conveyed the Brazilian Government's concern over the possibility that the WTO might become a politicized organization "for reasons other than trade." He noted that the WTO could become politicized "if it carelessly introduces the social clause." Lampreia chairs a GATT committee charged with studying the links between trade and the environment. The committee is due to propose to the WTO two years from now "the course of action to take" regarding this matter. The Brazilian Government is concerned about our exports of paper, cellulose, and shrimp, which have been threatened by ecological measures with underlying trade motives. In the case of shrimp, Brazil had to sign an accord with the United States whereby Brazilian shrimp boats will be equipped with devices to avoid catching sea turtles. Brazil signed the accord without reservations. It should have made the above requirement applicable only to fishermen operating in the northern part of the country, who are the main exporters of shrimp to the United States, thus exempting fishermen operating in southern areas, who are now complaining about this restriction. Mexico, a major exporter of this product to the U.S. market, has had to conform to U.S. legal requirements designed to prevent the catching of dolphins. Another controversial issue at this time of transition from GATT to the WTO deals with restrictive trade practices used by some companies in their international transactions. Amorim said: "This is an old claim by developing countries that has now been compounded by the growing attention developed countries are devoting to competition policies. In a globalized economy, this type of practice could annul the liberalization efforts made by some governments. This possibility has in fact been recognized in the Uruguay Round accord on services and intellectual property rights." Jesus Seade, deputy director general of GATT, who also attended the seminar, said: "The challenges are enormous. The Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD) is working in this. The GATT member countries have no modern laws on competition. Many practices do not encourage competition." According to the foreign minister, it is a mistake to believe that governments and unions are united on the social "dumping" issue because unions are inclined to favor higher salaries. Ambassador Julio Antonio Lacarte, "chairman" of the Group of Negotiations and Settlement of Disputes of the Uruguay Round, said that operating under the WTO umbrella will be an organization charged with settling controversies ("Dispute Settlement Body" -- DSB), which will deal with disputes concerning each accord of the final Uruguay Round agreement. The DSB will be empowered to set up "panels" (arbitration committees), will monitor the implementation of rules and recommendations, and will authorize retaliatory measures if the recommendations are not observed. This is a step forward in relation to GATT, because the mechanisms for settling controversies there is spread out among the GATT Council and several committees created by the Tokyo Round. For the first time GATT has also adopted the notion of processing and production methods. Imports will now have to go through a process designed to determine how the imported product has been manufactured.
