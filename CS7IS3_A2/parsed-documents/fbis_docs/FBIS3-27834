The officials said the idea was dropped after it was discovered that the used chemical tanker under consideration might not be able to withstand the severe cold of the Russian Far East. They said the two sides have subsequently begun considering the idea of Japan providing financial assistance for emergency disposal facilities. Russia asked Japan in talks last December to help find a chemical tanker with a storage capacity of between 5,000 tons and 25,000 tons. Japan had introduced a 10,000-ton class Panamanian-registered tanker docked in Singapore. But Russian inspectors determined that the tanker might not be able to withstand severe cold weather conditions and that its deck may not be thick enough to prevent adverse effects on the environment and on the health of the crew. A 100 million dollar fund pledged by Tokyo to Moscow to help it scrap its obsolete nuclear weapons is expected to be utilized toward the alternative facilities. Russia last dumped 900 tons of low-level radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan on October 17. It suspended a planned second dumping following international protests, particularly from Japan and South Korea.
