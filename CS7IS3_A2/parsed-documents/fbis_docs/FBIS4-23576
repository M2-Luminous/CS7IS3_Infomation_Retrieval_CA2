The official said the SNA's rejection was communicated to the SSA by Ambassador Lansana Kouyate, acting special UN envoy to Somalia, and that the UN Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM] should therefore clarify to the Somali people and the world who is responsible for the conference's delay. The spokesman continued that the SSA members are ready to participate in the conference, as previously agreed, so as to do something about the existing problems in the country. The SSA spokesman also said that a delay in holding the conference could entail a bleak future for the Somali people. However the 12 organizations are not ready be associated with those advocating the delay. The 12 organizations, he said, have always shown their readiness to contribute toward resolving the affairs of Somalia which have been unresolved for four years. In conclusion, the official reiterated how UNOSOM bears responsibility for pinpointing those causing the delay.
