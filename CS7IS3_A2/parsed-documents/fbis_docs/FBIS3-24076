Just a few days remain until the deadline for registration of candidates for deputies. At midnight on 18 February the electoral commission will stop accepting signature lists from coalitions and independent candidates. The statute on elections envisages two methods of candidate nomination in majority-based districts--self-nomination and nomination from a public association. Self-nomination requires the collection of 2,000 signatures in one of 50 districts. Electoral coalitions' task is somewhat easier: They need to submit 35,000 signatures, after which the coalition may field one candidate in each district. It is worth remembering that 38 coalitions have submitted registration applications, of which 34 have been cleared by the city electoral commission to participate in the election campaign. Not all made use of this right--realistically, 24 coalitions have begun signature collection. Although this does not mean that the rest have given up on their plan to place their candidates in the assembly. For instance, the unregistered "Entrepreneurs Forum" intends to field representatives in 15 districts. They will run in the elections as independents. Many candidates included in coalition lists also collect signatures on their own in parallel--as a fallback. And some have managed to get placed on the lists of several coalitions at the same time. We are offering you a brief review of electoral coalitions that have begun signature collection. It is quite difficult to determine the political coloration of many coalitions. Of course, as in Elections-90, both communist and democratic blocs are represented. But this distinction is not as clear-cut today--four years ago it would have been impossible to see a former member of the CPSU oblast committee and a former Democratic Russia cochairman coexist on the same list. For a considerable number of candidates this is not the first election campaign. Many have experience of working in the city soviet, and in the Congresses of Russian and USSR People's Deputies. Many participated in the recent election campaign to the Federal Assembly. Democratic Unity of Petersburg The Democratic Unity of Petersburg [DUP] is the fruit of a pre-election accord of parties, public movements, and organizations of a democratic orientation, many of which are quite well known in the city. The bloc was set up at the beginning of the year by seven founders: the Christian-Democratic Union, the regional branch of Democratic Russia, the Free Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the Memorial human rights society, the Economic Freedom Party, and the Society of Russian Solidarists. The DUP has brought together supporters of proceeding with socioeconomic reforms, and aligns itself with the right-of-center coalition in the State Duma, that is, Russia's Choice, PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], the 12 December Union, and part of Yabloko [Yavlinskiy-Lukin-Boldyrev bloc]. In their platform statements bloc members emphasize support of entrepreneurship. The DUP signature list contains 22 names; altogether, the coalition submitted 43 candidates to the electoral commission. The DUP leaders have succeeded in putting together a team that has an impressive abundance of well-known names of politicians, figures of science and culture, entrepreneurs, and industrialists. At the same time, the bloc's list proved quite diverse. The coalition is headed by A. Belyayev, member of the Federation Council and a former city soviet chairman. Also on the DUP list: N. Arzhannikov, former deputy chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet human rights commission; M. Chulaki, writer and democratic movement activist; the famous jeweler A. Ananov; Baltic Plant Director Oleg Shulyakovskiy; and Igor Soshnikov, SvDPR [Free Democratic Party] cochairman. Entrepreneur Ilya Baskin also is running on the DUP slate. Many DUP candidates have already had the experience of the pilgrimage to power in the recent past. First and foremost 13 former city soviet deputies. Among them are Nikolay Zhuravskiy, former chairman of the commission on housing policy; Andrey Krylov, former chairman of the commission on economic reform; and Aleksey Reshetov, one of the leaders of the Leningrad Oblast farmers' movement. Also on the bloc's list are former all-Russia deputies Nikita and Mikhail Tolstoy. Former high-ranking mayoralty functionaries also vie to return to the levers of city administration: Yelena Drapeko, former chairman of the culture committee, and Vadim Kalinin, chairman of the Port-Bank board of directors, who came to his current job from the post of deputy chairman of the Committee for the Administration of State Property. The Petersburg Branch of the Russian Creative Union of Cultural Workers The Creative Union of Cultural Workers took advantage of its position as nearly the only creative association that has the right to participate in the elections and fielded its own list of candidates. The Creative Union runs first and foremost under the banners of protecting culture and defends the interests of people who work in this sphere. The association sees as one of its main tasks preservation of the city's system of cultural establishments--libraries, houses and palaces of culture, cinema theaters, etc. Most names on the registered list of 11 candidates are heads and functionaries of various cultural, educational, and science establishments, who are not too well known to city residents. Among them are the rector of the Humanities University, Aleksandr Zanesotskiy; the director of Imeni Rerikha School, Sergey Kirpichev; and the director of Imeni Lensoveta House of Culture, Lyudmila Trofimova. The most colorful figure on the list is Aleksandr Ilyin, in the past a circus performer and now a well-known folk-medicine healer. Also nominated together with the Creative Union is Aleksey Kovalev, former deputy of the latest city soviet, who acquired some fame at the end of the 1980's through his actions in protecting architectural landmarks, and then actively fought the mayoralty's comprehensive city planning projects. Independent Association `Business Petersburg' In addition to V. Kharchenko, president of the Union of Associations of Industrial, Construction, Science, Transportation, and Communications Enterprises, the bloc's list includes V. Zanin, general director of the NPO [scientific-industrial association] Signal; I. Konoval, general director of the Plastpolimer AO [joint-stock company]; V. Zhimirov, general director of the Almaz AO; Yu. Trusov, general director of the Ptitseprom AO; and V. Rudenko, director of the clinical center for advanced medical technologies. In the same list are film director V. Bortko and V. Orlov, chairman of the presidium of the Foundation for Aiding Residents of Blockaded Leningrad. (A total of 11 candidates.) "Business Petersburg" leaders point out that the bloc unites people who do not need to be taught--they have a good idea of the mechanism for solving city and sectoral problems. "Business Petersburg" intends to bring up a score of draft laws at the very first session of the City Assembly. The goal is to make it profitable for goods producers to preserve and create jobs; support the population's investment in residential housing construction; increase the role of local taxation; and bring the city's credit and finance system in line with the interests of the population. The bloc also intends to propose a program for setting up enterprises for the production and sale of goods intended for low-income population groups. The Constitutional Democrat Union of St. Petersburg Registered in December 1992. Its ranks are relatively small--about 100 members. They are mainly research associates of academic and other institutions. According to the union's leaders, they try to accept into their organization only those they trust completely. Neither do cadets [constitutional democrats] approve of chasing famous names. In addition to their party leader Aleksandr Kozyrev, the Union nominated Maritime Technical University Professor Aleksandr Fedorov, Agrobusiness Academy instructor Boris Gavrilov, Semen Vaykhanskiy, a leading research associate of the TsNII [central scientific-research institute] of fuel apparatuses; and other members of the science and technology intelligentsia. The Union supports the soonest possible implementation of reforms, reorganization of the judiciary and law enforcement organs, and development of self-rule. Cadets see the main task of the state as ensuring the rights and freedoms of citizens--everything else the citizens will do for themselves. Overall, they consider themselves successors to the cause begun before the October revolution--the cause of building a law-based state. In the event all the candidates from the Constitutional Democrats Unions are elected to the City Assembly, they will vote for changing the existing statute on the structure of organs of power in St. Petersburg. Cadets would like to see the representative body have broader powers and the restoration of balance of the branches.
