During the first three or four days of this year, U.S. President Clinton made his first official visit to Russia since assuming office. It was the second official meeting between the heads of state of the two countries after their April 1993 meeting in Vancouver. Russia has said that the talks at the most recent meeting had "very enriched contents and were most businesslike and substantial" compared with all previous summits. Leaving aside a dozen important documents signed between the two sides, the "Moscow Declaration" signed by the two presidents shows that Clinton presented a new thing during his current trip, that is, he announced that the United States and Russia have entered "a new and mature stage of strategic partnership." Apparently, this new formulation constitutes a big step forward compared with the U.S.-Russian ties which had changed from being opponents during the "Cold War" to the "strategic partners" they declared to be at the Vancouver summit nine months ago. How could the United States and Russia, the long-standing enemies during the "Cold War," cause their recently established ties of "strategic partnership to mature" within the short period of only 9 months and then enter a "new stage"? Is it a diplomatic miracle or merely a political show? Each Side Has Its Own Intentions The Moscow meeting was held at a time when there were various complicated factors in the international situation and the U.S. and Russian domestic situations. Russia's radical reform measures suffered setbacks and the ultranationalist forces were on the rise at home; there was a strong demand in the United States to "be cautious in maintaining relations with Russia"; and turbulence continued in Europe and the disputes over whether East European countries and the former Soviet Union should join NATO were intensifying. These scenes formed the background to the latestt U.S.-Russian summit. Against such a background, the primary consideration for the United States was to clearly state U.S. support for Yeltsin via the summit, to exert an influence on Russia's political situation. The United States has always believed that the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and Russia's reforms aimed at establishing a Western-style "democratic society," are the greatest victories of the "Cold War." However, the unexpected victory of the Russian Communist Party and ultranationalist forces in the 1993 December parliamentary elections, particularly the crazy "remarks" by Zhirinovsky, sent a warning to the U.S. Government. Hence, helping Russia "steadily realize the democratic transition" became an urgent task for the United States to consolidate the "Cold War" victory and ensure the establishment of a new international order. Second, placating Russia through the establishment of the "mature strategic partnership" to win Russia's support and cooperation in handling the regional security and nuclear nonproliferation issues. Although Russia is no longer a superpower following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, its military strength and geopolitical influence cannot be ignored. Moreover, it still exerts a great influence on the countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and it would be unimaginable for the United States to establish a new security structure in Europe without Russia's support. The United States intends to make use of Russia to check the tendency of Western Europe to drift away from the United States so that it can play a leading role in Western Europe and also exert an influence on the whole of Europe, including the countries of the former Soviet Union and East Europe. Through the recent meeting, Russia tried to prove to the United States its irrevocable reform and used promises (that is, not allowing the pace of reform to slow down) in exchange for U.S. economic aid and support for the Yeltsin government. Through the establishment of an "equal" and "strategic partnership," Russia also tried to show the world that "it was a big country like the United States" and that the United States had to admit Russia's "special status" and "leadership" over the countries of the former Soviet Union and East Europe. False Display Exceeds Substantiality During the recent meeting, both sides exchanged views on a wide range of issues including Russia's domestic situation and economic reform, Europe's security system, Ukraine's nuclear problem, and the establishment of mutual trust and comprehensive bilateral cooperation and reached a series of agreements. The two sides also agreed to hold another two meetings between the head of states before the end of the year. To sum up, the following achievements were attained at the recent meeting: First, the "Moscow Declaration" stated that the United States and Russia had "entered a new stage of their mature strategic partnership." The declaration set a high tone for the current U.S.-Russian ties of cooperation. However, whether Clinton and Yeltsin can continue to sing in a high tone depends to a great extent on the future trend in Russia's political situation and whether the changes in its foreign policy can be brought into line with the United States. Viewed from the recent changes in Russia's domestic situation, the future is by no means optimistic. Second, Yeltsin told Clinton that Russia "will continue its reform and not slow the pace" while Clinton reiterated that the United States resolutely supported Russia's "democratic market transformation." Clinton also said that he will fulfill the economic aid promise made after the Vancouver summit and declared that he had urged the U.S. Congress to make a decision on offering Russia $900 million in economic aid by the end of 1995. The United States also agreed to reduce the tariffs on over 4,000 commodities imported from Russia and to "work positively" to remove the trade restrictions and discriminatory trade policy toward the former Soviet Union. However, the United States failed to make new offers on economic aid. As everyone knows, the West has merely paid lip service rather than offering economic aid in the past. Even if the promise on economic aid is honored, it will be inadequate for Russia's ailing economy. As to Yeltsin's promise of not slowing down the pace of reform, it has probably become a rubber check following the dismissal of Gaidar and other "reformers." Third, the two countries decided to stop targeting their missiles against each other or their allies before the end of May this year. This move seems to have dispelled the West's nuclear phobia left over from the former Soviet Union. When there is no mechanism to examine the implementation of this agreement, however, it can only be a symbolic political game. What is more, it is an easy technical job to resume the targeting of these nuclear weapons. Fourth, the United States and Russia jointly compelled Ukraine to sign the Russia-U.S.-Ukraine Agreement on destroying all the nuclear weapons in Ukraine within a prescribed time. This was regarded by Clinton as a "breakthrough" in "strengthening the security and stability of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia and the world as a whole." Western media also believe that this is the only substantial achievement scored in the recent summit. Nevertheless, a demonstration against the agreement was held in Ukraine during the signing of the agreement by the three parties. The Ukrainian parliament ratified the agreement on 3 February but refused to approve the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. As the political situation in Ukraine is unstable and the people have heightened their vigilance against the rising tendency of Russian nationalism, the Ukrainian Government will encounter numerous problems in implementing the three-party agreement. Since the destruction of nuclear weapons is to be completed within 7 years, some experts believe that even if the political troubles are ruled out, the question of Ukraine's nuclear problem is far from being resolved technologically and in terms of funds and timing. Not Yet Mature Despite the achievements attained at the recent meeting and the enhanced ties between the two countries, it is "probably too early" to say that the two countries have entered a "mature new stage of strategic partnership." According to the general understanding, a "mature strategic partnership" refers, at the very least, to ties of mutual trust, equality, and comprehensive cooperation. Viewed from the current situation, however, the United States cannot rest assured of the development of Russia's domestic situation. Not long after Clinton met with and extended his regards to Gaidar while in Russia, Gaidar and Feyaodorov, who were regarded as "symbols of reform," left the government. The U.S. media believe that this is a sign of a slowdown in Russia's economic reform. After the meeting, some American experts insisted that the rise in Russia's nationalism and the forces of the former Communist Party constitute a component part of Russia's political reality. Russia's internal and external policies will undoubtedly be conditioned and influenced by these forces. The uncertain factor in Russia's policies toward the West will increase and trouble might crop up in U.S-Russian ties. Because of Russia's unstable internal and external policies, some experts of the U.S. Heritage Foundation and Carnegie Endownment for International Peace believe that U.S.-Russian "cooperation will reduce" and "the prospects are dreadful." Regarding Russia, it also strongly distrusts the United States. Even Foreign Minister Kozyrev, who is regarded as pro-Western, expressed the following view: No Western power has truly shown concern for Russia's revitalization. Such a mentality of the two sides not trusting each other is bound to affect the "strategic partnership" between the two countries. Second, U.S. policy toward Russia is immature. During Clinton's stay in Russia, the United States indicated that there should be more "treatment" and less "shock" in Russia's reform. When there were indications of a readjustment of the economic reform policies introduced by the new Russian Government not long after the meeting, the call within the United States urging Russia not to slow down the pace of economic reform immediately took the upper hand. Newly appointed deputy secretary of state Talbot, who was ambassador-at- large to the former Soviet Union, has openly said that if Russia slows down its economic reform, "the date for it to receive the $1.5 billion loan from the IMF will continue to be postponed." The U.S. Congress also criticized Clinton once again for putting all his stake on Yeltsin. Thus, it can be seen that U.S. policy toward Russia can mature only after a period of exploration. Third, U.S.-Russia cooperation on international issues is limited. During the recent meeting, although Yeltsin expressed support for NATO's establishment of a "peaceful partnership" with Eastern Europe, he also said that it was one of the options for building a new Europe. In fact, Russia still keeps a wary eye on the U.S. eastward strategy. Regarding the region covered by the former Soviet Union, Clinton stressed at the meeting that the "independence gained by Russia's neighbors must be respected" and hoped that "Russia could totally withdraw its troops from the three Baltic states this year." Yeltsin once again indicated that Russia assumed a "special status" and "leadership" over the region of the former Soviet Union. The tunes by the two leaders were not in harmony. In his State of the Union Message on 25 January, Clinton pointed out that action by the Russian troops in the neighboring countries should be taken only in light of the agreements reached with the parties concerned and based on international rules. Apparently, the purpose was to check Russia's "re-expansion" in the former Soviet Union. On the second day after Clinton's remarks, Zhatulin, chairman of Russia's CIS Affairs and Overseas Russian Liaison Committee, told the press: "Everyone knows that these nations (countries of the former Soviet Union) are within Russia's sphere of influence." On other international issues involving their vital interests, the two countries will not easily make concessions for the sake of the so-called "strategic partnership." In a word, the strategic interests of the two countries and their geopolitical positions determines their so-called "global strategic ties of cooperation" can only be established on the basis of bargaining and maintaining the interests of each side. Being opponents as well as partners, rivalry as well as cooperation will continue as the main line of U.S.-Russian ties for some time to come.
