He pointed out that "today no state can defend itself on its own." Radetskyy's news conference was devoted to the results of his visit to NATO headquarters from May 25 to 27. During his visit, Radetskyy submitted a presentation document on Ukraine joining the Partnership for Peace program to NATO. Ukraine joined the program in February 1994 when Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko signed a framework agreement with NATO. Commenting on the situation in Crimea, Radetskyy said that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry had "sent not a single soldier to Crimea recently." He said that the bulk of military hardware which had been delivered in the recent past to Crimea belonged to the Black Sea Fleet. Radetskyy criticized Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov's personnel policy, saying that 80 percent of his surroundings were former Ukrainian servicemen citing as an example Interior Minister Valeriy Kuznetsov and Security Service Chairman Vladimir Lepikhov. Radetskyy declined to comment on Ukraine's position at the talks on dividing up the Black Sea Fleet infrastructure, saying these complicated issues were being discussed by Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Sevastopol. At the same time, he pointed out that the division of vessels had been completed. According to Radetskyy, the Russian part of the Black Sea Fleet will be stationed on the Ukrainian territory as fleet of a foreign state.
