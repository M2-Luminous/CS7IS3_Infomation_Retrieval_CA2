FBIS4-23481 "drafr109_d_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-109 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique Foreigners Registering in Manica Foreigners Registering in Manica MB0606153194 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1030 GMT 6 Jun 94 MB0606153194 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network Portuguese BFN [Text] The National Democratic Party, Panade, has accused the Manica Province government of allowing foreigners to register for the elections and then vote for the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo]. Cardoso Saide, Panade's deputy national coordinator, says foreigners are being brought from neighboring countries for registration in Mossurize, Manica, and Barue Districts. In a communique sent to our Chimoio correspondent, Saide said before the registration began, Mossurize District had about 31,000 inhabitants, but now the figure has risen to 98,000, most of them having come from Zimbabwe. Panade urged all unarmed political parties, UN Operations in Mozambique observers, and monitoring and registration teams to be vigilant and report cases of that nature, as these are likely to create serious problems during the October elections. Saide said this is yet another delaying tactic by the Frelimo government to prevent the upcoming multiparty general elections from being free and fair. It has not been possible to get comment from acting Manica Provincial Governor Carlos Falcao and Henrique Munguambe, chairman of the provincial National Elections Commission.
