They must commit themselves to de-escalation and they must understand that the negotiating process remains constantly open. They must therefore stop their attacks, their shelling, their killing. Once more, everyone must sit around the negotiating table. [Unidentified correspondent] Do you agree with Prime Minister Balladur, who said yesterday evening that what is now happening in Gorazde is shameful? [Juppe] Obviously. This is why we have fully committed ourselves to obtain an end to all this. I remind you that the UN Security Council resolution is a French initiative which was passed by a unanimous vote, including the Americans and the Russians. We later supported the idea of a more robust commitment by the Atlantic Alliance. The proposal for a summit between the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations is a French idea put forward by the president of the Republic and the government several day ago. I hope that we will also move forward in that direction. [end recording] [passage omitted]
