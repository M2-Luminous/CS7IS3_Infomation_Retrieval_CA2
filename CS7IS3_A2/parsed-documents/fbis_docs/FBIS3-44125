Article 15 of the Electoral Law states that the National Elections Commission will be made up of people whose professional and personal attributes will guarantee a balanced approach, objectivity, and independence in relation to all political parties. The Radio Mozambique news desk has received a communique saying that, by appointing professed Frelimo and Renamo members to the National Elections Commission, the two former warring sides have created a precedent that may result in future violations of the Electoral Law. That document also says that such behavior creates the possibility and conditions for disagreements that could have unforeseeable consequences because it will hinder consensus within the National Elections Commission. The unarmed opposition political parties further note that the government and Renamo are only worried about defending their parties' interests, thereby ensuring that there will not be honesty in the upcoming electoral process. The communique issued by the unarmed opposition political parties also says that Renamo has shown unprecedented opportunism and a lack of democratic spirit by grabbing the 13 seats in the Central Electoral Administration Technical Secretariat which had been reserved for all opposition parties. According to the unarmed opposition, by resorting to such behavior Renamo has tried to show that it heads the opposition, while making it clear that its much vaunted interest in democracy amounts to no more than a farce. The unarmed opposition has also called on the Mozambican Government and Renamo to reconsider their stands and to abide by the Electoral Law. The unarmed opposition political parties met in Maputo yesterday to assess what they describe as the impact of partisanship in the National Elections Commission and to discuss the composition of the Elections Administration Technical Secretariat, STAE.
