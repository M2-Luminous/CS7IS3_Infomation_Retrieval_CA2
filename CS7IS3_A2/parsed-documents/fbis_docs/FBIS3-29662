Why do you think North Korea changed its attitude and decided to allow nuclear inspections right before plans to refer it to the UN Security Council? [Hong Sun-yong] There are various opinions regarding North Korea's intentions. I would like to assess positively [kungjongjoguro pyongga] North Korea's intentions. In my opinion, North Korea did not allow nuclear inspections for many reasons, but it finally recognized the fact that it could not avoid isolation as an outlaw by the international community if it continued to refuse international inspections. [passage omitted] [Hwang] The government has insisted on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue in a peaceful way through dialogue. Is there any special reason for the government to carry on with this strategy? [Hong] Our emphasis on a policy of dialogue was based on the possibility of sanctions by the international community. We have pursued a carrot-and-stick policy, and the carrot side has just borne fruit. [Hwang] In any case, has the government stressed the dialogue policy because it realized the possibility of changes in North Korea's attitude through a secret South-North dialogue channel? [Hong] There is no secret dialogue channel. Under the current situation, in which South and North Korea mistrust each other, it is highly possible that communication through any secret channel will just amplify the mutual misunderstanding. [passage omitted] [Hwang] Some people criticize that the United States assumed a leadership role in the nuclear negotiations while we, a party directly concerned, played a supporting role. What is your opinion? [Hong] The suspicion about North Korea's nuclear development is an important matter that not only directly relates to peace and security of the Korean peninsula, but also is considered a challenge to the international order based on the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Therefore, the United States stepped forward and played an important role. We should admit the U.S. role. [passage omitted] [Hwang] The ROK and the United States said they would suspend the Team Spirit exercise this year if North Korea allows nuclear inspections. When will they announce the suspension of the exercise? [Hong] They will express their willingness for a conditional suspension when the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team enters North Korea, and will make a final decision when the IAEA inspection is successfully conducted and when progress is made in South-North dialogue. [passage omitted] [Hwang] What are the prospects for South-North dialogue, which is likely to be resumed in the near future? [Hong] As North Korea agreed to make meaningful progress in South-North dialogue before the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks, South and North Korea will hold working-level contacts, which were severed October 1993. The government position is that the South-North envoy exchange is another precondition for the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. [passage omitted] [Hwang] People are concerned about the fact that North Korea has adhered only to dialogue with the United States, while it has just formally acceded to South-North dialogue. [Hong] North Korea's attitude is unpredictable. It is not probable, however, that the United States trusts North Korea and will promote improvement of relations under the situation, in which South Korea does not trust North Korea. The shortest way to Washington is through Seoul. [passage omitted] [Hwang] There is a view that the refusal of strong countries to allow developing countries to possess nuclear weapons is wrong. [Hong] In my opinion, it is more important now to increase nuclear transparency. It is undesirable to attempt to have nuclear reprocessing facilities to achieve peace and security on the Korean peninsula. In the present situation, nuclear reprocessing facilities are not economical. [passage omitted] [Hwang] What is your opinion on the possibility of holding South-North summit talks? [Hong] Building mutual confidence between South and North Korea by accepting the principle of peaceful coexistence first is more important than arguing when to hold the summit talks. [Hwang] It is reasonable to hold the summit when conditions are met. Is it possible, however, that the top leaders of South and North Korea will meet first to reach some important agreements, which can be implemented on a working level? [Hong] That is theoretically possible. It would be nothing but a temporary unity [ponghap] or a compromise [tahyop] for the top leaders, who have different senses of value and systems, to hold talks. From a long-term viewpoint, it would not be of much help for the reunification of the country. [passage omitted]
