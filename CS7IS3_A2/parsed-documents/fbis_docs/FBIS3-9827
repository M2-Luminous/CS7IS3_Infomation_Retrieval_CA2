Cz: "Will the SLD Leave the Coalition?"] [Text] If this were a normal Sejm, in which it were clear what one can expect from which party and it were clear that all sides would stick to their agreements, the ruling coalition would not exist today. This is claimed by certain members of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. An agreement between the Democratic Union [UD] and the Union of Labor [UP] would have been enough to push through the vote of no-confidence in the government and establish a cabinet supported by the Sejm and independent from the president. If the SLD were not able to reach such an agreement, the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] would do that because both partners are beginning to consider the coalition uncomfortable. Meanwhile, as unofficial reports indicate, the leftists and the peasants have independently examined the possibility of taking such a step in the Sejm, in both cases without any results. Doomed to Themselves The difficulty to receive the prime minister's acceptance regarding personnel decisions put forward by the SLD, as well as the suspicions that cooperation is blocked with the quiet consent of the president, were not the only reasons behind the hitherto discrepancies inside the coalition. These conflicts, however, have been the most visible to the public. Left-wing politicians begin to more and more loudly accuse the peasants of lacking competence, which is predominantly described as a lack of vision of how the state should function--in both the administrative and the economic spheres. The draft decree on the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], which has been submitted for consultations among the coalition members and certain voivodship leaders, is supposed to testify to the first accusation. The first opinions, which are not without resentments, are that the draft, which has been presented by Minister Strak, contains only two concrete proposals: First, the prime minister is the most important person in the government, and second, the URM chief is next, after the prime minister. As critics of the draft unofficially claim, numerous articles of the draft have nothing in common with the reform of the central administration. The weakness of the PSL's intellectual potential and the small number of economic experts working for it are supposed to be proof of their lack of economic vision. The left wing is therefore convinced that the PSL will not break the coalition without support from a party that has a concrete economic program and people who could implement it. Only the Opposition It is also very unlikely that the SLD will decide to suspend the coalition. Numerous concessions to the PSL indicate that the left wing wants to remain in power, and it is able to swallow a lot to achieve this. The only thing that could make it leave the coalition would be clear and demonstrative disloyalty of the prime minister. Waldemar Pawlak, as the conflict over Dariusz Rosatti shows, will not run this risk, however. Political alignment determines whether the SLD's place today is in the government with the PSL or in the opposition. Being in the government, the SLD becomes a client of the PSL, if it wants to implement its program. If the SLD ended up in the opposition, both sides would have to switch their roles. It would be Pawlak who would have to exert himself to win over the friendship of Kwasniewski and his club. Apparently, the left wing is beginning to use this scarecrow more and more often. The SLD politicians, however, still believe that the conflict with the president will finally convince both leaders, particularly the prime minister, that they will manage to survive the long-dreamed-of four years in the Sejm only in close cooperation. If the coalition manages to jointly overcome the political crisis, for which the SLD is striving, the left wing will probably further chill its relations with the president. Given the current majority in the Sejm, we actually do not need the president, reminds one of the SLD leaders. He also announces that the coalition can minimize the president's ability to make political decisions before the next elections. They Will Stay Because They Have No Choice Jan Rokita (UD), who indicates that he is not convinced "it is a good thing in politics to answer the question of what your political opponents are going to do," does not believe that the coalition will split in the near future. Arguments in favor of preserving the coalition are stronger than the controversy over the program, which is currently dividing and will continue to divide it. The PSL and the SLD are primarily divided over redistribution of the GDP--whether it should be used to stabilize the agricultural sector or to fulfill the SLD's election promises to the budget sector. I am convinced, however, that the willpower in both the PSL and the SLD is still strong enough to patch this discrepancy for a long time. I do not believe that the SLD leadership can allow itself to leave the coalition because this would mean that thousands of people who are associated with the communist apparatus would lose the chance to regain their position, which was endangered during the past four years. They would probably not forgive Kwasniewski for the rest of his life. It is hard for Jaroslaw Kaczynski (Center Accord) to predict how the SLD will react--it can leave Pawlak alone, not overthrowing him but leaving him with certain responsibilities. Another two schemes can also prevail--opportunism and waiting for the presidential elections and adoption of a new constitution, meaning a situation favorable for the SLD. The decision of the SLD can also be affected by other factors. I know nothing about the mood inside the SLD. Is it true that Oleksy is against Kwasniewski and that Kwasniewski feels beset by others? Kwasniewski must also reckon with the "retro" apparatus, which does not want to be in the opposition. The humiliation of the SLD by the prime minister and the president, in the opinion of Kaczynski, is a result of an error committed by the SLD at the beginning. While forming the government, Kwasniewski should have stated: Either we get the office of prime minister or a ministry, or we do not join the government. The SLD will definitely not leave the coalition, Wieslawa Ziolkowska (UP) insists. It will feel the pressure of "the responsibility for the fate of our country." The SLD will not leave the coalition because it does not have any political interest in doing this, Janusz Piechocinski (PSL) claims. The coalition has not yet begun to implement its program. It would therefore be hard for them to explain that they did not manage to do anything in this situation. I do not expect any significant political movements in the political arena before the local elections or even before next fall. If such tensions between the president and the government recur, however, the SLD may leave the coalition and support a minority government of Pawlak and the Belweder. In such a case, however, Pawlak would have to find time and understanding for Kwasniewski's opinions.
