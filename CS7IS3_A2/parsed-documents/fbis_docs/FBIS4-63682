This was said by Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius after his visit to France. According to him, his meetings with the French president, the head of the government, some members of the Cabinet of Ministers, and representatives of influential financial and trading companies, demonstrated there was a great interest in Lithuania and in the possibilities of political and economic cooperation. This cooperation, claims Adolfas Slezevicius, should become concrete now. As is known, the Lithuanian delegation led by Adolfas Slezevicius paid a working visit to Paris on 17-21 May. The Lithuanian prime minister mentioned the European stability pact as one of the most important facts of political support. Adolfas Slezevicius has an especially favorable opinion about the initiative by the French prime minister to hold regional round tables where it will be possible to discuss at the level of European state leaders and experts, for example, relations between the Baltic states and Russia. This will divert our dialogue with Russia in a completely different direction, claims Adolfas Slezevicius. It is especially important to Lithuania in the sense of economic cooperation to attract as much French capital as possible to Lithuania. Some conditions are essential for this purpose, for instance, the protection of and guarantees to investments, insurance, the abolition of double taxation, etc. According to Adolfas Slezevicius, expert missions from French insurance companies, the Central Bank, the Finance Ministry, and the electronic industry, will soon be coming to Lithuania. Concrete projects in which French companies could take part will be discussed. Technical assistance is possible in the administration of taxes and in financial payments.
