FR940405-2-00024 FR940405-2-00011 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Office of the Secretary Technology Reinvestment Project; 1994 Planned Solicitations AGENCY: Department of Defense, Advanced Research Projects Agency. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP) is a six-agency effort that includes the Departments of Defense, Commerce, Energy and Transportation, the National Science Foundation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It was formed to execute eight statutory programs enacted by Congress in the Defense Technology Conversion, Reinvestment, and Transition Act of 1992. These eight programs have common requirements, including participation by ``partnerships,'' cost sharing between those partnerships and the Federal Government, and a focus on assisting small businesses and defense-dependent businesses. It is the continuing mission of the TRP to stimulate the transition to a growing, integrated, national industrial capability which provides the most advanced, affordable, military systems and the most competitive commercial products. TRP programs are structured to expand opportunities in commercial and dual-use United States industries and demonstrably enhance U.S. competitiveness. This announces two planned solicitations in FY 1994 under the TRP. The first solicitation will be for a focused competition seeking proposals in a specific set of tightly defined technology areas. This solicitation will be announced in the Commerce Business Daily on or about 4 April 1994. The second solicitation will cover a broader range of technology areas. The second solicitation will be announced in the Commerce Business Daily sometime this summer.
