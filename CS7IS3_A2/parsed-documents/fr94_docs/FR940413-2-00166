FR940413-2-00166 FR940413-2-00075 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [Docket No. 94&hyph;26; Notice 01] AM General Corp.; Receipt of Petition For Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance AM General Corporation of Livonia, Michigan has determined that some of its vehicles fail to comply with Paragraph S5.3.1.1 of 49 CFR 571.108, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, ``Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment,'' and has filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573. AM General has also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq. ) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This notice of receipt of a petition is published under section 157 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgment concerning the merits of the petition. Paragraph S5.3.1.1 of Standard No. 108 states in part that ``*␣*␣* no part of the vehicle shall prevent *␣*␣* any other lamp from meeting the photometric output at any test point specified in any applicable SAE Standard or Recommended Practice.'' AM General determined that certain of its 1992&hyph;1994 HUMMER vehicles do not meet the requirements of Paragraph S5.3.1.1 in Standard No. 108. The HUMMER is a truck. Its gross vehicle weight rating is 10,300 pounds. The noncompliant vehicles were built from July 1992 through February 1994, and are those models equipped with an optional rear-mounted, swingaway carrier for a full-size spare tire. AM General stated that the HUMMER is required to be equipped with identification lamps at the rear of the vehicle, since the width of the HUMMER exceeds 80 inches. The HUMMER has three identification lamps (left-side, center, and right-side) mounted on a horizontal bar just above the rear bumper. The noncompliance is that the optional spare tire and its carrier, supported by the rear bumper, obstruct some visibility of each of the three identification lamps. On 578 vehicles, built from July 1992 through January 1994, a photometric noncompliance exists at the 10U 45R test point on the right lamp, and the 10U 45L test point on the left and center lamps. AM General explained that its solution for this problem was to lower the lamps by 0.75 inch. However, ``[s]ubsequent to implementing this revision, it was discovered that a small hex screw head (1/4 x 5/8) on the spare tire carrier now obstructed the [V 10]D test point on the center lamp with the lamp in the revised lower position.'' The vehicles involved in this second noncompliance were built in February 1994. The actual number of vehicles is not known at this time. AM General stated it believes the first noncompliance among the 578 vehicles is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and offered the following rationale: The obscuration of the lamps by the wheel/tire assembly affects only a 10 U45 test point for each lamp *␣*␣*. [T]his typically reduces the visibility angle from 10 ○ to about 7 ○. At a following distance of 12 feet in an adjacent lane, this reduces the effective visibility point by less than 8 [inches] *␣*␣*. The obscuration occurs only in close proximity to the vehicle. Since an identification lamp is a steady-burning market lamp, not a signaling lamp, its function is most important as a vehicle approaches from the rear. For approaching vehicles in which the operator's seating position is high above the ground, such as a bus or a heavy truck, the lamp would be fully visible to the operator until the operator was about 25 [feet] behind. For conventional passenger cars, the lamp will remain visible until the operator is 12&hyph;15 [feet] behind. (This assumes a go/no go visibility situation. In reality the lower portion of the lamp lens will still be visible at these distances, although the photometric output is reduced). The rear surface of the HUMMER is already highly␣␣ decorated␣ with␣ multiple␣␣ marker lamps *␣*␣*. In addition to the partially obstructed identification lamp(s), at least one identification lamp is always visible from either side. A clearance lamp is supplied on the rear of each fender, as well as two taillamps *␣*␣*. With so much prominent lighting on the rear of the vehicle we believe that the loss of visibility of a portion of each lamp in only a very small visibility regime represents no hazard to motor vehicle safety. Any following vehicle in an adjacent lane will have more than sufficient indication of the size and presence of the vehicle. AM General also stated it believes the second noncompliance among the vehicles built in February 1994 is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and offered the following rationale: The obscuration of the lamp affects only the V [10]D test point. As described above, the HUMMER is already amply equipped with rear marker lamps, and any following vehicle will have more than adequate notice of the presence of the vehicle. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the petition of AM General, described above. Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that six copies be submitted. All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated below will be considered. The application and supporting materials, and all comments received after the closing date will also be filed and will be considered to the extent possible. When the petition is granted or denied, the notice will be published in the Federal Register pursuant to the authority indicated below. Comment closing date: May 13, 1994. (15 U.S.C. 1417; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 49 CFR 501.8) Issued on: April 7, 1994. Barry Felrice, Associate Administrator for Rulemaking.
