Reportedly Prime Minister Hosokawa has recently placed more priority on Ozawa than Takemura. "I received a necktie from Liberal DEmocratic Party [LDP] LDP Secretary General Mori." "Even Mr. Gotoda agreed with my idea." Recently, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura has been going out of his way to emphasize his substantial ties with the LDP. It is as if he is saying that he will establish an agreement with the LDP concerning passage of the political reform bill. Scathing Comments Made About Ozawa Off the Record "Oh! This is an off-the-record comment. Don't make a record of it." Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, 59, habitually smiles wryly and he licks his somewhat thick lips in making this statement. It is the political reporter's role to pump for confidential information when he hears such off-the-record conversations and notes incipient friction emanating in the Hosokawa government. Recently, holding informal discussions with Takemura has become popular among political reporters. That trend is not based solely on the fact that he has a lot of information because of his position as the chief cabinet secretary. The reason is that they can hear Takemura's sensitive comments about Shinseito President Ichiro Ozawa, 51, who is the second major functionary in sustaining the coalition party and whose political beliefs and methods differ from those of Takemura. Takemura versus Ozawa. The rivalry between the two was well known when the current government came into being. However, as deliberations on the political reform bills reach a critical period, differences in the objectives of the two have become more obvious. Both tread on common ground in aiming for passage of the reform bills with the support of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's intense popularity, but they differ widely about the design of the second political restructuring. The chief cabinet secretary wants to establish ties with a reformed LDP and part ways with Shinseito. On the other hand, the leading personality of the ruling party would like to gain the support of those sympathetic to his cause and eliminate Takemura--with whom he is incompatible--and his group from the coalition. These two who hold the key to passage of the bills are waging a "desperate battle" about negotiations with the LDP in the face of the pending Diet vote on the bills. This is why interviews with Takemura, who has a tendency to be verbose, is so popular. In any event, allow me to introduce a number of Takemura statements based on the evaluation of political editors of national newspapers who say, "interviews with Takemura are richer in information than the regular press conferences held by the Prime Minister's Official Residence." The first quote concerns the research group arranged by former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi which became a topic of conversation as having resulted in the establishment of ties between Ozawa and former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe. (27 September) "Even Hiroyuki Sonoda and Shusei Tanaka of our Sakigake were invited to join the research group. No way will they join. However, `Chinnen' Yamaguchi occasionally joins some of the key individuals and does some astounding things. He has even visited the Prime Minister's Official Residence. Mr. Hosokawa doesn't particularly like `Chinnen,' but the latter has critical information. That's because someone is manipulating him in the background." There's no need to mention that "someone...in the background" is Ozawa and it seems that Ozawa's temerity in unhesitatingly attempting to recruit officials from Sakigake displeased Takemura. Even so, this particular quote can be regarded as a light diversionary statement, though in the form of a sharp off-the-record remark. (4 October) When one reporter asked, "In Russia, is Yeltsin of greater value than the congress?" Takemura replied, "Your question is akin to asking, `Is Mr. Ozawa of greater value than Mr. Seiroku Kajiyama, former LDP secretary general. Are you going to make a memo of my statement? If so, please write, `I pray for the earliest possible return of Mr. Ozawa.'" At the time, the comment was made in view of the fact that Ozawa was taking convalescent leave. Although supposedly an off-the-record comment, the reporter makes a memorandum of the statement and turns it in to the newspaper company. The contents of the memorandum are conveyed to Ozawa via reporters in charge of covering Shinseito. It can be considered a shrewd statement made by Takemura knowing that it would reach Ozawa's ears through this particular circuit. And, concerning the rice tariff issue, Takemura once made a very suggestive statement that Ozawa went over the head of government officials in concluding a secret agreement with the United States. (14 October) "Before he left Washington, Agriculture Secretary Espy who visited Japan on the 10th, made a statement saying, "Noteworthy progress has been made." I wonder who did the negotiating. Were there any key personnel who made a trip to the United States at this stage? I wonder who went..." In the latter part of September, Ozawa was making a trip through Europe. That statement was skillfully used to refer to rumors that Ozawa had made a secret side trip to the United States. On the other hand, Takemura indirectly points out Ozawa's lack of popularity by saying, (18 October) "The discussions were very lively today at the government's ruling party summit conference, because Ozawa was absent." And adds, (18 October) "Mr. Ozawa's draft law to revise the Diet goes too far. The mass media should provide greater coverage of the proposed revisions and issue cautionary comments." Such statements represent frontal attacks on Ozawa and are only a couple of such statements made in rapid succession to the effect that Takemura does not wish to share the same destiny with Ozawa. Fresh in the minds of the public is the episode when Ozawa denied a request for interviews by two newspapers and Takemura publicly criticized Ozawa with the comment, "Politicians are public figures. They should aggressively seek out involvement with reporters." One wonders why Takemura dislikes and uses diversionary tactics so extensively in reference to Ozawa. One reason is the sudden intimacy between Ozawa and Hosokawa. Ozawa and Hosokawa became closer by the day as the political reform bill neared passage. Because of that situation, rumors have it that Takemura who was said to have honeymoon-like relationships with Hosokawa from before establishment of the current government is no longer an insider. According to sources at the Prime Minister's Residence, Ozawa and the prime minister are holding frequent secret sessions using the Prime Minister's Residence and hotels in Tokyo. They are being held at the pace of more than once a week. Telephone calls are being made more frequently at the rate of two calls a day." Ozawa Confidant Says, "Takemura Is a Scoundrel" Now, the question is, why is Ozawa suddenly approaching Hosokawa and why is Takemura being avoided? Influencing the situation is the decisive difference in the blueprints envisioned by the two individuals concerning a second political restructuring. According to a source close to the prime minister, Takemura's strategy goes this way. "Takemura visualizes elimination of the bloc consisting of Shinseito and Komeito and reorganization of the government using former Deputy Prime Minister Masaharu Gotoda, LDP reformists, and the Japan New Party. Takemura's move is highly disadvantageous to Ozawa because of the strong anti-Ozawa sentiment in the LDP. This is why Ozawa is suddenly approaching Hosokawa and assuming a strategy to separate the latter from Takemura." Takemura is a liberal in a political sense. He cannot agree at all with Ozawa who advocates constitutional revision and aims at making Japan a political power. He wants to avoid Ozawa's approach and tie up with LDP reformists with whom he enjoys commonality in terms of constitutional and national principles. According to sources at Shinseito, "Takemura has been making frequent contact with Gotoda at hotels in Tokyo and over the telephone, as well as contacting Masasuke Kitamura who rapidly gained prominence among young LDP reformists. Concurrent with such contacts, Gotoda is continuing talks with LDP President Yohei Kono on political reform, forming a Takemura-Gotoda-Kono lineup. The confrontation between Ozawa and Takemura has come to a stage where it is no longer reversible." If Takemura has written off Ozawa, the same is true in reverse with Ozawa. Based on past episodes, he has already decided, "I can no longer deal with Takemura." The strategy envisioned by Ozawa calls for a split in the LDP, disposal of the left wing of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake, unification of the Japan New Party, Komeito, and Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and a quick reorganization. According to earlier quoted sources at Shinseito, "The plotting goes on unmistakably. One form it is taking is the contacts with the prime minister and plotting with the LDP is being conducted confidentially. The first targeted group is Michio Watanabe and his group. Ozawa has held confidential talks with Watanabe himself on at least two occasions. Serving as intermediary was Mutsuki Kato. Ozawa can expect 30 followers in the Watanabe group. He has also contacted the Komoto faction and has met directly with Komoto at the end of August. Ozawa reportedly said, `I won't ask you to join Shinseito, but when the next political restructuring takes place, I would like to work with Kaifu and other reformists.' It seems Ozawa said that in return he would take care of Saburo Komoto, Komoto's son, when he decides to change over to the House of Representatives. Up to mid-September, Ozawa has also met twice with Kaifu." In addition to such movements, Ozawa is also circulating information that is unfavorable to Takemura. Recently, sources close to Ozawa are constantly leaking such statements as, "Takemura is a scoundrel. His goal is to destroy the Hosokawa government. He's plotting for a change in government by preventing passage of the political reform bills by yearend and splitting the LDP. He's stating that he will push Gotoda to lead the next government, but it is already known that Gotoda will not accept. His intentions are to assume leadership of the new government at that point." Newspapers and other mass media are now saying that the situation is developing so as to favor Ozawa, in view of the foregoing circumstances. However, that is no more than a superficial observation. The basis for that conclusion is that, "Ozawa's only ace in the hole is Hosokawa." Sources at Sakigake comment, "If the coalition government should fail, the party most adversely affected would be Shinseito. Sakigake, the Japan New Party, the DSP, and the SDPJ could align themselves with the LDP which has acquired a clean image because of President Kono, but as long as Ozawa is around, the LDP and Shinseito could never join forces. Ozawa has no choice but to continue supporting Hosokawa as a leader." There are many aspects to the situation which are a disadvantage to Ozawa. Kajiyama, who once waged an "internecine war" and is now a natural enemy of Ozawa, has begun to move actively. He frequently contacts SDPJ Committee Chairman Tomiichi Murayama with whom Kajiyama has been on close terms since he was chairman of the Diet Affairs Committee. Even Murayama has publicly stated, "The SDPJ can win 100 seats at the end of the year if the midsized electoral district system is retained." There is a strong possibility that Murayama will join Kajiyama in a movement to defeat the political reform bills. LDP and SDPJ goals are in agreement. If the LDP and SDPJ join to defeat the reform bill, Hosokawa will definitely move to dissolve the cabinet and call for a general election. If that should become the case, it would clearly be disadvantageous for Ozawa who is using the strategy of preserving the Hosokawa government as long as possible and conducting an election only after decimating the LDP's support structure. Making Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishihara an Ally That is the very reason why Ozawa is desperately pushing passage of the bill and plotting a split in the LDP, but aside from such adverse movements, Ozawa has another weak point. We are speaking of his relations with Komeito with whom he is said to be very close. Members of the LDP are very sensitive about the Soka Gakkai, which is Komeito's support organization, and have intensified their attack on unity of church and state ever since Komeito became a part of the coalition government. According to LDP sources, "However, since Ozawa will have no choice but to join hands with Komeito as a matter of strategy, those attacks will have a severe adverse impact. The presence of members within Shinseito who are sensitive to the Soka Gakkai renders Komeito a double-edged sword for Ozawa." On the other hand, developments such as failure of the reform bills to pass and dissolution and general elections won't have much of an adverse impact on Takemura. The earlier quoted sources at Sakigake comment, "Takemura has the added advantage of the option of joining with the LDP. Takemura also anticipates dissolution." Diet member Seiichi Ota has publicly stated that he cannot join Ozawa but could do so with Takemura. Ota remarks, "The only reason the present coalition parties are maintaining a semblance of balance is because of the presence of Takemura. We need to give him positive recognition for this fact. If Takemura did not exist, Ozawa's Shinseito and Ichikawa's Komeito would join forces to control the current government. The only reason why the two are not able to take such action is because of Mr. Takemura's lone struggle. The liberal faction of the LDP is ready to form an alliance at any time with Takemura who opposes the Ozawa-Ichikawa bloc." Further, the real chief of staff within the Prime Minister's Official Residence, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara in charge of administration, was senior to Takemura in the Ministry of Home Affairs. In the past, Ishihara is said to have favored Ozawa, but with Takemura's appointment to a position in the Prime Minister's Official Residence, he is said to have altered his stance. Even on the issue of imposing tariffs on rice, Ishihara has joined hands with Takemura in negotiating with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. After reviewing the situation as covered thus far in this article, one comes to the conclusion that there is more flexibility in Takemura's strategy calling for support for Hosokawa until the very end, while maintaining liaison with liberal factions of the LDP such as Gotoda and Kono so that he can join hands with them if the need arises. Diet man Susumu Yanase has said, "Mr. Takemura is a politician with sound judgment. Mention is made that he clashes often with Mr. Ozawa, but if he thinks clashing would be to his advantage, he will do so in the manner of a stage show. He does not clash with others with any serious motivations." It appears Yanase is saying that Takemura skillfully conceals his true intent while steadily working for points. Another Sakigake official remarks, "The current government was established, to begin with, because of the close relationship between Takemura and Hosokawa. Although Hosokawa appears very easy-going, he is very shrewd in dealing with Takemura and Ozawa and sustaining the current government. He will probably allow Ozawa to conduct himself as he wishes until he wins passage of the political reform bills. However, the important point is that Mr. Hosokawa and Ozawa are of two different types. In the end, there will be a Hosokawa-Takemura team and Ozawa will be discarded. Takemura exercises confidence in this respect." Takemura had dinner with Hosokawa in the evening of 22 October. He licked his lips as he said, "We talked about many subjects. We even talked about Ichiro Ozawa. After all, the situation is such that we couldn't avoid the topic." Even if there is a change in government, there will be no change in efforts to determine the intentions of opposing parties or in Machiavellianism. In order to realize Prime Minister Hosokawa's public pledge to "implement political reform by the end of the year," it will be essential to gain passage of the bill in the House of Representatives by the middle of November. As confusion in the political situation deepens, the question is, who will have the last laugh--Takemura or Ozawa? It appears the main battle of the cold war concerning political restructuring is yet to be fought.
