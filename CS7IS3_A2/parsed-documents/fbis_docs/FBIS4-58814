Rabin said the Russians have realized that if they wish to influence the peace process, they cannot hold biased views. "Having understood that, the Russians decided to adopt a balanced policy, which allows them to influence events," the prime minister said. The prime minister said that Japanese-Israeli relations have known difficulties, and although a favorable change has taken place over the past few years, there is room for continuing improvement. He stressed the importance of increased Japanese investment in Israel, which cannot be only a market for Japanese products. "U.S.-based multinational companies, such as Motorola, Digital, and IBM, have invested in Israel," Rabin noted. The prime minister stressed Israel's commitment to the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord, explaining that at the PLO's request, the withdrawal from Gaza will take longer than anticipated. He asked Japan to increase its involvement in the peace process, mainly by exploiting its ties in the Arab world. The prime minister asked his guest to raise the issue of the Israeli MIA's and Israel's request for new information on this issue during his forthcoming meetings with President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus. The Japanese foreign minister said his country has pledged $200 million to the Palestinians over a two-year period. "Japan assists Jordan as well, and it is acting to convince Syria to join the multilateral talks," Kakizawa said. He added that Japan is committed to continued active participation in the multilateral process. Japan chairs the multilateral working group on environmental issues. Kakizawa noted the developing Japan-Israel ties in the spheres of trade and scientific, technological, and cultural cooperation. He said his country is committed to action against the Arab boycott, and it misses no opportunity to pressure Arab countries to call off the boycott. [passage omitted] The Japanese foreign minister surprised the prime minister by revealing that he had visited Israel in 1964. "My return after so many years reinforces the hope that we will see you in Japan as early as this year," Kakizawa said. Rabin accepted the invitation, explaining that his planned visit to Japan had been postponed due to developments in Israel. [passage omitted]
