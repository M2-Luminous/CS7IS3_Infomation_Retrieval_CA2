Metropolitan Jovan was greeted by a large crowd of worshipers at the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord in the center of Zagreb. He returned for the feast of St. Sava, one of the major holidays of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The return of the Zagreb-Ljubljana metropolitan to his residence in Zagreb after a two-year absence spent in Belgrade, combined with visits to Ljubljana, has a deep meaning for global Croatian-Serbian relations as well as for normalization of relations following the signing of the Geneva Declaration by Franjo Tudjman and Slobodan Milosevic. Metropolitan Jovan is a Croatian citizen. He has a Croatian identity card and passport that were recently given to him personally in Ljubljana by Dalimir Vidis, an official of the Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the name of the Committee for Normalization of Croatian-Serbian Relations.
