With some 38 tonnes of cannabis--or twice as much as was seized in the previous year--last year's seizures "reached an unprecedented level." Concurrently, 233 kilograms of heroin were seized--a 48-percent increase with respect to the previous year. As for cocaine, the increase is minimal, even though the absolute number is high: 1,284 kilograms (1,278 in 1992). Last, in the mercifully small LSD market, 23 grams of lysergid were seized in a single operation in 1993--enough to produce 400,000 doses for the underground British market. Here too, these are unprecedented amounts. New Tools [subhead] While record amounts of cocaine (1,400 kilograms) and heroin (400 kilograms) had been seized in 1990 and 1991, respectively, 1993 saw a steady average progression. That is, "a 50-percent increase as compared with 1992," the minister explained, adding that it was difficult to determine the relative impact of better operation on the part of customs, and increased amounts of drugs smuggled into the national territory. "In any case, this indicates a highly alarming reality," Nicolas Sarkozy concluded, with new General Customs Director Jean-Luc Vialla looking on. Mr. Vialla's services describe an "unprecedented level" of seizures for all types of drugs except opium and hemp plant and hemp oil. Active international cooperation, selective road checks, air and marine monitoring are all part of the array of weapons used by customs, which intend to "use new tools"--that is, fighting smugglers of chemical products used as precursors for the production of drugs, promoting cooperation in the international trade sector to identify illegal shipments, in addition to open sea interceptions and increased cooperation--including with Eastern European countries. Since 1 January 1993, customs have also been very active against illegal immigration, in cooperation with border police. The array of possibilities and prerogatives of customs has been extended in view of the implementation of the Schengen Convention, although the latter remains to come into effect. Last year's results--8,729 persons held for questioning as compared with 5,177 in 1992 and 5,246 in 1991--are indicative of the scope of the new measures. However, one must differentiate between foreign nationals in an irregular situation (2,907, a figure marginally higher than in previous years) and those turned away (5,822, or over twice as much as the 1991 and 1992 figures). Last, Jean-Luc Vialla indicated that the Tracfin action group, which specializes in intelligence and operations against underground financial channels--used, among other things, for the laundering of "dirty" money--receives "50 to 60 statements of suspicion" a month from banks. Although none of the 40 cases currently processed by the courts has been judged yet due to their complexity, there is "no question of terminating Tracfin," Nicolas Sarkozy indicated.
