ACTION: Supplement to the notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the proposed Zortman Mine Expansion Project in Phillips County, Montana. SUMMARY: This notice supplements the ``Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Proposed Zortman Mine Expansion Project, Montana'' that the Bureau of Land Management published in the Federal Register , Volume 57, No. 230, page 56588, November 30, 1992. This supplement notes that the scope of the Zortman Mine Expansion EIS is expanded to also include long-term mining and reclamation practices for the Landusky Mine to correct existing problems identified with acid rock drainage. The Landusky Mine is located approximately two miles west of the Zortman Mine and is also operated by Zortman Mining, Inc. The Landusky Mine is located in southwestern Phillips County about 50 miles south of Malta, Montana, near the southern boundary of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. Existing mine facilities include seven leach pads, four waste rock dumps, three open pit mining areas, a processing plant and associated infrastructure covering approximately 815 acres. The resulting combined Zortman-Landusky EIS will provide a comprehensive impacts analysis for deciding on future mine expansion and reclamation requirements at both operations. DATES: Comments on the change in scope for the Zortman Mine Expansion EIS will be most helpful if received by May 2, 1994.
