The Petroleum Equivalency Factor accomplishes this by multiplying each of the individual input energy generation mix value terms used in calculating electricity generation efficiency by a relative scarcity factor (V i ). The relative scarcity factor is derived by determining the U.S. percent and numeric share of the world reserve market (Table III), and calculating the rate at which the U.S. is depleting each fuel source's reserves. These values are then normalized to obtain the relative scarcity value for each fuel source (Table IV).
