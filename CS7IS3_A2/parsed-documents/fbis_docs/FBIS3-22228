Thanks to Yuriy Kostenko [Ukraine's minister of environmental protection] and Experts from Saxony-Anhalt, Ukraine Will Not Yet Become a Dumping Ground for Toxic Waste''] [Text] For several months, the Ukrainian mass media have been carrying alarming reports on the uncontrolled dumping of German toxic waste in Rivne and Nikolayev oblasts. The ``Greens'' and Ukraine's Greenpeace sounded the alarm. German officials kept silent for a long time. Finally, in November [1993], at the request of Ukrainian Minister of Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko to his German colleague Klaus Toepfer, a group of experts headed by Dr. Andre Radde [names as transliterated] arrived in Kiev. For a week, the FRG specialists conducted identifications of toxic substances and investigated the circumstances of their delivery to Ukraine. In Rivne Oblast, between 50 and 70 tonnes of various substances were revealed (dyes, varnishes, putty, wax, tallow, and laboratory chemicals, including mercury), as well as 100 tonnes of slag, which are stored under the guard of chemical troops. In Nikolayev Oblast, between 40 and 50 tonnes of such substances are also stored under proper conditions. There does not seem to be any acute danger for the population, but, of course, there exists a certain threat to the environment. What part of the imported waste may be processed and what is to be done with the remaining substances will only be determined in Germany after an evaluation of the results of the inspection. The results will be reported to Saxony-Anhalt institutions, which, within the framework of their jurisdiction, are presently conducting a criminal and administrative investigation of German firms under suspicion that they have violated the Law on Waste Disposal. The thing is, in the FRG lands, private contracts between firms (including foreign ones) are not controlled by federal organs of power. Economic ties are established directly. That is why competent bodies alone may determine the degree of responsibility of the entrepreneurs. Unfortunately, the absence of a similar law in Ukraine makes it possible to import waste (secondary raw materials) on a perfectly legal basis. Smart dealers take advantage of this and fill their pockets under the pretext of saturating the market with raw materials, which are in short supply. It is impossible to rely solely upon the vigilance of the ``Greens'' or the enthusiasm of members of the Ukrainian Greenpeace Organization. Ukraine's Supreme Council, by its decree of 17 November 1993, already made the first step, having authorized the Cabinet of Ministers to adopt a list of groups of substances and materials belonging to the category of those dangerous waste materials, whose import to the territory of Ukraine is prohibited, and the Procedure for Issuing Licenses for Importing (Transit) of Secondary Raw Materials and Relevant Waste to the Territory of Ukraine. It only remains to make the second step -- to fill in the blank spaces in the legislation, lest impudent entrepreneurs should make dangerous attempts to bring highly toxic substances to Ukraine. I must point out, as a positive development, the meeting of the German experts with Ukrainian and foreign correspondents at the German Embassy in Ukraine. It is my impression that [German] Ambassador Alexander Arnot is particularly active in trying to help our state overcome various hardships in its present critical situation.
