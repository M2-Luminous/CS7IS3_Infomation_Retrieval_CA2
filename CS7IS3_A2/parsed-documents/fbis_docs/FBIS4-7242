FBIS4-7242 "dreas082_d_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 South Korea Chochongnyon Official Said Recalled to Pyongyang Chochongnyon Official Said Recalled to Pyongyang SK2704083794 Seoul YONHAP in English 0823 GMT 27 Apr 94 SK2704083794 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 27 (YONHAP) -- The sudden homecoming Tuesday of Han Tok-su, chairman of the pro-Pyongyang organization Chochongnyon [General Association of Korean Residents in Japan], has triggered speculation that Han was forced to return to North Korea permanently because he rejected orders to sell Chochongnyon's assets and send the proceeds to the Kim Il-song regime, North Korea watchers say. The 87-year-old Han, who has controlled Chochongnyon for the past 39 years, was reluctant to go to Pyongyang because he thought he might not be able to return to Japan after meeting North Korean leader Kim Il-song and his son and heir-apparent, Chong-il, Chochongnyon insiders say. The homecoming was related to North Korea's intentions to change the leadership of Chochongnyon, making it easier to collect money from the pro-Pyongyang organization in Japan, the insiders say. Han reportedly failed to comply with the North's request that Chochongnyon sell its assets in Japan for remittance to Pyongyang, insisting the assets were obtained by the organization itself. To facilitate the transfer of proceeds from selling the group's assets, Pyongyang tried to dispatch former Chochongnyon Vice Chairman Kim Pyong-sik to Tokyo but was thwarted by Chochongnyon leaders, according to the insiders. Kim was named vice president of the North Korean Government last December, 22 years after disappearing from public view. Pyongyang has repeatedly asked Han to return since last year and even sent Han's eldest son, U-chol, as a special envoy to persuade him early this year, the insiders say. According to the SANKEI SHIMBUN, Japanese security authorities see Han's return to Pyongyang as a prelude to measures facilitating money transfers to Pyongyang from Tokyo if international sanctions are imposed on North Korea for its suspected nuclear weapons program.
