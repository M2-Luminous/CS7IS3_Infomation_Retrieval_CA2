Krimi: "Innovations and Limitations of the New Investment Incentive Code"] [Text] On 21 December 1993, the Chamber of Deputies adopted the new "investment incentive code" and its application texts. This new law, filling a legal vacuum that prevented a restart of investments (in marked decline in the past two years), proposes to provide more consistency, security, and profitability to onshore and offshore investments. For this, the new legislation will guarantee investment security, mobility, and profitability. Security will be achieved by instituting three fundamental freedoms: freedom to invest, freedom to transfer profits, and freedom to transfer capital to complete the project. Eagerly awaited for at least two years, the new code will harmonize in a single text the incentives provided by the five previous codes (industry, agriculture, services, tourism, and regulations concerning trade and international brokerage). From the start, the new code differs from the previous codes by its global character, by its perfect adaptability to the growth objectives of the eighth plan (1991-1996), and by its goals: to rehabilitate business and provide impetus for private investment. Roughly, the new code (which does not cover the mining, energy, and finance sectors because of their specific nature) aims mostly to revive direct foreign investment, to provide impetus for local investment, and to link both kinds of investment to exports. The sectors concerned are: agriculture and fisheries, manufacturing industries, civil engineering, tourism, artisanat, transport, education, vocational training, culture-related production and industry, youth activities, child welfare, health, environmental protection, real estate development, and other activities and services specified in the decree. The Code Contains 6 Innovations First, the code no longer targets sectors, but businesses irrespective of the field in which they operate. However, special attention is given to agricultural, aquicultural, and fishery companies, followed by export companies, decentralized businesses, and ecology-related projects. Businesses overlooked, or even penalized, by the code will be found in the tourism sector. Professionals see in this a deliberate decision on the part of the government to slow down investment in that sector. Second, the new code draws up a new list of priority activities eligible for tax and financial incentives provided by the State. There are seven of them: exports, regional development, agriculture, technology transfer, environmental protection, incentives for young entrepreneurs to create small to midsize businesses or start small trades, and finally consolidation or support investment. Third, there are two classes of incentives: common incentives and specific incentives. The latter will be granted exclusively to the above-mentioned priority activities. Fourth, tax and financial incentives provided by the State will also extend to the sociocultural environment of the production apparatus. Incentives will thus be granted to entrepreneurs wishing to invest in ecology, vocational training, education, or cultural activities. Fifth, incentives will be granted only to achieve a dual goal: to make businesses aware of their responsibilities and to encourage them to stop borrowing and to modernize their equipment. Sixth, State subsidies and bank interest rate rebates will be replaced by premiums: a specific premium, and another complementary or additional premium. Three Common Incentives -- Companies and individuals who contribute to the capital of businesses created in the sectors covered by the code will automatically be granted a tax exemption for 35 percent of their net taxable revenues or profits. -- Durable goods required for the purpose of the investment--with the exception of passenger cars other than those intended for Sahara or hunting tourism--will enjoy a reduced customs duties rate of 10 percent while taxes of equivalent effect, the value-added tax, and the consumption duty on imports will be waived provided that equivalent durable goods are not available in Tunisia. -- Third tax incentive: businesses may choose to use the diminishing values method to depreciate production equipment and facilities with a useful life in excess of seven years. Through this incentive, the government intends to encourage businesses to modernize their facilities and to acquire new technologies. According to the code, this provision is not retroactive; therefore, it will apply only to equipment and facilities acquired after promulgation of this code. As for specific incentives, they will be granted to priority activities. Agriculture is the favorite sector of the new incentive code. Previously granted incentives were consolidated and extended to agricultural product processing industries, fisheries, packaging, and to the forestry sector.... Premiums will be granted directly to farmers as soon as their projects start. Seventy percent of the profits and revenues invested as contribution to the capital of an agricultural company will be tax exempt. Note also that investments in the agricultural sector fall into three classes: Class A, investments made by small farmers; Class B, investments made by midsize farmers; Class C, investments made by large farmers. Class-A and Class-B projects will receive two investment premiums, one specific premium and a complementary premium, in addition to the common incentives. The specific premium, that farmers [sic] will also receive, will be granted solely to finance investment components: purchase of agricultural machinery, installation of irrigation systems leading to water savings, secondary irrigation for grain crops, water and soil preservation work, seed propagation and production, creation of ranges and areas for pasture and to plant forage and forestry bushes and shrubs. Agricultural investments made in regions with a difficult climate, and fishery investments in areas with underdeveloped resources may receive an additional premium. Investments made to develop areas designed for aquicultural or geothermal projects will receive a premium representing the State's payment for infrastructure expenditures. As far as exports are concerned, 70 percent of the profits and revenues invested as capital contributions will be tax exempt, instead of 100 percent previously. Profits generated by exports will be 100-percent tax exempt for 10 years, and only 50 percent after that period. Another incentive: each exporting company may recruit four foreign management-level supervisors and sell 20 percent of its production on the local market, as long as it pays import customs duties. As an exception, agricultural and fishery companies will be considered as exporting companies if they export 70 percent of their production. Exports and Technology Transfers The code also contains an important innovation: it eliminates the distinction between fully and partially exporting companies. For the first time, regional development will enjoy State tax incentives. Materially, investors who choose to operate inland will enjoy a full 10-year tax exemption for profits generated by investments in industry, tourism, and some services. Note that this 100-percent tax exemption will be reduced to 50 percent at the expiration of the first 10-year period. Other incentives to regional investment are premiums consisting of a State participation in the cost of projects, studies, and development work in industrial and tourism areas. The State will pay the employer's social security contribution for a period of five years. Construction and real-estate development companies will enjoy a 50-percent tax exemption if they have to provide community facilities. Technology transfer and technological expertise are the other priorities of the code. The code provides incentives for any business taking steps to improve its supervisor ratio (recruitment of senior technicians, etc.) and the skills of its supervision personnel. For the first time, environmental protection and the fight against pollution are entitled to State subsidies/premiums. The latter will be granted to businesses that invest in waste and garbage processing and treatment. They involve exemption of customs duties and taxes of equivalent effect on imported goods that have no equivalent in Tunisia and are deemed necessary to complete the project. Finally, the institution of tax and financial incentives designed to promote support or consolidation investment. The objective is to encourage vocational training centers, educational institutions, and construction and real-estate development companies to invest in activities lying at the periphery of the production apparatus (continued education, low-rent housing, etc.). The code provides miscellaneous incentives that may be of "special interest" for the country's economy or for border zones. The additional incentives that may be granted involve tax exemption for a period of up to five years, State participation in infrastructure expenditures, investment premiums amounting to 5 percent of the amount invested, and the waiving of duties and taxes on facilities required to complete the investments. As a result, the new code is both open and flexible. Everything will hinge on direct negotiations between the investor and local authorities. All things considered, the code offers la carte service. Reactions of Economic Operators This being said, economic operators as a whole did not react well to the new code. They saw it as a net reduction of investment incentives. As an indication, operators mention the elimination of the bank interest rate rebate, which manufacturers prefer to the State investment subsidy or premium, and the 10-year limit on the full tax exemption of profits and revenues and its reduction to 70 percent of profits of revenues instead of 100 percent as previously. We should recognize, however, that Tunisian entrepreneurs, used to State subsidies and excited for some time at the prospect of getting new incentives under the new code, exaggerate a lot when they go so far as to link the restart of investment to the institution of zero tax on capital goods and duty-free import of passenger cars. For the government, eliminating the (10 percent) customs duty is unacceptable for a very simple reason: under nondual-taxation agreements between Tunisia and its partners, local or nonresident entrepreneurs will be liable one way or the other to taxes levied by one of the two partner countries. In that case, why should Tunisia deprive itself of it? The main objection that can be formulated against the new code is that it does not address current mutations and requirements. If we are to believe Mr. Ferid Tanfous, foreign trade and transfer director at the Central Bank of Tunisia, investors are rather more interested in the secondary sector (stock market, etc.), hence Tunisia's interest in working already now to deregulate investment in the secondary market. It is not at all irrelevant to recall here that any purchase of stocks and shares on the secondary market is still subject to preliminary official approval. In addition, although the new code is intended to be clear and easy to understand, it includes very vague "formulations" leading to conflicting interpretations. For instance, it is punctuated with expressions such as "subject to...," "provided that...," "businesses may...." Such expressions, which will be defined more precisely in applications texts, indicate that enjoying State incentives or premiums is a mere possibility; as a result, they may discourage entrepreneurs who, in their investment decisions, look first of all for a crystal-clear nondiscriminatory legal system. Another limitation or inadequacy of the new code is that the new legislation gives too much importance to financial incentives and overlooks other parameters that are equally important when it comes to improving the competitiveness of businesses, namely capital and personnel productivity, continued education, total quality, management methods, working conditions, etc. To quote the head of the Tunisian employers association, Mr. Hedi Jilani, this investment incentive code "is a piece of goods designed for local and external consumption. It will be evaluated and judged not by the government or even by the deputies, but by the market for which it was written."
