At his press conference Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communists, stated that the "Russia's Choice" faction has in effect already disintegrated, and hence no longer represents any serious counterweight to the recently formed bloc of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Agrarian Party, and the Democratic Party of Russia, which numbers 115 deputies. Deputy Mikhail Poltaranin did not agree with Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov's assertion of a split in "Russia's Choice": "All that happened is that two candidates for the post of Duma chairman were discussed inside the faction. As a result Sergey Kovalev was nominated." "But in that case, Mikhail Nikiforovich, what in your opinion is the reason for the democratic blocs' failure in the preliminary ballot?" The correlation of forces in parliament is very complex. And it is not constituted in our favor. But it is the cross section of society which we have and which we received in our parliament. In addition, just like before the elections, the democrats are uncoordinated. We reach agreements with other groups, but when we look at the breakdown of the vote, in general one-half of the votes go astray, as the saying goes. When there is no overall majority, we cannot afford to blow hot and cold in this way: Every man counts. Especially since there are less of us than the "Zhirinovskiyites," Communists, and agrarians. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's "coronation" speech 13 January roused the indignation of the majority of deputies. Let us cite excerpts from this offensive speech by the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, which reached hysterical proportions. Addressing deputies he uttered the following: "You are not yet mature enough for a normal parliament.... I agree to undergo psychiatric examination.... My two-day visit to Europe made everyone sit up.... I am not suitable for the role of parliament's traffic controller (in other words chairman of the State Duma). My health will be spoilt by Chubays, Kozyrev, Fedorov.... But my health is necessary for the entire Russian people. Mr. Chubays (addressing Chubays), don't look at the clock, you will have time to look at it in your cell in Lefortovo.... Quiet! (taps with his heel on the rostrum). Get out of the hall, out, all of you! I am waiting for the presidential elections. Then I will show you!" The mood of the majority of those present was expressed by Sergey Shakhray, who spoke directly after Zhirinovskiy: "Our parliament could be economically self-sufficient if we start selling tickets for Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's performances." Everyone was pretty much bored stiff by the wait for the results of the election of the State Duma chairman. But it became known in the lobbies before it was announced officially that 47-year-old engineer Ivan Rybkin had been elected State Duma chairman. From our files: Ivan Petrovich Rybkin was born in 1946; he is Russian, has higher education, and is a member of the Russian Agrarian Party and deputy chief of the Russian Federation Ministry of Agriculture Main Administration of Water Supplies.
