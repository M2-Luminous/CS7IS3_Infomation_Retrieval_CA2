On 16 March the board of directors of the DKR Company for Plastics Recycling in Cologne authorized management to negotiate contracts with the companies BASF/Otto, RWE and VEW/KAB for the construction and running of recycling plants with an annual capacity of up to 500,000 tons. The head of the BASF plastics division, member of the board Dr. Albrecht Eckell, considered this decision to be an "approved surcharge" for his company's raw material recycling plan. For a consortium made up of BASF AG in Ludwigshafen and Otto Plastics Service GmbH in Heidelberg has made DKR an offer to utilize the materials of 300,000 tons of used polymers annually starting in 1996. At the moment BASF is constructing a suitable pilot plant in Ludwigshafen to transform mixed and soiled plastic waste into reusable petrochemical raw materials. The resulting distillates are naphtha, olefins and aromatics, which are used as on-site materials within the investment group. According to Eckell, loss of quality does not occur as it does in the case of working material recycling (plastic wastes are made into plastics again). The BASF board member sees raw material recycling as an ecologically and economically sensible alternative for utilization. For he says that "disproportionately many resources" are used in the recycling of working materials for packaging marked with the Green Dot. "Collecting, sorting and cleaning require an unreasonably high level of energy, water and costs," says Dr. Albrecht Eckell, "which cannot be justified ecologically or economically." These problems are also reflected in the new licensing compensation structure for the "Green Dot," which was agreed on by the DSD board of directors on 21 March. It stipulates, for example, that from 1 October an additional DM2.95 per kg is to be paid to Dual System for plastic containers over a base amount defined by number and volume. This means that the timing would be precisely right for raw material recycling as a brake on costs. For according to Dr. Albrecht Eckell the reduction of the total utilization costs for plastics is a particular concern of the plastics industry. Of the present high costs of about DM3,000 per ton for recycling in Dual System, about 80 percent can be traced to expensive collecting and sorting, he said. But with raw material recycling that could largely be dispensed with. Achievable exploitation of the material is given by the BASF plastics expert as 85 to 95 percent. Says Eckell: "This makes raw material recycling-- contrary to a common prejudice--an efficient kind of utilization." In addition, the goals of the packaging ordinance, which are ambitious in the opinion of BASF--according to current interpretation, from 1 July 1995 approximately 600,000 tons of private commercial packaging must be collected, sorted and materially reused by DSD--can only be met, according to Dr. Albrecht Eckell, with the help of raw material recycling. In this way 300,000 tons of DSD material could be recycled annually from mid-1996. For plastics recycling on a major technological scale BASF needs an additional surcharge of about DM350 per ton and, according to Eckell, "stable framework conditions." Among these he includes permanent exemption from the requirement for plastic packaging to be returnable in the marketplace. Wolfram Brueck is confident that the DKR's decision marks a great step forward in this regard also. "There is no more reason to set a time limit on exemption for plastics through the Land departments," says the DSD managing director. But more than one plant is needed for comprehensive utilization of the used plastic packaging created in Germany. In the view of BASF board member Eckell, only through the construction of additional utilization facilities by other companies can the goal of keeping dumps free of plastics be reached. As an example he cited Veba Oel AG, which hopes to transform 120,000 tons of used plastics annually into a synthetic oil in the coal/oil plant in Bottrop starting in 1996. He also listed RWE's plan to use 70,000 tons of used plastics annually in the production of synthesis gas.
