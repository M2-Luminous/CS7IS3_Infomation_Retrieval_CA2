The memorandum circulated at the conference, underlined that establishment of an independent Estonian state was going hand in hand with pushing the non-Estonian population out of the country. The document emphasized that Estonia had adopted and was implementing several laws discriminating against the Russian- speaking population in Estonia. In particular, this meant the law on citizenship, depriving a third of the population of citizenship, the law on language, hampering employment of ethnic Russians, the law on local elections, which does not admit the election of non- citizens and the law on aliens which made many Estonian permanent residents foreigners in their own country. There is also a law on schools limiting studies in Russian to the first nine years of secondary education. The Russian delegation suggested that the recommendations by international experts, including the CSCE and Council of Europe High Commissioner for Ethnic Minorities, had not been taken into consideration when adopting these laws. The document also stressed that implementation of the legislation was left to the arbitrary whims of officials. The Estonian authorities fail to display any appropriate response to this, the document said. Russia proceeds from the fact that the legal rights of the non- ethnic population in Estonia and settlement of their civil status concerns not only Russian-Estonian relations but the whole world community, the document underlined. The Russian delegation circulated one more memorandum urging the participants in the council to work on projects for development of infrastructure and transport in the region, to coordinate improvement of navigation on the Baltic Sea and modernization of sea ports and to facilitate business and other contacts. Much attention was paid to social and economic development of the Kaliningrad Region. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is concerned over the activities of the Baltic Sea States' Council which he has estimated as not so effective. Speaking at the third conference of foreign ministers of the council, which unites ten states of the region, Kozyrev wished that activities of the council would be more concrete; particularly as concerned cooperation in the humanitarian sphere and human rights. Kozyrev submitted to Estonian Foreign Minister Yuriy Luik a letter on the part of Russian retired servicemen revealing concrete examples of violations of their human rights. The letter said that elderly people older than 60 were demanded to present medical documents confirming they were free from AIDS or venereal diseases and that military pensioners were deprived of free medical care. Kozyrev suggested that the commissioner for democratic institutions and human rights could be charged with such issues. Kozyrev hoped that the commissioner would also control the situation with the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic states. Russia would assist the commissioner with his activities on Russian territory, Kozyrev stated. He announced that Russia approved of the candidacy of well known Danish politician, former minister of justice Ole Espersen. Kozyrev spoke in favor of cooperation between the members of the council in the sphere of infrastructure and transport and between different regions of the member-states. He spoke for the future chairmen of the council to be more energetic and efficient. Kozyrev supported the candidacy of Poland as the head of the organization for the next year.
