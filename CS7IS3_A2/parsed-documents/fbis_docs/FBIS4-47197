FBIS4-47197 "jpusr069___94012" FBIS-USR-94-069 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 17 June 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC & SOCIAL AFFAIRS Yeltsin's Edict on Banking System Criticized Yeltsin's Edict on Banking System Criticized 944E0975A Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY in Russian 17 Jun 94 p 5 944E0975A Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY Russian CSO [Report on Association of Russian Banks press conference by Boris Boyko and commentary by Financial Turnover Department: "The Sixth Paragraph Has Become Hated as Much as the Fifth One"] [Text] Less than a week after signing of the president's edict "On improving the operation of the Russian Federation's banking system," which has been received with widespread public reaction both in Russia and in the West, the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) issued an official commentary on this decision by Boris Yeltsin. The main object of analysis, it was easy to assume, was not so much the edict itself as its sixth paragraph, which removes a number of the restrictions on foreign banks' activity set forth in November 1993. Sergey Yegorov, president of the ARB; Aleksandr Smolenskiy, president of the "Stolichniy" Bank; Garegin Tosunyan, president of the Tekhnobank; Leonid Nevzlin, vice president of the "Menatep" Bank; and Vladimir Gusinskiy, president of the Most-Bank, took part in a press conference. The overall tone of the press conference showed that in their choice of reasoning the representatives of Russian banks were quite familiar with the attitudes prevailing in the higher echelons of political authority. In criticizing the hated sixth paragraph, the emphasis was put on the danger it represents for the work of state construction in Russia. It is interesting that the political factor became almost dominant in the statements made by members of the banking elite. Thus, in the ARB's opinion, the president's decision gives an opportunity to "rightist forces" to take advantage of the presence of foreign banks in the Russian market "to inflame political passions." The edict provided a reason for the association to declare a fundamental change in the state's policy of protectionism, which, in Vladimir Gusinskiy's words, should be no less than in Western countries, where it is quite difficult for a foreign bank to open a branch because of the numerous restrictions. Leonid Nevzlin was more dramatic: in his opinion, the president's decision threatens the very structure of Russian statehood--four or five large foreign banks are enough "to cut off oxygen to the Russian banking system." In addition, the example given by "Menatep" may illustrate the increasing force of this dangerous trend--under the threat of a breakdown, plans have appeared to attract foreign investments by selling some of the Russian banks' stock shares to foreign banks. Despite the good preparation, the sense of proportion changed at times for the press conference participants: in the words of Garegin Tosunyan, a campaign is under way to discredit Russian banks connected with the general tendency "to turn pink and turn red" in domestic policy. As a result, proposals are showing up at the state level to nationalize all banks altogether on the grounds that they allegedly have been tainted by crime. The argument that the Russian banking system was unprepared for severe competition with foreign banks sounded more meaningful. There are now 2,000 commercial banks and 4,800 of their branches operating in Russia now (one bank for each administrative rayon). At the same time, the oldest Russian commercial bank is only 5 years old. Because they are relatively new, Russian banks can offer clients only 70 to 80 types of service, whereas their foreign competitors are able to provide up to 3,000 types of service. In this connection, subsequent statements by a number of the press conference participants that they did not fear foreign competition appeared to be somewhat contradictory. Especially as reputable Western banks such as Deutsche Bank believe their presence in Russia is premature, according to Sergey Yegorov. The conclusion that the presence of foreign banks would serve no purpose for the Russian economy appears to be more logical. In the opinion of the press conference participants, opportunities are being made available to pump rubles out of Russia instead of to attract foreign investments. As Mr. Gusinskiy stated, the conditions for reservation of banking capial in Western countries do not make it possible to invest more than $20 million to $30 million per year in the Russian economy because of the high degree of political risk. In this connection, the KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts would like to emphasize one thought expressed in the statement by Garegin Tosunyan: in spite of the frequent declarations by the government, the conditions needed for investments by Russian banks in the Russian economy have not been created. Compensation for the absence of a normal investment climate in the country cannot be provided by financial institutions from the West. * * * From the ARB appeal to the international banking community Consolidation and development of the banking business are almost decisive in beginning the successful formation and development of a market economy. However, the Russian banking system is only coming to its feet, and all the capital of our banks is less than the capital of any foreign bank. This does not mean a fear of competition, but apprehension about the restoration of Russia's national economy and its entry into the world community as an equal partner. The international banking community should also take something else into consideration--there are forces in Russia which take advantage of the presence of foreign banks in our market in order to instill in people's consciousness that national property is being sold off and to break through on this wave to the structures of authority and their powers. This is why the widespread presence of foreign banks in Russia is premature today. Not only Russia, but the entire world community will lose. We appeal for the declaration of a moratorium on opening branches of foreign banks in Russia for a year and a half. From the ARB letter to the President of Russia In gaining access to our financial market, foreign banks are accumulating a substantial part of Russian funds. It is obvious that they will make use of foreign banks to extend credit to their traditional clients, the foreign companies in Russia, which will not attract the expected Western investments for this reason, but take advantage of our financial resources. This will lead to a significant outflow of Russian national capital and intensify the already critical situation in domestic industry. We hope the admission of three more of the largest foreign banks into Russia's financial market is the only exception to the procedure which you established, that the government and the Central Bank will require states in the European Community to allow adequate representation in their countries by branches of the largest Russian commercial banks. * * * Commentary It is generally known that the position of Russian commercial banks on the presence of foreign banking structures in the domestic market varies. In this sense, the ARB position reflects only the views on this problem of most Russian banks, presenting a certain average opinion, and it does not take into account the most extreme positions for this reason. A number of banks (for example, the International Moscow Bank and TOKOBANK) consider it possible to open the Russian market for their foreign colleagues now, but others (in particular, the Most-Bank) believe even the period up to 1996 is too liberal. In the opinion of the ARB leadership, the differences in views are explained chiefly by the different priorities (tactics or strategy) given preference by the banks. For example, the ones which are planning to open foreign branches in the near future or which have substantial foreign funds in their capital prefer not to force the situation. However, even fervent opponents of the presence of foreign banks in the Russian market would probably soften their position if they had adequate opportunity to open their own branches abroad. But this is not happening at present. It is sufficient to remember the "Stolichniy" Bank's opening of its subsidiary bank in Holland, which was replete with all kinds of nuances. In the words of the bank's president, Aleksandr Smolenskiy, when the "Stolichniy" Bank was finally granted a license, the Central Bank of the Netherlands imposed serious restrictions on it: two of the three bank directors had to be Dutch; the ratio between Russian and Dutch personnel was set at 5 to 1; and restrictions were introduced on service for physical persons and an increase in assets and capital, as well as on the opening of additional branches. According to the bankers, similar conditions apply with respect to foreign banks in most European countries. But the main apprehension of Russian bankers is that foreign banks will "take over the market," that is, they will win over their clients (to which the mentality of Russian citizens, who are very timid in dealing with anything foreign, will contribute to a substantial degree). But the foreign banks will direct the funds attracted in the market mainly to extend credit to their traditional clients--foreign firms. At the same time, in the bankers' words, four or five of the banks are enough to completely "cut off the oxygen" to the Russian banks. It is obvious in this case that the foreign banks will not be establishing branches and offices in Russian regions--Russians will have to occupy these. This is already quite apparent today, but with the reduction of an unfavorable base for banks, the establishment of branches will become unprofitable altogether. In following the Russian bankers' logic, it may be said that this will mean stagnation of the national banking market.
