FR940406-0-00173 FR940406-0-00012 In the NPRM, NHTSA noted that two companies, Range Rover and PAS, projected MY 1992 light truck CAFE levels that are well below those of the large domestic manufacturers. In their mid-model year reports for MY 1992, Range Rover projected a CAFE level of 16.3 mpg and PAS 18.6 mpg. The agency notes that in their mid-model year reports for MY 1993, Range Rover projected a CAFE level of 15.4 mpg and PAS 18.5 mpg. Both of these companies sell a small number of light trucks in the U.S., on the order of about 5,000 vehicles or less. PAS modifies GM light trucks. One other company which has a CAFE capability below that of the large domestic manufacturers is UMC, a small domestic producer of delivery vans. That company projects selling 950 light trucks in MY 1993, with a CAFE of 18.8 mpg. B. Possible Additional Actions To Improve MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE The agency analyzed the additional actions which manufacturers may be able to take to improve their CAFE levels above those that they currently project for MYs 1996&hyph;97. These actions may be divided into two categories: further technological changes and product restrictions. 1. Further Technological Changes The ability to improve CAFE by further technological changes to product plans is dependent on the availability of fuel efficiency enhancing technologies that manufacturers are able to apply within the available time. The agency's Regulatory Evaluation discusses the fuel efficiency enhancing technologies which are expected to be available by MYs 1996&hyph;97. However, for MYs 1996&hyph;97, limited leadtime is a significant constraint on the increased use of these technologies. NHTSA recognizes that the leadtime necessary to implement significant improvements in engines, transmissions, aerodynamics and rolling resistance is typically at least three years. Also, as the agency discussed in establishing its final rule for MYs 1993&hyph;94, once a new design is established and tested as feasible for production, the leadtime necessary to design tools and test components is typically 30 to 36 months. Some potential major changes may take even longer. Leadtimes for new vehicles are usually at least three years. Further, light trucks have a long model life, i.e., 8&hyph;10 years or more. If a manufacturer must make a major model change ahead of its normal schedule, this change may have a significant, unprogrammed financial impact. NHTSA notes that AAMA stated in its comment that the above leadtimes, which the agency cited in the NPRM, are more typical for passenger cars and that truck leadtimes are even longer. Given the leadtime constraint, the agency does not believe that manufacturers can achieve significant improvements in their projected MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE levels by additional technological actions.
