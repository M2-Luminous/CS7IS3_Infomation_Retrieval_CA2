'Abd-al-Haqq: "Are We Interested in the Fall of Rabin or in Foiling the Settlement Policy? Palestine Wants `Political Revenge,' Not a Bloody One"] [Excerpts] Instinct is the worst guide to useful and creative political work; such work needs the ability to apply "a bundle of pressure factors" on the adversary to force him into accepting the Palestinian reading of the Declaration of Principles. The PLO has gradually built up a cumulative position, presenting specific demands that create a balance between pushing the peace process onto a more serious course and giving the necessary response to the angry popular reaction to the Hebron massacre as dictated by its duty and role as a representative of the Palestinians. [passage omitted] It goes without saying that the PLO understands Washington's role and influence in the United Nations. But Palestinian insistence on a Security Council resolution condemning the massacre, calling for an international presence in the occupied territories to protect our people, and indicating that Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories, as a condition for resuming bilateral talks with Israel may lead to some sort of confrontation with the United States, as indications have shown since the massacre. But the PLO, for its part, realizes that the United States has a genuine interest in resuming the negotiations as soon as possible, and this is also the position of other influential international parties with clearer support for our people and cause. Moreover, Israel's position is weak, and it is difficult to defend all its components. All these factors, consequently, help the PLO achieve better political gains that previously offered to it. An effort for a political achievement does not necessarily require confrontation. That is why the PLO accepted, as President 'Arafat said a few hours after the massacre, U.S. President Bill Clinton's invitation to 'Arafat and to the Israeli prime minister to resume the bilateral talks in Washington as soon as possible. American intervention in the talks, indeed, had been a Palestinian demand for months, and it is not right to abandon it when opportunity knocks. The conditions for taking up the invitation must be satisfied, basically by the government of Yitzhaq Rabin doing what it must do vis-a-vis the tragedy. [passage omitted] PLO's hardline position, and the fact that the organization did not immediately respond to exaggerated suggestions that time is not on the side of the Palestinian position, may be in order. But we must understand and realize the fact that these two factors have limits, and that it is inevitable for the PLO to return to the negotiating table. The PLO is not in the business of a revenge governed by instant angry reactions, but is seeking a political achievement that may return things to the right track and make up for our loss in the negotiations in Davos and Cairo, with a view toward adopting the Palestinian reading of the joint Declaration of Principles.
