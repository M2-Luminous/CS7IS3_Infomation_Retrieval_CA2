The task of such a committee would be to specify, in detail, the frameworks, form, and extent of joint cooperation. In an exclusive interview with the Jordanian news agency on arriving in Amman en route to occupied Jerusalem tonight, al-Husayni added that Jordanian-Palestinian coordination should be at the highest levels and that all details should be discussed. He said: If we do not proceed in this direction, the Israelis will seek to isolate the Palestinians in order to move the occupied territories from the Israeli occupation to limited self-rule. To prevent Israel from achieving this objective, Jordanian-Palestinian cooperation should be enhanced. Al-Husayni asserted that the current phase requires maximum coordination. Palestinian-Israeli relations have reached a phase in which Jordanian-Palestinian coordination is an inevitable necessity. Without such coordination, we would give Israel an opportunity to tamper with our cause and plan and make whatever decisions it pleases, he said. Al-Husayni added that Palestinian-Jordanian coordination should bring us to the point where the Jordanian and Palestinian sides would be almost one party. He asserted that the Israeli settlements should be removed, and that there is no room for the settlers in the occupied territories because they are an obstacle to peace. He added that he visited London and Paris where he held talks with several officials dealing with the Palestine question and European support for the Palestinian people. He also met with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis.
