The human rights organisation feels that there is no justification for preventing the right of people to seek asylum, particularly at such a crucial time when renewed fierce fighting in Kabul has forced thousands to flee to safer areas. A BBC report on Saturday [22 Jan] painted Pakistan as a villain in this regard, and even played up differences between the federal and NWFP governments over the issue. At the same time the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has also urged Islamabad to reopen the border, saying that the policy would create difficulties for refugees. Thousands have been turned back from the Torkhum border, the main entry into Pakistan for those fleeing the Kabul fighting. The first impulse is to lash back at these self-righteous international organisations for preaching to us about refugees rights, when the western countries of their origin have themselves repeatedly ignored all such concepts of international responsibility. Pakistan has a much better track record of hospitality and sensitivity than any other sovereign nation, having hosted over three million Afghans for over a decade since the Afghan war started. Yet when the Russians were thrown out, and the Cold War came to an end, suddenly everyone lost interest in Afghanistan, at one time the front line in the war against communism. More than a million refugees are still in Pakistan, but international agencies and countries had washed their hands of the problem much before this latest round of internecine fighting. Despite repeated requests for aid and rehabilitation funds, Pakistan has found itself increasingly taking on the entire burden of a refugee problem for which the blame lies as much on the West as it does on the former Soviet Union. Then, there is no reason to criticise Pakistan as if it is committing some sort of heinous human rights violation. The stand of the Pakistani government is quite valid that since fighting has been thus far limited to only Kabul and a few adjoining areas, there is no reason why refugees cannot be shifted to other places in Afghanistan which are otherwise untouched by the fighting. Leaving aside the fact that Afghans have begun to find it more convenient to jump across the border than find shelter in other parts of their country, Pakistan has not left the refugees to fend for themselves -- camps are being set up inside Afghan territory, and Pakistan has committed a substantial amount of relief aid to the effort to feed and shelter the needy refugees. As for the right of asylum, there is no law that says that a country should open the floodgates in a situation such as the one Pakistan is faced with. The US wasn't willing to take on even a few thousand Haitian refugees, preferring to keep them at sea or forcibly returning them to their homeland, where chances of persecution were much higher than in Afghanistan. That was criminal. A decade of experience with the Afghan refugees has shown us at least this much that when dealing with the kinds of numbers as in this scenario, it is hard to distinguish the persecuted from the needy. Perhaps UNHCR could set up an appropriate office in the refugee camps in Afghan territory, and then see how many other countries are willing to accept asylum seekers from among the applicants they get. With the kinds of laws adopted by many European countries regarding asylum, it seems unlikely that there will be many. Instead of preaching to Pakistan about standards of responsibility that we know better about, AI should concentrate on urging the West to atone for its crimes against Afghanistan. When Amnesty accuses the warring parties in Afghanistan of using civilians as human shields, does it forget that this is only a natural continuation of the policies of the superpowers in their quest for global supremacy? Their violations of human rights are much more significant, yet all Amnesty has to say to them is: Please try to send some aid, if it's not too much of a bother. It's for a good cause. We cannot afford to take on more refuges simply on the promises of the international agencies, because unless they can get other countries to pay their share. Pakistan will once again be left to absorb the costs into its own barely solvent economy. If the US can get the Gulf states to foot the bill for such a massively destructive war effort in Iraq, surely there is something available to use constructively for the Afghans. Amnesty International would do well to consider human rights on a macro rather than a micro level. Don't expect Third World countries to go out of their way if you can't even convince your own people to start taking responsibility for their doings and misdoings. Notwithstanding this aspect of the Afghan Refugees' cases, our Interior Ministry needs to handle the issue with sensitivity. Eye witness accounts of arrival at Torkhum suggest insensitive handling of the policy laid down by Islamabad. There are reports of crying women and children at the barrier and of families who fled in such a hurry that they brought their dead. Some women have given birth waiting on the other side. The border guards enforced the rule that only those recommended by the Afghan authorities would be admitted. The Afghans with all their humanity burnt out by a long exposure to brutalities, recommended only those who could pay for their recommendation. The going rate was Rs 500/- [as published] per person. Pakistan rupee is hard currency in Afghanistan. It is difficult to suggest any foolproof method of verifying genuine hardship cases. But a few honest officers posted as assessors may help.
