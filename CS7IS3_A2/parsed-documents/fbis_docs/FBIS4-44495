The Investment Commission of the Economics Ministry announced yesterday (7 May) that as of the end of the first quarter of 1994, more than 10,000 applications from Taiwan's businesses to invest in the mainland have been approved with the total amount of investments exceeding US$3.8 billion in value. Tientsin has, for the first time, squeezed itself into the top five most popular areas. Investments in the manufacture of basic metal products are expected to increase. According to statistics announced by the Investment Commission yesterday, 314 projects for indirect investment in the mainland were approved by the government with a total amount of investments reaching US$246 million in value. This has brought the total number of approved projects, by the government, investing in the mainland to over 10,000 and the total amount of investments to US$3.836 billion. The investments are mainly made by Taiwan's businesses for the manufacture of electric and electronic products, plastic wares, food, beverages, precision machinery and basic metal products in the mainland. The Investment Commission admitted that the statistics showed that Taiwan's businessmen's enthusiasm to invest in the mainland remained unabated. However, the government has adopted measures to cool off the across-Straits exchanges under the influence of the Chientaohu Incident. The April meeting to examine special cases involving investments in the mainland was called off. As for the schedule to resume this meeting, the Investment Commission said that it was a matter of policy and that it was waiting for further instructions. The statistics compiled by the Investment Commission showed that Shanghai remained the most favorable spot on the mainland for Taiwan's businesses to make investments. Tungwan of Kwangtung ranked second; and Shenchen took third. For the first time, the city of Tientsin squeezed itself into the rankings to take fourth. Amoy ranked fifth. A large amount of investments went to the manufacturing of basic metal products amounting to US$51.59 million in value. As for the number of projects, as many as 48 projects approved were in the manufacture of electric and electronic appliances and products. Apparently the aforementioned figure announced by the Investment Commission sharply differs from the US$10 billion quoted by the mainland source as the total amount of Taiwan businessmen's investments there. The Investment Commission believes that the figure quoted by the mainland source may possibly include the amount of investments that the Taiwan businesses had preliminarily promised to make. As for the credibility of the figure revealed by the Investment Commission, the commission pointed out that since last year when Taiwan businesses with investments in the mainland were asked to register once again, the majority of them had complied with the request. Thus, the figures should be quite reliable. However, an official of the Investment Commission pointed out: Many entrepreneurs with investments in the mainland have failed to register themselves for their mainland investments and their cases were reported to the authorities by other businessmen. Scores of such cases were handled by the Investment Commission. Huang Ching-tang, head of the commission, said that the commission will check and verify the cases. If they are found to be true, these entrepreneurs will be fined between 3 million and 15 million yuan in accordance with the Regulation on Relations Between Peoples Across the Straits.
