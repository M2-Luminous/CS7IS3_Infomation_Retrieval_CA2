[Hluchanova] Is it the Democratic Party [DS] that hampers the implementation of the proposal for right-wing entities to participate in the elections on KDH slates of candidates? [Miklos] No. I see a problem in whether there will be readiness to seek a better solution than the one proposed by the KDH. [Hluchanova] What is your idea of forming a right-wing bloc? [Miklos] The Christian Democrats' proposal does not offer the possibility of forming a right-wing bloc. There is to be a ticket of a single party and not a common ticket of several political entities with similar programs. A common ticket could be far more successful from the viewpoint of both maximizing electoral gains and minimizing the risk of votes getting lost. [Hluchanova] Are there any differences of opinion between you and DS Chairman Pavel Hagyari on this issue? [Miklos] From the viewpoint of our present attitude toward the need to seek other possibilities of uniting the right-wing parties, our views are identical. However, this does not necessarily mean the same standpoint in the event of a final decision.
