Secretary Pu Chaozhu pointed out: Since 1993, the province's township and town enterprises have extricated themselves from protracted stagnation and slow growth and started embarking on a multilevel rapid growth, with the result that their total income topped 21 billion yuan in 1993, up by 71 percent over the year before. Moreover, in the January-April period of this year, the province's township and town enterprises still witnessed sustained and high-rate growth, with the result that their total income in the period registered a 67 percent increase over the corresponding period of last year. The province's total township and town enterprise income is expected to have topped 33 billion yuan by the end of the year. Secretary Pu Chaozhu noted: Nevertheless, we should not be overly optimistic about the existing achievements. Rather, we should make continued efforts to work hard to secure an average annual increase of 50 percent or more in the province's township and town enterprise income. Only by so doing will we be able to narrow the gap between the country's economically developed regions and Yunnan Province and bring about a comparatively comfortable livelihood across the province. Secretary Pu Chaozhu put forth the following four specific views on ensuring sustained and high-rate township and town enterprise growth in the province: 1. It is imperative to further emancipate the mind and acquire a clearer understanding of the strategic importance of township and town enterprise development. To this end, all levels and departments concerned across the province should strengthen coordination, cooperation, and determination with a view to securing high-rate township and town enterprise growth across the province for several years to come and raising township and town enterprise output value to over 70 percent of the province's total rural output value. Under no circumstances, Pu Chaozhu noted, should we err in this regard. 2. It is imperative to seek truth from facts and suit measures to local conditions. To this end, the province should first and foremost concentrate on developing several primary industries with an eye on building about 10 backbone local industries with output value exceeding 100 million yuan each over the next seven to 10 years. 3. Deep-going reforms have all along been the motive force behind sustained and high-rate township and town enterprise development. The township and town enterprises across the province should first try to implement a joint-stock system on a trial basis; ensure compensated transfer to peasants or collectives of such rights as exploiting, managing, and using exploitable barren hills, slopes, shores, and fields without altering the existing ownership system; actively readjust the ownership system structure; push ahead with individual economic and private enterprise development; bring about a balanced growth of state-owned, collective, and individual economies; and sell, lease, amalgamate, or privatize small state-owned enterprises in various counties, thereby invigorating this group of small enterprises and turning them into private enterprises in terms of ownership and management. 4. It is imperative to strengthen leadership over township and town enterprises. To this end, party committees and people's governments should be bold in taking risks, undertaking responsibility, and proceeding from actual conditions. All areas across the province should take township and town enterprise development as an important criterion for appraising work done by party and government cadres; establish a responsibility system under which party and government cadres are required to attain clear-cut goals regarding township and town enterprise development; award cadres who have contributed to such development and punish cadres who have failed in pushing such development forward; and strive to mobilize enthusiasm among the broad masses of cadres and people of all nationalities across the province in promoting township and town enterprise development.
