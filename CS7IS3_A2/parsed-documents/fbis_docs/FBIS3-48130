"I think the political reform bills are sure to be passed by the Diet because there are still opportunities for negotiations," Hata told a meeting with business executives at a Tokyo hotel. Hata, who is also head of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), said the package can still be approved either by a joint panel of both houses of the Diet or by a two-thirds majority at the House of Representatives. The House of Councillors rejected the package of four bills Friday. Seventeen rebel members of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest force in the ruling coalition, joined members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party and Japanese Communist Party to vote down the package. Hata said the enactment of the four reform bills, which would introduce a new election system and measures designed to curtail corruption, would produce "dynamism" in Japanese politics because it would activate stalled debates in the Diet. He brushed aside suggestions for corruption prevention measures to be enacted before overall political reform, saying the root of political corruption lies in the current multiseat constituency system. Touching on the sluggish economy, Hata predicted that the future of Japan's economy is not so gloomy, although it is unlikely to recover immediately. He told the audience of executives and managers from across Japan that compiling of the state budget and carrying out deregulations are essential for the economy, saying it would boost demand in Japan, open markets for other countries and improve public life. The foreign minister expressed willingness for Japan to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, saying Japan has various techniques and know-how to offer to the world besides money and that its role is to extend them to the world. Hata said Japan should take initiatives on the international scene and put forward its own proposals.
