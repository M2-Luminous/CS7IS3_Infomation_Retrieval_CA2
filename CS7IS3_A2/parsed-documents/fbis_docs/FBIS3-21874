Political reaction to a proposal letting drug addicts escape punishment if they agree to undergo treatment is positive. A broad political majority in the Folketing supports the Progressive Party's proposal to let drug addicts escape a prison term by undergoing treatment to recover from their addiction. This can be seen from a poll conducted by BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. "It is completely insane to put these young people behind bars. They will not be rehabilitated that way," says the vice chairman of the Judicial Committee, Ebba Strange (SF [Socialist People's Party]): "The criminal code provides for the possibility to sentence people to undergo treatment. This opportunity should be used somewhat more, and more treatment centers should be provided." The Progress Party's proposal is aimed at drug users who commit crimes related to their drug abuse. This proposal was submitted a short time after the proposal from the Conservatives concerning, among other things, life terms for financial kingpins in the drug world. Liberal Party Agrees "We agree in fact with both proposals, to say it in a radical way," Birthe Ronn Hornbech, the Progressive Party's legal spokesperson, says: "The financial kingpins should be hunted down, [while at the same time] the addicts must be helped. Just punishing the addicts does not accomplish this, so let us try sentencing addicts to undergoing treatment. We already have a corresponding arrangement for drunk drivers. But there must be a relationship to the crimes they have committed." Viggo Fischer, the Conservatives' spokesperson in narcotics matters, is not enthusiastic about the proposal, but is willing to discuss treatment in lieu of punishment in cases of low-level crime and first offenders. "But this must be under the condition that the addicts continue with their treatment -- by force if necessary. Our goal is to have treatment take place in drug-free prison wards," Fischer says. As mentioned in BERLINGSKE TIDENDE yesterday, the Progress Party also proposes that the treatment of drug abusers be financed by the national government rather than the present arrangement where it is being paid for by the counties and the municipalities, and that an independent council be created to furnish information about drugs and drug abuse. Positive Initiative "The Progress Party has presented a surprisingly positive initiative," says Frank Jensen, the political spokesman for the Social Democratic Party, who is especially happy about the idea of providing treatment rather than punishment and the proposal about government financing. The political parties disagree as to the need for government financing, and both the Liberal Party and the Conservatives reject the need for an independent drug council. Drug Addict: Everyone Will Accept A drug-addicted prostitute from Vesterbro in Copenhagen says that all the addicts she knows will accept an offer to avoid prison by accepting drug treatment. "Yes, definitely. Everyone I know will accept. For sure." The 29-year-old addicted prostitute who used the name "Maria" has no doubt. If she was offered treatment so she could overcome her addiction and thereby avoid prison when she had stolen money, credit cards, or checks from her customers, she would accept. "Maria" approves of the proposal from the Progress Party to the help drug addicts who commit crimes arising from their abuse. "They should be offered treatment instead of prison.'' ``All addicts would like to be helped, but treatment that lasts only four months does not have much effect.'' ``And there is not sufficient capacity to treat everybody.'' "It does not do any good when nobody is there to take care of you when you sit there crying, having a hell of a time, and are ready to quit," "Maria" says. We met "Maria" at Halmtorvet, and over a Jolly Cola at Freddy's Bar she tells us that she has been an addict since she was 11 years old. "Cocaine and heroin. I spend 1,800 kroner a day on drugs. I walk the streets to make the money, and I have been convicted of having stolen cash, checks, and credit cards from my customers," "Maria" says. Her face is sunken and pale, she has lost several teeth, "they were knocked out" and her neck and hands bear signs of drug abuse over many years. She is dressed completely in black, boots, pants, shirt, coat. She tells us that she has been in prison four times--every time because of drugs. She was off drugs for four years when she lived at Jutland, but as soon as she returned to Vesterbro, she went back to the needle. Treatment Opportunity Unused Drug treatment: A catastrophic lack of treatment centers is the reason why so many addicts end up in jail rather than in treatment centers, according to a physician. Even now the criminal code offers the possibility of sentencing drug addicts to treatment rather than incarceration, but this possibility is mostly unused. "It is relatively rare that someone is sentenced to treatment because there is a lack of treatment centers and because it is expensive," says Peter Ege, the director of medicine of Copenhagen county. "Maybe it happens 20 times a year that someone is sentenced to treatment. This must be seen in relation to the fact that there are about 1,100 drug addicts in prison," he says. Ege's remarks come in response to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's comments yesterday on four proposals that the Progress Party will submit next week. These proposals are to the effect that drug addicts who commit crimes stemming from their drug abuse shall be offered treatment instead of incarceration; that the treatment shall be financed by the national government instead of by the counties as it is at present; that a council for information about drug abuse be created, and that a treatment model like the one in Rome, where 85 out of 100 people go through a drug treatment plan, be adapted for Danish conditions. "It would be wonderful if treatment could be government financed, because it is not reasonable that Copenhagen County should pay for the treatment of all the addicts in the country," Ege says, while still being somewhat doubtful that it is economically and politically realistic to expect the proposal to be carried out. There is capacity to treat about 2,000 addicts while there are at least 10,000 addicts. Ege realizes that the capacity for treatment must reach 3,000-4,000 to meet the need. There is especially a need for 24-hour care centers, he says. Director Jorgen Green, the head of Storstroms County Youth Center in Vordingborg, says that the Progress Party's proposal will remedy the problems created by the funding [mechanism] of the drug measures. The efforts to furnish treatment have been made without any oversight by the government, and they have suffered from the counties' and municipalities' budgetary cutbacks with the result that drug abusers ended up in jail instead. By letting money for treatment and prison administration come from the same source, the treasury, solutions based on economic considerations can be avoided when it comes to choosing between treatment and prison, Green opines. "An increase in the number of drug related deaths cannot be seen as a result of the efforts of the police or as a rise in drug abuse, but must be regarded first and foremost as a sign of both poor quantity and quality in drug treatment and a lack of concerted action against drug abuse in Denmark," Green says. Both he and Ege approve on the whole of the Progress Party's four proposals, and they agree that in the long run they will lead to large savings for, among other things, the judicial system, because successfully treating drug addicts will lead to less crime; crime that the addicts commit in order to get money for drugs.
