In light of the progress made by the two teams concerning military issues, notably a cease-fire agreement and the formation of the future armed forces, the Luanda government should have announced a unilateral cease-fire as a show of good faith. Given that UNITA had already announced its unilateral cease-fire, such a measure would have allowed a general cease-fire to have been in place throughout Angolan territory, and the Lusaka peace talks could have continued without cannons firing away on the battlefield. That did not happen, though. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] has a negotiating team in Lusaka, but inside the country the Futungo de Belas Palace leadership is determined to continue its military offensive against UNITA-controlled areas. It has been receiving massive military aid from Russia, Brazil, and Spain. It has also been joined by mercenaries of various nationalities, thereby showing complete disrespect for the peace efforts being made by UNITA -- which sent a team to Lusaka to negotiate peace -- by the UN special representative in Angola, and that portion of the international community that means well, all of which are interested in a peaceful settlement to the conflict that has been devastating the country. The events that have been marking the daily lives of Angolans clearly show that, far from wanting peace for Angola, the Luanda government is rather more interested in a military solution. That position has been made all the clearer in recent statements by unelected Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the top Futungo de Belas chieftain, and Joao de Matos, People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola chief of General Staff, when he addressed a ceremony where new officers received their stripes. Joao de Matos noted on that occasion that those officers would now lead their military units on the combat fronts. Taking into account the fact that the Angolan people anxiously want peace and that the Angolan economy is in chaos -- and showing every tendency to deteriorate even further -- it would have been expected that the sole combat front should have been Lusaka. All honest people wanting peace in Angola have turned their attention to the Lusaka peace talks. Eduardo dos Santos and his warmongering sidekicks are insisting on shellings and air bombardments, but such acts can only worsen the people's already very depressing social and economic conditions. Jose Eduardo dos Santos continues to show quite clearly that he is only concerned with staying in power. He did not obtain the necessary 51 percent of the vote, so he usurped power by carrying out tribal massacres at the end of October and in the first days of November 1992. Those events led to war, causing confusion that has been used by the Futungo de Belas Palace leadership to enrich themselves. Despite all that, the Angolan people remain hopeful about the Lusaka peace talks which, they hope, will provide the correct solutions to the grave problems facing Angolan society. Through its concessions, UNITA has been making negotiation possible in the Zambian capital. Despite many provocations by the MPLA-PT forces, the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FALA, have continued to observe the unilateral cease-fire declared by UNITA. UNITA has recognized the Bicesse Accord and the results of the fraudulent September 1992 elections. Furthermore, UNITA has also accepted the UN resolutions on Angola. Such courageous steps reflect UNITA leadership's good will and have ensured progress at the Lusaka peace talks. The MPLA-PT government had been reluctant and had continued to stick to its obsolete theories, which reflect its desire to keep Angola and all its people under its totalitarian and monolithic regime, but it has been forced to give in. Now, there is talk that an accord has been reached concerning the future national police force issue. For a long time, the Angolan people did not have a police force that defended their interests, so now they are happy about this important step forward at the talks. For the better part of a month, the UNITA negotiating team defended the creation of a new national police force that will serve the Angolan people, contrary to what has happened so far, where the so-called police force is an army pursuing social instability in the country. The Angolan people were happy to learn that UNITA will substantively participate in the future national police force. No one will be detained without having undergone trial. The Futungo de Belas leaders got us used to having the police rob, detain, and kill people without trial. Such a confused situation's days are numbered. A national police force with a substantial UNITA presence will be a source of pride to the Angolan people, and it will serve all citizens. There will be respect for the law and for public order. Now that discussions on the national police dossier have been wound up, other fundamental political issues are to be viewed, notably the political and administrative [words indistinct] the status of opposition political parties, freedom of the press, a government of national unity that fosters national reconciliation, the status of UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, and a redefinition of acting President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos' powers. Those are, among others, the issues that the negotiators must contend with from now on. May good sense prevail! May Angolans be able to understand each other for the sake of higher interests! Let us all unite behind the same ideals! There will be peace, national reconciliation, and peaceful coexistence because the Angolan people desire them. Lusaka is the beacon of hope.
