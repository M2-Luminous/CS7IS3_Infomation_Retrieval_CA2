The action plan is presented in four functional areas: Political Area Within the framework of a new culture of peace and democracy, ARENA proposes to coordinate legislative actions, strengthen the judiciary, modernize the public sector, and ensure municipal development. The party proposes to coordinate education programs for peace and democracy through the Ministry of Education in coordination with the judicial branch, the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman, and other offices, as well as guaranteeing the development of freedom in all its manifestations. ARENA offers to promote the independence of municipal governments so they can participate in the development of their communities. It proposes to support the advancement of the Legislative Assembly's technical and administrative capabilities so it can respond to a free society. ARENA suggests a foreign policy that will protect the country's interests and the welfare of all Salvadorans living abroad; a foreign policy that will be analogous to Central American integration. The public official morality bill would be modified and the state administrative financial systems would be modernized to prevent illegal enrichment and the abuse of power at all levels and all institutions of the public sector. State of Law and Public Safety ARENA offers to continue improving the entire legal system, especially by reviewing the entire legal process and modernizing the judicial branch, the justice ministry, and other agencies involved. It would create effective instruments to prevent and fight crime and upgrade scientific investigation systems in connection with respecting human dignity as consecrated in the Constitution of the Republic. It offers to consolidate the police modernization process to guarantee citizen security; proclaim citizen rights and duties, including applicable laws; and guarantee the right to property, administration of justice, and citizen security. Economic Development ARENA intends to modernize government institutions to guarantee greater efficiency and responsibility; centralize public administration to do away with bureaucracy; privatize government organizations that should not be managed by government; and maintain a monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure proper public spending. It offers to strengthen the financial system to protect the people's savings and guarantee the system's efficient operations; to increase public investments with an emphasis on personnel training; and to protect consumers by guaranteeing the quality, weight, and measure of products and by implementing supervision mechanisms. The party proposes to gradually reduce tariff and nontariff barriers and promote agricultural and industrial conversions to increase competitiveness and exports. Social Development ARENA intends to modernize social programs in the health, education, and housing sectors by decentralizing them and training communities and beneficiaries to participate in their implementation. It will reinforce programs that promote equal opportunities by training personnel in the informal sector, the micro and small business sectors, and the peasant sector. The party will suggest social programs to attack the causes of poverty at its roots and increase workers productivity with new technology and opportunities. It plans to change municipal governments so they can identify problems, implement solutions, and assign resources. It also suggests that nongovernmental organizations and the private sector carry out development programs in the communities. The health and education budgets will be strengthened. Income will be redistributed to focus on those sectors and direct subsidies will be assigned. Property ownership will be facilitated by simplifying procedures and giving credit in a timely manner. ARENA offers to modernize the social security system by improving its quality and coverage. It proposes an environmental strategy and policies to ensure that land be used properly and according to its properties. It offers to strengthen the micro and small business sectors so they increase in number, improve in competitiveness, and boost participation in the market.
