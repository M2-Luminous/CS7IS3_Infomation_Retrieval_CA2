The stumbling block at these talks -- this is the third round -- is differences between Moscow and Pyongyang over the legal status of the loggers in Siberia. The old agreement, signed back in the time of developed socialism, allowed the Korean authorities to dispense justice in the logging camps in accordance with North Korean laws. But the agreement expired last December. Moscow does not rule out the probability of violations of the code of the builders of communism occurring in the logging camps: You cannot really expect refined behavior from operators of the "Druzhba" gasoline-driven saw, even if they are dedicated to the chuche idea. But Moscow is nonetheless insisting that citizens of the "land of morning freshness" -- North Korea -- working in Siberia should now enjoy all the democratic rights enjoyed by the citizens of the "country building capitalism" -- Russia. For example, the right to strike, an eight-hour working day, and the opportunity to move anywhere, provided they have papers. "If these demands are not heeded there will be no agreement," Valentin Moiseyev, chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Korea department, said. He described as "rubbish" an AP report the other day that North Korea has lately been evacuating its loggers from Siberia, in order to deprive them of the opportunity to "choose freedom" and flee to South Korea. Citing sources in the South Korean capital, the agency insists that at least 170 fugitive loggers have taken refuge in remote camps in the taiga in the hope of being able to get to the southern part of the historic homeland. Pyongyang regards them as having been "kidnapped" by Seoul, where a special commission has even been set up to resolve matters related to the resettlement of former loggers. Seoul is rather afraid that there might by spies working for Kim Il-song, not to mention criminals, among them. The problem is complicated by the fact that the fugitives have to be taken at their word: Their identity cards are permanently held by the labor camps they have left. Valentin Moiseyev tends to take a sardonic view of stories of supposed atrocities by Pyongyang special services in Khabarovsk Kray. According to Foreign Ministry data, only four fugitive loggers have gotten to South Korea so far, and illegally at that -- which, as a matter of fact, was unnecessary: Russia would neither help nor hinder loggers wishing to go either to North or to South Korea. The talk of tortured dissidents and of a prison regime in these logging camps may turn out to be untrue, if only because Kim Il-song's loggers are little different from the so-called Soviet workers abroad who resisted evacuation from Iraq during the war in the Persian Gulf or from battle-torn Yemen. The loggers are highly paid by North Korean standards, and many of them bribed officials at home to get the chance to wield an ax in Siberian temperatures of 60 below. According to Valentin Moiseyev, the North Koreans' selfless work in the Siberian taiga means a net profit for our country. Two-thirds of what they fell -- and that is three million cubic meters of timber per year -- stays in Russia. It is not inconceivable that the problem of fugitive loggers will be touched on at the talks with DPRK Deputy Foreign Minister Li Yen Gu [name as transliterated], who is in Moscow. The story is that the senior diplomat's talks will cover the whole range of bilateral relations, including Russia's proposal on holding an international conference on security problems on the Korean peninsula.
