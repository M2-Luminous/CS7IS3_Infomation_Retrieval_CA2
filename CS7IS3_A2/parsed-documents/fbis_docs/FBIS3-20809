The publication, which was prepared in a million copies, cost 26 million forints for printing and 15 million for mailing, which was absorbed by the budget of the National Information Office [NTI]. According to opposition opinions, this publication is nothing more than publicly financed election propaganda that suppresses everything negative. NTI head Gyorgy Varga Domokos informed us in response to our questions that the cost of the brochures, which have so far been published in Hungarian and will soon also appear in foreign languages, along with the publicity connected with their publication, has not been more than one-fifth of the office's annual budget. (The NTI's 1994 budget was 190 million forints, with additional funds left over from last year.) Discussing the timing, the office chief believes that it would not have been possible to give an accounting of four years of government activity after only three and a half years, although he would have preferred it if the brochure had appeared a few weeks earlier. Nevertheless, the publishing date was postponed because they wanted to prepare a high-quality publication that contained correct data and was "worthy of all the effort that had been put into it." Another volume will soon appear in several foreign languages and in considerably fewer copies, which will be distributed much more narrowly, mainly to foreign embassies and libraries. This high-quality publication--which will not cost more than 8 million--will not be an account of accomplishments but is intended instead to give an overview of our country's 1,000-year history and the past four years. Both publications serve the NTI's new mission. Previously the office's main job was to continually correct the supposedly distorted international image of the country that was propagated by the press. From now on, however, the NTI wants to improve our image in the long term by providing information about our accomplishments and giving some idea of our culture. In the period before the elections, however, this was their first and at the same time their last large-scale campaign undertaking (with the possible exception of a specialized publication about the change to a market economy, which will appear in fewer copies for a narrower audience.) Nevertheless, according to Gyorgy Varga Domokos, much information should be provided both at home and abroad, because "public opinion must not be left without knowledge of our accomplishments," and it is not even possible to begin the next four-year period without drawing up a balance.
