"We will unify the dual-track advertising-price system as soon as China attains its Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) membership," said an official with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Foreign companies, including overseas-invested firms, have to pay 30 per cent more than their Chinese counterparts to place ads on TV and other media. To prepare for the advertising price reform, the central government already is encouraging step-by-step price increases for Chinese advertisers, Zheng Heping, deputy director of the administration's Advertising Department, told Business Weekly in an exclusive interview. Some media outlets have consequently increased prices. Zheng stressed that increasing the advertising prices for Chinese firms must be accomplished gradually, because the central government has to consider affordability for State-owned firms in particular. The government also is sensitive to the need to make efforts to avoid domination of China's advertising by foreign companies when prices are levelled. China Central Television (CCTV) will, on July 1, take the lead in raising its average advertising rate to 41,000 yuan ($4,713) from the current 39,000 yuan ($4,483) for every three seconds during prime time. This further increase comes on the heels of a 30 per cent price hike by much of the country's media at the beginning of this year. Zheng believes other media units and China's 1,605 local television stations will soon follow CCTV's move. The increasingly wide coverage of television programmes encourages the TV stations to charge much higher advertising rates than other media. Television stations account for at least 22 per cent of the country's total advertising business volume. The administration's latest available figures show the country's advertising sales were 13.4 billion yuan ($1.54 billion) last year, which was up at least 50 per cent from the previous year. Zheng predicted nationwide advertising business growth of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent in 1994. Estimates of growth this year probably would be even higher had there not been substantial advertising price increases at the beginning of this year, he added. The government has launched a trial programme in Guangdong Province to prohibit the province's media units from seeking or meeting clients for advertising business without going through designated advertising companies. He expects similar moves will be carried out nationwide by the turn of this century, he said. Official figures show that, by the end of last year, the country had already set up some 10,000 advertising agencies, up 149 per cent from the previous year. At the same time, the government has come to realize the need to rein force the management of the advertising market. It is still in its infancy, and while the State oversees specific, designated advertising agencies, anyone could still set themselves up to sell space or air time around the country.
