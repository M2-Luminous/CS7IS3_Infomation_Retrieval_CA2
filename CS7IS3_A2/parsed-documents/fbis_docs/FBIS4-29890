The number of calls of U.S. nuclear submarines at ports on the west coast of Japan last year jumped remarkably. The submarines called at the White Beach Base of the U.S. Navy in Okinawa on 17 occasions at maximum and frequent the Sasebo Base in Nagasaki prefecture and the Yokosuka Port. The brisk activities of U.S. nuclear submarines are related to the expanded scope of the the U.S. naval espionage against the DPRK, said ITAR-TASS June 20. The news agency said U.S. nuclear submarines navigating along the shores of the DPRK are specialised in collection of information about the communications network of the Armed Forces of the DPRK and every possible eavesdropping of radio communications. U.S. nuclear submarines enter Sasebo Port of Japan but stay on the waters off the harbour for more than an hour, not anchoring at the wharf, in order to hand over information, experts say. The activation of the espionage of U.S. nuclear submarines near the coast of the DPRK coincides with the intensification of the U.S. hostile campaign to stifle the DPRK.
