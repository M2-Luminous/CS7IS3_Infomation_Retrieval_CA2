The Guatemalan official told ACAN-EFE that the Mexican-Costa Rican agreement is "positive" and added that "we have been closely following the process that Costa Rica was carrying out with Mexico." Nevertheless, he said Guatemala has decided along with Honduras and El Salvador, which form the so-called CA-3 [Central America-3] group, to jointly negotiate an economic agreement with Mexico. "The agreement between Costa Rica and Mexico will serve as an example and a foundation for the negotiations" that will be held with the Mexican authorities, he said. Gonzalez announced that the CA-3 technical groups will meet in El Salvador on 7 and 8 March to continue analyzing a joint mechanism for an economic complementation agreement with Mexico, which jointly with the United States and Canada forms the world's biggest economic bloc. Ministers of the three Central American countries are scheduled to meet with their Mexican counterpart, Herminio Blanco [name as received], on 11 March to analyze the marketing obstacles that some products of the region have in Mexico. Gonzalez said efforts will be made to have the closer trade ties with Mexico lead to Central America's integration into the NAFTA.
