Even after last Friday's concerted intervention overseas by some 16 major central banks, the dollar's weak trend has continued. After hitting a new global postwar low of 99.50 yen in morning Tokyo trading, the dollar closed Monday at 99.93 yen, easily renewing its previous Tokyo closing low of 100.40 yen recorded last Friday. The Bank of Japan actively stepped into the market from the opening to buy up the dollar for the yen in large amounts, which momentarily pushed it up back to 100.30 yen but failed to keep it above 100 yen at the closing. The effect of Monday's intervention by the Bank of Japan was "so- so," considering the somewhat smaller amount than last week, said Kazuo Takayama, foreign exchange director at Barclay's Bank. Coordinated central bank intervention, however, could have impact only in combination with cooperation on monetary policy, Takayama said Washington's stance to defend the dollar was not clear yet with the concerted intervention Friday night, Takayama said. Takayama suggested there is a need for the United States to raise its key interest rates and for Japan and Germany to lower theirs to support the dollar. Considering the dollar's current weakness, vigorous concerted intervention in may turned out to be ineffective in the long run, said Yuko Fukakusa, manager of the treasury division at Tokai Bank. Last Friday's coordinated intervention was also futile, or otherwise created the best chance for selling, because the timing was premature, Fukakusa said. To stop the dollar's further slip, however, intermittent central bank intervention may be a must, Fukakusa said. Although another dive in the dollar could be expected from a short-term point of view, such intervention may have gradual effect to brace the dollar, she said. There is a growing view that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will finally decide to raise its base interest rates to prevent the dollar's further drop, market watchers said. A strategist at Daiwa Institute of Research said there is a need for U.S. monetary authorities to either abandon the present policy of keeping interest rates extremely low, or carry out large-scale concerted intervention. He said, however, since the possibility is remote that the U.S. will hike interest rates, Japan may be forced to cut its official discount rate as an emergency measure. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told reporters Monday that Japan will take "aggressive" action to stem the yen's rise in cooperation with the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations. Fujii declined to comment on possible joint G-7 actions on credit policies, however, saying, "monetary measures are for the central bank to decide." Government officials tried to react calmly but firmly to the dollar's fall below 100 yen, with one official saying, "We will not make a fuss about the yen's appreciation and remain calm." "Our being upset will adversely affect the exchange rate," the official said, while noting that immediate concerted intervention is the only way to check the yen's further rise.
