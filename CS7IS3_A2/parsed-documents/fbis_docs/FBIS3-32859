FBIS3-32859 "drlat031_a_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-031 Document Type:Daily Report 15 Feb 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba U.S. `Fully Responsible' for Incidents at Interests Section FL1402161794 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1255 GMT 14 Feb 94 FL1402161794 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Unattributed "Our Opinion" commentary] [Text] Encouraged by the United States, many Cubans want to emigrate to that northern country. Why has the United States sponsored an incident involving the Interests Section in Havana? What has hurt the United States? Could it be that after 35 years of frustration it can no longer resist a Cuba that keeps resisting, and which in its [word indistinct] has adopted initiatives to facilitate the reunion of Cuban families? Or is it perhaps trying to create incidents with rumors like these, to prevent the meetings called for by Cuba? Or was it perhaps trying with this incident hastily to create charges to justify its groundless accusations against our country at the UN Human Rights Commission, which is meeting in Geneva? Or was it perhaps trying to tarnish the rally it knew was scheduled to be held in New York on 12 February in support of Cuba and the proposal that Charles Rangel will submit to the U.S. Congress demanding the lifting of the blockade? Or perhaps, because of its arrogance, the United States can no longer resist the many blows such as those scored by the success of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's tour of Africa; the great Israeli rabbi's recent remarks about Fidel Castro; Ricardo Alarcon's tour of several European nations; the agreements signed with businessmen from developed nations who have publicly stressed the feasibility of Cuban projects; and of Carlos Lage's successful visit to three Latin American countries? Imperialism, the Miami counterrevolution, and the warmongers disguised as dissidents are fully and exclusively responsible for the incident. Cuba does not implement any coercive policy; neither does it have any military base in any country whatsoever, nor does it finance radio or television stations against any government, nor does it lend its territory to shelter terrorist organizations with all material and radio means to promote incidents like this one. The strength of the Cuban policy is based on its universally recognized justice, its clear openness, and its loyalty to the principles it proclaims. The embassies in Cuba will always have the necessary protection and facilities to carry out their activities and provide security to their staffs, who also have the moral obligation not to promote incidents which have nothing to do with their diplomatic roles. Trying to hold the Cuban press responsible for this incident because of the recent publication of a number of works on the emigration issue is a maneuver by certain U.S. sectors which can have no other objective than trying to disguise the true origin of the problem. It is childish to try to hold those who condemn and denounce such an action responsible for it. Once again it is confirmed that the streets of this country belong to and will belong to revolutionaries. Under no pretext will anyone jeopardize the fatherland's independence. The economy is experiencing a special period, but the dignity and decency of a people who are displaying heroism will never be at stake. Today we must be more alert than ever. What imperialism could not achieve at Playa Giron or during the past 35 years, it is now trying to achieve, as in the 1960's, by spreading lies and rumors that could create incidents propitious for its goals. It is not the Cuban Government that must give explanations to the people who might go to the U.S. Interests Section, but rather the U.S. officials. Surely they have publicly explained their rules for the issuance of visas, which will help dispel the false rumors and unfounded illusions created. Our action and our duty, clearly outlined during the incident, are strictly based on the obligations of a nation and have been fulfilled impartially and efficiently. Cuba will continue granting all guarantees to those who are authorized by the United States to travel or to emigrate to that country. Nothing happened within the U.S. Interests Section. There is not a single Cuban citizen inside the building. No one was either injured or wounded. With the dispelling of the rumor, everything returned to normal. However, this type of incident or irresponsibility can provoke more serious consequences, all the responsibility for which will fall upon the promoters. This incident will serve as a lesson to the unscrupulous perpetrators of this ordeal. No one will ever step on the Revolution, because to step on the Revolution means to step on the courage and resolution of millions of Cubans who believe neither lies nor rumors when they must defend their country's integrity.
