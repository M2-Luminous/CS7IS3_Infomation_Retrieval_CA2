The reshuffle was done in this way despite the fact that lately the government party and the other parliamentary parties had been engaged in a dialogue, Roman said. Such consultations would have been necessary, he assessed, as some of the offices subjected to the reshuffle are important for our national interests. Regarding the talks conducted by PD representatives with the leaders of PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania], Roman said that actually they were discussions rather than negotiations merely intended to clear up certain things. However, consultations and the dialogue have to be continued in order to concretely solve the problems and sorrows of the people. The PD leader said that the current government seems to be detached from reality, which is a serious matter, considering the way the people's problems and sorrows have accumulated. Those who bear high responsibility in our society ought to show interest for all such problems, Roman pointed out, saying that the time is ripe for a program of hope and confidence.
