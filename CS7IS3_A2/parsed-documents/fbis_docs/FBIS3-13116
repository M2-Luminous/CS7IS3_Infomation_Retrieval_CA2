But he insisted that the fate of the settlements is an internal Israeli affair, completely divorced from the current negotiations with the PLO. Peres also told foreign correspondents Israel does not have the money to meet settler demands for compensation in return for evacuation. [passage omitted] Peres told reporters that the government does not have the political power to evacuate Jews from settlements. He insisted that the government would seek to convince the public that this needs to be done, but it cannot come as result of PLO demands. When asked about the wisdom of having settlements remain, Peres said removing them would cause a deep schism in the country. "We wanted to push through an agreement with minimum opposition. That is one of the reasons why we insisted the settlements remain where they are. We thought that any different approach would split the nation beyond recognition," he said. When pressed by reporters on the idea of compensating settlers who wish to leave, Peres scoffed at the notion. "They are talking about very large amounts of money," he said. We aren't forcing them to leave, so why should we pay compensation? In Sinai, since the government forced them to leave, there was reason to compensate them. If we start with compensation, it will be an endless story. I don't think we have to do it."
