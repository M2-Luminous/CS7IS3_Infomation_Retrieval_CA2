FBIS4-1580 "drchi063_v_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-063 Daily Report 6 Mar 1994 TAIWAN MAC Official on GATT Membership, Cross-Strait Trade MAC Official on GATT Membership, Cross-Strait Trade OW0104101794 Taipei Voice of Free China in English 0200 GMT 6 Mar 94 OW0104101794 Taipei Voice of Free China English BFN [From the "News" program] [Text] Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, Friday [4 March] said Taiwan's future admission to the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, does not mean a collapse in the ROC [Republic of China] Government's policy to keep trade and transportation with Mainland China on indirect basis. Also the cross-strait ties will not be altered simply because both Taipei and Peking are expected to join GATT in foreseeable future. The GATT membership and cross-strait relations are two different issues, Kao explained, judging that the government's mainland policy is governed by national reunification guidelines. The guidelines state very clearly that direct trade and transportation will not be allowed until the two sides enter the medium phase of the unification, Kao said. Although GATT asked members to remove trade barriers and abide by the principle of free trade in open market, Taipei and Peking can still apply Article 21 instead 35 to exclude each other for enjoying a cross-strait trading privilege.
