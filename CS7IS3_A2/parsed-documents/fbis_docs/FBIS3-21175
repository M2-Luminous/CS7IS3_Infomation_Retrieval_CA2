This was the first compound semiconductor created under microgravity conditions, and the biggest monocrystal created in space. In the experiment, the suspension zone fusion method was used in which materials were suspended in space without containers. The materials used were indium and antimony. The monocrystal that was grown was 20-30mm in diameter and 100mm long, and this diameter is 4 times the monocrystals grown on earth.
