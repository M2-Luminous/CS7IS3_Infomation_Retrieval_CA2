He explained to us why his country is interested in East Europe. The third annual meeting of EBRD governors closed last night in St. Petersburg with a general feeling of satisfaction. [EBRD President] Jacques de Larosiere thanked the 33 governors who had "given their wholehearted support" for his strategy. He anticipated that 1994 would not be a highly profitable year for the bank: "Costs are high because of the new priorities approved by the shareholders." He added that major investments would be required for the EBRD to be present in each of the 25 countries of operation and to finance priority aid to small businesses. Moroccan Finance Minister Mohamed Sagou came to Russia as an EBRD governor. Here are the impressions of one of the bank's few southern representatives. [Hennion] Why is Morocco a member of the EBRD? [Sagou] We were asked to take part. Our participation of 0.1 percent is the same as that of Egypt and the countries of the former socialist bloc. Morocco has close ties with Europe and does two-thirds of its business with the continent. That is why we are interested in European aid to help Eastern countries adapt to the market economy. [Hennion] Are you pleased with the way the EBRD's operates? [Sagou] Yes, but we are above all pleased with the business potential that the transformation of these countries represents for Morocco. This is the first time I visited St. Petersburg: They lack a lot here. Morocco has much to offer to Russia, in particular agro-food products and textiles. [Hennion] What about the other countries of East Europe? [Sagou] You cannot provide for everyone. [Hennion] You have come from Marrakesh, where the GATT trade agreements were ratified. What will profit Morocco most: The fact that they were signed in Marrakesh, or the agreements themselves? [Sagou] Both. First, this was an historic event that will improve other countries' awareness of Morocco. In the longer term, the GATT agreements are going to open up markets. That will present us with an industrial challenge: Industry has to be competitive. That is why it is important to maintain our privileged trading relations with the countries of Europe. [Hennion] Morocco is often cited as an example by the IMF. What do you think will happen at the interim committee meeting to be held in Washington on Friday? [Sagou] Morocco has successfully implemented an adjustment policy: Inflation is under control at less than 5 percent, the budget deficit is less than 2 percent, and our economic growth rate is 4 percent. [Hennion] What about unemployment? [Sagou] That is one of our weak points. It averages around 16-17 percent. It is precisely to reduce unemployment in southern countries that I hope that the Washington meeting will decide on a better distribution of financial flows between the North and the South. Public aid aimed at restructuring economies or modernizing infrastructures should be redirected to the South.
