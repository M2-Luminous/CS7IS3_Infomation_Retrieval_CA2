At the entrance to Villanueva, groups of people stoned several buses as a way of protesting against the strike called by the owners of intercity buses, which has left hundreds of passengers on the streets. These people were unable to reach their workplaces because of the lack of mass transit buses. At the time of the attack on the buses, which were severely damaged, several people were injured, including children who were assisted by municipal and volunteer firemen who quickly arrived at the scene. Policemen at the scene arrested three men caught stoning the buses. The detainees were taken to the National Police station in Villanueva and turned over to the courts. Similar incidents of violence were reported in Boca del Monte, Villa Canales, San Miguel Petapa, and other municipalities that were adversely affected by the transportation strike. We can also report that a bomb threat took place at La Quinta Shopping Center this morning in Zone 7 of the capital. The offices of the CNT and other associations are located in this shopping center, and it is believed the false bomb threat was aimed at the bus owners who decided to go on strike starting on 1 February. Firemen and National Police patrols arrived at the scene where they proceeded to search the place very thoroughly without finding anything. Normal activities at the shopping center were suspended while the authorities conducted the search. As is already known, the CNT, among other requests, is demanding that the government enact an intercity bus service law, approve a law to regulate the operation of shipping companies that operate in the country, approve an increase in cement transportation fares, authorize higher fuel transportation rates, and keep border customs offices open at night. CNT President Miguel Angel Luna said the strike currently has the support of 80 percent of the CNT's members. He added that some attacks against several members of the transportation sector have already occurred, especially in Villanueva.
