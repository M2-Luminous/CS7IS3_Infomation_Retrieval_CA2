He did so in anticipation of reorganization of the political environment, which is expected to gather momentum immediately following approval of the political reform bills. Hosokawa ultimately aims to create a political system led by "two major parties" by forming a political power base strong enough to compete with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Hosokawa envisions yet another new party to be formed from the merger of the Japan New Party, Sakigake [Harbinger] (led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura), and Shinseito at some point in the future. It will be different from the "moderate multiparty system" of the past. Most JNP members and some Sakigake members have already expressed support for Hosokawa's plan. The prime minister's plan will inevitably have a major impact on changes in the political scene. Since the potential parties' merger is related to developments at Diet deliberations on political reform bills, each party is likely to be quite active when the extraordinary Diet session resumes. The prime minister met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura and other members of Sakigake at a Tokyo hotel on the evening of 31 December and exchanged opinions on political realignment, including Hosokawa's idea on the merger of the three parties. Reportedly, Takemura disapproved of the idea. However, it is said that under Hosokawa's plan, the JNP and Sakigake would merge as early as February after the end of the extraordinary Diet session, according to sources close to Hosokawa; Shinseito would join them later. With the JNP acting as an intermediary, the three parties would form a nucleus later to be joined by Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party, LDP members who desire political reform, and liberal reform-minded members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. Hosokawa devised these plans for the following reasons: 1) it is necessary to consolidate a power base within the ruling coalition parties to prevent the LDP from regaining power; 2) because both the JNP and Shinseito are new conservative parties, there are few differences between the parties' political ideas and basic policies; and 3) if the heiretsu formula of combining single-seat constituencies and proportional representation is introduced to the lower house as a result of the Diet's passage of the political reform bills, the change will likely initiate a shift toward a system featuring two large parties. In this connection, a senior official of the JNP who is close associate of the prime minister clearly stated the following in a YOMIURI SHIMBUN interview on 31 December: "It appears that the prime minister is planning for an eventual grand merger among all ruling coalition parties. However, for the time being at least, he wants his party to merge with Shinseito." When he met with Satsuki Eda, director general of the Environment Agency, on 26 December, the prime minister reportedly touched on the issue of reorganizing the political world, saying: "A merger with Sakigake only is too small. I am of the view that a greater change will occur." Eda plans to actively take part in such a reorganization. The JNP and Shinseito formed a joint group within the House of Representatives (which was also joined by the Democratic Reform Parliamentary Group) in November 1993. It is said that they formed the group in "preparation for a future merger," (according to a senior JNP official). However, Takemura makes a clear distinction between his party and the Shinseito-Komeito bloc. Therefore, it is said that he aims to form a coalition with LDP members who want political reform and other groups after the merger with the JNP. Reportedly, Takemura is wary of the idea of forming an alliance with Shinseito. From this stance, Takemura tried to reconcile different views at the 31 December meeting. The prime minister explained his position: "It does not mean that I promised to form a merger with Shinseito. However, as Sakigake and the JNP unite together, we must give due consideration to Shinseito." In this way, he explained his view of tackling the issue of merging Sakigake and JNP while keeping an eye on the possibility of forming a merger with Shinseito. However, Takemura and some Sakigake members are not favorably disposed toward Shinseito, which played a central role in LDP politics. Some JNP members disagree with Shinseito's political style as well. It can be said that the prime minister's concept will have a subtle impact on the issue of the merger between the JNP and Sakigake.
