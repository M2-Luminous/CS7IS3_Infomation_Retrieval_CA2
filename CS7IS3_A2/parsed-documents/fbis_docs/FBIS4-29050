The two parties are narrowing differences as much as possible during the current ongoing working-level auto trade talks, said the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), who declined to be named. But difficult issues will be left to the next stage of talks which may be held next week at the earliest between Sozaburo Okamatsu, MITI vice chief for international affairs, and Jeffrey Garten, U.S. commerce undersecretary for international trade, the official said, indicating that the controversial issue of how to set "objective criteria" in gauging openness of Japan's auto markets will be suspended. Japan and the U.S. held working-level talks in Tokyo on Monday and Tuesday and will continue into an unscheduled third day Wednesday. The senior MITI official said the two countries next week will resume talks designed to expand foreign access to Japan's glass market, a topic newly added to the priority fields of the trade "framework" negotiations.
