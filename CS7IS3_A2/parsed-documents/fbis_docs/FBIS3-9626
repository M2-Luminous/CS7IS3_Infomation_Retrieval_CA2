In reply to a question as to whether the pardons have anything to do with the visit of the Council of Europe rapporteurs, Chebeleu answered in the affirmative, to the extent that some of the rapporteurs have brought up the issue of certain interventions made by the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] in this respect. In connection with President Iliescu's meeting with the chief editors of the main dailies on 21 March, Traian Chebeleu said that two letters are now being drafted to be sent to Petre Mihai Bacanu [chief editor of ROMANIA LIBERA] and Ion Cristoiu [chief editor of EVENIMENTUL ZILEI], explaining the exact purpose of the meeting. The spokesman denied rumors that the government has revised its decision to appoint General Niculae Spiroiu as our country's representative at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
