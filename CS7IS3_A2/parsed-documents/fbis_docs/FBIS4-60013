The brother president and supreme commander of the Armed Forces said: This fighting, which was imposed on our people and Armed Forces by the gang of apostasy and secession in the Socialist Party leadership, has made it incumbent on the masses of our people, headed by our Armed Forces--the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy--to rise in defense of the dearest of their national aims and confront the remnants of apostasy and secession, who sold their consciences, and abandoned the values of belonging to this homeland and their loyalty to its martyrs who shed their blood for the sake of the unity of the homeland--land and people. The brother supreme commander of the Armed Forces praised the high morale of the officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers of our Armed Forces--the forces of unity and legitimacy. He greeted this high militant spirit and the splendid combat performance as embodied by the heroes in the arenas of national struggle in defense of the gains of the Yemeni revolution and people. In his speech, the brother president invoked mercy on the souls of martyrs, who sacrificed their lives so the banner of unity and Republic of Yemen will continue to fly as high as the mountains of Yemen and as solid as the solidity of its blessed, brave sons. He stressed that the state will look after the families and children of martyrs and will extend to them all good care and sound education. He stressed the importance of maintaining discipline and vigilance and care for the people's interests. He said officers, noncommissioned, and soldiers in the battle should set an example to others with good conduct, high discipline, and the sense of responsibility and the noble mission they are performing for the sake of the people, homeland, and unity. Brother Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil, minister of the interior, accompanied the brother chairman of the Presidential Council.
