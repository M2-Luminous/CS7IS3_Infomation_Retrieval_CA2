According to Yuriy Melnikov, chief of the Interpol National Central Bureau in Russia, an understanding on this score was reached in the course of the 23rd European Interpol Regional Conference. In the words of Melnikov, due to certain telecommunications measures, the system of prompt contacts between police services of 44 countries incorporated in European Interpol will be enhanced. The direct dialogue with colleagues from other countries, noted Melnikov, helped us clear up some particularly acute problems facing Russian law-enforcement officers, such as, the wide-scale penetration into the country of weapons of foreign make, including laser guns being bought by Russian Mafiosi.
