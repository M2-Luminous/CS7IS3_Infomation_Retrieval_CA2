The primary purpose of the grant is to help ``K through 12'' teachers improve math and science education classes for their students and to assist in strengthening math and science education in the public sector. This two year effort will have an estimated cost of $300,000 for the first budget year. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Questions regarding this announcement should be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office, Procurement Division, Mail Stop A7&hyph;80, P.O. Box 550, 825 Jadwin Avenue, Richland, Washington 99352, Attn: Jo Laughlin, Contract Specialist. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In support of DOE's Math/Science Education Action Conference Report of May 1990 which emphasized the critical need for a technologically informed citizenry and the need for American elementary and secondary students to receive increased preparation in math and science in every grade and that teachers must become empowered to prepare this generation of children for lives in the 21st Century, various methods are being explored and pursued to accomplish these aims. Surveys have found that many K&hyph;12 teachers have little or no background in science or need to enhance and update their skills in this field. A science literacy course covering such fields as astronomy, geology, chemistry, math, physics, origins of life, evolution, global warming, electromagnetic fields, population explosion, ionizing radiation and the health effects of radiation, has been developed to increase and stimulate a teacher's interest and understanding of the sciences and the concept of the scientific approach to societal issues involving science and/or technology. Some simple, inexpensive experiments are offered which can be used by the teachers in the classroom to demonstrate scientific principles. Experts in various science fields are utilized as lecturers to provide quality instruction. Teachers who complete the course generally overcome their fears of science and transfer a sense of excitement in science to their students. Dated: April 22, 1994. P.E. Rasmussen, Acting Director Procurement Division, Richland Operations Office. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10571 Filed 5&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
