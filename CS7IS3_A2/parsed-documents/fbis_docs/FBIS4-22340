The Authorities Are Working on the Timely Payment of Wages"] [Text] For the first time, the state has proclaimed its intention strictly to control the timeliness of the payment of wages at all enterprises, including private. This was done through Boris Yeltsin's edict "On Penalties for Violations of the Labor Rights of Citizens," of which the official distribution began yesterday. However, the real significance of the edict is political rather than economic. The main thrust of the edict is quite simple: The president instructs the procuracy to step up the oversight of compliance with the legislation of the Russian Federation on labor and collective contracts and agreements by enterprises, offices, and organizations regardless of the form of ownership and departmental affiliation, "paying special attention to the prevention of instances of delays in the payment of wages." Therefore, the state has officially proclaimed for the first time its intention strictly to control the timeliness of the payment of wages at enterprises with all forms of ownership. Technically, such steps by the authorities may have certain significance for entrepreneurs. Since the right of the employees to receive wages at the times specified in advance is mainly set forth in collective contracts, employers at both state and private enterprises may be accused of violating these contracts in the event that the payments are delayed. Pursuant to the law "On Collective Contracts and Agreements," which was passed in March 1992, individuals representing the employer who are guilty of violating and failing to honor obligations under collective contracts shall be liable to fines in an amount of up to 100 times the size of the minimum wage assessed by courts. However, no actual stricter control by the authorities should be expected in this sphere, given the traditional high case loads of the Russian procuracy and courts, as well as the purely technical difficulties involved in the continuous monitoring of a large number of enterprises. Nonetheless, in individual cases enterprises may, of course, run into problems. For example, a technical delay in financing for many city enterprises may occur in conjunction with the redistribution of the budgetary accounts of the city among authorized banks by a recent decree of the government of Moscow. In view of friction between the federal authorities and those of Moscow, this may very well be used as a pretext to accuse these enterprises of delaying the payment of wages. Under the specific Russian conditions, the significance of the edict on the whole is political rather than economic. In this manner, the authorities have simply pointed up yet again their intention to win the broadest possible support from the population, having selected the problem of delays in the payment of wages precisely because it is virtually the easiest to understand for Russian citizens from among all other economic problems. It is quite safe to say that the new edict is one of the steps calculated to make popular a new slogan of the authorities--the idea of reinforcing the statehood of Russia: A quite significant proportion of the population still views the state primarily as the direct or indirect employer and guarantor of incomes. This is not the least important reason why the government has demonstratively dissociated itself from the practice of delaying the payment of wages to the employees of units financed from the budget as a peculiar method of financial stabilization. It is noteworthy that precisely on the eve of the signing of the edict, the presidium of the government ultimately approved a draft of the programmatic decree "On the Standing of the Russian Economy and Prospects for Its Development in 1994." The decision to fully pay the debt of the budget to enterprises in the sphere financed from the budget in March 1994 is one of the focal points of the decree. This is quite a serious step, given that according to some estimates, such debt comes to 1.9 trillion rubles, and may only be eliminated within a short period of time through additional emission.
