It carried more than 200 refugees, most of them Belgian, as well as 10 Rwandans and around 20 Dutch. All of the passengers were transported to the military hospital in Neder-Over-Heembeek, where they were welcomed by Princess Astrid. A third plane with 400 refugees is expected to arrive this afternoon around 1515. Nearly 450 Belgians have returned from Rwanda thus far. Last night a first plane arrived with 200 evacuees, while 12 Belgians reached the country last night via Koln and seven others via Paris. According to the Army's information service, the rescue operation is generally proceeding as planned. The evacuation normally should last three to four days. The paratroopers are concentrating today on Kigali, where a few hundred Belgians are waiting to be evacuated. The operation is being hampered, however, by gangs, mainly composed of Rwandan Army soldiers, engaged in looting and killing. Meanwhile, rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front reportedly are approaching the capital. All together some 1,000 Belgians remain in Rwanda, but it is not clear how many of those want to be evacuated.
