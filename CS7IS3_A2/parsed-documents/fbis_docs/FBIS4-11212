With this sentence one of the main PC [Communist Party] leaders suggested there is an ongoing process to dissolve the party in order to be reborn as a new leftist faction within the Grand Front. The basic objectives are three: rejuvenate the Communist identity, which has always been associated with the former Soviet Union's model; reduce the target for the government's strong McCarthyism, which had an impact inside the front; and concentrate on the development of the Grand Front -- not as a party -- taking into account the notable result of the 10 April election. This new force would present a battle on programs within the Grand Front "to defend leftist positions." PAGINA 12 spoke with PC national and federal district leaders. In both cases the leaders consulted spoke about the same schedule for reconversion: "six months at the most." According to the party's jargon, the PC's transformation is defined as "the establishment of a political movement within the Grand Front." The partners in the PC's refounding would be some former leaders of other factions within the Grand Front -- People's Encounter members and trade unionists affiliated with the Grand Front -- who would propound a congress for launching the party's refounding. A leader close to PC General Secretary Patricio Echegaray said: "We are not disguising ourselves under false colors. The progressive space has become wider with the 10 April elections, and this would not only entail a change of name but also constitute a way of strengthening a left-wing trend within the Grand Front." [Kollmann] Has the offensive against the Grand Front for having included the PC had a bearing on this refounding? [Echegaray] It is true that some leaders were ill at ease because, as they contended, there were no Communists among the front ranks of the FG [Grand Front] ticket. Anyhow, it was precisely during the McCarthyist campaign when voters massively turned to the FG. Therefore, it is possible to state that nobody opted to vote for other parties instead of the FG on account of our presence. There are those who argue that the FG wants to expel us, but not a word has ever been said to that effect. The process that is about to start has nothing to do with McCarthyist pressure. [Kollmann] Buenos Aires City Communists -- who are the most enthusiastic about dissolving the PC to establish a new movement -- recall two recent events that strained relations within the Grand Front: Echegaray was to have stood as a FG candidate in the Constituent Assembly elections, but FG leaders vetoed his candidacy. Following a tense meeting at the Communist Central Committee, the party acquiesced to the FG's demand and Echegaray was replaced by Eduardo Barcesat, who was then elected to the Constituent Assembly. The other conflict arose from the calling of a PC rally to close the election campaign last 5 April. Buenos Aires Communist leaders opposed the rally and some of them did not even go to the Swiss House, where the meeting took place. From the viewpoint of Buenos Aires PC leaders, refounding the party would constitute a way of putting an end to those comings and goings and putting one's shirt on the Grand Front. The other thorny issue still pending is the FG platform. Echegaray's entourage gave vent to their annoyance with the economic and methodological statements made by Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez during two interviews published by PAGINA/12. One Central Committee members explained: "We do not agree with that but, precisely, the establishment of a left wing within the FG will enable us to wage the platform battle." Buenos Aires Communists interpret things differently: "Echegaray should not tolerate Chacho's speaking about repaying [as published] the external debt or accepting privatizations. We believe the party should be dissolved to establish a new movement, and that positions should be changed. It is no longer possible to speak about defaulting on external debt payments." Both Central Committee and Buenos Aires Committee members are of one mind about the fact that the process they are about to undertake may cause a rift within the party. They foresee that "there are some stick-in-the-muds who will cling to their old views, and there is no way they can see the political reality any other way. In any case, they are a minority." Other PC leaders have a different diagnosis: "The party's transformation will by no means be easy. It will meet fierce opposition, but this is the only way out."
