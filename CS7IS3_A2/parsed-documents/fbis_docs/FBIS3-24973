Of course, the political parties are deeply involved in the campaign. Nonetheless, there is a dispute within the opposition. Here is Raphael Mbadinga: [Begin recording] [Mbadinga] There is especially a war of words among the opposition parties. Those who are in favor of boycotting the 6 February elections are accusing the moderate opposition of seeking to legitimize President Gnassingbe Eyadema's government by taking part in the elections. According to the radical opposition, President Eyadema's government has not yet met all the conditions for truly democratic elections. Zarifou Ayeva is critical of the attitude of the moderate opposition here: [Ayeva] Regarding my friends in the opposition who have involved themselves unashamedly in this affair, I wonder how they will find their way out. One only has to observe France's position. Minister Roussin is already withdrawing his support for the presidential elections. Tomorrow, faced with the worsening situation on the ground, France will withdraw again. [Mbadinga] The moderate opposition has reacted by saying, and I quote, the Togolese people are tired. They have had enough of endless political transition. The legislative elections could therefore be a solution to the Togolese crisis, unquote. These petty squabbles of the opposition are publicly embarked upon in the country's privately owned newspapers. [end recording]
