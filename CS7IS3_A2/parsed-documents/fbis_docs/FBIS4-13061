I maintain, however, that the interview with a repentant extremist which Egyptian television broadcast three times last week raises several serious issues for discussion. By frivolity I mean the attitude of treating the issue superficially, focussing on some outward features, and summarizing the entire affair with a collection of anecdotes and sensational headlines harping on the same old story--primarily that those groups contain only young guys with sexual and emotional hangups who receive orders and financing from abroad. The media has persistently driven this image home by various means, most recently via television soap operas and motion pictures. This method is especially bad because it caters to our spontaneous and emotional responses and fosters in us an attitude of disgust. It bypasses our minds and does not require us to think. It makes people angry without understanding why they are angry and therefore convinces them that the individuals concerned are evil, deviant, criminal. People do not understand why those individuals are like that. Were they born that way or were they originally good and later became perverted? The root cause of the problem is ignored and the essential question "why" is not asked, so it follows that no one asks: "What should be done?" To be precise, in this way of addressing the issue we are preoccupied with the sick person while ignoring the sickness. It is a method of caricaturing terrorists and terrorist behavior. The terrorist dossier itself, however, is left unopened. The testimony of the repentant leading member -- 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi -- is important because it was a direct testimony illustrating the views and experiences of some existing groups. Regardless of possible guidance and the revision of his testimony and no matter the degree of accuracy of his information, we believe that it revealed, in a general way, some important aspects of this disease. It shed some light that deserves to be followed up in order to answer the big question that still needs to be discussed seriously and courageously, namely: Why does such deviant behavior occur? Where does it come from? Before we attempt to interpret the testimony from this angle, we must pause a moment and examine who the witness and his group are, in order to identify the case study we are addressing. We shall use the man's own statements as evidence. He was born in 1961, did not complete his secondary education, and joined these groups in 1977 at the age of 16. It was at this point that he was taught to say that this is an infidel society. He was arrested after President al-Sadat's assassination in 1981; and while in jail he became a member of the group known as "al-Shawqiyun," named after "Shawqi al-Shaykh," a dissident belonging to Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman's "Islamic" group. Apparently, however, he quarreled with the al-Shawqiyun and joined another group known as "Hesitation and Confirmation." Throughout his life he has relied on his personal reading to acquire religious knowledge; and at the age of 22 he was regarded as a theoretician, issuing rulings about what is permitted behavior and what is taboo, and leveling accusations of disbelief and apostasy. By chance he came across Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali's book "Jurisprudence in the Life of the Prophet," in which the writer discusses some aspects of the conduct of the Prophet, may God's prayers and peace be with him. He realized then that he and his group were seizing other people's money wrongfully. This was the first spark in his gradual enlightenment as to the errors in the various groups' views and behavior. Other events prompted him to reconsider the whole issue and eventually led him to testify on television, where he renounced the ideology he had embraced for 17 years. The "Hesitation and Confirmation" group to which he was said to belong is a link in the chain of groups that are covered by the blanket of the heretic ideology which brands [yadmagh] individuals, society, and the authorities as unbelievers. These groups went under various names, notably the "Repudiation and Renunciation," "al-Shawqiyun," "Those Delivered from the Fire," and the "Hesitation and Confirmation" groups. These four groups are the most prominent manifestations of intellectual deviation on the Egyptian Islamic scene. They are small groups of limited influence, drawing their grassroots membership from among simple, unsophisticated people to whom a person like 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi can act as an "authority" able to lead them intellectually and organizationally. The heretic ideology is limited to these small groups. An essential difference between them and the larger well-known groups, that is the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic Group, and the Salafis [revanchists] is that the latter, despite having diverse programs, methods, and goals, do not call anyone an unbeliever. This repentant leader took care to explain this difference. His explanation corrected the widespread misconception that branding others as unbelievers is the foundation of Islamic action, a misconception created by frivolous media treatment of the issue. Actually, the heretic ideology is a deviant concept and an exception to the general rule. If we go back to our subject and examine his remarks carefully, we will find in them important hints concerning the points of weakness and disorder through which this intellectual deviation infiltrates, paving the way for events culminating in terrorism. Here are examples of such factors: First, he did not find in school anything to satisfy his desire for religious knowledge and thus he left school to seek that knowledge elsewhere. He was asked: Are the school curricula designed to help every person learn true religion? He replied: I felt that the religion of the mosques and what we learn in school did not satisfy my religious needs as a young man. Both the question and the answer raise an issue which I believe is crucial in tracing the roots of intellectual deviation. This is that our youths emerge from school with a very shallow religious background that fails to give them a minimum of protection for keeping their balance and straight thinking. As a result, young men become soft and pliable putty for anyone to shape. Regrettably, some of those annoyed by the deviations now apparent in the Islamic stream are calling for countering them by reducing the religious content of the academic curricula on the hypothesis that extremism grows in religious soil so by eliminating that soil we can slow the spread of deviations. These people have used and are still using the slogan "Dry Up the Springs." I remember I criticized this stand in previous articles and said we need to adopt a purposeful policy on religion, not dry up its springs. I warned that the advocates of drying up the springs drive students to various types of extremism and deviation so that they thereby do not fight extremism but encourage and spread it through their poor judgment and shortsightedness. The example of 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi confirms this. The young man did not find what he was looking for at school, so he went looking for it outside school, became involved in illegal acts, and dragged many others with him. I have no doubt that entire generations are suffering from what this person suffered from, and there is no way to save them except by reconsidering the education policy and curricula in a manner that will restore prestige to religious culture and immunize our youths to deviation. I mentioned before that the years of nationalistic fervor dictated these "nationalistic subjects" at the various education levels right up to university. It was an understandable approach during that stage. In the period of religious resurgence we are now experiencing, we ought to give our youths the healthy food they need at school before they swallow adulterated and poisoned food from street vendors. Second, when he joined the groups, one of the leading advocates of the proposition that society is heretical convinced him about "legalization" -- that is to say that stealing money from others, from "the infidels," and using this money for one's duty is permissible. He was convinced of this and advocated it. He added: "We used to read things, but found no one to advise us on correct concepts. At the same time we shut ourselves in, regarded all preachers as part of the "infidel" regime, and turned our backs on them." At another point he said: "I could not find a clergyman who would tell me if what I read was right or wrong." This is the first time I have heard the term "legalization." I know that some kind of a shari'ah loophole justifies seizing other people's money on the pretext that they are "infidels." This opens our eyes to the fact that there is an unknown world out there in the dark in which the weirdest ideas are spreading with no one to stem or rectify them. This draws our attention to more than one crisis: --the crisis of darkness, in which such groups move; --the crisis due to preachers who have lost the youths' confidence and forced them to be satisfied with their underworld; --the crisis of indignation against a society that fostered the mind set among young men that accepts the idea that the society is heretical and that it is permissible to seize people's money and property; and --the crisis of the higher religious authority, which should be making sure of the correctness of the ideas these youths absorb and taking the lead in seeking a prudent and moderate way. Suppose this young man, and hundreds or thousands like him, had found a public, legitimate agency to nurture them and satisfy their desire for piety and public service; would the concept of the repudiation of society have spread so easily then? Can anyone imagine that the term "legalization" would have appeared then? Such questions lead to the discussion of an issue totally ignored amid the preoccupation with extremism and terrorism. It is the need to provide avenues of moderation for these young men before they find themselves compelled to join illegal groups that will indoctrinate them with whatever ideas those groups want, without supervision or accountability. Another question arises: Why did those young men not find reliable, authoritative ulema to correct the ideas that had taken hold of their minds? The young men regarded preachers as part of the government, a form of authority, and establishment mouthpieces and so they lost faith in them and did not listen to them. Preacher convoys have toured the country. Reports and photographs of them holding seminars and conferences to fight deviant ideologies fill the newspapers, but when young men were asked about them, they replied: Those preachers did not discuss any issues with us. They came to the villages to dictate things to us. There is no doubt that those preacher convoys were a bureaucratic solution adopted merely as a stopgap measure and to show that the authorities were doing something. Perhaps we did not need this repentant's testimony to reach the conclusion we are now reaching. What is the solution? It is necessary to make do better in training and upgrading preachers. Al-Azhar must play its role and do its duty as a beacon of sober thought and an independent institution responsible for the defense of Islam in Egypt and all over the Islamic world. Those who seek to undermine and slander al-Azhar and those who seek to subjugate it and make it part of the political establishment are derogating it and reducing its credibility. Every reduction of its credibility gives free help to deviancy and terrorism. Efforts to undermine or control al-Azhar serve the same ends as extremism. Commenting on the membership of the deviant groups, the repentant leading member said that most of those who have joined since 1985 were unemployed who "came to us and we provided them with employment in the form of robbery within the context of legalization." He explained that "they wanted to marry and we provided them with the money for that. Within four months such a member would feel he had become somebody, with a job, a home, and a wife." This description places the socioeconomic factor squarely before our eyes. Unemployed persons find self-fulfillment in the embrace of those groups that provide them with the things society has been unable to give them. If we remember that there are 3 million unemployed people in Egypt, we will immediately realize that those groups have a huge potential army. Unemployment is an important source of members, of those who are looking for a job and self- fulfillment. The issue goes beyond this, for once they are persuaded that their society is heretical and that their mission is to change that society from a swamp of unbelief into an oasis of faith, those young men will find a cause to defend and for which to make sacrifices. Does not this situation demand some very deep thinking about the younger generation crushed by the ordeals of unemployment, a search for self-fulfillment, and the quest for a dream and a cause? Should not this situation make us think again of what we are doing for our young people, who actually live on the margins of society where no one cares about them even though one day they will have to lead the country? Our friend said that his mother gave him 4,000 pounds to start a project and earn a living. She did this after she realized that he had definitely abandoned his studies. He spent the money on forming his "Hesitation and Confirmation" group. He rented a house in which he lived with 25 companions. When the money ran out two months later, the solution was the legalization fatwa. They started stealing bicycles and selling them. When this became insufficient they stole motorcycles, and so on. "The greater the need for money, the more legalization was granted." This discussion raises the issue of who finances them. Many people find it easy to link financing to foreign sources. Much published comment and various recent movies give the same message. According to this repentant man, generalized statements about links to foreign parties are at the very least not very accurate. He personally spent every penny his mother gave him on a cause he judged to be worth while. Later on, the legalization of theft was the solution to getting the funds necessary for continuing the "mission." What I mean is that this entire scene we are examining was homegrown, including the ideas, the people, and the money. It means that foreign parties were not part of the picture in the beginning. At worst, the role of foreign parties--if such a thing is proved--came later and was incidental. We are not concerned with exonerating the foreign parties. Our chief concern at this time is to focus attention on the domestic factors in order to give them priority in our effort to eradicate this phenomenon. In other words, repeatedly hammering away about foreign parties does more harm than good because it diverts attention from the original and real domestic causes. These causes lie at our feet and are in our hands but we insist on looking beyond our borders, searching for an unknown foreign party that we cannot see. What applies to money also applies to weapons. When the man was asked where he had obtained weapons, his simple answer was that weapons are found in every house in Upper Egypt. This means that the weapons have been found inside the country since the beginning. The means of violence were available from the start. What happened afterwards was a development and an exploitation of those means. In conclusion, one cannot but notice in the statement of the repentant leading member that he wasted 17 years of his life on his miserable adventures and refused to meet his mother when she came to visit him in jail. We cannot fail to notice his references to those who abandoned their families and devoted their lives to a cause they considered righteous. He spoke of the science student who left his studies to peddle socks in the streets and the specialist surgeon who abandoned his profession to sell watches. When one examines these images, one realizes that this army of young men are victims of a corrupt cause and a fallacious dream. This raises the puzzling question: Who is responsible for this waste? Is it merely the responsibility of those who have misled the young men and tempted them with corrupt ideologies about repudiating society and considering the theft of its wealth as legitimate? Or is it also the responsibility of a society that has failed to rally them around an honorable cause and did not fire their imagination with a great dream? 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi said that he used to act on the understanding that he had a cause that filled his thoughts and took hold of his feelings and that, in those days, if he had been given 50 death sentences he would not have regretted his acts. That is because he believed he was right and would die a martyr. He is not alone in this; there are many like him. They think they are right and express a willingness to die in defense of their convictions. These are urgent questions: Is there a way to channel these feelings in the right direction, one that can serve the homeland's and the nation's noble objectives? Is there a means to channel this energetic faith, so full of resentment against society, in a way that will help society to progress and realize some of its legitimate dreams? In the midst of our media's renowned buffoonery, sensationalism, and confusing tactics, it is difficult to answer these questions. Regrettably, sensationalism has governed even the way we read the testimony mentioned here. Many people have focused on the accusations, scandals, and other sensational material that emerged from the testimony. Only a few noticed the moral behind it. Hence, instead of organizing a roundtable to discuss the various aspects of the issue and the responsibility of all parties, we were astounded to see a great pavilion being set up full of shouting, clowning people. They gave us a headache with their loud but empty talk. Those who tried to say something serious could not be heard above the din. This means that the frivolous method of addressing the issue still has the upper hand and that the time for seriousness has not yet come!
