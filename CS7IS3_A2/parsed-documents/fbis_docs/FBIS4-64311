The veiled threat was contained in the report the European Union executive presented here today on the state of restructuring plans by European public steel concerns, approved by the European Industry Council last December. The warning was also aimed, sources at the European Commission said, at Germany and its plan for Ekostahl, and Spain's plan for CIS. Karel van Miert, the European Commissioner responsible for competition, on Wednesday [27 April] stressed the need to have "all information necessary, from interested countries, to verify progress made in the restructuring plans for which state aid has been authorized. The overall credibility of the plans, in fact, will depend on the respect of these conditions." Van Miert went on to say that not all countries in question have offered the full data requested in the time required. This question was already raised by the European Commission last week, during the Industry Council in Luxembourg, at which time Italian Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta promised to promptly forward lacking data from IRI [Institute for Italian Reconstruction] on the application of the Ilva plan. He also reiterated Italy's determination to respect the commitments made last December on the time-table and methods to restructure the country's public steel sector. Nations in the process of restructuring their public steel companies were to have forwarded to the European Commission, by March 15, data on the reduction of production capacity, investments, job cuts, market conditions, financial results and on privatization drives. The plan the European Union approved for Ilva foresaw the closure in Taranto, by the end of June, of two blast furnaces, for a production cut of 1.2 million tons, and a further 500 ton cut through the sale of ILP. The plan also called for the total dismantling of the Bagnoli plant, outside Naples, while the sales if ILP and AST must take place before the end of the current year.
