He said that the Iraqis insisted that they were honoring the disarmament conditions of UN Security Council Resolution 687. "For the Kuwaitis, however, Iraq's disarmament is less important than its abandonment of plans to take over Kuwait. This approach is quite reasonable," the official said. He also said that the UN Security Council discussed the extension of sanctions every two months. "The Security Council chairman stated recently that the Council decided to keep the sanctions in place. This time, incidentally, there was no question of lifting or alleviating the sanctions (lifting the oil embargo -- IF). We thought that the Security Council chairman's statement could be read as admission that positive changes could be detected in the Baghdad's activities which suggested its intention to comply with what the international community wanted. Iraq had taken steps to implement the Security Council resolutions on destruction of missiles and other weapons." According to the diplomat, "Russia wanted a certain test period to be imposed on Iraq. UN Security Council resolution 715 enables imposing a long-term monitoring. Certain installations could be subjected to an extended technical and visual supervision under that resolution. Russia wanted to give Iraq, say, six months. If all disarmament conditions of resolution 687 were met during that time, then, in compliance with item 22 of that resolution the issue of lifting the oil embargo could be raised." The diplomat said, "Iraq must comply with all UN Security Council Resolutions. But Iraq should be given a chance to see light at the end of the tunnel."
