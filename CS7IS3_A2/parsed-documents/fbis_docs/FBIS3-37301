It will probably have significant influence on the fate of the Ukrainian people and state. President Leonid Kravchuk and his team, for example, claim that Ukraine's future will be bright and cloudless as soon as we give up or, to be more precise, hand over our nuclear arsenal to Russia. For the first time, officers and generals of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, headed by Defense Minister Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, were actively involved in the campaign to support and propagate this idea. The extreme zeal with which the Ukrainian military pressed for the "nuclear trash" to be sent to our northern neighbor raises the suspicion that they might not get their pay only from Ukrainian funds. Whatever the case, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev could not even dream of better advocates of his country's policies; and President Bill Clinton would definitely promise them high positions in the Pentagon (remember how they offered our president the job of press secretary for the U.S. President?). On the other hand, one can understand Ukrainian Defense Ministry officials -- they simply obey instruction from on high. As for the Defense Minister, however, it was expected that he would give a frank opinion about the situation. But Gen. Radetskyy did not have the guts to do this. It was done for him by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and Supreme Council deputies during the examination of the Moscow tripartite treaty and its annex. Following that session, it became obvious that the president's campaign is nothing but a fig leaf covering his and other high-ranking officials' blunders. So Ukraine has lost the battle over the right to have its interests respected, and it was left at the mercy of two empires. Very soon, under a slight dollar anesthetic -- and maybe even without it -- it will have its "nuclear teeth" removed. Moscow's playing of the "Crimean card," however, may stop this operation. Incidentally, as this situation would certainly work to the Kremlin's advantage, the temptation to use it is very great. The newly elected Crimean khan, Meshkov, does not even conceal his pro-Moscow orientation, while the dropping of the moratorium on the all-Crimean referendum gives the green light to separatists. The self-assuredness of chauvinists will be boosted by the knowledge that standing behind them is the Black Sea Fleet -- a heavy military fist -- whose commander, Admiral Baltin, habitually "forgets" that he is accountable to two presidents. In late January, Baltin had another opportunity to pay tribute to the Kremlin and do some saber-rattling, which he certainly did according to the best imperial traditions. As a countermeasure to the Ukrainian strategic territorial defense exercises conducted in Kiev and led by the commander in chief, L. Kravchuk -- which the Moscow media exaggerated to call "large-scale maneuvers in southern Ukraine" -- Adm. Baltin ordered heightened combat readiness in the Coastal Guard Division and marine division exercises, including the loading of military equipment onto assault vessels and the support of about 20 vessels. At the same time, it was explained to personnel that Ukrainian military units and Ukrainian National Self-Defense detachments were hatching plans for the seizure of the Crimea. By these means, the Black Sea Fleet Command proved that it was resolutely protecting the Ukrainian Crimea against the Ukrainians. One should also note that during these exercises, 43d Rocket Army Commander Volodymyr Mykhtyuk was promoted to colonel general. This "gift" from the president is explained by the fact that the commander eventually stopped vacillating and pledged allegiance to Ukraine. Hopefully, this example will be followed by other officers. By the way, Ukraine obtained one more general in January -- Valeriy Hubenko, head of the State Committee for State Border Protection, who was promoted to this high rank. It is not difficult to notice that with the ever increasing number of generals in the Ukrainian Army, the number of its problems is not decreasing. While some of these problems require considerable amounts of money and time to resolve, it is absurd to make a problem out of introducing the state language into the Army, particularly since the former defense minister, Gen. Morozov, proved this himself. He learned Ukrainian in a short time and spoke it with his subordinates. He also made sure that the language became predominate in the military. Once the leadership was changed, this process stopped and even reversed. Today, all commanders that have already switched over to Ukrainian in their everyday operations are forced to make their reports in Russian because the Defense Ministry "does not understand it well." Maybe they simply do not want to, Mr. Radetskyy?
