The specifics of the period which we are experiencing are such that under current conditions the primary threat to Russia's national security stems not so much from foreign sources as from various destructive forces within the country. Among the most dangerous factors, along with the prolonged and deep economic and social crisis, we must cite also the crisis of national policy of the state as a whole. The absence of a unified conception of national policy in essence has made it impossible to localize even one of the inter-ethnic conflicts arising during the period of disintegration of the USSR as well as after it, to expose the main reasons for their emergence, and to develop a mechanism for early prevention and effective reaction to crisis situations. The State of Interethnic Accord and Possible Prospects for Its Development A rather high level of inter-ethnic tensions continued to be retained in 1993. Experimental studies and an analysis of the conflicts allow us to conclude that at the present time there are three levels of tension in inter-ethnic relations. The first of these--ethnic limitation (i.e., the unwillingness to opt for contacts beyond the boundaries of one's ethnic group)--is the most widespread. It is manifested in increased interest toward creation of mono-national families (there is a reduction in the relative share of mixed marriages), in a preference to work in mono-national collectives, and in the monopolization of leadership positions of all levels by representatives of one's own people. Practically each of the peoples, especially those which have a national-state or national-territorial autonomy, is gripped with this illness, which is the initial and primary basis for disintegration of interethnic accord. The second level--ethnic egoism (the desire to ensure advantages for one's own people at the expense of others)--is becoming ever more widespread. Up to 30-40 percent of the native population of the republics believes that it is natural for them to get advantages over other peoples populating this republic. It has become almost the rule that the employment of Russians exceeds their relative share in the population only in industry and partially in science, public health and education. In all other spheres and sectors, including the organs of state and economic administration and the make-up of the student population, the relative share of Russians is lower than their specific share in the make-up of the population. In Tatariya, for example, there is a de facto introduction of strict limitations by national indicator on the ownership and management of natural resources. Russian joint-stock holders are being edged out, and the representatives of the Tatar people are gaining the controlling packets of stock, etc. In Dagestan, ethnic egoism is manifested in the hidden opposition of the Laktsy and the Kumyks (because of Kumyk lands), and in the desire by the Nogay to achieve unification of Nogay territories which are currently divided up between Dagestan, Stavropol Kray and Chechnya. Ethnic egoism may go into the third stage--ethnophobism, which is characterized by open enmity and irreconcilability in regard to other people who are "foreign" and "not one's own." This has been particularly manifested in the well-known Ossetin-Ingush conflict, when the fires of hatred, nonrecognition and mutual accusations continue to rage on an interpersonal level. Individual regions of the Cossack brotherhood and certain rayons of the North Caucasus stand on the brink of open opposition to the interests of various peoples. However, the level of acuteness in national relations has become stabilized. While undoubtedly being exceedingly high, it has nevertheless been retained within the framework of 1992 indicators. As compared with a year ago, the mass consciousness of the native population is somewhat less taken with the ideas of national separatism and unification of one's ethnic groups presently living on other territories into a single state formation. Ethnopolitical Movements, Organizations and Parties Their growth in 1993 continued. There was an increasing number of associations and organizations based on the principles of national rebirth and self-preservation. Their organizational consolidation continued, and in some of them the extremist wing grew stronger. Their actions led to a forced decision on the rates and content of sovereignization. Part of the national associations strived to become parallel organs of power, to replace the state structures. Efforts were made to create militarized formations. In a number of republics (Komi, for example), they were granted the right of legislative initiative, as well as the actual right to conduct expert evaluation of drafts of legislative decisions. Many of them became the bearers of new consolidating principles, appealing not to the political consciousness of the citizens, but to the historical, ethnic, and ethnosocial, i.e., to more universal interests than, for example, class or group interests. And although more significant differences were manifested in 1993 than before, differences between positions of titular peoples and their "representative" national parties and movements (extremist nationalist demands were supported by 10-15 percent of the native population, with an alarm indicator of 7-8 percent), we cannot underestimate their negative influence. Thus, the activity of the All-Osset Council "Styr Nakhas" and the socio-political association "Our Ossetiya" not only intensifies the Osset-Ingush conflict, but also facilitates the emergence of anti-Russian and anti-military sentiments among the Osset people. In the second half of 1993 there was a sharp increase in the propaganda of nationalist ideas in the Republic of Dagestan by the socio-political movements "Tenglik," "Birlik," and "People's Front imeni Shamil," whose leaders call for the struggle against the colonial policy of Russia in the North Caucasus as one of the conditions for prosperity of the nations. The Lezghin people's movement Sadval" promotes in its activity the idea of forming a "Unified Lezghistan," which leads to the violation of the territorial integrity of Russia and Azerbaijan. The activity of the Komi national party "Doryams AsnyMES" ("We Will Defend Ourselves") has a notably expressed nationalistic and anti-Russian position. The Buryat-Mongol People's Party promotes the idea of unifying all Mongols with an orientation toward Mongolia. The "Union of the Banished", the "Eastern Prussia" association of fellow countrymen and other organizations of an extremist ilk in Kaliningrad Oblast have set for themselves the goal of creating a powerful German community by means of implementing broad economic cooperation with Germany, which may also evoke negative consequences. The Party for Chuvash Rebirth and the Chuvash National Congress are expanding contacts with representatives of Turkish religious centers for the purpose of spreading the principles of Islam and gradually edging out Christianity, which may cause friction between the adherents of different religious confessions. A particularly destabilizing factor in inter-ethnic relations is the presence or creation of possible military or militarized formations. In the Chechen Republic there are subdivisions of the regular army in various stages of formulation. Among these are a mountain-infantry brigade, tank and artillery regiments, a border brigade, and a special purpose regiment. Within the make-up of the ChR [Chechen Republic] national guard there is a regiment of the national guard, a Muslim fighting regiment, and an "Abkhaz batallion." Detachments of the people's militia are being created or have already been created in each population center, based on territorial principle. In North Ossetia there are also measures being implemented on the formation of a future national army, the nucleus of which is the Administration for Defense of Facilities of the National Economy. At the end of 1993, its ranks numbered up to 7,000 persons and around 100 units of armored equipment. The overall number of personnel of various military formations in Ingushetia is in excess of 2,500 people. And finally, the emergence (retention) of interethnic tensions, work on regulating conflict situations which is long in its duration and ineffective in its content and, on the contrary, a stable situation in multinational regions largely depends on the opposition of the national-political elite. The conceptions of national statehood and national sovereignty of individual national-state formations often conceal the political ambitions of the ethnic elite, and efforts to translate their slogans into the language of practical actions end in human tragedies. At the same time, the danger of ethnopolitical organizations for the present time is most likely exaggerated (perhaps with the exception of Tatarstan and, in part, Dagestan). They are for the ruling national elite sooner a means of trade with Moscow than a real opposition. The pressure of national organizations on the leaders of republics will evidently continue, but its effectiveness will be determined in the nearest time by the will of the national majority--the people, and not by the degree of pressure exerted by the extremist part of the national parties and movements. Refugees and Forced Migrants 1993 was a year of gradual transition of almost all parties to a more precise definition of their positions in regard to Russians in the "near abroad" countries. Out of a total of 26 million people who found themselves abroad in the Spring of 1991, 2 million have already returned to Russia. According to official statistical data, in 1990-1992, one-fourth of the Russians left Tajikistan and Azerbaijan, and 17 percent left Georgia. Central Asia and the Transcaucasus gave up 2/3 of the repatriates (although only 16 percent of the Russians located in the near abroad countries live there). On the whole, the return of a total of 6 million people is expected. The complexity of solving the problems of Russian refugees (in the political plane) consists of the fact that they represent a dynamic, active and explosive group under conditions of Russia, inclined to support nationalist forces and nationalist organizations. At the same time, this is the most skilled, the most organized and creative part of the Russians living abroad, which by its knowledge, experience and skill is capable of successfully resolving economic and social problems and actively aiding the new Russia. Migration of the Population Along with the continuation of emigration of the Russian and Russian-speaking population, there has been a significant increase in the influx of people of other nationalities who have left their native land as a result of economic and political instability in their regions, as well as inter-clan and inter-tribal clashes under the threat of physical and moral annihilation. An operative analysis of the flow of migrants to Kaluga Oblast shows that, along with Russian refugees, a significant portion is comprised of forced migrants from Moldova, Armenia, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, and the republics of the Northern Caucasus. Aside from the difficulties of integrating into a foreign-speaking environment, this situation bears contradictions which are difficult to resolve: --the urban population predominates within the influx of refugees and migrants, while Kaluga oblast (like most of the Russian oblasts) primarily offers them employment involving farm labor; --among the refugees and migrants there is a very high relative share of the intelligentsia, which in a certain sense hinders its employment due to lack of correspondence of skills to available jobs, or due to saturation of traditional professions. We should also note that the influx of the foreign-speaking population to the territory of Russia will increase, because along with the political reasons there is an increase in the significance of socio-economic ones: Growing unemployment (lack of jobs), especially for young people, as well as problems of water and land. The lack of resolution of the newly emerging problem--the foreign-speaking population among the native Russian population--requires increased attention in 1994 in order to prevent the emergence of ethnic tensions and conflicts in the central part of Russia. Sore Spots in Interethnic Relations The retained tendencies toward intensification of regional separatism, the expansion of interethnic conflicts, the aspirations of the national elite toward re-division of the territories and toward greater sovereignty, and the struggle for power all pose a threat to the territorial integrity of the country and Russian statehood in general. The direct sources of real threats in the sphere of interethnic relations are: Efforts to form enclaves according to the ethnic principle on the territory of the Russian Federation; intensification of socioeconomic inequality of various peoples and ethnic groups; increase in ethnic migrations, migration of refugees and forced migrants; mass violations of civil rights and freedoms in individual regions. By indicator of conflict, all the sore spots in Russia may be classified by the following principles: --zones of acute crisis (military conflicts or balancing on their brink); --potential crisis situations; --zones of strong regional separatism; --zones of moderate regional separatism; --zones of weakly expressed separatism. We will deal primarily with the "painful", crisis zones. Regions of Acute Crisis Situations The most explosive remains the situation in the zone of North Ossetia and Ingushetiya. After the trip by the Russian Federation President to the zone of conflict and the 13 December 1993 edict on the procedure for returning refugees and forced migrants to Digaron, Chermen, Kurtat and Dachnoye, the tensions have not declined, but continue to increase. Despite the positive evaluation expressed by officials of these republics regarding the results of the achieved accord, there is, nevertheless, an expression of apprehension that extremist forces will make use of the situation and will push the Ingush toward elemental resettlement to the indicated population centers, the negative consequences of which are unpredictable. Meetings of extremist directionality have been held in North Ossetia, organized by the opposition. The session of the North Ossetia Supreme Soviet refused to rescind its previous decision on the impossibility of Ingush and Osset living together. The information spread by extremists regarding the forceful provision of Ingush resettlement to places of their former residence once again intensifies the mutual enmity. Negotiations within the framework of the mixed commission have been suspended. Efforts by the temporary administration to put the factors of "people's diplomacy" into action have not yielded positive results. In order to reduce tensions in this region, it seems expedient to implement a series of successive measures. First of all, to tie in the solution of the problem of refugees not with the territorial aspirations of the Ingush and Osset, but with the creation of opportunities for each people for realization of their rights to national self-sufficiency. Secondly, stricter measures are needed for disarmament of the military formations created in Ingushetiya and North Ossetia after the armed conflict. Thirdly, it seems expedient to more effectively utilize the additional financing of Ingushetiya and North Ossetia, to establish strict control over the expenditure of financial means allocated for target programs. Fourthly, it has long been time to give a public legal and political evaluation of the events of October-November 1992 and to name the names of the organizers and participants in the criminal actions. Fifth, it is necessary to change over from a military-administrative form of administration to a direct federal form of administration and to repeal the state of martial law. Another point which personifies the acute crisis situation is Chechnya and the indeterminacy of its status, as well as the separatist policy of its current leadership. The approaches to the problem of Chechnya as defined at the conference in Nalchik on 7 December 1993 do not have favorable prospects. Moreover, the closure of the border with the Chechen Republic along its entire perimeter, including the undefined line of administrative division with Ingushetiya, may lead to an exacerbation of the situation in the region and to provocation of anti-Russian sentiments. A mild course toward keeping Chechnya within the make-up of Russia, juridically and economically, seems more preferable. The interests of stabilization of the situation in the region and reduction in the criminal situation in Chechnya would be served by efforts of the leadership of Dagestan and Stavropol to conclude bilateral agreements with the regime of D. Dudayev regarding cooperation in resolution of socio-economic questions and provision of human rights. At the same time, it would be expedient to continue contacts with the opposition to D. Dudayev's regime, and to support the social base of the opposition. This course is desirable also because the Chechen diaspora in the nearby and distant foreign countries is beginning to speak out against the regime of D. Dudayev. It would be expedient to involve such influential movements as the Conference of Peoples of the Caucasus and the Tersk Cossack Brotherhood in the regulation of problems of a crisis character in the North Caucasus. Potential Acute Crisis Situations Among these we must cite primarily the tense ethnopolitical situation taking shape in the Republic of Tyva (Tuva). Beginning in 1990, the separatist course of the People's Front of Tuva provoked the mass departure of the Russian-speaking population. Tensions are being increased by the actions of organizations of former prisoners, particularly by the mass "seizure" of the vacated apartments of refugees. On the wave of increased nationalism, increase in crime, and decline in productivity, the Supreme Soviet of Tuva adopted a new constitution in November of 1993. The first article of this constitution calls the republic a sovereign state within the make-up of Russia, having the right to full self-determination by means of an all-people's referendum. At the same time (29 November of this year), the Supreme Soviet of Tuva adopted a decree on holding a referendum on the question of Tuva remaining in the Russian Federation. Considering the fact that Tuva was included in the make-up of the USSR only in 1944 and that Tuvins comprise the overwhelming majority in the republic (around 65 percent), the probability of its separation from Russia in the next few years is very great. The population of Tuva is largely comprised of lamaists of the Mongol doctrine and is culturally oriented toward its former suzerain--the Mongol state. Unemployment and a high crime rate facilitate the increase in anti-Russian demonstrations, which are not opposed by the official authorities. The second zone of potential acute conflict is Krasnodar Kray, which has become multi-national. Analysis shows that it is among the regions which are most explosive in a national sense. The concentration of situations generating conflict has long been prevalent here, but especially since the late 1980's, and continues to the present time. The causes of such situations which arise in the kray are varied. One of the reasons is concealed in the multi-nationality of the kray, where along with the 4-million Russian population there are representatives of 22 peoples, including Ukrainians, Armenians, Adygey, Greeks, Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Meskhetin Turks and others. Most live compactly and represent groups which are ethnically rather cohesive, retaining their native language and traditions. The second factor giving rise to inter-ethnic conflicts in the kray is associated with migration, primarily forced migration, and the influx of refugees which was facilitated by the disintegration of the Union, the inter-ethnic conflicts, the exacerbation of socio-economic and national situation in a number of regions. The changed geopolitical position of Krasnodar Kray evoked a new wave of migrations. It became a border region of Russia. The migration processes in Krasnodar Kray occurred in the 1970's-1980's. Crimean Tatars, Meskhetin Turks and Kurds moved here. A new wave of influx of Meskhetins was caused by the events of 1989 in Fergan. The influx of Armenians into Krasnodar Kray increased in connection with the earthquake in Armenia in 1988, and was later spurred by the flare-up of genocide in Sumgait and Baku and the war in Karabakh. The Abkhazo-Georgian War gave a new impetus to forced migrations--of Russian, Armenian and other refugees from Abkhaziya. The dynamics of refugees in Krasnodar Kray is such: The first half of 1991--32,000 persons; October 1991--38,500; January 1992--54,000; April 1992--53,000; June 1992--58,500. In 1993 the flow of refugees increased even more. By nationality, the refugees were distributed as follows: Russians and Russian-speaking peoples--27,000; Armenians--over 16,000; Meskhetin Turks--around 13,500, and Azerbaijanis--1,500. The influx of refugees and forced emigrants is continually complicating the situation in the kray. Part of them are not registered, and therefore cannot be employed. Inter-ethnic relations between the Russians and the Armenians, the Cossacks and the other population, the Adygeys and the Russians have become particularly acute. In recent times there have been repeated demands for the deportation of the Armenians and the Meskhetin Turks. There are frequent cases of deportation of new settlers from the kray. According to a sociological survey conducted among the local deputies, the conflict situation in the kray may intensify, since 60 percent of the population (throughout Russia it is 20-25 percent) believes there is a possibility of open conflict between individual national groups. The third potentially dangerous point may become the Republic of Dagestan. Although on the whole it has been possible to keep the situation under control there, the probability of a breakdown and violation of relative ethnopolitical stability and inter-ethnic accord is great. A zone of increased conflict is the region settled by the Chechen-Akkin, the once liquidated Aukhovskiy Rayon. The authorities have been able to find a compromise decision which satisfies the Chechen (their rayon is being restored) and the Laktsy and Avartsy who are living here, and who are now being relocated to new lands next to the Kumyk. On the other hand, sentiments are increasing among the Kumyk against the occupation of the "Kumyk lands" by the Laktsy. As the settlement continues, the prospect of a conflict with the local Kumyk population becomes rather probable. Another notable point of inter-ethnic opposition in Dagestan is the situation in the south of the republic, where the Lezghin popular movement "Sadval" actively speaks out for the preservation of the ethno-cultural and ethno-political unity of the two parts of the Lezghin ethnos, currently separated by the borders of the RF [Russian Federation] and Azerbaijan (there are over 170,000 Lezghin living in Azerbaijan, and over 75,000 Azerbaijanis living in Dagestan). The formulation of the boundary in this region may evoke sharp exacerbation of the situation and lead to conflict. Of the other points of inter-ethnic tensions, one that requires particular attention is the Kumyk problem, which consists of the desire by part of the Kumyk population for administrative separation of their ethnic territory, as well as the Nogay problem, which reflects the intentions of the Nogay people to achieve unification of all Nogay territories which are currently divided between Dagestan, Stavropol Kray and Chechnya. Regions (zones) of Strong Separatism The Republic of Tatarstan occupies a peculiar place in the ethnopolitical situation. The republic is located in the center of the Russian Federation, and its population is almost half comprised of Russians (43.3 percent). The most numerous and influential national parties agitate for secession from the Russian Federation and acknowledgement of equal rights for Tatarstan. It is possible to preserve peace in Tatarstan because the current leaders of Tatarstan are among the proponents of Tatarstan independence who are gravitating toward gradual disunification with Russia. Slogans about Turkic unity are becoming ever more popular, although on the whole the idea of creating a parliament of the entire Tatar people, presented at the 1st All-Tatar Congress in February of 1992 by the newly formed Milli Medjlis (people's parliament), did not find deep-seated support in society. The appearance of the Milli Medjlis changed the placement of political forces: An organ emerged which was an alternative to the official parliament. In the case of a political crisis in the Republic of Tatarstan, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Milli Medjlis may be changed into some semblance of an all-national congress and that there will be a changeover by members of the Milli Medjlis to extremely strict positions in regard to the existing organs of power. A confirmation of this is the joint announcement, in which the only lawful organ of power of the Tatar people is acknowledged to be the Milli Medjlis, and which contains an appeal for cohesion of the Tatar people under its flag. In the last two years there has been a radical re-distribution of power and prestigious positions in favor of the Tatars: 70-80 percent of all heads of administration and chairmen of rayon soviets, rayon procurators, chairmen of rayon courts, leaders of the RUVD [rayon internal affairs administrations] and chief physicians. Nevertheless, the leadership of Tatarstan stands on the positions of preserving ties with Russia and conducting civilized negotiations with Moscow on all important questions, especially on problems of handing over the rights and authorities of the federation subject to the center.* Regions of Moderate Regional Separatism The political situation in the Republic of Komi is becoming more complicated. The organization "Komi kotyr" created in January of 1991, which speaks out as the initiator of consolidation of the Komi national movement, has formed a permanent organ--the Committee for Rebirth of the Komi People. The active work of this committee in the republic and close cooperation with analogous organizations of Finno-Ugric peoples have significantly increased the prestige of the Committee for Rebirth of the Komi People and its influence on the ethnopolitical situation in the republic. We must note that, within the Komi national movement, a tendency has emerged toward merging of the Committee for Rebirth of the Komi People with the constitutional system of power, turning it into an organ representing the Komi people on the foreign economic arena. At the demand of the Second Congress of the Komi People (December 1992), the Republic of Komi Supreme Soviet adopted a law on granting the congresses of the Komi national movement the right of legislative initiative. The Third Congress of the Komi People (December 1993) demanded that an article be included in the republic's constitution stating that Komi is a sovereign republic, with the right of secession from the make-up of the RF. Demands were also presented regarding the return to the Republic of Komi of five rayons which had "previously been handed over" to the make-up of Arkhangelsk Oblast. We must stress that the Committee for Rebirth of the Komi People is trying to establish control over the power structures of the republic and, relying on the support of Estonia, to take a course toward national self-determination. We may also relate the situations which have arisen in Yakutiya, Kalmykiya, and Gorny Altay to the zones of moderate separatism. Despite the assurances by the republic leadership that they have no intention of seceding from Russia, already today the line of their legislative and executive organs of power toward treaty, and not constitutional, relations with the Russian center is becoming quite evident. This in fact leads, at best, to the establishment of a specific form of confederative relations. And finally, we should note the group of regions with the lowest level of inter-ethnic tensions. These include the territories populated by the minor peoples of the European north, Siberia and the Far East, a number of republics in Povolzhye, Kareliya, specifically "Russian" krays and oblasts, as well as regions of compact settlement of peoples who do not have national statehood or autonomy (Veps, Izhor, Greeks, Koreans, Tofalars, etc.). Prognosis for 1994 New conflicts of a violent character over a large part of the territory of Russia are improbable in 1994, although in the North Caucasus and in Dagestan the conflict potential is more significant than in other regions. On the whole, 1994 will not be a year of opposition by specifically national groups or confessions. It will be a year of "war" of the federal and national-republic structures over the division of statehood, property and authority, over questions of citizenship, the state language, and especially questions regarding the sale (or redistribution) of land. At the same time, the following problems will become objects of political discussions and speculations, and may exacerbate and undermine inter-ethnic accord. The Russian Republic A number of social movements and political parties are actively promoting the idea of the possibility of creating a Russian Republic in Russia, based on the fact that Russians do not have statehood, despite the fact that they are the most numerous ethnic group. Russia is characterized as a federation without Russians, and in this connection the task of struggling for the creation of a single unitarian Russian state on the territory of Russia is presented. For the present, this demand does not yet find support in the mass consciousness. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of an increase in the number of its supporters. The very idea, naturally, increases the status of Russians in Russia, but the creation of a Russian Republic would lead to an actual dismantling of the RF and a disintegration of Russia. Russian Nationalism There is a real danger that the Russian national ideal will grow into a militant force, into everyday chauvenism, when, under the influence of economic disintegration and political instability, the mechanism of national self defense will begin to operate in the public consciousness, growing into aggressive behavior. If we do not oppose this process now, then, by its consequences, the nationalism of a large people cannot be compared to any social catastrophes. Territorial Disputes Between Russia and the `Near Abroad' Countries and Within Russia Although there are no pretensions between the republics of the former USSR at the state level, in fact there are a number of situations which, under certain circumstances, may turn latent (hidden) processes into open ones. First of all, this is manifested in the position of part of the Russian population (and certain foreign national groups associated with them) not to migrate to Russia, but to go under Russia's jurisdiction together with the territory on which they are living. This concerns the Dniester region, the Crimea, the region of Kokhtla-Yarve and Narva in Estonia, and certain regions in the Northern Caucasus and Eastern Ukraine. Secondly, this is the desire by a number of autonomies or a number of peoples to enter the make-up of the Russian Federation--Abkhaziya, South Ossetia, or the Lezghin (37 percent of whom presently live in Azerbaijan). Thirdly, there are territorial claims also inside the republics, stemming from the fact that the people of a given nationality live on adjoining territories. This is manifested in the claims of a number of political leaders of Tatarstan to regions with a predominant Tatar population in the Republic of Mari El and the Republic of Bashkortostan, and in Ulyanovsk and Samara Oblasts. Among the Komi people, the notion of reunification with the Komi-Permyaks, who have their own okrug within Perm Oblast, is actively propagandized. There is an analogous situation in Buryatiya, where the idea of reunification with fellow countrymen having their national formations in Irkutsk and Chita Oblasts is actively supported. An intensification of Kalmykiya's claims regarding the regions which have been "lost" and handed over to Astrakhan Oblast and Krasnodar Kray can also not be excluded. And finally, there is the desire by a number of peoples, especially those who had been previously deported and now returned to their homeland, to regain all the territory which previously belonged to them. The problem of the Germans in the Povolzhye [Volga region] occupies a special place. And although many demands have as yet been expressed in the form of wishes, this does not remove the danger of aspirations to review the boundaries. Despite all the disputes, indecisiveness and even historical injustice, to try to change the existing boundaries at the present time means to create a dangerous groundwork for the emergence of bloody inter-ethnic conflicts. Moreover, the first precedent of this sort will open the way for violence on an inter-ethnic basis, which, taking on an avalanche character, has the prospect of lasting for many generations. All disputed questions must be resolved only by means of lengthy negotiations and through striving for accord. In this sense, we must return once again and permanently declare a correction to the previously adopted law, "On Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples," which states that their political rehabilitation is associated with the restoration of the boundaries lost during the time of relocation of these peoples. As experience shows, the implementation of this law in terms of defining the national-territorial boundaries must be repealed, making the consideration of the interests of the peoples previously living here dependant on other methods of resolution. The minor peoples (national minorities) Among the most numerous people of Russia, aside from the Russians (82 percent), are the Tatars (3.7), Ukrainians (3 percent), Chuvash (1.2 percent), Bashkirs (0.9 percent), the peoples of Dagestan (1.2 percent), and the Belorussians (0.7 percent). These seven peoples make up 93 percent of the population. The remaining 7 percent are comprised of 110 peoples, among which only 26 number more than 100,000 persons. Thus, there are currently 29 primary peoples residing in Dagestan (according to the census of 1926 there were 81 ethnic groups). On the whole, the picture appears as follows: 16 national groups (a total of 7.8 million people) represent the peoples of the CIS countries; 30 national groups (1.3 million people) represent the peoples outside the boundaries of the CIS countries (Englishmen, Bulgarians, Finns, etc.); Another 30 national groups (173,000 people) represent the peoples which do not have statehood anywhere in the world (Gypsies, Assyrians, Uygurs, Kurds, etc.). There are another 22 peoples (116,000) living in Russia but not having national-territorial formations. And, finally, there are 10 peoples (67,000 people) who do not have any national territories, neither in the RF, nor in the CIS, nor in third countries. Based on the fact of such a large number of peoples, we may conclude that the primary means of development for most of them is the creation and strengthening of a national-cultural, and in a number of places also a national-territorial autonomy. In principle this is the most progressive approach for Russia, in which, due to historical peculiarities, the national groups are found in compact groups as well as being dispersed. As for the representatives of all peoples, it would be possible to create a civic (national) assembly under the Russian government, which would operate as a consultative organ according to the principle of representation: One people--one vote. Possible Scenarios for the Development of the Ethnopolitical Process These scenarios are closely associated with the resolution of cardinal tasks on reforming Russia, and with the effect of outlined tendencies in the development of basic spheres of society, including the sphere of relations between various ethnic communities and groups and their political structures. Variant 1. This could be called the ideal. It presupposes the development of events under which the program of stabilization of the economy would be successfully realized, social protection of the population would be ensured, the impulses of market relations would manifest themselves in a positive manner, demands would be unconditionally met, including those directly relating to the problems of inter-ethnic relations on the basis of the negotiation process. In this case, we would be able to expect a resolution of acute inter-ethnic conflicts, an extinguishing of the "hot spots," and a significant reduction in the level of tensions in inter-ethnic relations. However, the realities are such that the negative factors in the economy in 1994 will not disappear, and at times may even make themselves known in more acute forms. The currently intensifying heterogeneity in development of subjects of the RF, and the national-state and national-territorial transformations are manifested in the ever-deepening gap in living standards, and in the indicators of meeting the material and cultural needs of various ethnic groups. As for the possibility of the effect of such a factor of a centripetal tendency as the constitution, this is in grave doubt. Based on the fact that the constitution has been adopted by only a part of the republics, efforts at its active application may evidently exacerbate inter-ethnic contradictions to a certain degree and intensify the negative attitude of the ethnopolitical elite in some republics who view the RF Basic Law as an effort to "tighten the screws" on the part of the center and to turn Russia into a dictatorship or at best a unitarian state. Thus, the factors stimulating centrifugal tendencies are still strongly making themselves known. Therefore, the examined variant of the prognosis, if we keep in mind the near future, is improbable. Variant 2. This characterizes the disperse state of inter-ethnic relations in Russia, distinguished by a rather high degree of tension and national-regional instability. We are speaking specifically about the fact that tensions may be manifested in one form or another within the scope of one or several regions. These are primarily the Northern Caucasus, Povolzhye, certain border zones, places of accumulation of refugees, etc. This variant is probably the most likely. Under such a variation, the primary task will consist of putting a timely end to the conflagration in one region or another, using non-violent methods wherever possible, and not allowing the conflict to expand to an all-federal level. Evidently, it will be necessary to act in such a manner for a number of years. An obstacle to the realization of this variant will be the rather deep mistrust of the real possibilities and abilities of the power structures to resolve inter-ethnic conflicts. Variant 3. This may conditionally be called the "division of Russia." Its scenario presupposes the possibility of such a situation when several republics at once (for example, two or three) reject the requirements of the RF Constitution, and in the process of the escalating confrontation with the center strive to leave the make-up of the Federation. In no case should we underestimate this variant, even though it seems significantly less probable than the second. Variant 4. The "Yugoslavian." This is war, blood, pain and suffering for millions of people--representatives of various ethnic groups. It is the least probable and is reviewed only as a warning. However, we must not lose vigilance. The world of inter-ethnic relations is so complex and multiplanar that what yestereday seemed merely an "abnormal" phenomenon may tomorrow suddenly turn out to be a great misfortune. Footnotes 1.
