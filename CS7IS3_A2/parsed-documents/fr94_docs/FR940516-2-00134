I. Purpose and Substantive Description (a) Authority Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;19 (Fair Housing Act), charges the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development with responsibility to accept and investigate complaints alleging discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national origin in the sale, rental, or financing of most housing. In addition, the Fair Housing Act directs the Secretary to coordinate action with State and local agencies administering fair housing laws and to cooperate with, and render technical assistance to, public or private entities carrying out programs to prevent and eliminate discriminatory housing practices. Section 561 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, 42 U.S.C. 3616 note, established the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) to strengthen the Department's enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and to further fair housing. This program assists projects and activities designed to enforce and enhance compliance with the Fair Housing Act and substantially equivalent State and local fair housing laws. Implementing regulations are found at 24 CFR part 125. Three general categories of activities were established at 24 CFR part 125 for FHIP funding under section 561 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987: The Administrative Enforcement Initiative, the Education and Outreach Initiative, and the Private Enforcement Initiative. Section 905 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA 1992) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992), amended section 561 by adding specific eligible applicants and activities to the Education and Outreach and Private Enforcement Initiatives, as well as an entirely new Fair Housing Organizations Initiative.
