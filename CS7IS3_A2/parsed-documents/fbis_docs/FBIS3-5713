The Zimbabwe-Korea Solidarity and Friendship Association in a statement February 24 noted that the South Korean authorities under the aegis of the United States worked out a policy of developing nuclear weapons and introduced heavy water reactors from the 1970s and now have stockpiled plutonium enough to make hundreds of nuclear bombs and are using them in developing nuclear weapons. The statement stressed that the South Korean authorities must immediately renounce the policy of nuclear arms development that gravely jeopardizes the Korean nation's right to existence and peace and security in Northeast Asia, and must remove the already stockpiled plutonium and remove the heavy water reactors or replace them aith light water reactors. The Indian paper TAMAKA DARBAR said it is no secret that South Korea now is possessed of all basic indices of nuclear armament such as the technology of nuclear development, operation of reactors, extraction of nuclear materials, manufacture of nuclear bombs, nuclear testing, possession of means of nuclear delivery and the established system of war by nuclear weapons. The Nepalese paper HINDU DAINIK wrote that nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula actually comes from South Korea, saying the world recognizes North Korea's sincere efforts for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Jose Fanequico, executive secretary of the Mozambican Committee for Friendship With the People of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in a statement urged that the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency should discard their double- standard policy and check South Korea's nuclear arms development that threatens peace and security in Asia.
