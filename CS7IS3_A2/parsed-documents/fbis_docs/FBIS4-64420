The chief prosecutors of eight State Security Courts also attended the meeting. General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, called Seyfi Oktay to congratulate him on the joint statement. Gen. Gures said that he also congratulated all the chief prosecutors and prosecutors who signed the statement. He said: "I am very pleased by the issuing of such a statement by the prosecutors at such a time." Seyfi Oktay said that he was very pleased by Gen. Gures' call. He said: "The Turkish Army is one of the leading institutions in which the reactionary forces have been unable to infiltrate. Therefore, Gen. Gures' message has made us very happy." Seyfi Oktay described Gen. Gures' call as "an indication of the Turkish Armed Forces' sensitive stance on the question of secularism." Yusuf Kenan Dogan, under secretary of the Ministry of Justice, thanked Gen. Gures for his sensitive approach to the matter. He said: "As the members of the judicial system, we are convinced that Gen. Gures will be successful in the struggle he wages against acts of terrorism to defend our homeland. We wish to stress that we shall always support him." Dogan said that the prosecutors must maintain an impartial stance on all the problems, except on matters related to the safeguarding of the state's indivisible integrity and the Republic's secular system. Recalling that the Republic's prosecutors met in Antalya for the first time, Dogan said that everyone approved the Justice Ministry's effort to maintain the independence of the courts and the judges. Stressing that the pro-Ataturk and secular nature of the courts have been restored, Dogan said: "People who act with common sense do not wish to even consider that Turkey will move toward a dark era once again."
