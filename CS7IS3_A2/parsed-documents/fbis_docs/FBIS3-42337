Dzakula, who had appeared on NTV Studio B [independent television station] two nights ago, was kidnapped by "three skinheads." In the statement for BORBA, Vesna Pesic, chairman of the Citizens Alliance of Serbia and a deputy in the Serbian Assembly, said that she immediately sent a telegram concerning this incident to Minister Zoran Sokolovic and President Milosevic. [passage omitted] Imprisoned for Negotiating Veljko Dzakula, an engineer and former vice president of the Republic of Serbian Krajina; Dusan Ecimovic, former information minister; and adviser Mladen Kulic were in prison until 21 September last year -- first in Knin and then in Glina -- for signing an 11-point agreement with Ivan Milas, leader of the Croatian delegation, after the meeting on 18 February in the village of Doljani near Daruvar. "To sign a secret agreement in times of war is an act of treason," Goran Hadzic, the then president of the Republic of Serbian Krajina said, while Dzakula claimed that he had "the authority to negotiate, since the talks with Croatia concerned local problems -- reconstruction of the infrastructure, delivery of water, electricity..." The interesting thing is that the other three members from the negotiating team not only avoided any blame (and prison) but also remained at their posts in the government of the Republic of Serbian Krajina.
