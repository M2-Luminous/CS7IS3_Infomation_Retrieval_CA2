The statement said the "nuclear problem" raised by the Kim Yong-sam group with the aim of blocking a contact between representatives of Chondoists in the North and the South and frustrating a joint celebration of the centenary of the Kabo Peasant War is a shameless sophism that can convince no one. "Impermissible is any act of trampling upon the patriotic intention of the Chondoists in the North and the South, and the Kim Yong-sam puppet group which is engaged in flunkeyist treacheries and nation-splitting moves must be removed in South Korea at an early date," said the statement. It held that the patriotic initiative of the Chondoists in the North and the South to celebrate the centennal of the 1894 Kabo Peasant War as a common festival of the nation in keeping with the expectation and hope of all the fellow countrymen must be realized under all circumstances. It expressed the hope that the South Korean Chondoists would discard any illusion about the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime and actively turn out in the struggle to sweep away the group of traitors by the united efforts of the whole nation like the forerunners and martyrs who participated in the Kabo Peasant War, and would more vigorously fight to bring the joint celebration of the centenary of the war to a success.
