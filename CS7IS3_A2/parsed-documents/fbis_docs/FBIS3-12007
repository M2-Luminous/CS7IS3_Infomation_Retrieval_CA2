In August 1992 Peru temporarily relinquished -- first until 31 December 1993, and then until 30 April 1994 -- the economic obligations it had under the external common tariffs agreement and the Andean liberalization program. Canale will apparently submit on 4 and 5 April in Caracas -- during the next meeting of the Commission, which is the Andean Pact's top organ -- a proposal for a transition program with a single 15 percent tariff that will be reduced gradually. The Andean Group currently has four types of tariffs -- of 5, 10, 15, and 20 percent -- but they are not yet in force because the tariff levels for some products have not yet been established. According to the Peruvian magazine, Peru cannot return to the Andean Pact all of a sudden, "because this might affect the enterprises of the sectors in which distortions remain in the other Andean Pact countries," which are Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. Peruvian Exporters Association (ADEX) representative Eduardo Irigoyen, a member of the Metal Mechanical Committee, has said that it is essential to return to the Andean Group because his sector and the chemical, lumber, and fishing sectors have great comparative advantages with respect to the other Andean Group nations.
