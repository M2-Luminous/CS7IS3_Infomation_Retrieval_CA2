He was born in the village of Qasr-i 'Arifan in Bukhara. The Naksibendi tariqa, which is very active in the Muslim world, gets its strengths from the fundamental principle of "devotion to the sheykh." After Sheykh Naqshbandi, the tariqa was led by 'Ala-al-Din 'Attar, Ya'qub Carphi, and Muhammad Parsha. This tariqa is classified as a simple tariqa to follow, because it does not interfere with worldly needs such as eating, drinking, sleeping, marrying, and working. The other fundamental principles of the tariqa are: Shari'ah, the religious order, truth, and spiritual knowledge. The first pioneers of the Naksibendi tariqa in Turkey were Ali Haydar Efendi and Mehmet Zahid Kotku. There is a Naksibendi tariqa in every city in Turkey, and there are about 2 million Naksibendi followers in Turkey. The religious communities of the Naksibendi tariqa are known to vote for the Motherland Party [ANAP], the Prosperity Party [RP], and the Grand Unity Party [BBP]. The main Naksibendi publications are ISLAM, ALTINOLUK [The Golden Channel], and BIZIM DERGAH [Our Dervish Monastery]. The following are the religious orders of the Naksibendi tariqa.

Risale-i Nur is the fundamental work of the tariqa's theoretic and practical views. Said-i Nursi said that Nurcuism was not a tariqa. In 1907, he attached the word "Bediuzzaman" (which means wonder of the age) to his name. Said-i Nursi, the most frequent exile in the history of the republic, acquired thousands of supporters and extended his influence to the places where he was exiled. In addition to the areas where the Kurds live, the tariqa has large numbers of supporters in northern Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India, Saudi Arabia, England, and the United States. The Nurcu tariqa strenuously opposes capitalism and also criticizes secularism. Said-i Nursi gave significant sermons on social justice, law, and equality. The tariqa was close to the MNP, MSP, and Justice Party [AP] in the past. Today, it supports The True Path Party [DYP] and the ANAP. Its publications are ZAMAN [Time], YENI ASYA [New Asia], SIZINTI [Leakage], ZAFER [Victory], SUR [City Wall], and BIZIM AILE [Our Family] newspapers.

Suleymanci Tariqa This was founded by Suleyman Hilmi Turahan, a Muslim judge of Silistre. After Turahan, the former deputy of AP, Kemal Kacar became the first man of the tariqa. The tariqa's specific tenets are: strength and missionary spirit, legality and modernism, and discipline and obedience. The tariqa believes that the Office of Religious Affairs has nothing to do with Islam, and has declared the Office and the Principles of Ataturk as foes. The tariqa has about 300 Muslim culture centers. It plays a role in politics. As far as the order is concerned, Turkey is Dar-al-Harb [abode of war], and the religious communities outside its own are not considered Muslims. When greeting people outside its own, "Essamualeykum" [blight be upon you] is used [instead of "Selamunaleykum" which means peace be upon you]. The tariqa supports the DYP and ANAP. By designating pilot regions in the Mediterranean area, the tariqa gained substantial amounts of supporters. The tariqa has retreated from its hard line in recent years. Its present leader is Huseyin Kumas, and it carries out its activities under the umbrella of courses and aid associations in schools. Isikci Tariqa This is also known as the Turkey Group. It was founded by Huseyin Ilmi Isik. In his work entitled Saadet-i Ebediye [Eternal Happiness] he points out the fundamental principles of the tariqa. After Isikci, the true theoretical leader of the Isikcilar tariqa is said to be "Feyz alan" [Knowledge Receiver] Abdul Hakim. The tariqa supports whichever party on the Right is most likely to come to power, places great importance on commerce, and considers every kind of commerce permissible in the name of its struggle. The present leader is said to be "sincere" businessman Dr. Enver Oren. The tariqa has weekly and monthly magazines, including TGRT [Radio and television network of TURKIYE GAZETESI] and TURKIYE GAZETESI, addressing every sector. The Other Tariqas We can group these tariqas under two main headings. The first group is those that are mystically inclined: Mevlevi, Rifai, and Cerrahi tariqas. The second group is those that are radically inclined: Vehabi [Wahhabi] tariqa (greatly influenced by Iran, Syria, and Egypt), Ihvan-i Muslimin [Muslim Brotherhood], and the Muslim clergy supporters. While the radically inclined ones are not able to find much support from people, mystically inclined groups are gaining support every day.
