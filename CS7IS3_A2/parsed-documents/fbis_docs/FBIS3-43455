Speaking to the GHANA NEWS AGENCY in Accra, Dr. Asamoah said the Togolese authorities have no evidence to support the claim that the attackers came from Ghana. He said, however, that the government was monitoring the situation and would respond at the appropriate time. Dr. Asamoah, who is also the acting attorney general and minister of justice, recalled that the Togolese authorities leveled similar accusations against Ghana on the eve of the presidential election in Lome last August. On the closure of the land border with Ghana by the Togolese authorities, the minister described it as unfortunate as it has caused hardship to people living on both sides. Dr. Asamoah hoped it would not be too long for the border to be reopened as provided for under the ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] Treaty.
