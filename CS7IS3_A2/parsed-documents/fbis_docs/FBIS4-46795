At this time there are actually three different rates--the fixed rate, the market rate, and the rate resulting from the relationship of world prices to the domestic prices of goods, which is different for each producer. The potential impact of this situation on Ukrainian exports is everyone's concern. An agency of the Ukrainian Ministry of External Economic Relations assessed the export potential of the main types of industrial commodities in 1994. Table 1 illustrates the results. Table 1 Commodities Unit of Quantity Average Value measurement price (millions of (dollars) dollars) Metallurgical Complex Finished thousands of 10,000-12,400 225 2,250-2,790 rolled metal tonnes Steel pipe 3,700 400 1,480 Cast iron 2,000 92 184 Crude iron 17,000 15 255 ore Ferroalloys 900 380 342 Aluminum and 215 1,100 236 items made of it Alumina 935 200 187 Total around 5,000 Chemical Complex Liquid thousands of 1,500 85 127 ammonia tonnes Carbamide 1,500 84 126 Synthetic 10.7 9,500 102 dyes Polystyrene 52 734 38 Polyethylene 57 700 40 Total 433 Electric Millions of 7,000-9,000 0.03 210-270 power kw/hr Transport 3,000-4,000 vehicles, equipment, and machines Goods for 500 cultural and household use Services 1,500 Total for 10,683-11,683 main commodities It is clear that the products of the metallurgical complex will continue to bring in the most foreign currency. Besides this, there will also be some emphasis on machine building. They should account for most of the receipts. Nevertheless, there is some indication of wishful thinking here. Profitability, after all, is one of the essential conditions of exports, and no one must ever forget that enterprises have to sell 50 percent of their foreign currency receipts to the state at the fixed rate. This puts producers in vastly different positions, because the production costs of all of these commodities are different, but the 50 percent of the foreign currency receipts remaining at the disposal of the enterprises must cover all of the expenses of reproduction and produce a certain amount of profit as well. Obviously, if these conditions are not met, the export of the commodity becomes unprofitable. This means that exports of some of the commodities listed in Table 1 or exports as a whole might be reduced considerably or be discontinued. The reader can judge the validity of this statement for himself. The figures in Table 1 and the results of simple computations, presented in Table 2, illustrate the current situation quite clearly. Table 2 Categories Finished Cast iron Ferroalloys Steel pipe Carbamide Polystyrene rolled metal Average price per 225 92 380 400 84 734 tonne in world market (dollars) Average producer 6.5 2.851 10.925 5.442 1.760 11.6 price in domestic market (millions of karbovantsy/tonne) Average producer price per tonne at fixed 515.5 226 866 432 139.6 919.9 rate of 12,610 krb = $1 per tonne at market 151 66.3 254 127 41 270 rate of 43,000 krb = $1 Dollar exchange 28,960 31,000 28,750 13,605 20,950 15,800 rate based on relationship of world price to producer price, thousands of krb/$1 Producer's receipts from sale of currency at fixed rate of 140,000 580,000 240,000 2,522,000 500,000 460,000 12,610 krb = $1 at market rate of 4,800,000 2,000,000 8,200,000 8,600,000 1,800,000 1,590,000 43,000 krb = $1 We should stipulate from the very start that any price set by a producer in karbovantsy will include a certain profit margin and all overhead expenses, including the cost of using obsolete equipment and inefficient production technology. An analysis of the figures in Table 2 suggests the following: 1. Goods cannot be exported at prices set with consideration for the fixed exchange rate of the dollar, because these prices would be much higher than world prices. In other words, the fixed rate and inflationary processes distort actual enterprise expenses by exaggerating them. It is also impossible, however, to export a commodity at a price set with consideration for the market exchange rate of the dollar, because this would be much lower than the world price and consequently would be a dumping price. 2. The undifferentiated approach to enterprises in different industries which export their products and sell 50 percent of their foreign currency receipts at the fixed rate will reduce exports of the products of the metallurgical complex because the income the enterprises earn will not cover their production costs at the present market exchange rate of the dollar. Exports of products of the chemical industry, on the other hand, probably will increase even under the conditions of the compulsory sale of 50 percent of the foreign currency receipts at the fixed rate. This is due to the high world prices, the fairly low production expenses of producers, and the high market exchange rate of the foreign currency. 3. In view of the fact that the projected export figures for the metallurgical complex are much higher than the projections of other industries, we can assume that enterprises of the metallurgical complex play a cardinal role in the determination of the market exchange rate. This means that unless the fixed rate is adjusted and the requirement for the compulsory sale of 50 percent of foreign currency receipts at this rate is cancelled, enterprises of the metallurgical complex will have an incentive to increase the market value of the dollar and will strive to do this, because this will give them a chance (their only chance) to cover their own expenses, earn a good income, and increase their output. Finally, if the National Bank could start buying foreign currency at the effective enterprise or industry rate, this would benefit the producers and the state. Furthermore, this probably would aid in stabilizing the exchange rate of the Ukrainian karbovanets.
