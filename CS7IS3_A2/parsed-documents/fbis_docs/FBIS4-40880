What "Heritage" Will Z. Paznyak Inherit From the V. Kebich Government? The Kebich government received all necessary powers from the Supreme Soviet to implement market reforms and stabilize and strengthen the economy of the Republic. However, four years have passed. Within this period: -- The volume of production has decreased by more than 50 percent; -- Inflation exceeded 50 percent per month; -- Foreign debts now total some $1.5 billion and are growing at a rate of $1 billion a year; -- Prices for basic consumer goods jumped by 3,000 percent; -- Seven in every ten Belarusian citizens live below the poverty level. Time -- the most valuable factor -- has been lost. The years 1991 and 1992 were the most favorable for reforming the national economy. This time could have been used to carry out profound reconstruction of the national economy with much lower expenditures, for introducing new jobs, for producing competitive products, and for ensuring public welfare. The government has not only failed to begin reforming the economy in this direction, but has no idea of how to do this. II. Reasons for the Economic Crisis -- Deliberate unwillingness on the part of the government to pursue an independent economic policy, the lack of political will -- to formulate a track for the state's development -- among the majority of Supreme Soviet deputies. -- Violation of basic economic concepts of ownership. The economy preserved its nonmarket nature, however, despite this, [the government] tried to implant market mechanisms and levers. This triggered the mismanagement of, and anarchy in, the production sector, the violation of proportions between work and consumption, which, in turn, prompted profiteering drives, a drop in production, and inflation. -- Continuous destruction of the monetary and credit system. -- Foreign trade is directed against domestic producers, especially against our agricultural workers. -- The preservation of the dominant state ownership in both the industrial and agricultural sectors. -- Lack of goals and programs postulating the transition of the national economy to alternate principles, to the opposite type of production -- production based on a market economy. III. Why Does Belarus Require the Market? According to the experience of advanced states, the economy has no other mechanisms -- other than the market -- to promptly report on who requires our products and to objectively report on the efficiency of national enterprises. IV. Key Principles of Reforms -- In line with the Constitution. In line with Clause No. 1 of the Constitution, "... The Republic of Belarus has all powers on its territory to pursue an independent domestic and foreign policy. "The Republic of Belarus protects its independence and territorial integrity, constitutional order, and provides for lawfulness and legal order." The implementation of reforms in the Belarusian economy will entirely correspond to the constitutional principles and vital interests of our people. -- With this purpose in mind, all factors shaping Belarusian statehood -- borders, customs checkpoints, a national currency, banking system with the central bank, the ability to protect our state sovereignty (the national Armed Forces) -- should be preserved. -- Nonviolation of the principles of the inviolability of ownership and preservation of ownership rights. Each person must be sure that their hard-earned property will never be expropriated. -- In the state-owned sector, functions of maintaining state property and exercising power will be separated. (Functions of exercising power will be transferred to stock holding companies and concerns, while functions of maintaining state property -- to the Ministry for Management of State Property; terrestrial property is defined according to the law on land.) -- Market relations -- given the equality of all forms of ownership -- will be put on a legal footing to provide for: a) The freedom of economic activity for physical and economic entities; b) Freedom of people's consumption on the market; c) Setting conditions for the development of competition. -- The establishment of a private (nonstate) sector in the economy through destatization and privatization, the formulation of state policy encouraging entrepreneurship. -- The adoption of military expenditures standing at no more than 6 percent of Gross National Product. -- State policy aimed at the profound reconstructing of the Belarusian economy and providing selective support to specific enterprises and sectors of the economy which have real chances to enter the global market with competitive products. -- The implementation of monetary reform and the legal strengthening of the national currency of the Republic of Belarus as sole legal tender. -- The establishment of a taxation system aimed at supporting production, the pursuing of an active investment policy; an increase in amortization allotments. -- An active and designated social policy aimed at supporting the unprotected segments of society at the expense of the state and local budgets. -- A guaranteed redemption of state debts to the citizens at the expense of privatizing state property, as well as at the expense of real estate. -- The implementation of a new budget policy based on: a) The formation of the budget from below, at the local government level, b) Procurement of profits using state property, c) The refusal to issue subsidies to producers, however, support for financially insecure citizens is obligatory, d) Reducing expenditures for maintaining the state administration, e) Earmarking considerable funds to ensure the legal order, protecting the life and health of citizens, guaranteeing ownership rights, and protecting the property of physical and economic entities, f) Financing such sectors as culture, scientific development, education, and health care, g) Financing Chernobyl cleanup programs and establishing a system for ensuring environmental safety. V. Domestic Economic Policy The domestic economic policy will set conditions ensuring the stabilization of the economy and providing for the welfare of citizens. To realize this goal, the Belarusian economy must be put on the market track. Special attention will be focused on the nonstate sector of the economy, toward support for small- and mid-sized businesses. A quick transition to market purchasing and selling of all products and resources will be implemented. This is a key condition for the implementation of reforms ensuring the economic order and giving producers genuine knowledge about the needs of society for specific products, resources, and labor. All the remaining issues -- social security, privatization, procurement of foodstuffs, conversion, etc. -- cannot be resolved without the absolute independence of businesses on the condition that they receive maximum profits. Market trade is based on trade contracts and money is the means of serving them. Therefore, we will adopt such a monetary and credit policy that will shrink the monthly inflation rate to 2-3 percent. To implement this, monetary reform -- along with establishing the customs territory, accumulating currency reserves, establishing an appropriate financial infrastructure, resolving technical issues such as printing money and drafting a normative basis [not further identified] -- will be carried out. During the first stage, accounting checks from the National Bank will receive the status of national currency. The key means to provide for "sound" money will be the transition of all businesses, irrespective of the forms of ownership, to a system of market relations. In addition, the law on bankruptcy -- with all the necessary leverage for its implementation -- will be adopted. Other urgent measures include: -- The legal shaping of the state debt, procedures for its molding, and sources for the redemption of this debt. -- Recognition of compensations -- for bank deposits of citizens and residential housing construction cooperatives, and for a part of the pensioners' fund -- as related to the category of state debt. -- Implementation of a new policy regarding wages and incomes of state sector workers and employees of budget-sector institutions postulating that people with equal qualifications and job performance are equitably compensated. -- Antimonopoly policy and state control over conditions providing for competition among producers. -- A housing policy aimed at building houses at the expense of the partial utilization of state funds to set up an engineering infrastructure in construction areas and citizens' savings to build houses. To provide for this, financial mortgage institutions will be established. A state energy program aimed at renewing and developing the national energy-generating capacities will be drafted and implemented. A tariff policy that encourages energy-saving steps and state standards defining obligatory conditions for the conservation of resources will be adopted. -- The implementation of an efficient demographic policy supporting women, children, and young families. -- An efficient migration policy in the interests of the state. Belarus has considerable raw material and mineral resources. Therefore, a state program regarding the development of ferrous, nonferrous, and rare-earth metals, and additional prospecting for energy resources will be drafted. The proposed technologies should also include stringent environmental controls. A range of agreements -- on issuing concessions for extracting raw materials and energy resources on the territory of other states -- will be signed. VI. Land Reform Land is a key strategic resource of any state. It is on the land where a person lives and produces, on the basis of which agricultural production functions. The Republic of Belarus -- a big state in the middle of Europe with a moderate climate -- is rich in land resources. Attitudes toward land and land management should be economically sound, scientifically founded, and efficient. Currently, land policy is acquiring a particular weight when our society has to move to a new stage -- toward a market economy when the role of the state is considerably decreased, when incompetent politicians can carry out the total privatization of land which is scientifically and methodically unfounded. (By the way, in 1992, the opposition Belarusian Popular Front faction in the Supreme Soviet managed to vote down such concept of privatization, in other words, "collective ownership.") State policy should be rational, scientifically based, and stringent. The government should establish a committee for, and -- during the implementation of reforms -- a ministry for land resources. We favor privatizing land ownership, equal rights for all citizens in land privatization, however, we oppose land as a source of profiteering or a basis for the exclusive power of the corrupt nomenklatura (officials). We require new laws on land. Land should become a commodity, but of a specific nature. The key condition for the efficient utilization of land and its socially-fair privatization is the establishment of precise land valuation, otherwise, not privatization but land-grabbing will happen. To introduce land evaluation, a special state body should be established which -- by not violating the rights of local bodies -- will keep privatization in line with state interests. Local authorities should have their own funds to implement social programs. The land tax -- a key source in forming a budget in the agricultural areas -- will raise this money. Kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and other users of land should not supplant local bodies, but engage in economic activities and pay -- like all other land users -- a land tax that is economically founded and equal for all. It is strictly prohibited to purchase land rights by purchasing real estate. Currently, it is possible to automatically privatize a plot of land in a city when privatizing a shabby house. We will abolish such a practice. Favoring the unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus, some politicians do not realize the consequences of this move. Unification with a state, which has already established its market structure and mortgage banks, and which has experience in privatizing [state property] -- including land -- leads to a situation whereby a Belarusian agricultural worker or an entrepreneur (our powers did not allow them to become land owners) could be left without land in their native state. Privatization of land is not an aim in itself, but a way to raise the efficiency of the economy, a way of guaranteeing the establishment of a network of small enterprises processing agricultural products. This means that agricultural products will be preserved, and our export potential will be increased. This is our key guarantee for any investments and, hence, the primary condition for spurring investment and the economy in general. The land market -- functioning through mortgage banks and land mortgages, a nonemission credit policy -- is the real way out of the crisis, a path along which all developed states had gone. Belarus is extremely rich in land resources. We should now be wise in using them. VII. Agrarian Policy The key goal of our agrarian policy is the welfare of an agricultural worker and the efficiency of his work. Land should reacquire masters, and our society -- agricultural workers. As a result, an entrepreneur could engage in private enterprise, and could choose what and where to produce without any state involvement. All forms of organized production -- state, collective, and individual -- will have equal rights. Kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and farmers could set prices for their products themselves. Only the market will regulate them. Each producer will become an owner of his own products, and will be able to sell them -- for a profit -- without any state restrictions. The evil practice of signing obligatory contracts based on low prices will be abolished. Purchasing land on preferential terms for private ownership with the right to divide and sell it (except for agricultural production) is economic nonsense. Preferential terms could be postulated only when land plots are apportioned to financially insecure sectors of the population for temporary (or indefinite) use within a legal framework. As for the land for agricultural purposes, we favor free privatization of land by those citizens and associations who want to work on this land, however, it would be based on the Republican legislation, on condition that free privatization will account for not more than 30 percent of the total land in this category. Further increases in agricultural land holding will take place at the expense of land leasing from the state (with the right to subsequent purchase) on equal terms for all economic entities irrespective of the forms of ownership. Our state is slow in competing for agricultural commodities markets. If, in the near future, we do not develop agricultural production that is efficient and competitive, we could even lose our domestic market due to high production costs. Our businesses will have the opportunity to become market structures, voluntary associations of owners in the form of partnerships, stock partnerships, unions, associations, etc. Equal conditions for the development of various forms of production organizations -- both collective and individual -- will be created. State programs for financing technological reconstruction, the proportional development of all sectors of agricultural production will be drafted. A network of agricultural mortgage banks -- to credit agricultural production, to build houses and sites of social designation based on property mortgage -- will be established in the shortest time possible. Special attention will be devoted to the processing of the agricultural production. Primarily, all state-owned meat processing factories, dairy plants, sugar refineries, fruit-and-vegetable processing plants, and related businesses will be privatized. All businesses will receive their share of stock. Favorable credits -- for purchasing installations and building small processing enterprises -- will be earmarked. To more efficiently use and promptly supply all producers with agricultural vehicles, all agricultural equipment will be privatized. Based on currently existing workshops in the agricultural sector, servicing organizations (stations) will service state, collective, and agricultural businesses and private plots. Foreign Economic Policy Our foreign economic policy is aimed at establishing partnerships primarily with neighboring states. Belarus is striving to sign agreements on free trade, customs and currency unions, on ensuring mutual freedom for activity of economic entities, on most-favored-nation status, on ensuring guarantees for the right of ownership, the protection of personal property and property of economic entities on their territories, and in the long run -- setting up a common market. Monopoly in foreign trade will be abolished. The number of suppliers and consumers -- particularly, in energy resources -- will increase. A new customs policy -- encouraging exports -- and a new license policy -- regulating imports -- will be formulated. A single free economic and off-shore zone on the territory of the Republic of Belarus -- making it attractive to foreign trade -- will create new jobs and increase the national income. Across the territory of Belarus, a free banking zone -- based on Swiss banking laws -- will be established. This will make Belarus attractive to foreign banks and investment companies. A system of international exchanges -- stock, energy resources, metals, grain -- will be established.
