It has been approved by the decree "On Measures Regarding State Support of Small Entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation for 1994-1995," which was officially distributed yesterday. Such steps are in full accord with the fashionable trend of world economic policy; however, they can hardly yield a real economic effect. The singularity of Russian economic policy is that the authorities are simply compelled to regularly demonstrate attention to the problems of small business. The reason for this is that in the Russian social consciousness the economic reforms have been associated for a rather long time already with the support by the state of small private enterprises and cooperatives in the struggle against the large state enteprises which have monopolized the markets. Still more important is the fact that such a stereotype exists also among Western creditors and international financial organizations, which traditionally require from the Russian authorities precisely the support of small private enterprise--as evidence of adherence to the course of the reforms. This is to be explained by the fact that now in the industrially developed countries (especially in the USA) state support of small business has become a fashionable trend of economic policy. Western officials want in this way to demonstrate their concern about increasing the competitiveness of national products on world markets. It is considered that precisely small business now moves scientific and technical progress. The paradox, it is true, is that the need for state support of small business is not at all incontrovertible. In the Western countries a large number of small firms prosper not thanks to but frequently in spite of the authorities (a vivid example in this respect is Italy, where small business has occupied a predominant position in the economy as a consequence of the population's mistrust of the state). However, the Russian authorities don't go into discussions about the effectiveness of state support of small business. A Fund for the Support of Entrepreneurship and the Development of Competition under the Russian Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures was formed as far back as April of last year and a wide-ranging decree "On Top-Priority Measures for the Development and State Support of Small Entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation" was adopted in May. And, finally, now with the adoption of a Federal Program of state support for small entrepreneurship for 1994-1995, this help has acquired as formalized a form as possible. True, the measures envisaged by the program are rather vague. Basically it is the development on order of all the same stock of drafts of legislative acts concerning privileges for small entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, it is not to be ruled out that, thanks to the program, individual entrepreneurs will be able to obtain preferential loans this year. Moreover, the chances for this are higher among the representatives of the regions (the program declares the fund's intention to give credit support to the entrepreneurs of Murmansk, Novgorod, Pskov, Tula and Nizhniy Novgorod (Nizhegorodskaya) oblasts). However, unbiased analysis indicates that in any case realistic prospects for the development of small business in Russia is rather connected not with the strengthening of state support but, on the contrary, with the weakening of state control over the economy. Financing of the Federal Program for State Support of Small Entrepreneurship in 1994-1995 (bill. rubles in 1993 prices) From the Federal Budget--210.22, including: --for the implementation of federal measures--18.38; --for shared participation in regional programs--191.84.
