Under the accord, which follows a transatlantic agreement reached in February, direct cod fishing will be suspended in the region, known as 3 N-O, until the end of the year. The accord confirms the ceiling set by the earlier agreement of 6,000 tonnes for by-catches in the region. Under the by-catches arrangement, vessels fishing for other species are allowed a limit of 5 percent cod in their catch, up to the 6,000-tonne ceiling. Canada had been asking for a total ban on cod fishing in the region, arguing that continued exploitation was threatening to wipe out stocks of the species there completely. Earlier in the day the EU fisheries ministers agreed to apply stricter controls on fish imports, mainly from Russian, Ukrainian and Polish ships, in a bid to combat a glut of cheap foreign fish.
