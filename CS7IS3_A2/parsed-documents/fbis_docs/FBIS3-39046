At a meeting in Mugla, Erbakan stated that the parties that have been governing Turkey for the past 50 years have brought misery on the people. He alleged that because of the practice of charging interest, the country's economy is collapsing. Our correspondent Omer Kebabcioglu reports that Erbakan explained that interest affects prices. [Begin Erbakan recording] Everything is being done on the basis of interest in this country. Interest is written off as expenses and is included in the price of goods. Ultimately, it is you, the citizens, who pay for all the interest paid in the banks. The interest crushes you. Look, one third of my jacket is interest. One third of my shoes is interest. One third of cheese is interest. Everything is interest. You pay for the interest in the end, because you voted for those who believe in interest. On the other hand taxes are levied on profits, and profits are made on sold goods. Profits are included in the prices. This means that the low income groups pay for all the taxes paid. What I am saying is that when the PP establishes a just order, it will lift all this interest. [end recording] Addressing meetings in Denizli and Afyon, Erbakan charged that the government is pursuing the wrong foreign policy. On the massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Erbakan said that it a shame for humanity that the world is remaining passive before these savage acts. He stressed that the United States and the world do not want to intervene, adding: They want to see the Muslims eliminated. Erbakan said that the government is compromising regarding Cyprus. Only we will be able to solve foreign policy problems, he said.
