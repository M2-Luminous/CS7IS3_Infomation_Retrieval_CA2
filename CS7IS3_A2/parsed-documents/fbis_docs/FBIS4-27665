He gave the instruction after receiving reports on the latest developments in the North Korean nuclear issue from Chief of Staff Pak Kwang-yong in Seoul and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and foreign affairs and security aide Chong Chong-uk in Moscow. Tension over Pyongyang's nuclear program is mounting as the U.N. Security Council moves toward sanctions against the Stalinist state, and the government should be scrupulous in dealing with such tension, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik quoted Kim as telling Prime Minister Yi. The transparency of North Korea's nuclear development program must be guaranteed under all circumstances, and on this principle the government should maintain close cooperation with the United States and Japan in considering future action, President Kim said. Kim asked Prime Minister Yi to ensure that the people can go about their business with full trust in the government and without any sense of crisis.
