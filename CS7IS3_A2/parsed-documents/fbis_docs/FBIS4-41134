Our correspondent Gevorg Gazaryan was present. [Begin recording] [Gazaryan] Armenian Presidential Press Secretary Levon Zurabyan opened his news conference by saying: The republic's president has so often expressed his views on the Constitution that there is no need to discuss it again today. I will instead discuss Karabakh and the peace process. He reminded reporters of the different phases of the mediation efforts for peace by the CSCE and Russia, and of the fact that no guaranteed cease-fire has been established due to the position of the Azerbaijani authorities, something that could have opened the door to further steps. Asked about Azerbaijan's position on the establishment of peace in the region, Mr. Zurabyan said: [Zurabyan] Azerbaijan is reneging on its previous position, which it declared during the visit of Ambassador Mosberg, deputy chairman of CSCE Minsk Group, to the region between 26 April to 2 May. At that time, Azerbaijan was ready for an unconditional cease-fire. This change, and the latest incidents in Noyemberyanskiy Rayon, about which you already know, and the [Armenian] Foreign Ministry's statement on 18 June in connection with these incidents testify to the hardening of Azerbaijan's position. This causes serious concern for Armenia. [Gazaryan] The press secretary then assessed the mediation efforts of Jan Eliasson, chairman of CSCE Minsk Group. Let me remind you that Eliasson visited Baku and Yerevan twice and Stepanakert once. The ambassador met with the Armenian president. He also met the Armenian foreign minister yesterday. [Zurabyan] Eliasson's mission produced no tangible progress in the peace process in practical terms. In contrast to his previous visit, this time joint examination of the first and second phases [of the peace process] and the deployment of the peace forces in the conflict zone were stressed. Eliasson also expressed concern that if there were a delay in agreement on the second phase, the CSCE observers who were to be deployed at the first phase could find themselves in a dangerous and uncertain situation. [Gazaryan] Asked if the CSCE and Russian mediatory efforts have reached an impasse, the press secretary replied: [Zurabyan] Regarding cooperation between CSCE and Russia on stationing observers and peace forces -- which would have prevented Azerbaijan from engaging in constant evasive maneuvers between the two mediatory missions -- there has not been any real progress on this issue yet. In effect, this issue lacks the necessary mutual consensus and cooperation, which otherwise would substantially contribute to the productivity of the peaceful settlement. [end recording]
