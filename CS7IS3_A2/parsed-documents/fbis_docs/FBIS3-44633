These leading personnel also delivered their important speeches at the gathering. Niemenggu University is the only key higher educational institution of the autonomous region. Over the past 36 years, it has turned out 15,118 graduates of various categories for the state and the autonomous region. In order to meet the challenge of world technical revolution and to accelerate the development of higher education in the country, the state put forward the enforcement of "211 project" in 1992, in which the state urged localities across the country to successfully foster 100 key universities and a large number of courses so as to enable the teaching quality and scientific research and management to reach the higher level both at home and broad as much aspossible in the beginning of next century. The autonomous regional party committee and people's government have attached great importance on this project and decided to support Neimenggu University to strive to join in the state "211 project." Over the past six months, the university has formulated its eight- year plan for construction and development by making careful preparations and conducting repeated studies and multiple appraisals in the fields of schooling scale, establishing specialized courses, and making more investments in school. In line with the plan, the university's student number will increase from more than 4,000 at present to 7,000 by the beginning of next century and its specialized courses' number will increase from 27 at present to 44. It will have 19 new courses for master-degree students and five new courses for doctor-degree students. Its graduate students' number will reach to 500 and its standards of key courses, teaching, and scientific research will reach to the advanced levels both at home and abroad. After hearing the report Wang Qun fully acknowledged the work done by the university and delivered an important speech on the issue of how to operate a socialist university with Chinese characteristics and how to train transcentury talented personnel. He said: We should never shake our will in upholding the party's education line and the socialist schooling orientation and in training "four haves" new successors. At present we should earnestly and successfully study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, arm our minds with the socialist theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and correct the weaker situation in the political work undertaken by the higher educational institutions. Efforts should be made to uphold the principle of scoring achievements in both political and professional work. He urged Neimenggu University to do a good job in taking the lead in this regard. Only by successfully studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, defining the schooling orientation, fostering targets, can the university do a better job in various fields for striving to join in the "211 project" and lay a solid foundation for turning itself into an advanced socialist university with Chinese characteristics. Wang Qun said: The task undertaken by the university in striving to join in the state "211 project" has been decided by the autonomous regional party committee and people's government. Thus, the university should only go ahead with the task without retrogression and only do a good job in the task without giving it up halfway. The task of joining in the state "211 project" requires a large amount of financial and material resources and represents a mission with hard work. Units from top to bottom should overcome difficulties together and do a good job in fulfilling the task because the autonomous regional party and people's government have made up their mind. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to uphold the spirit of seeking truth from facts and to refrain from separating the region's reality from the task. Just following the spirit of "the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political College", Neimenggu University has scored marked achievements in improving its former poor schooling conditions. Such a spirit should be carried forward forever and we should never cast away the spirit even if our schooling conditions have become good in the future. Wang Qun pointed out: Various work cannot be separated from the programs of reform and opening up and so does the university in joining in the state "211 project". It should dare to pioneer and to try in the task and change its concept at present. First of all it should change its concept of running the university under the guidance of the planned economy. The university should have all its work meet the needs of building the market economy and train talented personnel for next century suitable to the economic development of China and Inner Mongolia. At present the region's college graduates are many and those who are suitable to the needs of developing the socialist market economy are few. In order to deal with the shortage of talented personnel in the region, it is imperative to accelerate the reform among the higher educational institutions. Neimenggu University should dare to pioneer and to try in the reform. It should tap its internal potential and while seeking development, it should also tap the potential in setting up cooperative programs with outside places. It should not only operate its activities in an open way but also set up its training courses in outside places. In conducting the teaching of some specialized courses, the higher educational institutions should regard enterprises as reliable partners and set up cooperative programs with economic and productive departments. In conducting scientific research, these educational institutions may have these departments define their courses and provide funds so that both of them can commonly achieve development. They should place the programs of developing and manufacturing high scientific and technological products on the first position and also strive to win support from various social circles. They should correctly deal with the relation between institutions' development and reform, stability so as to apply stability to ensuring development and to regard reform as a motive force in promoting development. Wang Zhan and Zhao Zhihong also delivered their speeches at the gathering.
