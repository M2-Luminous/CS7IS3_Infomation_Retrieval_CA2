FR940303-1-00064 FR940303-1-00011 PART 301_DEFINITIONS 1. The authority citation for part 301 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 450, 1901&hyph;1906; 21 U.S.C. 601&hyph;695; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.55. 2. Section 301.2 would be amended by revising paragraph (rr) to read as follows: §301.2 Definitions. * * * * * (rr) Meat. (1) The part of the muscle of any cattle, sheep, swine, or goats, which is skeletal or which is found in the tongue, in the diaphragm, in the heart, or in the esophagus, with or without the accompanying and overlying fat, and the portions of bone, skin, sinew, nerve, and blood vessels which normally accompany the muscle tissue and which are not separated from it in the process of dressing. It does not include the muscle found in the lips, snout, or ears. This term, as applied to products of equines, shall have a meaning comparable to that provided in this paragraph with respect to cattle, sheep, swine, and goats. (2) The product derived from the mechanical separation of the skeletal muscle tissue from the bones of livestock using the advances in mechanical meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems that do not crush, grind, or pulverize bones, and from which the bones emerge comparable to those resulting from hand-deboning (i.e., essentially intact and in natural physical conformation such that they are recognizable, such as loin bones and rib bones, when they emerge from the machinery) which: (i) Meets the criteria of no more than 0.15 percent or 150 mg/100 gm of product for calcium (as a measure of bone solids content) within a tolerance of 0.03 percent or 30 mg and meets the criteria of a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent or an essential amino acids content of at least 33 percent of the total amino acids present in the meat, as assured by an approved quality control program described in §318.24 of this subchapter; (ii) Is produced under an approved quality control program set forth in §318.24 of this subchapter; and (iii) Is handled in conformance with §318.18 of this subchapter. * * * * * PART 318_ENTRY INTO OFFICIAL ESTABLISHMENTS; REINSPECTION AND PREPARATION OF PRODUCTS 3. The authority citation for part 318 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 450, 1901&hyph;1906; 21 U.S.C. 601&hyph;695; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.55. 4. Section 318.18 would be revised to read as follows: §318.18 Handling of certain material for mechanical processing. Material to be processed into ``Mechanically Separated (Species)'' or meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems shall be so processed within 1 hour from the time it is cut or separated from carcasses or parts of carcasses, except that such product may be held for no more than 72 hours at 40 ○F. (4 ○C.) or less, or held indefinitely at 0 ○F. (^18 ○C.) or less. ``Mechanically Separated (Species)'' or meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems shall, directly after being processed, be used as an ingredient in a meat food product, except that it may be held prior to such use for no more than 72 hours at 40 ○F. (4 ○C.) or less or indefinitely at 0 ○F. (^18 ○C.) or less. 5. Part 318 would be amended by adding a new §318.24 to read as follows: §318.24 Compliance procedures for meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems. (a) The product resulting from the separating process shall not have a calcium content exceeding 0.15 percent or 150 mg/100 gm of product within a tolerance of 0.03 percent or 30 mg, and it shall have a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent (except as modified in paragraph (b) of this section). (b) An essential amino acid content of at least 33 percent of the total amino acids present in the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems shall be accepted as evidence of compliance with the protein quality requirement set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, essential amino acid content includes isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and valine content, and the total amino acids present include isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine, alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, proline, serine, and hydroxyproline content.
