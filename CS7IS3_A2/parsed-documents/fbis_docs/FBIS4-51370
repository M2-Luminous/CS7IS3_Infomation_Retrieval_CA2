The township and town enterprises have developed in a sustained and rapid manner, and their growth rate has been in the forefront in China for three years running. Agriculture has developed steadily, good harvests have been reaped for several successive years, and there has been marked progress in the construction of the infrastructure, such as transportation, telecommunications, and power. The momentum of development in a number of key construction projects is very good, and the pace of opening to the outside world has also been accelerated. The actual amount of foreign capital used has increased by a big margin as compared with the past. In addition, greater efforts have been made to help the poor. Talking about why Guangxi has made gratifying achievements in reform, opening up, and economic construction, Cheng Kejie and Ding Tingmo said it is mainly because of the policies for Guangxi formulated by the central authorities. It is also the result of the concerted efforts of various trades and professions, party members and cadres at all levels, and people of all nationalities in Guangxi who are using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as guidance for practice. Cheng Kejie and Ding Tingmo hoped that the reporters would visit various localities in Guangxi, tell the public more about the region, and make valuable suggestions on the work there.
