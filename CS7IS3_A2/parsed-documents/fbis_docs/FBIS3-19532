Pasqua said that in Paris the protest drew up to 35,000 people, two-thirds of them students and the rest union supporters. Union leaders had put the total at 50,000. In other French cities and towns, between 180,000 and 200,000 people took part in protests, Pasqua said. The demonstrations were called to denounce a government plan to fight unemployment by letting businesses pay young people less than the minimum wage. In Paris, demonstrators burned about a dozen cars and threw stones at police and occasionally at union leaders.
