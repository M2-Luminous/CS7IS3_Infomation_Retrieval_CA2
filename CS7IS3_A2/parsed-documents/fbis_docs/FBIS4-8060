The soldiers began crossing the river, which had marked the front line between warring forces, shortly after 3:00 p.m. (1300 GMT), the UNHCR spokesman in Zagreb, Peter Kessler said. Half an hour later, shells continued to "pour down" on the villages of Bacci and Vinarici to the south of Gorazde, while three other villages to the east were in flames, he added. General Michael Rose, commander of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia, called off a flight to Brussels from the Croatian port of Split and returned rapidly to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, UNPROFOR officials here said. Rose's spokesman here was unable to say whether the sudden change in his plans was due to developments in Gorazde. [passage omitted]
