He cautioned during today's weekly news conference that the decision of Romania's Prosecutor General of appellation against final court decisions regarding the confiscated houses was a direct consequence of President Iliescu's position. Regarding the no-confidence motion [against the Nicolae Vacaroiu government], the PNTCD leadership considered that irrespective of the results of the vote, a change of the government was inevitable, and it did not rule out the likeliness of early elections either, considering the grave economic situation. The leadership of the PNTCD considers that the Democratic Party-National Salvation Front's [PD-FSN] position in the opposition is declarative, rather than based on concrete actions. Referring to that party's "hesitant" stand on the PNTCD's initiative to suspend President Ion Iliescu from office, Senator Radu Vasile noted that the PD-FSN was manifest as an opposition party "especially on an external plane [abroad]." Both Radu Vasile and Ion Diaconescu, PNTCD first deputy presidents, disapproved of the PD-FSN parliamentarians' having failed to sign so far the list regarding the suspension procedure. "This is a conjuncture alliance pursuing to change the parliamentary majority," said Ion Diaconescu cautioning that this alliance "does not mean we have forgiven the FSN's [National Salvation Front] past mistakes made at the time it was the ruling party."
