He has been strongly urging the need to regenerate the party. The plan is composed of four pillars, including plans to fundamentally review the party platform and actively promote young LDP members. Watanabe plans to present his plan to LDP President Yohei Kono following the Golden Week holiday. When he decided to abandon his plans to run for the premiership and to secede from the LDP, Watanabe met with Kono. At the meeting, Watanabe stressed the need to reform the party, saying: "We need reform that is equivalent to forming a new party." He expressed a strong sense of crisis because the LDP, while running the government for so many years, had bureaucratized personnel matters as well as party organizations, thus losing its vitality. His plan calls for: 1) a drastic review of the party platform which dates from the Cold War era; 2) promoting young and promising members; 3) streamlining LDP headquarters by reorganizing party organs; and 4) activating local organizations and strengthening cooperative ties between local organizations and headquarters. In particular, he explains the "need to find promising people" by abolishing the long-established seniority system, under which cabinet posts were allocated to those who had been elected to the Diet more than five or six times. Moreover, he urges the need to reduce the number of people working at headquarters, trim expenses, and review local and other small organizations. He also urges the need to intensify headquarters' daily activities. At its general meeting held on 27 April, the Watanabe faction decided to map out concrete plans to reform the party. However, the faction did that to flesh out "Watanabe's private proposal." After the Watanabe faction completes its work and maps out concrete plans, Watanabe intends to strongly urge Kono and the LDP executive department to bring about reform.
