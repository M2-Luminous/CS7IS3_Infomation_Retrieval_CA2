FBIS3-48871 "dreas020__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-020-A Document Type:Daily Report 31 January 1994 ANNEX Japan `Secret Note' Source of Phone Accord Friction OW3001223594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 28 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW3001223594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] It has been revealed that a secret note was attached to an agreement Japan and the United States concluded in 1989 to expand the access of U.S.-made mobile and portable telephones to the Japanese market and that the two countries are at odds about the interpretation of the note. Japan wrote the note as a "preamble" which stipulates the spirit of the agreement. With regard to the interpretation of the phrase "equal market access" in the preamble, the United States has maintained that this phrase "assures the U.S.- system a share equal to the Japanese-system." Meanwhile, Japan has refuted the U.S. view, saying: "It only means that the U.S. system will also be given an opportunity for access to the Japanese market." The friction over mobile and cellular phones, which came to the fore again at the end of last year, has become complicated. The outline of the 1989 Japan-U.S. agreement stated that new frequencies would be allocated to the U.S. Motorola-system apparatus so it could be used in the metropolitan and central areas of Japan. Following the agreement, Japan Mobile Communication Co. (IDO) has begun providing service via the Motorola-system in addition to its original service via the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) system. According to IDO, the Motorola system is characterized by relatively low charges for a telephone call. However, due to the difference in the number of ground relay stations, the area available for service via the Motorola-system is smaller than for the NTT-system. That is why about 310,000 units have subscribed to the NTT-system while only about 10,000 units to the Motorola-system. The United States is dissatisfied with the figure. Threatening sanctions based on the U.S. commercial law, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) began investigating the case last December, saying: "There is a possibility that Japan has not abided by the 1989 agreement." The results of the investigation will be issued on 15 February. The very note was sent to [then] Deputy USTR Lin Williams [name as published] of the Bush administration by [then] Administrative Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Yuzai Okuyama (currently president of DDI [Daini Denden Company]). According to a source concerned, there was the following clause in the note: "Measures included in the agreement should reflect the principles of MOSS (market-oriented sector selective) talks (which Japan and the United States concluded in 1986) such as transparency, home-country treatment, equal market access, and nondiscrimination against foreign companies." It appears that on the basis of the phrase "equal market access" in the clause, the United States has asked the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications "to instruct IDO to take measures such as increasing relay stations so that the Motorola-system will grow to the same level as the NTT-system." However, the ministry has rejected the U.S. request, saying this "is not an issue the government can touch." In this connection, Mr. Okuyama says: "Although it is true that the note exists, I indicated the view in the note that Motorola-system mobile and portable telephones would be given an opportunity to access the Japanese market through allocation of new frequencies. I am sure that the United States consented to such an interpretation at that time. If, at present, the country maintains that the phrase assures the Motorola-system of an equal share with the NTT-system, that is regrettable."
