The present is the crucial period for spring farming. We should be mobilized and seize the opportunity to combat drought to ensure wheat field management and spring sowing, ensure that this year's summer grain output is not lower than last year's, and reap a bumper harvest in the whole year. Gao Dezhan arrived in Baodi County without fanfare early in the morning. He inspected the antidrought work and spring plowing and conducted investigation and study on implementation of the guidelines of the central rural work conference. He first came to the wheat field along the Jinwei Highway in Dakoutun Town to inspect how wheat seedlings were growing. Gao Dezhan greeted Yang Zizhong, a peasant who was working, cordially talked with them, asked him in detail about irrigation, fertilizer application, and wheat field management, and also asked whether he had difficulties. He said to the rural cadres beside him: We should mobilize town, township, and village cadres and every peasant household and adopt every possible means to strengthen wheat field management, do a good job in spring farming, and reap a good harvest of summer grain. Gao Dezhan then visited the farmland in Xiliuzhuang Village of Haohezhuang Township. He asked Wang Ruihai, secretary of the township party committee, and Li Fa, secretary of the village party branch, about rural work. He urged all townships to attach importance to application of science and technology to agricultural development, make agricultural scientific and technical service organizations successful, and serve agricultural production well. When he saw the newly planted poplar trees along the roads, he said happily: Tree planting not only can improve the natural environment and promote agricultural development but also is a way to achieve affluence. We should mobilize the masses to plant trees, green and enliven the land, and make the masses prosper. When inspecting spring plowing in Chenjiaan Village of Shiqiao Township, Gao Dezhan said to rural cadres: You have worked hard at the grass-roots levels. It is hoped that you will do a better job in the mass work and promote agricultural production and rural economy. Please convey my regards to the people. Gao Dezhan also came to the Huanqiu Enterprise Group, Haitai Industrial Co. Ltd., and Meizhong Wood Product Co. Ltd. to inspect their production, management, and construction. After this, Gao Dezhan listened to the work reports of the Baodi County party committee and government and held a discussion. Gao Deshan said: The Baodi County party committee and government have paid close attention to their work, and their work ideas are also very good. It is hoped that they will do a still better job and open up a new situation in rural work. The central authorities have held the rural work conference. We should make earnest efforts to do practical work and rapidly implement the guidelines of the conference to the letter. He emphasized: Districts and counties engaged in agriculture should mobilize the people, seize the opportunity, race against time, and combat drought to ensure wheat field management and spring plowing in the right season. This is a task of prime importance in the current rural work. We should exert great efforts to stabilize the areas sown to grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops and increase their per-unit yields, pay attention to the key links, and adopt comprehensive measures to win a bumper harvest in summer grain. The summer grain output and the whole year's production of this year should not be lower than last year's. To carry out the "vegetable basket" project and develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fisheries, and township enterprises, we should take the road of optimizing the structure and improving efficiency. In short, we should ensure the efficient supplies of farm and sideline products and substantially increase peasants' income. Speaking on how to mobilize people to successfully carry out current agricultural production and rural work, Gao Dezhan pointed out: Rural cadres at all levels should be mobilized first. They should enhance the sense of urgency and responsibility toward spring plowing and wheat field management, strengthen ideological and political work as well as organization work, invest more labor forces and money, and carry out meticulous management to make up for the unfavorable conditions we encountered in winter and ensure the stable increase of summer grain. We should also mobilize the entire society. All relevant departments and cadres at all levels should make spring plowing a success in order to reap a bumper summer grain harvest, go deep into rural areas and grass-roots levels, do practical work, give the green light, and provide good service. All trades and professions in Tianjin should support agriculture, the antidrought work, and spring farming and truly resolve difficulties and problems for the endeavors to combat drought and ensure wheat production and spring plowing. Gao Dezhan emphasized: We should further enhance the understanding of the important position and role of Tianjin's suburban-type agriculture. We should truly understand that agriculture is the foundation for the national economy and for reform, development, and stability. Greater importance should be attached to the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops when developing the suburban-type agriculture. We should also understand that achieving success in the production for the vegetable basket is a task of prime importance in developing Tianjin's suburban-type agriculture. We should develop the high-yielding, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture on the premise that the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops is stabilized. We should coordinate the development of township enterprises and diverse production with the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. The characteristics of Tianjin's suburban-type agriculture should be reflected in the high level of development, high science and technology content, high per-unit yields, and high economic efficiency. Supporting and developing agriculture with industry, we should continuously increase agricultural investment, strive for high efficiency in industry and high output in agriculture, continuously increase peasants' income, and develop the rural economy in all sectors.
