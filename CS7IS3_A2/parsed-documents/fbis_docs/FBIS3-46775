On 5 December, the relevant government official stated: "The Board of Audit and Inspection pointed out in July 1993 that `for no valid reason, the U.S. Government has not paid rent while occupying the embassy building for 13 years.' Thus, the Ministry of Culture and Sports, which manages the Embassy building, sent a notice to the U.S. Embassy requesting payment of rent." The official stated that "such steps by the government is of significance in clearly informing the U.S. side of our position. Since the issue of unpaid rent will be discussed in future between the ROK and the United States, details regarding this were left out of the notice." He added that "based on the principle of resolving the rent issue for the U.S. Embassy building in accordance with diplomatic norms and practices, the government asked the U.S. side for a prompt settlement, and the U.S. side said that it would make efforts for a solution when the new ambassador came into office." According to the relevant government authorities, annual rent for the U.S. Embassy building is estimated at five hundred million won and unpaid rent for the past 13 years amounts is estimated to amount to 6.5 billion won. The U.S. Embassy building was built in 1961 as one of twin buildings (the other building was formerly used by the Supreme Council and now houses the Ministry of Information and Ministry of Culture and Sports) with the ROK providing the land and $1.15 million of the total $3.21 million in construction costs and with the U.S. side providing the remaining $2.02 million. The building stands on 6,625 square meters of land, has one underground floor and eight floors above the ground.
