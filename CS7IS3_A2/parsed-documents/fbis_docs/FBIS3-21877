According to the prosecutor, this automobile painter has on seven different occassions since 1990 brought hashish to Finland via Turku, Naantali, and Helsinki. At first the shipments were 3 kilos in size, but the last shipment was 60 kilos. Charges in the case have already been brought against more than 10 people, including the chief individuals in the so-called Ristiina Gang, among others. The case has been in court now for almost one year. The case has been at a standstill for half a year as the court awaited the extradition of the Finnish man who was arrested in Belgium. The automobile painter was arrested in April of 1993. The automobile painter admitted on Monday that the charges were true in their main parts. The last charge, involving the 60-kilo shipment, is not quite accurate, however, according to him, for, as his own version has it, he merely received the shipment here in Finland. He had no prior knowledge about the size of the shipment he was receiving. Police have been able to seize over 50 kilos of hashish in connection with the case. Some of this was found on the property of one Ristiina businessman, the main defendant in the case, and some was found in a residence in Porvoo.
