FBIS4-11540 "drlat083_a_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Conference Attendees Reportedly Intimidated in Miami Conference Attendees Reportedly Intimidated in Miami FL2804143494 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1155 GMT 28 Apr 94 FL2804143494 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras] [Text] Cuban emigres who have just returned to Miami from Havana after attending the Nation and the Emigre Community conference are now victims of death threats and all types of pressures by the exile industry, who have made the anti-Cuban policy a lucrative business with a quasi-Mafioso structure. In one Florida county, the police had to search the home of one of those people who had received repeated death threats, because of the possibility of criminal activity. Why have these criminal group leaders assumed such an aggressive attitude? Why do they violate U.S. laws and try to revamp them in Miami and use forms of extortion like those used by the Chicago Mafia during the 1930's? The answer is very simple: Repeated myths and lies are being weakened in a large sector of the emigre community, which is not beneficial to the Mafia heads, from the financial standpoint, or to the political tyranny exercised by personalities from the U.S. business and political sector. This cannot be interpreted to mean that the Cuban emigre community in Miami is undergoing a radical change in its political and ideological views. That was clear at the meeting here in Havana. To put it plainly, the sector of Cuban emigration to which I am referring is that group of persons who are the victims of the aggression. It is they who are making another evaluation of the Cuban reality -- their own evaluation, within their own political and ideological views -- and that does not fit well with the totalitarian and strong-arm [matonezca] version of the traffickers in hatred and anti-Cuban sentiments. It is curious, but not coincidental, how in this crusade of deeply rooted antagonism the most vile figures gang up with those who pose as intellectuals in an attempt to dominate other sectors of the emigre community. I mention no names, but everyone knows whom I refer to. I am talking about those who organize anti-Cuban congresses throughout the world, visit governments, travel nonstop, all without revealing who is financing their incessant movement.
