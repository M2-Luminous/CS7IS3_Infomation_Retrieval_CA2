Those socialists who did not get behind the new course set by [Italian Socialist Party, PSI, Secretary] Ottaviano Del Turco met today at Montecitorio (the parliament building) and forged a national political executive made up of Socialist MPs and regional officials, deputy Franco Piro reported in a communique released here this evening. Not only had thousands of Socialists backed the new grouping but even those organized structures which "do not intend to sacrifice the identity, dignity and prospects of socialists" for those who have always bucked reforms, the communique continued. The symbol of new grouping will bear the words "The Socialists" and the first party congress will be held in May. The birth of the Federation of Italian Socialists is not in conflict with the initiative which led last week to the formation of the Federation of Democratic and Liberal Socialists which, together with the Liberals and the Social Democrats, forms a larger grouping with which the new party would continue to work. The FSI national leadership includes socialists who did not follow in Del Turco's train, such as Ugo Intini, Maurizio Sacconi, Stefano Caldoro, Maria Magnani Noya, Franco Piro (house caucus leader) and vice-presidents Damiano Poti' and Angelo Sollazzo.
