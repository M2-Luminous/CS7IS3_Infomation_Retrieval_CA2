"They wanted to know what the interview was about and why I was being interviewed. It was nothing," Wang told KYODO NEWS SERVICE by phone. According to Lucky Severson of U.S. National Broadcasting Corp. (NBC), the five-man crew has been at Wang's residence for about an hour before police arrived and took them all away. "We were essentially finished with the interview and were just getting shots of the residence when they came," he said. The passports, residence permits and videotapes of the crew were all taken by police and have not yet been returned, he said. "Wang Dan talked about the status of human rights in China and MFN (most-favored-nation trading status)," Severson said, saying he felt Wang did not say anything that would bring him trouble. U.S. President Bill Clinton must decide by June 3 if China has made enough progress in human rights areas to warrant the renewal of MFN. Billions of dollars in bilateral trade are at stake. Severson said Wang, who was interrogated separately from the NBC crew, was "cautious" during the interview. He said none of his crew, composed of several nationalities, was threatened or beaten by police.
