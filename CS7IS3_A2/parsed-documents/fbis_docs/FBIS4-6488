The Cuban people's victory in the Playa Giron battle showed that any formidable imperialist enemy can never bring to their knees the people who have risen as one, rallied close around their leader, convinced of the justness of their cause, stresses MINJU CHOSON. Recalling that after the battle the fraternal Cuban people have defended the gains of revolution and stepped up socialist construction, valiantly smashing the never-ceasing aggression and intervention, subversive activities and sabotages of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges, the paper says: The Cuban people under the correct guidance of the Communist Party of Cuba headed by Comrade Fidel Castro are notching up success in different sectors of the national economy including industry, agriculture, education and health service, and working hard to stabilize and improve the people's living. They are striving to get the U.S. troops withdrawn from Guantanamo and to preserve peace in Central America and Caribbean region. The Korean people rejoice as over their own over the achievements gained by the fraternal Cuban people in their struggle for the defence of the country, revolution and socialism and for the independent development and prosperity of the country and extend militant solidarity to them in their righteous struggle. They are happy to have such courageous and honest friends as the Cuban people in Latin America. They wish the Cuban people greater success in their efforts to build socialism, believing that the traditional relations of friendship and cooperation between the two peoples will grow stronger and develop in conformity with the aspirations and desire of the Korean and Cuban peoples. NODONG SINMUN in a signed article says that the Cuban people are now pressing forward the revolution and construction with redoubled efforts under the difficult conditions of the "special period of peace time". It stresses that no one can stop the Cuban people from advancing in an indomitable revolutionary spirit.
