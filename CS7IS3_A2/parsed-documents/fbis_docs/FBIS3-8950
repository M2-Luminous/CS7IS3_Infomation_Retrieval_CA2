When asked whether he had a clear concept of the make-up of a new cabinet, Moravcik answered by saying that negotiations between individual parliamentary opposition parties were continuing. "Maybe on Tuesday [a5 March], maybe on Wednesday we shall know the definitive results of these talks and will be able to specify about the composition of the government," he said. Moravcik was put forward as new Slovak premier by the former opposition parties earlier this evening. He added he would like to present President Michal Kovac with a list of cabinet members to appoint on Wednesday so that parliament, which resumes its session on that day, could approve the choices. "A quick approach like that would be desirable," he said in view of the decision of the Meciar government to cease its functions as of Friday. Moravcik said he would submit details of his programme to parliament at the subsequent session. He asserted that the new government would concentrate particularly on the economic field. As regards the post of foreign minister, which Moravcik himself once held, he said he would prefer to see an experienced diplomat in the post. He had a definite candidate in mind, but denied it was Jan Lisuch, saying, "he already has been charged with a position abroad." Moravcik, who recently quit the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) after a fruitless attempt to alter the populist course fixed by party chairman and ex-premier Vladimir Meciar, confirmed talks were still continuing between all the "dissident" groups of the parties that formerly made up Slovakia's governing coalition -- the HZDS and the Slovak National Party (SNS) -- on the creation of some joint formation. "It will be a new political grouping, comprising three or four groups," he said. The party should be established this month and should include, besides the former Alternative of Political Realism within the HZDS (led by Moravcik and former Vice-Premier Roman Kovac), also a group headed by former SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak and the Alliance of Democrats, led by another one-time Slovak foreign minister, Milan Knazko. Chairman of what was the strongest opposition party, the Democratic Left Party (SDL), Peter Weiss, stressed that the government to be formed would be "composed for a temporary period" until early general elections are held, in his view in September or October. If parliament does not alter the law shortening the electoral term, a referendum will decide on early elections, he said. "All political parties have told President Kovac it will be a six-month government," he said. Weiss commented on the nomination of Moravcik as new premier by saying the proposal received widespread support, also from the SDL.
