FR940725-2-00050 FR940725-2-00035 In its administration of the MCH Services Block Grant, the MCHB places special emphasis on improving service delivery to women and children from culturally identifiable populations who have been disproportionately affected by barriers to care. This means that FY 1994 MCH CISS/HVAF projects are expected to involve members of ethno-culturally distinct groups in planning activities, unless there are compelling programmatic or other justifications for not doing so. Projects funded under the MCH CISS Set-Aside Program are selected and administered under the same procedures and practices as are currently in effect for the MCH Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) set-aside activities. The regulation implementing the MCH SPRANS Set-Aside Program was published in the March 5, 1986, issue of the Federal Register at 51 FR 7726 (42 CFR Part 51a). Availability of Funds $2.5 million is available under the MCH CISS Set-Aside Program to support approximately 50 HVAF projects, not exceeding $50,000 per award for a one year budget period. Awards will be made for project periods of one year. Applicants are advised that support for implementation of planning components developed under this program will not be available through the MCH CISS Set-Aside Program after FY 1994. Eligible Applicants Eligibility for funding is limited to a single application from each State. State Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and Child Welfare (CW) agencies must either act as co-applicants or collaborate in the identification of the applicant. Each CISS/HVAF grant award in FY 1994 is contingent upon a funded Family Preservation and Support Services program. Well defined roles for the State MCH and Title IV&hyph;B agencies are essential to ensure maximum collaboration and coordination across the MCH&hyph;CW service systems. Projects must promote community/State partnerships. Project Review and Funding The Department will review applications as competing applications and will fund those which, in the Department's view, are consistent with the statutory purpose of the CISS set aside program; focus on coordination and collaboration across the MCH&hyph;CW service systems; pay particular attention to involvement of women and persons from culturally distinct populations; and, address the achievement of applicable Healthy People 2000 objectives in communities with demonstrated need. Final funding decisions for CISS/HVAF grants are the responsibility of the Director, MCHB, and will be carried out in consultation with the Commissioner, ACYF.
