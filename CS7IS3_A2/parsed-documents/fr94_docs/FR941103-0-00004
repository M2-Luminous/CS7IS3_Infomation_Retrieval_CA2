FR941103-0-00004 FR941103-0-00001 An interim final rule was published in the Federal Register on September 1, 1994 (59 FR 45188). That interim final rule added ยง955.207 to authorize expenses and establish an assessment rate for the Committee. That rule provided that interested persons could file comments through October 3, 1994. No comments were received. While this rule will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period began on September 16, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal period apply to all assessable onions handled during the fiscal period. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the Federal Register as an interim final rule. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 955 Marketing agreements, Onions, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 955 is amended as follows: PART 955_VIDALIA ONIONS GROWN IN GEORGIA Accordingly, the interim final rule amending 7 CFR part 955 which was published at 59 FR 45188 on September 1, 1994, is adopted as a final rule without change. Dated: October 28, 1994. Eric M. Forman, Deputy Director, Fruit and Vegetable Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27232; Filed 11&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P
