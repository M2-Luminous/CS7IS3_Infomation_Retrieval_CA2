Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said that as the country's stock market matures the role of public companies in the development of the securities industry gains importance. He said the companies, which are pioneers in China's shareholding reform and the establishment of a modern corporate system, must strictly obey regulations because their every action can arouse great attention from the public. "Standardized operation of the listed companies is the foundation for a stable and healthy development of the stock market," he said. Liu said that if a stock market pays little attention to companies' illegal practices, serious speculation will appear and endanger the stability of the market. "To a certain degree, the quality of the public companies is of vital importance to the future of China's stock market and to the confidence of shareholders," he said. Meanwhile, Liu pointed out that standardizing the operations of public companies is also a prerequisite for access to the international securities markets. With more international financial institutions shifting attention to China, there are more opportunities for Chinese enterprises to enter the international securities markets. But this also requires companies to improve their performance and bring their operations in line with international practices, he said. In addition, Liu said standardized operations also represent a basic way for listed companies to establish a good image among shareholders, raise their credibility and improve market competitiveness. He said that although listed companies have done much already, many problems persist, such as: -- Rights and responsibilities among companies' shareholders, directors and senior managers are not defined clearly; -- Some companies blindly expand their shares and capital to mask poor management; -- Some companies, unaware of disclosure requirements, don't release information properly; -- Some even make major decisions without authorization.
