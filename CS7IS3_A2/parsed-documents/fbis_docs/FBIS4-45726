But a £5,000 damages claim launched by SAS [Surfers Against Sewage] against Southern Water is expected to provide a test case which could decide whether British companies must expect to face pollution bills running into many billions of pounds. Surfer James Andrews claims he caught Hepatitis A from the sea 700 metres offshore from Eastbourne after contamination from sewage emissions from Southern Water. The water company says there are no recorded instances of the disease being contracted from sea water and argues there is no evidence in the United Kingdom to link Hepatitis A with bathing or surfing. The importance of the case lies in its implications for the liabilities that industrial companies and insurers face over pollution dating back many years. Southern Water believes that at least 60 other potential cases hang on the result of the SAS claim. Pollution has become a nightmare for many companies in chemical, oil and extractive industries and a big threat to the worldwide insurance industry. After lobbying by Stephen Merrett, Lloyd's of London's former deputy chairman, a Bill is before the United States Congress designed to alleviate the crisis, but potential liabilities are still huge. Water contamination is the latest in a flood of pollution claims that are scaring companies and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. United States insurance ratings agency A M Best says potential U.S. environmental and asbestosis claims--many insured or reinsured by British companies or Lloyd's syndicates--could top £1,300 billion. Best says that already identifiable claims could top £88 billion over the next 25 years. That is nearly three-quarters of the insurance industry's capital. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified 36,000 hazardous waste sites in need of a clean-up, at an average cost of £20 million per site. The Confederation of British Industry has put the cost of cleaning up contaminated British sites at £20 billion. The American situation is bedevilled by the legal concept of "no-fault" liability: the principle that the polluter--or the polluter's insurer--must pay, whether or not the pollution could have been foreseen. Recent British court judgments, notably in a case between Cambridge Water and Eastern Counties Leather, have upheld the principle of forseeability, but that is scant comfort to insurers providing cover worldwide. The latest twist is a spate of lawsuits against garages with leaking underground storage tanks which have contaminated water supplies. "One site in three in Britain has some degree of contamination," says Dave Stewart, a Shell spokesman. BP [British Petroleum] says it will cost "several billions" to put things right. The oil majors are now fitting polyethylene and fibreglass pipes, instead of metal ones, and using continuous tubing to reduce leaks. But most garages are run by independent operators so the process of upgrading and installing adequate leakage checks will take time. There have been only a few insurance settlements for leaks but the claims momentum is picking up. Sun Alliance says another uncertainty in Europe is a European Commission pollution directive expected this year. Pessimists fear companies could be made liable for long-term seepage and other contamination which arguably could not have been foreseen. Insurers have taken fright. They may be saddled with historic claims under old, liberally-worded policies written years before pollution became a political issue, but they are writing more restrictive policies now. Lloyd's underwriter Richard Keeling says industrial companies have often been less than frank with insurers about known, but not admitted, pollution. He says: "When the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] visited one polluter whose works were next to a lake, they asked a local why there was a boat out on it. `Every time you come', he replied, `they have to send it out to collect the dead ducks'." Sun Alliance says: "From now on, we will insure the future, but not the past." Insurers will no longer offer retrospective liability cover and they are taking a tougher line with clients suspected of ignoring obligations under today's environmental laws. "We will write sudden and accidental pollution risks but not long-term seepage," says one group. "Insurers are devising new--and costlier--products for clients to cope with today's problems, but gradual contamination is virtually uninsurable at present." Amid the gloom, there are signs that Stephen Merrett's call for changes in the U.S. market is being heard. A Bill backed by the Administration aims to impose a 0.2 per cent levy on casualty premiums to finance a "Superfund" to meet environmental claims. Polluting companies would take their insurance policies to the fund and it would make a non-negotiable offer. If the polluter does not like it, he would have to bear the entire cost himself. Hank Greenberg, chairman of U.S. insurer AIG [expansion not given], has been demanding a levy for years. But he is understood to feel that the present Bill does not cast its net wide enough. "Morally, we should not be paying for much of this," says Keeling, who feels the Bill is a sign of an overdue sea change. "Polluters, insurers, Greens and politicians have at last decided that the present situation only benefits the lawyers." He hopes that this time it will not be the lawyers who have the last laugh.
