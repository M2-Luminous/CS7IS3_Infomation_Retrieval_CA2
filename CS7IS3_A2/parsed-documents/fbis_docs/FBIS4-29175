Concerning this measure, a government source stated on the evening of 15 June: "According to the Finance Ministry, it will be difficult to take this measures without a UN resolution. In saying it is difficult, the ministry means such a measure cannot be taken." It is speculated that in the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law that restrictions can be imposed on payment "for the purpose of faithfully fulfilling international treaties that our country has concluded or other international commitments." According to the same source, the judgment seems to indicate that a UN resolution can be taken as an "international commitment" but this regulation cannot be applied to "multilateral-type" sanctions.
