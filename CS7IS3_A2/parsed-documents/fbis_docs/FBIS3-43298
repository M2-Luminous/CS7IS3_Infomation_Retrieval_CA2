Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing; MK] Chief of Staff Siphiwe Nyanda says March must be the target date for the establishment of a multiparty force. John Matham has the details: The establishment of a national peace keeping force will be discussed at the first meeting of the Law and Order Sub-Council of the Transitional Executive Council. There is some skepticism that the force could be set up and properly trained prior to April. A government source has told the BUSINESS DAY newspaper that the idea of creating a force is, in his words, dead in the water for political and logistical reasons. The government is concerned about the wisdom of deploying a poorly trained force in tense areas. But Nyanda insists that the force will replace the SAP [South African Police], especially the Internal Stability Unit, in dealing with political violence. Nyanda says the force will consist of about 10,000 men who will be selected from recruits who gather at assembly points.
