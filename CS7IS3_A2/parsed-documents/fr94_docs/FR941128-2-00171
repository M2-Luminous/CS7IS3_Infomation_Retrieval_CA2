FR941128-2-00171 FR941128-2-00088 C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others No written comments were either solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The NYSE has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act 5 in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed change does not raise any significant regulatory issues that were not addressed in the Commission's approval orders regarding ELDS. 6 The Commission finds that the proposal to add an additional market capitalization and trading volume requirement for eligible linked securities will expand the number of securities that can be linked to an ELDS while maintaining the requirement that the linked security be an actively traded common stock or sponsored ADR issued by a highly capitalized issuer. While the proposal introduces a third alternative for ELDS eligibility that reduces the minimum market capitalization requirement for the linked security, the stock of such an issuer (or sponsored ADR related thereto) could only be linked to an ELDS issue if its trading volume in the U.S. for the prior one-year period is at least 80 million shares, which is four times higher than the current minimum trading volume requirement. 7 The Commission believes that together, the new capitalization and trading volume requirements will continue to ensure that ELDS are only issued on highly liquid securities of broadly capitalized companies and that these requirements will reduce the likelihood of any adverse market impact on the securities underlying ELDS. 5 15 U.S.C. ยง78f(b)(5) (1982). 6 See supra note 1. 7 See supra note 2. Additionally, allowing the NYSE, subject to the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, to approve an issue of ELDS that either does not satisfy one of the existing requirements regarding market capitalization and trading volume merely adds flexibility to the proposed rule change. The Commission believes that this portion of the proposal does not raise any regulatory concerns, particularly given the requirement of obtaining the concurrence of the staff of the Commission prior to listing. 8 8 If the NYSE proposed an ELDS that raised unique or significant regulatory concerns, the staff of the Commission would require the NYSE to submit a rule filing to the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. Depending on the proposed facts, the Commission may require the NYSE to submit a rule filing to the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act to address the regulatory issues raised by any proposed offering of ELDS that does not satisfy the market capitalization and/or trading volume set forth in Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual, as amended herein. In this connection, the Commission notes that any proposal to list an ELDS linked to a security with a market capitalization of less than $500 million would raise significant regulatory concerns for which a Section 19(b) rule filing would be required. Moreover, as stated above, amending the language of Paragraph 703.21 to state that the concurrence of the staff of the Commission is required prior to listing an ELDS linked to greater than the maximum specified percentages of the outstanding shares of the linked security merely clarifies the intent of the language currently contained in Paragraph 703.21. 9 Accordingly, this portion of the proposal raises no new regulatory concerns. 9 See supra note 4. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice thereof in the Federal Register in order to allow the Exchange to begin listing ELDS satisfying the revised listing standards described herein without delay. For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the proposal does not raise any significant regulatory issues. Additionally, the changes proposed herein are substantively the same as amendments recently approved by the Commission for the listing of equity linked debt by the American Stock Exchange, Inc., 10 the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., 11 and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc, 12 for which no comments have been received by the Commission. 10 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34765 (September 30, 1994), 59 FR 51220 (October 7, 1994). 11 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34758 (September 30, 1994), 59 FR 50943 (October 6, 1994). 12 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34759 (September 30, 1994), 59 FR 50939 (October 6, 1994). For the above reasons, the Commission believes it is consistent with Section 19(b)(2) 13 of the Act to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. 13 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(2) (1988). IV.
