"The Fleet must be single, powerful, and battleworthy. It is in the common interests of Russia and Ukraine -- two great brotherly Slavic nations -- to secure the southern sea frontiers," Rear Admiral Aleksandr Penkin remarked and added that the Black Sea Navy Command was always prepared for constructive dialogue and smooth civilized ties with its Ukrainian counterpart. If Ukraine takes over more than 160 ships through navy division, there will not be anyone to serve aboard the vessels since "the overwhelming majority of commissioned and noncommissioned officers in the Black Sea Navy are unwilling to join the Ukrainian Armed Forces." Penkin suggested that there would also be problems for the Russian crews if the seamen who have sworn allegiance to Ukraine leave. He said that at the moment the navy is made up of an equal number of Ukrainians and Russians -- about 15,000 men on each side. Penkin runs for the office of Chairman of Sevastopol's City Council from the Black Sea Fleet and the Sevastopol-Russia electoral bloc. Local and presidential elections in Ukraine will take place on June 26.
