The Federal Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik has had to fly to Khabarovsk in order to try and solve the most pressing problems "on site". According to specialists, all enterprises in this vast region are likely to stop unless emergency measures are taken promptly. The cities will have to live without electricity for ten hours every day, and the local thermal power stations will use up all the electricity to keep going. The Russian Maritime Territory needs about 47,000 tonnes of coal every day to keep its electricity-generating plants going. At present, the daily supplies have dwindled to 23-25 thousand tonnes, and the emergency reserves are vanishing. This is why electricity supplies have to be cut off in the evenings and the major cities, including Vladivostok, Nakhodka, Ussuriisk and others are plunged in the shadows one after another in the evenings. In many houses and departments the average temperature never rises about 6-7 degrees centigrade. The energy crisis is largely due to the epidemic of non-payment, although the federal government adopted a resolution on October 8, 1993 to bring about "emergency measures of support of the Maritime Territory". The federal budget owes more than 30 billion roubles to the coal producers. The coalminers in the territory are owed 19 billion roubles in wages. Last year the Primorugol Association was unable to purchase a single mechanised set of machinery. The machinery and equipment now used by the miners are wornout and even at full capacity produce a million tonnes of coal less than planned. The federal government delivered 35 billion roubles to the territory but the money was fully spent to pay for earlier supplies.
