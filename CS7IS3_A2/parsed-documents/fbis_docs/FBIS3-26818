According to statistics from the provincial Border Trade Bureau, last year Yunnan registered a total of 2.873 billion yuan in imports and exports through border trade, an increase of 26.55 percent over the previous year. Last year border trade departments focused their work on adjusting the product mix. The imports and exports of bulk commodities through border trade developed well. Of commodities imported through border trade, 28 categories each exceeded 1 million yuan, while 16 categories of exported commodities each exceeded 10 million yuan, including cigarettes, electrical machinery, building materials, and textile products. The quality of commodities imported and exported through border trade improved as a result of cooperation between the relevant management and supervisory departments on both sides. In addition, eight border prefectures have scored marked achievements in carrying out economic and technological cooperation with Burma, Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand. By the end of 1993 they had signed 46 contracts, worth a total of more than $100 million. So far contracts worth almost $50 million have been completed, 50 percent of the total amount of the province's economic and technological cooperation with foreign countries.
