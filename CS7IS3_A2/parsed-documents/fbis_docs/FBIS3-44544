The country had previously imposed tariffs ranging from 1.8 to 2.2 times the actual car price on imports to protect its fledgling car manufacturing industry. However, a senior official from the China Trade Centre for Automobile Imports said this will not effect imports to a great extent, as the devaluation of the renminbi will increase the prices of imports on the domestic market. The trading centre, established last year, is expected to play a more important role in overseeing the country's car imports. The official predicted that in fact fewer foreign-built cars and vans will enter China's mainland this year than in 1993. Estimates from Chinese automobile trading firms show that about 400,000 foreign-made cars and vans entered the mainland market in 1993. The vehicles, in various brands, were brought in by Chinese Government purchasing groups, trading firms, and smugglers. The imported cars and vans, an all-time high for the country, squeezed domestically-made vehicle sales on the home market. The official predicted such a big inflow will not take place this year despite the drop in tariffs. The official said the government took measures to block routes used by smugglers last year--and will beef up those measures this year. The number of cars and vans smuggled into China in 1993 was estimated at 100,000, compared with 90,000 in 1992. The central government is now reconsidering its policy that allows overseas-funded firms to buy duty free foreign-made cars and vans. To date, the government has approved more than 150,000 foreign invested projects. Some overseas-funded enterprises bought duty-free cars so they could profiteer by selling them to China's car-hungry consumers. As a result of the inflow of foreign made vehicles sales of domestic cars decreased month by month and some plants had to reduce production in face of rising stockpiles. Besides automobile manufacturing, producers of other vehicles also were hit by a market recession that started in July. The recession was also attributed to the government's tight credit policy and a nationwide anticorruption drive. The credit policy has weakened the purchasing power of enterprises and the anticorruption drive reduced institutional car buying. In China, where per capita gross national product stands at some $400, automobiles are regarded as luxury consumer items. Car stockpiles, although showing a downward curve after October, remained higher than in the first half of 1993. Exact figures are unavailable. Reports say State targets for car production for 1993 was probably unfulfilled.
