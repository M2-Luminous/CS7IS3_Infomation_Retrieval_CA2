The inspection deadline is early May as indicated in last month's U.N. Security Council presidential statement, Kim Sam-hun, South Korea's ambassador on North Korean nuclear affairs, said after meeting his U.S. counterpart Robert Gallucci in high-level consultations here. The two sides also reaffirmed the principle that inter-Korean dialogue is indispensable to fully clearing up the nuclear problem. "The most immediate issue is getting North Korea to accept additional inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," Kim told reporters after nearly three hours of talks. The next Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks will be the final opportunity to resolve the nuclear dispute, the ambassador said. "The South Korean and U.S. Governments are ready to discuss North Korea's interests and demands in the political, security and economic fields related to improving relations once the nuclear obstacle is out of the way." Kim suggested adjustments in the North Korean-U.S. "small package deal" that included suspension of this year's "Team Spirit" military exercise that Seoul and Washington stage annually. South Korea and the United States announced earlier the maneuvers would be cancelled this year on condition that North Korea allowed full nuclear checks. "We can't say that the entire agreement is void, but adjustments are inevitable," said Kim. Gallucci, assistant secretary of State who was appointed chairman of the newly established U.S. senior policy steering group on Korea, flew into Seoul on Sunday. The consultations came immediately after Seoul announced last week that it would no longer demand inter-Korean dialogue as a precondition for the third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks. Kim was at pains to emphasize that Seoul has not given up on inter-Korean channels. "The two countries confirmed the principle that the issues of the Korean peninsula, including the nuclear situation, have to be solved through inter-Korean dialogue," said Kim. "We agreed that while South-North Korean and North Korean-U.S. talks should be harmonized, the two channels must be managed as complementary," he said. But future South-North dialogue "will have to carry substance and be meaningful," he said. "The dialogue will be aimed specifically at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula." The timing and format of the dialogue are under negotiation between Seoul and Washington, he said, citing the inter-Korean Joint Nuclear Control Commission and prime ministers' talks as possible examples. The ambassador denied speculation that Washington may hold the next high-level meeting with Pyongyang just on North Korea's promise to permit further IAEA inspections. "There must be full and complete additional inspections by the IAEA," he said. Kim referred to the March 31 statement by the Security Council president which asked the IAEA to report back to the council on North Korea's nuclear program in a few weeks, which is tacitly understood as early May. "You can assume that the period mentioned in the statement is, in actuality, the deadline," he said.
