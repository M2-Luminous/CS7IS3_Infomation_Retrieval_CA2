We are more confident than any time before of China's future. Li Peng said when analyzing the reasons for the world's new understanding of China in 1993: The fundamental reason was that China's reform, opening, and economic construction made great development under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. He said: Just a number of years ago, when seeing the drastic changes in Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, some people in the world alleged that "China would also collapse." Facts showed that China did not collapse; instead, it developed and grew stronger. At present, many economists and commentators in the world and even some politicians have made more optimistic predictions and forecasts on China's economic strength and developmental vista than we did. Although such predictions and forecasts may not be in keeping with the facts, in any case they reflect from another angle the world's acknowledgement of China's achievements. Li Peng pointed out: At present, Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics not only has taken shape completely, but also has shown its strong effectiveness in practice. At the same time, the third generation leading collective, with Jiang Zemin as the core, has taken shape and has been maturing gradually. Thus, our modernization drive not only has theoretical grounds, but also has organizational guarantees. Today we are more confident of China's future than at any previous time. He pointed out, however, that in the world, some people who harbor malicious intentions are still spreading the allegation about the "China threat" in an attempt to sow discord between China and its neighboring countries and to undermining China's favorable surrounding environment. It was a U-turn from the allegation about China's "collapse" to the allegation about the China "threat," and such arguments were indeed perplexing. The two extreme ideas reflected some people's ignorance about China's real situation. A developed and strong China will never pose a threat to any other country, but will only make greater contributions to world peace and development. As for how to approach some different opinions between the central and local authorities, or between different localities, and how to approach unevenness in economic development, Li Peng said: China is a unified country, and the socialist market economy we are striving to build is also a unified market. He said: Of course, it is hard to avoid different opinions on various issues between the central and local authorities, and there certainly is unevenness in economic development between different localities. The gap between China's east and west is widening, but the western region itself has developed, and the living standards of the people there also have been continuously raised. In the world, uneven development is also a common phenomenon, and there is no exception in various countries. In addition, the party and government have fully noticed the gap between the east and the west of the country, and are taking measures to solve this problem. Li Peng said: If some people are worried, out of their good will, about the development unevenness in various parts of China and the contradictions caused by some reform measures or by some local interests, then their concern is understandable. However, if some people, out of their ill intentions, hope and even assert that the development unevenness between the east and the west of the country will lead to China's division, and if they want to see trouble occur in China, then their hope certainly will fall through.
