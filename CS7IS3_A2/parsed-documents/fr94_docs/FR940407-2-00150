FR940407-2-00150 FR940407-2-00081 D. Purpose The purpose of this program is to demonstrate and evaluate ways of creating new employment and business opportunities for certain low-income individuals through the provision of technical and financial assistance to private employers in the community, self-employment/micro-enterprise programs and/or new business development programs. A low-income individual eligible to participate in a project conducted under this program is any individual eligible to receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) under Part A of Title IV of the Social Security Act and any other individual whose income level does not exceed 100 percent of the official poverty line. (See Attachment A.) Within these categories, emphasis should be on individuals who are unemployed, those residing in public housing, and those who are homeless. Part II_Program Priority Areas A. General Projects 1.0 The Congressional Conference Report on the FY 1992 appropriations for the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and related agencies directs the ACF to require economic development strategies as part of the application process to ensure that highly qualified organizations participate in the demonstration. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 282, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 39 (1991). These strategies should include descriptions of how projects financed and jobs created under this program will be integrated into a larger effort to promote job and business opportunities for eligible program participants. Proposed projects should demonstrate how their program will impact the overall community/communities served by the applicant. OCS will only fund projects that create new jobs and/or business opportunities for eligible program participants. Projects funded under this program must demonstrate how the proposed project will enhance the participants' ability and skills in their progress toward self-sufficiency. Therefore, proposed projects must show promise toward progress of achieving self-sufficiency among the target population. OCS expects that the jobs and/or business/self employment opportunities to be created under this program will contribute to the goal of self-sufficiency. The employment opportunities should provide hourly wages that exceed the minimum wage and also provide benefits such as health insurance, transportation, child care, career development opportunities, etc. Applicants must show that the proposed project will create a significant number of new full-time permanent jobs through the expansion of a pre-identified business or new business development and by providing opportunities for self-employment to eligible participants. While projected employment in future years may be included in the application, it is essential that the focus of employment opportunities concentrate on new full-time, permanent jobs to be created during the duration of the grant project period and/or on the creation of new business development opportunities for low-income individuals. In creating self-employment business opportunities for eligible participants, the applicant must detail how it will provide training and support services to potential entrepreneurs. The assistance to be provided to potential entrepreneurs must include, at a minimum, technical assistance in basic business planning and management concepts, and assistance in preparing a business plan (see Part IV, Criterion III for requirements) and loan application. Any funds that are used for training purposes must be limited to providing specific job-related training to eligible participants who have been selected for employment (expansion of an existing business or new business development) and/or self-employment business opportunities. In the review process, favorable consideration will be given to applicants with a demonstrated record of achievement in promoting job and enterprise opportunities for low-income people. Favorable consideration also will be given to those applicants who show the lowest cost-per-job created for low-income individuals. For this program, OCS views $15,000 as the maximum amount for the creation of a job and, unless there are extenuating circumstances, will not fund projects where the cost-per-job in OCS funds exceeds this amount. Only those jobs created and filled by low-income people will be counted in the cost-per-job formula. (See Part IV, Criterion IV) Technical assistance should be specifically addressed to the needs of the private employer in creating new jobs to be filled by eligible individuals and/or to the individuals themselves such as skills training, job preparation, self-esteem building, etc. Financial assistance may be provided to the private employer as well as the individual. If the technical and/or financial assistance is to be provided to pre-identified businesses that will be expanded or franchised, written comments from the businesses must be included with the application.
