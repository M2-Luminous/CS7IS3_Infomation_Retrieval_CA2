Our correspondent in Washington Arye Golan reports that the delegation heads will meet again in approximately two weeks. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will then leave for a tour of the Middle East. In the talks between the Palestinian and Israeli delegations, it was agreed that the parties would discuss the establishment of the Palestinian council, decide on the modalities of the elections in the territories, and modify laws in the territories prior to the inception of Palestinian self-government. However, any practical discussion of these issues would only start after an agreement on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First proposal has been signed. U.S. sources assessed that due to the delay in the negotiations on the implementation of the Declaration of Principles, the elections for the autonomy council would be postponed and would not be held this summer. Some progress on environmental issues was reported in the talks between the Jordanian and Israeli delegations.
