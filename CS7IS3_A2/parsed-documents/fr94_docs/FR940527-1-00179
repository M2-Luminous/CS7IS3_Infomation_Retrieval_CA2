FR940527-1-00179 FR940527-1-00014 •Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, section 1886(d)(5)(F)(vii)(I)(d) of the Act requires an increase in the DSH payment adjustment to urban hospitals with 100 or more beds and for rural hospitals with 500 or more beds, that have a DSH patient percentage greater than 20.2. •The special payment protection for MDHs is not applicable after FY 1994. (Section 1886(d)(5)(G)(i) of the Act as amended by section 13501(e) of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66). Finally, when comparing our estimated FY 1994 payments to FY 1995 payments, another significant consideration is that we currently estimate that outlier payments during FY 1994 will be 4.0 percent of total DRG payments. When the FY 1994 final rules were published September 1, 1993 (58 FR 46270), we estimated FY 1994 outlier payments would be 5.1 percent of total DRG payments. The effects of the lower than expected outlier payments during FY 1994 are reflected in the analyses below comparing our current estimates of FY 1994 total payments to estimated FY 1995 payments. Finally, we also compare the changes in payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995. In this comparison, our FY 1994 baseline reflects payment policies during the current year. The FY 1995 simulation similarly reflects the combination of the statutory and proposed changes to go into effect during FY 1995. Table I demonstrates the results of our analysis. The table categorizes hospitals by various geographic and special payment consideration groups to illustrate the varying impacts on different types of hospitals. The top row of the table shows the overall impact on the 5,248 hospitals included in the analysis. This is 54 fewer hospitals than were included in the impact analysis in the FY 1994 final rule (58 FR 46270). (Data for 80 hospitals that were included in last year's analysis were not available for analysis this year; however, data were available this year for 26 hospitals for which data were not available last year.) The next four rows of Table I contain hospitals categorized according to their geographic location (all urbans as well as large urban and other urban or rural). There are 2,947 hospitals located in urban areas (MSAs) included in our analysis. Among these, there are 1,616 hospitals located in large urban areas (populations over 1 million), and 1,331 hospitals in other urban areas (populations of 1 million or fewer). In addition, there are 2,301 hospitals in rural areas. The next two groupings are by bed size categories, shown separately for urban and rural hospitals. The final groupings by geographic location are by census divisions, also shown separately for urban and rural hospitals. The second part of Table I shows changes in payments based on hospitals' FY 1995 payment classifications, including any reclassifications under sections 1886(d)(10) of the Act. For example, the rows labeled urban, large urban, other urban, and rural, show the numbers of hospitals being paid based on these categorizations, after consideration of geographic reclassifications, are 3,252, 1,830, 1,422, and 1,996, respectively. The next three groupings examine the impacts of the proposed changes on hospitals grouped by whether or not they have residency programs (teaching hospitals that receive an indirect medical education (IME) adjustment), receive DSH payments, or some combination of these two adjustments. There are 4,197 nonteaching hospitals in our analysis, 829 with fewer than 100 residents, and 222 with 100 or more residents. In the DSH categories, hospitals are grouped according to their DSH payment status based on how they will be paid during FY 1995. That is, hospitals located in rural counties that have been reclassified as urban by the MGCRB for purposes of assigning the standardized amount are categorized here as urban, since they are considered urban in determining the amount of their DSH adjustment. The rural DSH hospitals, therefore, including those in the rural referral center and sole community hospital categories, represent hospitals that were not reclassified for purposes of the standardized amount. The next category groups hospitals paid on the basis of the urban standardized amount in terms of whether they receive the IME adjustment, the DSH adjustment, both, or neither. The next six rows examine the impacts of the proposed changes on rural hospitals by special payment groups (sole community hospitals, rural referral centers, and MDHs). Rural hospitals reclassified for FY 1995 for purposes of the standardized amount are not included here with the exception of the MDH row. This row includes all hospitals that were paid under the MDH provision during FY 1994 in order to isolate the impact of ending this provision. Of the 415 hospitals shown in this row, 3 are located in a county now designated as urban under the 1993 MSA definitions, and 39 others have been reclassified for either the standardized amount, the wage index, or both. The rural referral centers (138), sole community hospitals (578), and rural referral center/sole community hospitals (54) shown here were not reclassified for purposes of the standardized amount. There are 19 rural referral centers and 27 sole community hospitals that would be reclassified for the standardized amount in FY 1995 and are therefore not included in these columns. In addition, one hospital that is both a rural referral center and a sole community hospital will be reclassified for the standardized amount. The next two groupings are based on type of ownership and the hospital's Medicare utilization expressed as a percent of total patient days. These data are taken from the Medicare cost report files, the latest available being FY 1992. Data needed to calculate Medicare utilization percentages were unavailable for 66 hospitals. For the most part, these are either new hospitals or hospitals filing manual cost reports that are not yet entered into the data base. The next series of groupings concern the geographic reclassification status of hospitals. The first three rows display hospitals that were reclassified by the MGCRB for either FY 1994 or FY 1995, or for both years. One effect of eliminating the separate rural standardized amount in FY 1995 is to reduce the number of standardized amount reclassifications. The next rows illustrate the overall number of reclassifications, as well as the numbers of reclassified hospitals grouped by urban and rural location. The final row in Table I contains hospitals located in rural counties but deemed to be urban under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act.
