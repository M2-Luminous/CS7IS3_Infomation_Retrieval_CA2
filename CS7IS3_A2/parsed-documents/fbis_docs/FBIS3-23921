In accordance with the Decree of the Russian Government "On the Territorial Organs of Hard Currency and Export Control," territorial organs of the Russian Federal Service for Hard-Currency and Export Control are being established in a number of oblast centers of Russia, including Moscow and St. Petersburg. The Russian Federal Service for Hard Currency and Export Control was established in June of last year by special governmental decree. In accordance with the Government's decision, the service was granted broad authority, enabling it to obtain information on the movement of hard currency in exporter accounts. In the absence of a federal network of subordinate structures, however, its attention was concentrated mainly on the large-scale producers of export production that have customs and hard currency privileges and on authorized banks. With adoption of the Decree "On the Territorial Organs of Hard Currency and Export Control," the central organ of the Russian Hard Currency Control Service obtained the opportunity to "spread networks" throughout the territory of Russia. Now organs involved in controlling exports and the procedure for use of hard currency are being established in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and in a number of oblast centers. The decree also establishes the total number of employees in these territorial organs at 350 persons (not including security and building maintenance personnel). The wages of directors and employees of the territorial organs are established at the level of the appropriate category of employee in the central service. The apparatus of the territorial organs will be financed out of state budget funds. Clearly, the formation of a network of territorial organs of export and hard currency control will not make life easier for Russian exporters. But the effectiveness of the new system is not indisputable in any case--there was no shortage of control personnel in the regions prior to the establishment of special control organs, and the practice of unlawful use of hard currency obtained from export operations was nonetheless widespread.
