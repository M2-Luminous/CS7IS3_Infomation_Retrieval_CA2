In a release issued this afternoon, the LPC says the story is of blatant lie calculated to lend support for the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] charges that the ECOMOG supports the LPC. The LPC says it has never received arms and ammunition from any contingent in ECOMOG, nor has any carrier of ECOMOG transported arms for the organization. The LPC in a release states categorically that it has not imported any arms into Liberia and the NPFL is its principal supplier of arms and ammunition since the NPFL's arsenal in the invasion of Sinoe County and the Liberia Agriculture Company, LAC, provided enough supplies to the LPC for its advances against the NPFL. The LPC further says Mr. Taylor's recent national call is part of the NPFL campaign to discredit ECOMOG and would not allow its organization to be used by NPFL loyalists masquerading as journalists who are supporters of ECOMOG. The LPC in the release pledges support for the ECOWAS, [Economic Community of West African States], ECOMOG, and all international organizations for working to restore peace and constitutional democracy to Liberia. Meanwhile, ECOMOG has termed as speculation the front-page story in the 11-17 June edition of the [words indistinct] newspaper, captioned War in Buchanan, stating that (?10) peacekeepers died at the front. ECOMOG says the story was only intended to embarass ECOMOG and create unnecessary stampede in Buchanan for reasons known to the paper. ECOMOG says there is no medical record in ECOMOG headquarters to accord the story any credence. ECOMOG noted that the paper did not seek to crosscheck facts to achieve [words indistinct] was an important element in news reporting. The ECOMOG release is again advising the media to always cross check facts, rumors, and speculations concerning ECOMOG before publication.
