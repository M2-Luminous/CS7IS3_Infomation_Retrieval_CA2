SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This report is to give notice of an altered Bureau of the Public Debt system of records entitled, ``Personnel and Administrative Records_Treasury/BPD .001,'' which is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. The Bureau of the Public Debt is amending its present system of records covering personnel and administrative records for the following reasons: (1) To cover categories of records added by new programs. An example is records covered by the Family Medical and Leave Act of 1993. Where records are covered by another system of records, such as an Office of Personnel Management governmentwide system, those records are not covered here. An example is Official Personnel Folders. (2) To more fully describe locations at which records are maintained. (3) To show additional categories of individuals covered by the system of records. (4) To show new and amended routine uses. (5) To show additional categories of sources of records. (6) To incorporate another system of records. The Savings Bonds Division has now been merged with the Bureau of the Public Debt. The Savings Bonds Division is no longer a separate Treasury component. Therefore, system of records Treasury/USSBD .001, Savings Bonds Employee Records System, is being incorporated into the Bureau of the Public Debt system of records Treasury/BPD .001, Personnel and Administrative Records. In accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;130, Treasury/USSBD .001 will be deleted from the Treasury Department's inventory of systems of records. The notice for Treasury/USSBD .001 was last published at 57 FR 14134 dated April 17, 1992. (7) To reflect the consolidation of Bureau of the Public Debt personnel and administrative offices and the shifting of most of these types of records to Parkersburg, West Virginia. This system of records is limited to those records Public Debt needs to function in an efficient manner and does not cover those records reported under another system of records notice. The altered system of records report, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) of the Privacy Act, has been submitted to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget, pursuant to Appendix I to OMB Circular A&hyph;130, Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals, dated July 15, 1994. The Privacy Act system of records notice Treasury/USSBD .001, Savings Bonds Employee Records System, is removed. The proposed altered system of records Treasury/BPD .001, Personnel and Administrative Records, is published in its entirety below. Dated: November 14, 1994.
