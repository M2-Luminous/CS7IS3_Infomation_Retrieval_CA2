The director of the Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping, this week criticised the Government for seeking extra funding from the Legislative Council for the airport project. He accused officials of sitting on huge reserves and refusing to inject more capital to fund the infrastructure development. He also rejected the plan to develop land along the airport railway and raised queries about the Airport Corporation Bill unveiled for consultation. Sir Hamish said Britain had tried many times to arrange expert meetings on such issues. He pointed out that Britain had informed China's JLG [Joint Liaison Group] team on December 15 that the Government would approach Legco [Legislative Council] for more airport money and had invited their comments. Then had been no reply. On January 5 the Government gave China an advance copy of the funding plans which were later published, again without response. The draft Airport Corporation Bill was also sent to the Chinese side on July 21 for comment. "We received no formal response till the end of November when the Chinese side confirmed that they would have no objection to publication of a White Bill," Sir Hamish said, adding there was no comment on the bill's contents. The vice-director of the local XINHUA (the New China News Agency), Zhang Junsheng, said the piecemeal approach in seeking funds could not help resolve the problem. "They submit one report today and another report tomorrow. We want to solve the entire financial arrangements (for the airport and the rail link). They can't put forward requests like that," he said.
