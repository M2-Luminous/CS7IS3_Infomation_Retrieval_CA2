We are carrying the letter in full: Esteemed Mr. President, I fully agree with you and support your stand on the urgent release of all detained Bosnian from Mostar's camps, and of all HVO [Croatian Defense Council] soldiers from Zenica and Travnik military prisons. In this respect we had previously made the necessary decisions and issued the necessary orders. The exchange of prisoners would have already been completed had it not been for the stand of the HVO's Commission for Prisoners' Exchange which is incomprehensible to us. Namely, this commission insists that four persons -- found to have committed crimes against civilians -- be included in the exchange. No country in the world can pardon such crimes, whichever nationality commits them. You are certainly aware of the fact that last year in Sarajevo a group of our soldiers was given long-term prison sentences for murdering two Croats, and that another trial is under way of the persons suspected of killing Franciscan priests in the military monastery [as heard]. To leave these crimes unpunished will shake the foundations of the law and security that our country -- despite everything -- managed to preserve. I conclude from your letter that you were not acquainted with these facts and I, therefore, beg you to do everything in your power to end the suffering of 340 people imprisoned in Mostar, Zenica, and Travnik and ensure that their fate is not linked with the fate of the four persons accused of war crimes. Esteemed Mr. President, I assure you that the people and government of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Republic are very keen to wipe out all disagreements between Croats and Bosnians. The last two months of peace have clearly confirmed that these two nations are capable of building a joint state and rebuilding the kind of life they enjoyed over the past five centuries, before the recent unnecessary and mutually destructive clashes had started. In this spirit, I am expecting your visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina, convinced that it will strongly encourage the restoration of trust between our peoples and countries. I beg you to accept the expressions of my respect.
