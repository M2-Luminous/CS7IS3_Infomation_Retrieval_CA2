FBIS4-8543 "dreeu072_p_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 POLAND Defense Affairs Committee Formed, Chairman Named Defense Affairs Committee Formed, Chairman Named WS1304131894 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 13 Apr 94 p 2 WS1304131894 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA Polish BFN [Article by Ma.S.: "Pawlak Government Currently Proposes: Defense Affairs Committee, Not a Council"] [Excerpt] The Pawlak Cabinet established the Committee of Defense Affairs of the Council of Ministers [KSORM] on Tuesday [12 March]. The ministers also accepted a bill on managing immovable property left over by the Russian Federation troops. Tuesday was the deadline for the government to take a stand on the demands of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarity. The union demands, among other things, that the budget law be amended. However, the Council of Minister first wants to adopt a program of socioeconomic policy for 1994-97. National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said after the government session that the president had promised to appeal to the Constitutional Tribunal against the already signed budget. What he wants changed is the commitment of the National Defense Ministry to earmark 300 billion zlotys for the purchase of Iryda [Polish aircraft]. Minister Kolodziejczyk believes that maintaining this paragraph of the law with such wording would be a dangerous precedent. He also announced that he would not meet this commitment unless Iryda satisfies Army requirements. The issue of establishing new defense structures has already been discussed once at a Council of Ministers' session. Toward the end of November, the National Defense Committee [KOK] decided that the National Defense Council [RBN] would be set up as "the supreme state organ in the area of defense." This would call for amending the law on general defense duty and the Small Constitution. The Basic Law envisions the existence of the RBN, but as an advisory organ of the president. Lech Walesa is trying to ensure that the council decisions are binding for everyone, including the government. For the time being, there exists KOK, a structure that coordinates the activities of state authorities in defense issues. In December, when the Pawlak Cabinet had already dealt with these issues once, it was officially announced that "interministerial agreements still need to be reached." Unofficially, there was speculation that the government "became frightened" of giving all of the powers in defense issues over to the president. The newly established KSORM is supposed to be a collective, internal organ of the government, with a structure similar to the already existing committees of the Council of Ministers: the Economic and Sociopolitical Committee. The chairman of the committee is the prime minister. During natural calamities and mass catastrophes, the new body is supposed to coordinate all government activities. Minister Kolodziejczyk evaluated the establishment of KSORM as an opportunity to reform the Army. He added, however, that he had supported a different order: the establishment of the RBN first. Contrary to initial proposals, KSORM does not include National Security Office Secretary Jerzy Milewski. [passage omitted]
