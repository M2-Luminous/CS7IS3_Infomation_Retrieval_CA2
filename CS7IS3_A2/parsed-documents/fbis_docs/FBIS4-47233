Alimov, department chief, Republic of Uzbekistan Goskomprognostat [State Committee for Statistical Forecasting], and E. Salimov, responsible organizer, Republic of Uzbekistan Supreme Soviet Committee for Economic Reform, Budgetary Policy, and Local Self-Government, under rubric "Facets of Reforms":"Uzbekistan Is Improving the Climate for Investors"] [Text] At the present time the economic reforms in Uzbekistan are entering a new stage, which is typified by the expansion of the scope of market reforms; a substantial increase in the role of economic regulators; the creation of a competitive environment and a resources-saving economic mechanism; and the intensification of the selectivity of the state support of the material-production branches and the specific addressing of the population's social protection. Steps are being implemented to stabilize and assure the further guaranteeing of the increase in production, including a consideration of the dynamic attraction of foreign capital; and to reinforce the financial system and monetary circulation on the basis of the introduction of a national monetary unit. The republic has begun to carry out structural reforms aimed at overcoming the raw-materials nature of the economy and at increasing the share of finished, competitive output produced. The work in all sectors of the economic reform received a new impetus after the issuance of the January Edict of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, entitled "Measures to Achieve the Further Deepening of the Economic Reforms, to Guarantee the Protection of Private Property, and to Develop Entrepreneurship." The enactment of that edict is the latest in a series of crucial steps on the path of carrying out socioeconomic reforms. Indisputably, that document will promote the further rise in Uzbekistan's prestige on the international scene and the reinforcing of its economic and political sovereignty. Finally, that document has become new testimony to the fact that the young state is faithful to the course of the gradual implementation of reforms. Thanks to its unique path -- the correct determination of the rules and forms of the transition to a market economy --and thanks to the gradual formation of market relations, last year and in the first quarter of the current year Uzbekistan managed to prevent a sharp reduction in the economic indicators and achieved definite success in producing manufactured output. In addition to the previously enacted laws governing foreign-economic activity, foreign investments, property, entrepreneurship, banking activity, etc., this edict has been called upon to effect a fundamental change in the current economic situation in the country. The reform program is in acute need of resources, highly trained specialists, and the latest technologies. There is not a single branch that does not require radical modernization and major investments. Our country is currently faced with the serious problems not only of "our daily bread," but also of mass computerization, the creation of a technical production base, education and public health, modern means of communication, ecological safety, new energy sources, and many, many other ones. It is obvious that no one other than ourselves is capable of resolving these vitally important tasks and of making a breakthrough. But there is something else that is true: history has given us such a short period of time that we cannot disregard even one chance out of a thousand. This chance -- and it is no small one -- offers us time. We are discussing the truly massive and purposeful attraction of foreign capital to our economy. Under the conditions that have developed, the broad attraction of foreign investments would provide that gain in time that is so necessary for us. Experience that would be beneficial here is the Russian experience of the 1920's concessions and especially the present-day practice of transnational business, and of foreign entrepreneurship in the world's developed and developing countries. The situation cannot be summarized simply as the obtaining from without of the resources and technologies that we lack, although, in and of itself, that alone would accelerate the process of getting our country out of its present situation. In these actions one can discern one of the incentives that facilitate the difficult process of gradually assimilating the market mechanisms of management, of creating for that purpose the necessary competitive basis of an antimonopoly mechanism, and, in the long view, an open economy. As a truly inexhaustible market for the investment of capital, the Republic of Uzbekistan currently is carrying out consistently an open foreign-economic policy that is aimed at the successful solution of the problem of integrating its economy into the world economy. The foreign-economic ties that are based on the active use of the advantages of the international division of labor must become an important factor in increasing the national income. The success of resolving the problem of including the republic in world economic space requires the carrying out of major, fundamental reforms, the diversification of the production structure, and the qualitative development of all forms and types of foreign-economic activity. During the pat two years the foreign-economic reform in the republic moved noticeably ahead, primarily in its legal and organizational aspects. Practically speaking, all the necessary republic-level institutional structures have been formed. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Ties; the National Bank of Foreign-Economic Activity; and the customs services are operating successfully. Corresponding functional subdivisions are operating in the republic's government, ministries and departments, and local agencies of self-government. A republic-wide international-trade complex is being created. A base of normative law has been created to permit enterprises to go independently into the foreign market. That base encourages the creation of new economic-organizational structures, including enterprises with foreign investments, and provides reliable guarantees for the activity of the foreign investors on the republic's territory in conformity with international norms and rules. At the same time, the attraction of foreign investors remains one of the problems in the resolving of which our republic has been encountering definite difficulties. As has been indicated by an analysis of the activity of joint ventures, there still exist problems and tasks that must be resolved by means of state regulation. For example, most of the SP [joint ventures] (more than 70 percent) are situated in the cities of Tashkent and Samarkand. In addition, enterprises with foreign investments that are very capital-intensive and that have social importance are being created basically only on the initiative of the republic's government in the fuel-and-energy, metallurgical, chemical, machine-building, and cotton-processing branches, which from the beginning have been oriented on local raw materials and the production of output to replace imported items. Enterprises that can serve as an example are the joint ventures that were created with such well-known companies as Deu Corporation (South Korea), Rank Xerox (Great Britain), Bursel (Turkey), Buller (Switzerland), Newmont (United States), and a number of others. The course aimed at increasing the activity rate of attracting foreign investments and at increasing the effectiveness of the activity of the joint ventures raises, for the republic's state agencies, a number of qualitatively new tasks that are being resolved on the basis of chiefly economic methods of management under conditions of the transitional period. This is a guarantee to private entrepreneurship and to the successful formation and stabilization of market relations. Foreign investors in the republic are granted broad opportunities, including the right to purchase on a competitive basis, for investment purposes, production areas, building, equipment, and housing, and to take out long-term leases on land. In addition, the question of expanding foreign capital in the privatization program is being worked out. In order to provide the necessary financial and economic guarantees for foreign investors, a state company for insuring investments -- Uzbekinvest -- is being created under the Ministry of Finance, and some of the republic's gold-currency resources are being transferred to it. A very important incentive factor is preferential taxation. In conformity with the legislation that is in effect, provision is made for freeing enterprises with foreign investments from payment of income tax for a period of two years after obtaining the first profit. The President's edict has freed from taxation that part of the income of enterprises with the participation of foreign capital which is reinvested into the expansion of production, technological modernization, and the implementation of social programs. The rate of the income tax of a foreign investor that is being transferred abroad has been reduced to 10 percent. Joint ventures that specialize in the production of producer goods, in which the share of foreign capital in the statutory fund exceeds 50 percent, are freed for a period of five years, starting with the moment of registration, from mandatory sale of part of their currency proceeds to the Central Bank. Something that is becoming an important factor is the developing system of international treaties that regulate both the general principles of commercial and economic activity and the principles of investment cooperation. Agreements of incentive and the reciprocal protection of investments have been concluded with West Germany, Turkey, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and India. The question arises: why -- given the stable political and economic situation in the republic; the consistency in the actions of the Supreme Soviet and the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan in guaranteeing the legislative basis for protecting the investments; the very rich natural and raw-materials potential; and the favorable climatic conditions --aren't foreign investors rushing into Uzbekistan? Without a doubt, there are both subjective and objective reasons. We are taking our first steps, without having any prior experience; we are being hindered by inertia in thought processes; the bureaucracy; etc. But this is a market. No one is waiting for anyone here. There is no time here to seek the reasons, whether objective or subjective. We must move ahead. We must succeed and resolve issues. A very important question that requires urgent development is the creation of conditions that guarantee an assurance to foreign investors of capital that the projects to be carried out by them will be profitable. In this situation we are talking not only about specific terms that guarantee the foreign capital against political risks, against a change in legislation, against nationalization and compulsory requisition with the cessation of investment activity, but also about the creation of completely valid market space, in which the joint ventures, foreign companies, and their branches would have the opportunity to function under conditions of free entrepreneurship that are natural for them. The new law, entitled "Foreign Investments and Guarantees for the Activity of Foreign Investors," which was approved by the recent session of the Republic of Uzbekistan Supreme Soviet, is, as it were, a logical continuation, supplement, and further development of the Law entitled "Foreign Investments in the Republic of Uzbekistan," with a consideration of the changed attitudes toward the problem of foreign investments under the new conditions. In the final analysis, a decisive role is played specifically by the legislation that regulates the activity of foreign investors and that must necessarily guarantee them, in addition to all the other favorable circumstances, economic incentives. We realize that without such incentives it is difficult to count on any significant influx of foreign capital, especially under the present-day conditions, when the countries that are experiencing an acute need for foreign financing are actually competing among themselves in creating a more favorable investment climate for foreign companies. The law entitled "Foreign Investments and Guarantees for the Activity of Foreign Investors" defines the overall legal, organizational, economic, and social conditions of investment activity on the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan. It is aimed at guaranteeing favorable conditions for national and foreign subjects of investment activity, and at guaranteeing the state protection of the rights, interests, ownership, and the industrial intellectual property of the subjects of investment activity, irrespective of the forms of ownership, for purposes of the effective development of the republic's socially oriented market economy, as well as for purposes of integrating Uzbekistan's economy into the worldwide economic system. This law defines the state's foreign and domestic investment policy, which is aimed at creating financial markets, output (commodities and services) markets, and a labor market, and at types of vestments, and a procedure for carrying out investment activity depending upon the investment regulations that are in effect on the territory of Uzbekistan; and also defines the forms and procedure for the state's coordination and monitoring of the carrying out of investment activity. The law provides a new definition of enterprises with foreign investments. Usinit the sizeg the international practice (the definition of the International Currency Fund), as well as bilateral agreements of the Republic of Uzbekistan concerning the procedure for excluding dual taxation, the law stipulates a low limit in the share of foreign participation in enterprises -- no less than 10 percent of the holding (stock or shares), which limit falls within the jurisdiction of the preferential taxation situation stipulated by legislation for enterprises with foreign investments. It is necessary in the republic to strive for precision, stability, and consistency in the regulation of investments. The formation of this regulation must proceed in the direction of unifying the efforts in the activity of the domestic and foreign investors in Uzbekistan. In worldwide practice this is characterized as "natural regulation," the sense of which lies in a nondiscriminatory attitude toward foreign investors. The task consists in creating equal regulation for domestic and foreign investors in our republic. In addition, during the transitional period at the initial stages of the reform it is necessary to grant foreign investors definite benefits that are aimed at reducing the risk of losing their capital. In particular, the article indicated emphasizes that, for foreign investors who are being directed into the priority branches of the economy and into the regions, the legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan can establish additional benefits. And Article 11 establishes a procedure in accordance with which the tax system that was in effect at the moment of concluding the contract will be preserved for no less then ten years. The experience of recent years and worldwide practice indicate that for the broad attraction of foreign capital it is necessary first of all to provide economic guarantees. A way out is seen in the creation of a system for insuring foreign investments in our republic. The use for this purpose of only foreign insurance companies will not make it possible to resolve the problem completely. First, the insurance itself will be rather expensive. Secondly, and this is more important, the scope of attraction of investments will be extremely limited: the insurance companies will limit the size of the investments in a single "client," and the investors will not view the guarantees as being complete, inasmuch as, in the event of actual loss of capital in Uzbekistan, that can cause a definite overload in the foreign insurance system. Therefore what would seem to most promising is the broad attraction for insuring investments of a definite part of the state gold-currency reserves and the creation of a National Insurance Company, as well as, jointly with the world's leading insurance companies, an International Insurance Fund. On the whole, the law has been called upon to provide a qualitative turning away from measures of a limiting nature and bans toward a legal policy of intelligently admissible liberalization and to the dynamic attraction of foreign capital into the republic. The attraction of foreign investments to Uzbekistan is proceeding along the path of creating an open market economy, and, consequently, an effective one.
