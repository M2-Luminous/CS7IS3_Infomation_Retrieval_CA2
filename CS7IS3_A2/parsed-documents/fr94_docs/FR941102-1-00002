FR941102-1-00002 FR941102-1-00001 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Parts 50, 55, AND 73 RIN 3150&hyph;AF18 Reduction of Reporting Requirements Imposed on NRC Licensees AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to reduce reporting requirements currently imposed on water-cooled nuclear power reactor, research and test reactor, and nuclear material licensees. This action would reduce the regulatory burden on NRC licensees. The proposed rule would implement an NRC initiative to review its current regulations with the intent to revise or eliminate duplicative or unnecessary reporting requirements. The proposed amendments would: (1) Eliminate the current requirement for licensees to submit summary reports of containment leakage rate tests to the NRC (10 CFR Part 50_Appendix J), but preserve the requirements in §§50.72 and 50.73 under which licensees currently report any instances of leakage exceeding authorized limits in the technical specifications of the license; (2) revise 10 CFR 55.25 to refer licensees to a similar reporting requirement in 10 CFR 50.74(c) and require notification of operator incapacity only in case of permanent disability or illness; and (3) eliminate the requirement for quarterly submittal of safeguards event logs presently contained in 10 CFR 73.71(c)(2) and Appendix G to Part 73. DATES: The comment period expires December 19, 1994. Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical to do so, but the Commission is able to assure consideration only for comments received on or before this date. ADDRESSES: Mail written comments to: Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch.
