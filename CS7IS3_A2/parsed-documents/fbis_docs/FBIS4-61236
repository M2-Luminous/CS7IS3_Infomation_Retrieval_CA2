Borovskaya: "Speaker Was Elected on the First Day"] [Text] The Kaliningrad Oblast Duma began its work on 26 April. The agenda prepared by the organizing committee included 16 issues. Naturally, deputies were unable to cope with such a number of topics in just one day, all the more so since a portion of the first session was devoted to representative issues. Members of political parties and civil movements welcomed the representative body and expressed their expectations toward it. Later, deputies arrived in the suite on 17 Kirov Street -- which had been previously allotted to them -- to begin their work. Gennadiy Batutin, the oldest deputy of the Duma, was elected the chairman of the first session. Deputy Danuta Smirnova was elected his deputy. Yuriy Matochkin, head of the Kaliningrad Oblast Administration, addressed the Oblast Duma. During the first day, deputies managed to form working bodies and approve the statute of the first session. The most urgent question -- who would become the Duma speaker and deputy speaker -- was resolved within five hours. In the course of several rounds of voting and numerous consultations, Valeriy Nikolayevich Ustyugov, head of the Baltiysk Rayon Administration, was elected Duma speaker by a margin of 17 votes. Yuriy Nikolayevich Semenov was elected deputy speaker (13 votes cast in favor, 6 against, and one invalid). We will provide more details on this fascinating story, as well as on the entire session that lasted two days, in the following issues of our newspaper.
