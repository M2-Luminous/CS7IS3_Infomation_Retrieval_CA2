The statement said "Iranian officials believe that the objective behind the groundless article is to create tension in the friendly relations between Islamic Iran and Spain." ETA which means `Basque Homeland and Liberty' was founded in 1959 and is regarded as an `illegal terrorist' organization by the Spanish Government. The Basques are an ethnic minority inhabiting the western Pyrenees mountains in northern Spain on the Bay of Biscay.
