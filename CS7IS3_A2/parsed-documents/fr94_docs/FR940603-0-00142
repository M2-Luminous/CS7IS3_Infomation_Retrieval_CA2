FR940603-0-00142 FR940603-0-00029 A federal charter may include in its field of membership persons working in a particular industrial park, shopping mall, office complex, or similar development either through a community or multiple group charter. If the multiple group option is selected, NCUA permits the credit union to satisfy the requirement for a request from each of the groups through a request by the complex owner, leasing agent, or similar responsible official. The complex owner, leasing agent or similar official must provide information regarding credit union service available to any segment of the proposed select group amendment or proposed federal credit union. It is up to the applicant credit union to investigate whether credit union service is already available to any segment of the select group amendment or proposed charter. In general, exclusionary clauses will not be used to protect any overlapped credit union. However, in those cases where each employee group in the complex has not specifically requested credit union service, NCUA may exercise broad discretion in addressing overlaps with other credit unions and any request from a group to be removed from the field of membership. The following or similar wording will be used to define groups added under this procedure: ``Employees who regularly work in the Plaza Mall, New Orleans, Louisiana'' If the community option is selected, the industrial park, shopping center, or office complex must meet the standards for community charters. V.D_Corporate Federal Credit Unions A corporate credit union is defined as one that: •is operated primarily for the purpose of serving other credit unions, •is designated by the NCUA as a corporate credit union, and •limits natural person members to the minimum required by state or federal law to charter and operate the credit union. Corporate credit unions operate under and are governed by standards different from those applicable to natural person credit unions. These standards are set forth in part 704 of NCUA's Regulations. Supervision of corporate credit unions is the responsibility of NCUA's Office of Examination and Insurance. All applications for federal corporate charters as well as requested changes to section 5 of the charter of existing corporate federal credit unions should be directed to that office. VI_Name Selection It is the responsibility of the federal credit union organizers to ensure that the federal credit union applicant's name or federal credit union name change does not constitute an infringement on the name of any corporation in their trade area. This responsibility also includes researching any service marks or trademarks used by any other credit union in their trade area. NCUA will ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that the credit union's name: •is not already being officially used by another federal credit union; •will not be confused with NCUA or another federal or state agency, or with another federal credit union; and •does not include inappropriate language. The last three words in the name of every credit union chartered by NCUA must be ``Federal Credit Union.'' VII_Steps To Take To Organize a Federal Credit Union VII.A_Getting Started Following the guidance contained throughout this policy, the organizers should submit the proposed field of membership to NCUA early in the process for written tentative approval. Once the field of membership has been tentatively approved, and the organizer is satisfied the application has merit, the organizers should conduct a preliminary organizational meeting to elect seven to ten persons to serve as subscribers. The subscribers should locate willing individuals capable of serving on the board of directors, credit committee, supervisory committee, and as chief operating officer/manager of the proposed credit union. The organizers and subscribers should arrange for any meetings necessary to develop the business plan discussed in section IV.A.4 of this chapter and to complete the documentation for submittal to NCUA. Each of the required documents is discussed more fully later in this chapter. The organizers and subcribers must apply for insurance of member accounts. The Certificate of Resolutions (NCUA 9501) will be executed by the prospective chief executive officer and recording officer. Following action on this issue, the prospective chief executive officer and chief financial officer will execute the Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts (NCUA 9500). These documents should be provided to NCUA as part of the charter application. The organizers and subscribers should also complete an NCUA 4012, Report of Official or Employee, for each prospective board member, credit and supervisory committee member, and employee. The NCUA 4012s should be submitted to NCUA as early as possible to enable the necessary credit reports and background checks to be obtained well in advance of the anticipated charter date. NCUA will pay the direct costs of acquiring such credit and background checks. Subsequent organizational meetings may be held to discuss the progress of the charter investigation, to announce the proposed slate of officials, and to respond to any questions posed at the meeting. If NCUA approves the charter application, the subscribers, as their final duty, will elect the board of directors and credit committee of the proposed federal credit union. The new board of directors will then appoint the supervisory committee. VII.B_Support for Charter Application VII.B.1_General As discussed previously in this chapter, applicants for federal credit union charters must, at a minimum, provide evidence that: •the group constitutes a recognized common bond; •the subscribers, prospective officials and employees are of good character; and •the establishment of the credit union is economically feasible. In addition, the Federal Credit Union Act requires applicants to submit a sworn organization certificate setting forth seven criteria (see section entitled ``Subscribers'' earlier in this chapter). In order to process the application and capture all required information, NCUA has developed certain chartering forms to assist organizers. See Appendix D for the necessary blank forms. VII.B.2_Federal Credit Union Investigation Report, NCUA 4001 Applications for new federal credit unions will be submitted on NCUA 4001. (State-chartered credit unions applying for conversion to federal charter will use NCUA 4000. See chapter 3 for a full discussion.) The organizer is required to certify the information and recommend approval or disapproval, based on the investigation of the request. Instructions and guidance for completing the form are provided on the form's reverse. Associational charter applicants must include a statement of their membership criteria (normally the group's charter or bylaws) and current financial statements on the associational sponsor. VII.B.3_Report of Official and Employee, NCUA 4012 This form documents general background information of each official and employee of the proposed federal credit union. Each official must complete and sign this form. The organizers must review each of the NCUA 4012s for elements_criminal convictions, indictments, etc._that would prevent the prospective official or employee from serving in an official capacity. Further, such factors as past due credit obligations and bankruptcies disclosed during credit checks may disqualify an individual. VII.B.4_Organization Certificate, NCUA 4008 This document establishes the seven criteria required of subscribers by the Federal Credit Union Act and is signed by the subscribers and notarized. This document should be executed in duplicate. During his or her on-site contact, the NCUA staff member assigned to the case will assist in the proper completion of this document.
