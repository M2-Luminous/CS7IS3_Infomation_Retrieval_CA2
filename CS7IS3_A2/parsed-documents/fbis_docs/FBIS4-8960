[Georgievski] We all must work for tearing down the Berlin Walls of the Balkans -- the cemented borders which have existed since the Balkan wars. Our party was the first in the republic clearly to declare already three and half years ago that it is impossible to open Macedonia only for Greece and Serbia. This must apply to all Balkan neighbors, and first of all to Bulgaria. We all are familiar with an idea which generates a lot of talk recently. This is the project of constructing a railroad between Sofia and Skopje, which is supported in our country. The project of constructing a railroad between the two countries is older than 100 years. It dates from the time of the Turkish Empire. After we proposed the idea of connecting Macedonia to Bulgaria and Albania, SRPSKA POLITIKA carried a half-page article in which the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity [VMRO-DPMNE] was accused of wanting to partition Macedonia between Bulgaria and Albania. It is a pity our government did not initiate this project three years ago, and not now when the United Nations imposed an embargo against Serbia and Greece -- a total economic blockade against Macedonia. This is done now not because the government really wants it, but because of the Greek embargo. I am afraid that if the Greek embargo is eliminated within one month the project will be put aside. It is abnormal when one has to wait for several hours at the border checkpoints in order to enter another state. I think that both countries are not doing much to facilitate contacts between people. [Boyadzhieva] How does the Greek embargo affect Macedonia? [Georgievski] This is an anti-European act and its spirit is anti-Maastricht. The European Community must understand that it cannot treat Greece as a small child which has unique interests and caprices, and thus destroy the European spirit. [Boyadzhieva] What emerged during your meetings with the Bulgarian politicians? [Georgievski] All those whom I met clearly declared that the Republic of Bulgaria steadily adheres to the idea of an independent and sovereign Republic of Macedonia. It is especially important that on this issue there is a national consensus in Bulgaria's foreign policy. I think that the Bulgarian representatives at all levels must continue their active policy and defend this position at all forums and international meetings. I was told that many Serbian politicians in their contacts with various parties support a policy of dividing Macedonia. I hear tales about Struma and Radonos regions, and a division into Bulgarian, Albanian, and Serbian parts. [Boyadzhieva] What is your attitude to the U.S. "blue helmets?" How long do you think they should stay in the Republic of Macedonia? [Georgievski] We demanded that the "blue helmets" not serve under the flag of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], but in accordance with an agreement between our government and the U.S. Administration. They implemented their mission in Macedonia with a great success. The chance of a direct Serbian aggression decreased. The government did not have the courage to outline the borders, and this was done with barbed wire only after the U.S. soldiers arrived. I think that they should remain in the Republic of Macedonia as long as a danger of destabilizing the country exists, and as long the sole goal of the Serbian-Greek alliance is to eliminate our country's independence. I think that our country must do everything possible to come closer to NATO's structures and thus to guarantee the total security of its borders. It is well-known that the Macedonian Army was not trained independently to fight against a foreign aggression. During their withdrawal the Yugoslav generals took with them all the serious military equipment stationed on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia.
