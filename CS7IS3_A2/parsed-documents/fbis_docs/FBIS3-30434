[Varga] The VMDK chairman informed Milosevic that the presidium of the Vojvodina Hungarian organization felt that the fact that Agoston was allowed to attend the meeting [on 27 January] between the Hungarian foreign minister [Geza Jeszenszky] and the Serbian president was a gesture. In the view of the presidium, this could mark the start of a settlement of the unresolved problems of the Vojvodina Hungarians, whose basis could be the VMDK's autonomy proposal in both a legal and political sphere. The VMDK presidium points out: The VMDK's plans guarantee the possibility for the Hungarians to survive as a true ethnic group [nepcsoport] in Vojvodina.
