The aggressor is sporadically targeting the lines of defense with small arms. A mortar shell fired from the chetnik position exploded in Zagorska Ulica. The same happened in Dobrinja and Vrbanja Most. The situation on the Ilijas front is again flaring up. After a brief lull, the chetnik artillery at Krnjaca, [word indistinct], Medojevici, and [words indistinct] became active with full force. From these positions, the regions of Mosevicko Brdo, (?Poret), and Milovac were hit with several hundred artillery projectiles of various caliber from different artillery pieces. At the same time, the aggressor also fired over 500 projectiles on Vrhove, Visicko Brdo, and Borovo Brdo from Nobozice, Kamenicke Stjene, and Dubine. The latest reports from this front indicate that the chetniks are continuing deploying new artillery pieces and bringing fresh forces, because in their four attempts to penetrate our defense positions at Taracin Dol they suffered considerable losses and were pushed back to their initial positions [passage omitted]
