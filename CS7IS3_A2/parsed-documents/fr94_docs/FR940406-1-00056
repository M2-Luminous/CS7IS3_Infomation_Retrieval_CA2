In determining when subcontracting plans should be required, as well as when and with whom plans should be negotiated, the contracting officer shall consider the integrity of the competitive process, the goal of affording maximum practicable opportunity for small and small disadvantaged business concerns to participate, and the burden placed on offerors. 3. Section 19.708 is amended in the first sentence of paragraph (b)(1) by removing the words ``has been'' and inserting ``is''; and at the end of the paragraph by adding a sentence to read as follows: 19.708 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses. * * * * * (b)(1) *␣*␣* When contracting by negotiation, and subcontracting plans are required with initial proposals as provided for in 19.705&hyph;2(d), the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate II. * * * * * PART 52_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES 4.

As prescribed in 19.708(b)(1), substitute the following paragraph (c) for paragraph (c) of the basic clause: (c) Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation shall include a subcontracting plan, which separately addresses subcontracting with small business concerns and with small disadvantaged business concerns. If the offeror is submitting an individual contract plan, the plan must separately address subcontracting with small business concerns and with small disadvantaged business concerns with a separate part for the basic contract and separate parts for each option (if any). The plan shall be included in and made a part of the resultant contract. The subcontracting plan shall be negotiated within the time specified by the Contracting Officer. Failure to submit and negotiate a subcontracting plan shall make the offeror ineligible for award of a contract.
