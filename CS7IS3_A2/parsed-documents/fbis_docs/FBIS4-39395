It was informed by officials of the Moscow criminal investigations department today that an explosive device of an unknown design was planted in an Opel passenger car, parked next to house no. 40 on Novokuznetskaya Street, where the office of the Logovaz joint-stock society is located. A Mercedes car, carrying Logovaz President Boris Berezovskikh, was damaged by the explosion when it drove out of the gates of the Logovaz office. The driver died on the spot. Berezovskikh, his bodyguard, and three passers-by were wounded and had to be hospitalised. Chief of the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department Vasiliy Kuptsov believes the terroristic act was directed against the Logovaz president. But this is only one of the versions. In any case, the owner of the blown-up Opel car with licence plates of one of the Baltic republics has still not been found. The explosion was very powerful. Experts have still not established the type of the explosive device, but one thing is clear -- it was distant-controlled by radio. The investigation is being continued. The board of the All-Russia Automobile Alliance and the Logovaz joint-stock society has called for immediate vigorous measures to find and punish the criminals, who had attempted on the life of director-general of the All-Russia Automobile Alliance and President of the board of directors of the Logovaz joint-stock society Boris Berezovskikh. "The attempt on the life of the initiator of Russia's first private investment project, who had earned the trust of millions of Russian citizens and who enjoyed the support of the president and the government clearly shows that there are forces in our society who are vigorously striving to prevent by brutal criminal methods the development of civilised entrepreneurship in the country, to preclude its economic revival," ITAR-TASS was told today at the board of the All-Russia Automobile Alliance and Logovaz. The board and share-holders of the All-Russia Automobile Alliance and Logovaz believe that the attempt on the life of Berezovskikh, member of the leadership of one of the country's largest financial-industrial groups, can be qualified as a terrostic act and calls for the most serious attention of the Russian law enforcement bodies and the public.
