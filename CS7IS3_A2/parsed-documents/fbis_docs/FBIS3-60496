There are 140 patients on record with full-blown AIDS, and 360 people are known to have the virus. However, estimates put the number of HIV cases at about 2,000-2,500, many of them foreigners living in Hungary. The above figures were reported at a press conference in the Ministry of Welfare in Budapest on Tuesday, held to mark World AIDS Day, December 1. AIDS in Hungary most frequently afflicts men, mainly homosexuals and bisexuals. There are relatively few hemophiliacs among the HIV positive patients, and the number who received the virus through blood transfusions or through drug use are also low. The 20 to 39 age group is the most endangered. Most of the HIV positive patients live in the vicinity of Budapest. However, many infections were noted in the country's western and north-eastern parts.
