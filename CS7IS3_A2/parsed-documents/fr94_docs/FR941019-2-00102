Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 6578 Dogwood View Parkway, Suite A, Jackson, Mississippi 39213 (telephone 601/965&hyph;4900 extension 27, fax 601/965&hyph;4340). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Wendell Neal at the Jackson, Mississippi, Field Office, or Rick G. Gooch at the Atlanta, Georgia, Regional Office. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Red Hills salamander is a plethodontid salamander and the sole member of its genus. Its range is confined to a small area of southern Alabama. Portions of the Applicant's lands in the Red Hills physiographic province of south-central Alabama are occupied by this species. The applicant owns 80 acres of timberland within the Red Hills salamander's historic range in Monroe County. The Applicant's HCP identifies a 15-acre preserve area characterized as having steep slopes ( > 30 percent), within the Tallahatta and/or Hatchetigbee geologic formations, have moist loamy topsoils, and forested with naturally occurring mixed hardwood/pine and pine/hardwood trees. Previous status surveys for the species indicate this to be optimal habitat, with burrow density as high as 5 per 100 square meters. Timber harvesting in the adjacent streamside management zones, encompassing 16 acres of the property, will be restricted to removal of approximately 20 percent of the canopy coverage. These areas are considered marginal habitat for the Red Hills salamander. On the remainder of the site (49 acres), normal timber harvesting will be conducted and will result in approximately 40 percent of the canopy coverage. Take incidental to the applicant's harvest plan is expected to occur in the marginally suitable areas, through the physical crushing of burrows (and thus individuals) from timber felling and removal of large pine trees. Incidental take of this nature is expected in approximately 5 acres of marginally suitable habitat. Mitigation and minimization measures identified in the HCP include the preservation of 15 acres of optimal habitat, restrictions of cutting in marginally suitable areas, restrictions of the use of chemical pesticides and herbicides within and in a 50-foot buffer of optimum habitat, and training and education of logging personnel. The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted, no action, or the HCP modified for a different mitigation strategy.
