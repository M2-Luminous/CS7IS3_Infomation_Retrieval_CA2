This holds especially true in the field of telecommunications, where great expectations are being placed on semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) that employ ultra-high-speed devices as the technology for supporting the broadband integrated services digital networks (B-ISDN) expected to form the infrastructure for our economy in the 21st Century. Fully-customized designs offer the best approach to the ultra-high-speed IC designs required to get the most out of device performance, but when system development time and costs are figured into the equation, employing fully-customized designs for each and every IC would place a considerable burden on IC development. This is where silicon emitter coupled logic (ECL) gate arrays come in. Silicon ECL gate arrays, with their semi-customized designs, not only enable development times to be shortened and costs reduced, but also offer the most effective means of developing ICs for use in ultra-high-speed systems thanks to the advantages of silicon devices over compound semiconductors from the standpoints of reliability, mass production and a proven track record. There are current reports[.sup]1)[/] of a 9.5 gigabits per second (Gb/s) discrimination decision circuit and a 6.7Gb/s 4:1 multiplexer (MUX) that employ 156-gate silicon ECL arrays. This report discusses the results of studies on a 216-gate silicon ECL gate array employing super self-aligned process technology-1C (SST-1C)[.sup]2)[/] to fabricate 0.5�m SST bipolar transistors. To evaluate gate array characteristics, we carried out measurement evaluations on a chip equipped with D-type flip-flops (DFF), toggle flip-flops (TFF), 4:1 MUX and other key elements in optical transmission systems. The maximum operating speeds of these various elements worked out to 10.0Gb/s, 10.1GHz and 9.0Gb/s, respectively, achieving a 10Gb/s-class signal processing IC on top of the silicon ECL gate array. Basic Cell Layout The basic cells are comprised of 28 transistors and 28 sets of resistors (three resistors to a set), and one basic cell can form one master-slave flip-flop. Internal logic swing is a standard 400mV, and the transistors inside the cells operate at 0.4mA and 0.8mA. As shown in Figure 1, there are three resistor elements in the substrate of a basic cell for each transistor emitter and collector, and the resistance value can only be changed at line connections. Figure 1. Layout of Resistance Value-Variable Basic Cells Because the substrate of gate array ICs is determined prior to routing, it is difficult to change current in accordance with the type or purpose of a cell, and in the end, this results in the power dissipation of the entire chip increasing to higher than necessary levels. However, by using the above-described resistance value-variable basic cell substrates, total chip power dissipation can be held down by optimizing the power consumption of each cell. In this study, in particular, so as to obtain greater circuit current variation with fewer resistor elements, we employed a three-resistor element resistance value ratio of 1:2:4 to enable the realization of 17 different resistance values. Chip Layout The chip substrate layout is as shown in Figure 2 and comprises 6 x 6 internal cells (basic cells) surrounded by output buffer cells. The input buffers are configured using the basic cells. There are 216 equivalence gates. The standard voltage generation circuits are divided into those for the internal circuits (V[.sub]CS[/]) and those for the output buffers (V[.sub]CSX[/]), and are located in the four corners of the chip. Output emitter follower transistors for when ECL interfaces are used are located in the vicinity of the pads. The chip is 2.5 x 2.5mm in size. Supply voltage is furnished via a single -4.5V power source, with the standard voltage (V[.sub]TT[/], V[.sub]CS[/], V[.sub]CSX[/] and V[.sub]BB[/]) used inside this chip being generated internally. Figure 2. Chip Layout Figure 3 compares the structure of the SST-1C device with that of a SST transistor (SST-1B[.sup]3)[/]) with 1�m feature sizes. SST-1C made possible the introduction of 0.5�m lithography using ion beams, and an embedded collector electrode structure[.sup]4)[/] using phosporus-doped multi-crystal silicon. And element isolation was accomplished using a flattening LOCOS[.sup]5)[/] and silicon-filled trenches. These scaling techniques made it possible to reduce the area occupied by transistors to roughly 60% of what it is for similar 1�m SST collector current transistors. Figure 3. And in forming the base, we achieved a high-density base region with a steep impurity distribution by ion implanting BF[.sub]2[/] into the thin oxide film and diffusing this by means of rapid thermal aneal (RTA). And to suppress the Kirk (phonetic) effect, we employed a selective ion-implanted collector (SIC) structure.[.sup]6)[/] These high-speed inducing techniques made it possible to achieve 40.7GHz (f[.sub]T[/]) when V[.sub]CE[/] is 1V. We established collector-emitter voltage at around 3.6V. Using the SST-1C process, we achieved a 22.4GHz 1/8 frequency divider. Results of Measurement Evaluation Each of the prototype chips was packaged in ceramic packaging developed for use with ultra-high-speed silicon ICs, and measured using a dedicated jig. 1. Transmitter-receiver Terminal-aligned Collector-level Output Buffer As the ultra-high-speed circuit interface, there is a method that derives the signal at the collector level, called the SCFL interface.[.sup]7)[/] Contrary to the conventional ECL interface, the SCFL interface doesn't require a terminal voltage (V[.sub]TT[/]), enabling it to hold down on post-packaging waveform deterioration, and making it especially suitable for use on ultra-high-speed IC interface system. When the transmission-reception terminals are aligned at 50_O_, using this system to establish an open emitter-style logic swing of 0.8V requires 32mA of current and increases power consumption. At this point, we looked at the achievements made with GaAs MESFETs and strove to reduce power consumption by making transmission terminal resistance 100_O_. Figure 4 shows the circuit configuration of the collector-level output buffer we designed. We went with a two-stage pre-buffer + main buffer configuration because the basic cell final output is through a 0.8mA emitter follower transistor, and when direct drive is applied to the 24mA transistor that forms the final stage of the output buffer, fanout load increases excessively and output waveform rise and fall weakens. Power consumption with this output buffer is 236mW. When we checked operating frequency sensitivity of the output level, we found that the output amplitude began to decrease slightly at around 6Gb/s. Figure 5 shows the output waveform at 10Gb/s. The chip measured was a DFF. The height of the eye-pattern opening at 10Gb/s was around 530mV. Figure 4. Collector-level Output Buffer 2. ECL Output Buffer We used the collector-level output buffer substrate to configure an ECL output buffer, and did so in such a way as to enable it to serve as an ECL interface as well. We configured this ECL output buffer by adding a final-stage 24mA emitter follower transistor to the collector-level output buffer in the vicinity of the pad. The power consumption of this output buffer, excluding that of the final-stage emitter follower transistor, is 210mW. We used an ECL terminator to measure the output waveform. When we checked operating frequency sensitivity of the output level, we found that the output amplitude began to decrease at around 6Gb/s. Figure 6 shows the output waveform at 10Gb/s. The chip measured was a DFF. The height of the eye-pattern opening at 10Gb/s was around 500mV. Figure 5. Collector-level Output Wave (10Gb/s) 3. Results of TFF Measurements We utilized the resistance value-variable basic cell substrate to design three types of TFF with different current values. The transistors are the same size. Figure 7 indicates the current sensitivities of the maximum operating frequencies of these circuits. I[.sub]CS[/] as used here is the current value vis-a-vis the ECL differential. Changes in the current value, i.e. the basic cell substrate resistance value, effected changes in the maximum operating frequency similar to those exhibited during simulations, thus confirming the advantages of a resistance value-variable substrate. The maximum operating frequency of the TFF was 10.1GHz, and their sensitivity was around 75mV at 6GHz. Figure 6. ECL Output Waveform (10Gb/s) We also confirmed that even low current circuits with I[.sub]CS[/] of 0.25mA operated at 4.5GHz, and could process signals in the multi-gigabit range at low voltage. 4. Results of DFF Measurements We measured a circuit to which we had added an input buffer and collector-level output buffer to the master-slave DFF. Figure 8 shows the operating waveform of this DFF at 10Gb/s. The maximum operating speed of this circuit was recorded at 10Gb/s, this being the upper limit of the measurement system used. These measurements confirmed error free operation at a code error rate of less than 10[.sup]-9[/] for psuedo-random signals with data lengths of 2[.sup]23[/]-1. Data sensitivity suddenly deteriorated around 6Gb/s. At 5Gb/s, data sensitivity was about 100mV. This sensitivity deterioration was probably due to the lack of a dedicated input buffer cell. The phase margin at 5Gb/s was 250�, and at 10Gb/s was 50�. Figure 7. Current Sensitivity of TFF Maximum Operating Frequency 5. Results of 4:1 MUX Measurements Figure 9 provides a schematic diagram of a 4:1 MUX. This 4:1 MUX multiplexes four data elements by repeating the operation of a 2:1 MUX two times. We configured this 2:1 MUX of a master-slave DFF (MS-DFF), a tri-stage DFF (TS-DFF) and a 2:1 selector, and designed it so it would be able to assure a large phase margin. We also fabricated a re-timing DFF at the stage prior to the output buffer for waveform shaping. The output buffer performs collector-level output. All signals in the circuit, with the exception of input clock and data signals, are differential signals. Also, by using a resistance value-variable basic cell substrate, we attempted to decrease the power level, reducing the power required by the low-speed block (first-stage 2:1 MUX) to 35% of that of the high-speed block (second-stage 2:1 MUX) with the same function. Figure 8. DFF Operating Waveform (10Gb/s) Figure 9. Schematic Diagram of 4:1 MUX Figure 10 shows the operating waveforms of the 4:1 MUX at 6.0Gb/s. These measurements confirmed error free operation at a code error rate of less than 10[.sup]-9[/] after multiplexing 1/4-speed psuedo-random signals with data lengths of 2[.sup]23[/]-1 derived from a pulse pattern generator. Maximum operating speed was 9.0Gb/s. The 1/4 dividing waveform began to distort when operating speeds exceeded this maximum speed, leading us to believe that the operation of the first-stage TFF is restricting the performance of the 4:1 MUX. Phase margins were 250� at 5Gb/s, and 100� at 8Gb/s. The power consumption of the chip, including that of the I/O buffer, was 1.2W. Figure 10. 4:1 MUX Operating Waveform (6.0Gb/s) Conclusions We studied a 216-gate ECL gate array using a new silicon bipolar transistor process called SST-1C. The maximum operating speeds of the DFF, 4:1 MUX and TFF fabricated on top of this gate array were 10.0Gb/s, 9.0Gb/s and 10.1GHz, respectively, realizing a 10Gb/s-class signal processor IC on the silicon ECL gate array. We also studied a transmission-reception terminal-aligning collector-level output buffer and ECL output buffer, confirming that they both operated at favorable eye-patterns up to 10Gb/s. Using a resistance value-variable basic cell substrate in the gate array basic cells, we configured a 4:1 MUX that controlled the current value of the cell in accordance with block operating speeds, and confirmed that this MUX is effective in reducing chip power consumption.
