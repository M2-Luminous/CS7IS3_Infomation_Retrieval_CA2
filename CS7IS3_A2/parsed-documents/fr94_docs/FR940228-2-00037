FR940228-2-00037 FR940228-2-00017 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;233&hyph;000] Chandeleur Pipe Line Co.; Application February 22, 1994. Take notice that on February 14, 1994, Chandeleur Pipe Line Company (Chandeleur), P.O. Box 740339, New Orleans, LA 70174, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;233&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the increase of maximum operating pressures and total system maximum capacity of its pipeline, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Chandeleur states that it consists of a 79.9 mile 12-inch mainline, a parallel 82.3 mile 16-inch mainline (which loops the 12-inch line) and an 11.3 mile 12-inch lateral gas supply pipeline. The maximum operating pressure of the 12-inch mainline is 1100 psig. The maximum operating pressure of the 16-inch mainline 1000 psig. The maximum operating pressure of the 12-inch lateral is 1318 psig. The current authorized system capacity is 205,000 Mcf per day, with maximum capacity of 240,000 Mcf per day. Specifically, Chandeleur requests authorization to increase the maximum operating pressures of both its 12-inch and 16-inch mainlines to 1200 psig. Chandeleur states that it has recently completed a new interconnection with Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation's (``TETCO'') 24-inch mainline in offshore Louisiana in OCS Breton Sound Block 42 for the purpose of allowing Chandeleur's shippers to transport gas into TETCO's system, thereby increasing the shippers' delivery options. Chandeleur states that TETCO's maximum operating pressure is 1200 psig. To allow delivery of natural gas from Chandeleur into TETCO's 24-inch mainline when TETCO is operating at maximum pressure, Chandeleur states that its maximum operating pressure must match TETCO's and therefore must be increased to 1200 psig. Chandeleur states that the requested increase in pressure to 1200 psig is within maximum allowable operating pressures for Chandeleur's pipeline as established by the Department of Transportation. Chandeleur states that the requested increase in operating pressure and maximum capacity will allow its current and future shippers to increase the amount of gas they can transport to existing markets and to new markets which are not now economically accessible through Chandeleur. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before March 3, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 18 CFR 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Chandeleur to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
