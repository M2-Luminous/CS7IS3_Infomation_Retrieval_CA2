FBIS TRENDS-20APR94-DPRK-U.S.-IAEA DPRK SUggests IAEA Inspection for Simultaneous U.S. Talks DPRK SUggests IAEA Inspection for Simultaneous U.S. Talks SUMMARY In a clear effort to nudge Washington toward resuming dialogue, Pyongyang has hinted at a willingness to accept additional international nuclear inspections if they were to take place simultaneously with the resumption of DPRK-U.S. high-level talks. Pyongyang's veiled call was accompanied by relatively muted criticism of the arrival of U.S. Patriot missiles in the South and Defense Secretary Perry's visit to Seoul. END SUMMARY Pyongyang used a 20 April Foreign Ministry memorandum--a vehicle sometimes employed to stake out the DPRK's initial negotiating position--to suggest a way out of the current nuclear impasse. The key passage in the memorandum called for the "gradual rebuilding" of mutual confidence through "inspections to ensure the continuity of [nuclear] safeguards" and, "simultaneously," the "tackling" of DPRK-U.S. nuclear talks "with sincerity." In this way, the memorandum went on, Pyongyang's full return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) will be worked out "in due course" and the nuclear issue "can be completely resolved." In a conciliatory note, the memorandum also expressed "wholehearted hope" that the issue will be settled "at an early date." Despite its conciliatory elements, the memorandum also indicated that Pyongyang is poised for hard bargaining. The bulk of the memorandum reiterated the standard North Korean argument for Pyongyang's "special status" with regard to the NPT and attempted to portray North Korea as a victim of an international conspiracy led by Washington and the secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). For example, the memorandum contended that because Pyongyang is in a state of having temporarily suspended withdrawal from the NPT, it is under no obligation to accept full-scope IAEA inspections, and that North Korea's return to the NPT and full-scope safeguards obligations are possible only after the United States has discontinued its "policy of hostility" and the IAEA has restored its "impartiality." Perry Visit, Patriot Missile Clearly attempting to avoid further complicating the chances of resuming dialogue with Washington, Pyongyang has so far limited its criticism of Defense Secretary Perry's visit to Seoul and the introduction of Patriot missiles in the South. Monitored Pyongyang media have so far withheld authoritative comment on these developments and low- level media commentary has also been restrained. Coverage of Secretary Perry's visit that has appeared included a 19 April commentary in the party paper Nodong Sinmun, carried by Pyongyang radio the same day, that attempted to assign financial motives to Secretary Perry's visit, rather than depicting it in terms of perennial U.S. attempts to "crush" the DPRK. The secretary, the commentary said, is trying to find an outlet for the U.S. "munitions industrial complex," which, it said, is facing shrinking markets as a result of the end of the Cold War. Similarly, in repeating the familiar argument that the Patriot can be turned into an offensive weapon simply by switching its warhead, KCNA on 19 April avoided using the pejorative term "U.S. imperialists" --normal for criticism of this kind--and simply used the designation "the United States," as did Pyongyang radio on 20 April. By contrast, both KCNA and the radio referred to Seoul as a "puppet clique." (AUTHOR: YIM. QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENT, PLEASE CALL CHIEF, ASIA DIVISION ANALYSIS TEAM, (703) 733-6534.)
