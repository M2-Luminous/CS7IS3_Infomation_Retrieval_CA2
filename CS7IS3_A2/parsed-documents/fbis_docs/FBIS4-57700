In a communique, the delegation said Emmanuel Joseph, 38; Bontemps [name as received], 43; Delil Saint Louis, 26; and Serge Joseph, 19, were gunned down by "heavily armed civilians." The number of assassins has not been determined. One victim was a member of the association Tete Ensemble Cite Soleil. Two belonged to the Association of Youths of Cite Soleil 8, and one was a member of the Alliance of Haitian Revolutionary Patriots and Democrats. A fifth victim, also a member of a political party, and whose identity was not revealed, was wounded and left for dead. He received treatment later, the communique said. At least six other people were wounded Sunday night in Cite Soleil. "Those executions seem to be a systematic elimination of members of popular organizations which favor a return to constitutional order," the communique concluded.
