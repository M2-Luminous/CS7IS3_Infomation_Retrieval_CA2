FBIS4-36463 "drnes111_c_94005" FBIS-NES-94-111 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 Egypt Paper: U.S. Should Reverse Security Council Stance Paper: U.S. Should Reverse Security Council Stance NC0906075494 Cairo MENA in Arabic 0610 GMT 9 Jun 94 NC0906075494 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Cairo, 9 Jun (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR has stated that the United States' objection to the Security Council's doing its duty in condemning the latest bestial Israeli aggression against south Lebanon, which constitutes a serious violation of the sovereignty of an independent state, makes Washington lose a great deal of credibility, at least in the Arab world and in most countries of the third world. In an editorial published today, the paper stressed that what is even more serious is that U.S. attempts to save Israel from the consequences of its aggressive actions will encourage Tel Aviv rulers to continue their blatant behavior with impunity. This attitude threatens the peace process in which the U.S. Administration states it plays the role of partner. AL-AKHBAR noted the surprise caused by U.S. President Clinton's attempts to bar the Security Council from passing a resolution condemning the Israeli aggression, which left approximately 130 people dead or injured. The paper also noted the denunciation of the Israeli behavior by many Western nations at a time when peace negotiations are supposed to be taking place with the participation of Israel, Syria, and Lebanon. Voicing hope that Washington will reconsider its stance, the paper stated that if Washington does not want to condemn its ally or at least advise it to exercise self-restraint, it should allow the international organization responsible for deterring the aggression the opportunity to do its duty.
