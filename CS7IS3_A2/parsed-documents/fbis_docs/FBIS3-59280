The seven new branches are located in Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Shenzhen and Xiamen, all relatively prosperous cities in China. With its existing offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, the company now has 10 business subsidiaries in China. The company succeeded last month in obtaining a license to operate a domestic service from China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. The company, a joint venture between Sinotrans, China's leading cargo transport company, and DHL Worldwide Express Ltd., the world's leading international air express company, has also made an investment of 200,000 U.S. dollars to equip its Shanghai and Beijing branches with advanced computer systems. The systems will link DHL-Sinotrans to DHL's business network worldwide.
