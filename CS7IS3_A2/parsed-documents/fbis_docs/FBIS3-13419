At the beginning of April he will travel to Moscow for political talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin sent Rabin a message yesterday with a special courier in which he invites Rabin for a meeting to discuss the political process, as well as issues pertaining to Israeli-Russian relations. Rabin accepted the invitation. In recent days, the prime minister has voiced his concern about Russia's wish to resume an active role in the region. Rabin publicly voiced his displeasure after meeting with the Russian foreign minister and his deputy, who recently came to Israel in a bid to mediate between it and the PLO. It seems that the Russians were hurt by the way their envoys were received in Israel and consequently proceeded to arrange a meeting between Rabin and Yeltsin. [passage omitted]
