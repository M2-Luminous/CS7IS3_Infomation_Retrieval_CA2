Soldiers serving with the battalion reported that they intended to refuse to do reserve duty and turn in their IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Reserve identity cards. Blumental, a settler from Qiryat Arba', has been the commander of a regional defense battalion in Hebron for several years. Major General Dani Yatom, the commander of the Central Command, suspended him after he described Dr. Barukh Goldstein as "a soldier fallen in battle" in a television interview. News of the suspension was revealed two days ago, during Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq's testimony before the state commission of inquiry on the Hebron massacre. Professor Menahem Ya'ari, a member of the commission, told Baraq that the murderer served in a reserve unit in Qiryat Arba'. During the massacre, Ya'ari noted, he used a weapon which was issued to him by that unit. The commander of that same unit publicy described the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs as a "battle." Ya'ari asked how it could happen that such a man had been in charge of issuing a weapon to someone who subsequently carried out such a terrible deed. Baraq declared that to the best of his knowledge, the man had been relieved of his post. "At any rate, this man cannot be permitted to command IDF soldiers, not even reserve troops, especially not in an area like Qiryat Arba', the chief of staff said. In reaction to this, Nahum Hoss, one of the soldiers in the battalion and an aide to Rabbi Levinger, said: "This is a political ouster. They are bringing politics into the Army. Blumental should be judged according to his professional ability as an officer and not according to some statement, which, in my opinion, was taken out of context. As far as I am concerned, Blumental is an excellent officer who I would follow to any battle. If he is not reinstated as commander of our battalion neither myself nor any of my comrades have anything to look for in an army that serves the government rather than the people." An injunction issued after the Hebron massacre bars Hoss from carrying weapons. The police have so far not been able to hand him the injunction. Yesterday, Hoss asserted that he would not turn in his weapon. "I must continue defending the lives of my family and myself. I think the Army is mistaken if it thinks that it is serving the country by ignoring our request and doing without our battalion's reserve duty. Many people will follow in our footsteps," he said. An officer in the battalion, who refused to reveal his name, said: "What would have happened if the Army had ousted an officer who was a member of Peace Now? Did the Army get rid of officers with left-wing views after Mordekhay Vanunu or Udi Adiv [who spied for Syria in the late 1960's]? Yatom should remember that the IDF is the peoples' army and not the army of Meretz. The officer added that attempts were being made to convince the southern Hebron hills regional defense battalion to join their struggle. An IDF spokesman said that Maj. Gen. Yatom had indeed decided to suspend Blumental pending an investigation into the matter. Blumental will be summoned for a hearing by Colonel Me'ir Kalifi, the commander of the Hebron Brigade and Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, the commander of IDF forces in the West Bank. They will then decide which steps to take against him.
