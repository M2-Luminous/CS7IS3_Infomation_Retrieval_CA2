Iacob; place and date not given: "The Unions Cannot Accept a Government of the Left Extreme That Is Being Prepared Now!"] [Text] [Iacob] As a result of the PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party] initiative, according to the statement made by [PUNR Chairman Gheorghe] Funar, the trade unions should expect to be invited to participate directly in the establishment of a political and social pact. What is your opinion regarding this issue? [Ciorbea] For the time being, we are expecting a special invitation addressed to us, after which, together with Alfa [trade union confederation] and the BNS [National Trade Union Bloc], we will establish whether we will attend those discussions jointly or rather separately. In case we are really invited, we will adopt the same stance as before, because in our assessment the situation has remained unchanged. The trade unions will not give up the idea of a real coalition government set up with the participation of the parties that are members of the democratic opposition. Otherwise we see no way in which a social pact could be achieved and we are not prepared to conclude such a pact with the current government. Unfortunately, for the time being, all that may be expected is merely a government reshuffle. However, the trade unions cannot accept a government of the extreme left that is being prepared now! Under such circumstances, I do not believe that another round of talks could be held with the unions. [Iacob] Do you intend to go on with your plan for the month of January, referring to the continuation of the union struggle by means of strikes, even if Cotroceni [the presidency] invites you to sign a social pact? [Ciorbea] Yes, our plan remains valid, and I would like to emphasize the fact that union solidarity is stronger than ever, despite all contrary rumors and despite the alleged diminishing of the tension at the basis of the unions. A reshuffled government, with a significant shift to the left and authoritarian tendencies makes the entire reform process and even democracy quite questionable, and therefore we cannot accept a compromise with such grave consequences. We continue to consult with the parties belonging to the democratic opposition and we reassert the need for their authentic participation in the governing of the country, and not merely by the participation of a number of their representatives who would receive decorative offices. [Iacob] Should a coalition government be set up, are the leaders of the large trade union confederations prepared to personally participate in the government? [Ciorbea] Under such circumstances it is possible that some of the union leaders would accept to participate in the government if they are asked to, and considering their experience achieved in the union movement, they might prove to be more efficient on the other side of the barricade as well. Personally, I haven't considered my joining the government, as I believe that there is still a great deal of work for me to do here, in the union movement.
