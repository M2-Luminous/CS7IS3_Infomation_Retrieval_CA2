When do you find the time to indulge in your hobby? [Gherman] Unfortunately, I do not have too much time for it. After all these things quiet down -- which make each week seem like the week in which the world was created, since we have so much to do each week that when we reach the seventh day we no longer feel like resting any more -- that is, after we finish with these weekly remakes of the initial week of the world creation, I will find some time for bridge. [Lucaciu] Do you think that this race against the clock will ever end? [Gherman] It is not fully up to me to ensure that we reach such a normal working week; to a large extent, it is up to the wisdom of the political forces in Romania. [Lucaciu] Your duties as Senate president have made you travel abroad quite a lot. If you were ever to return to those places as a simple tourist, which country would you choose? [Gherman] First of all, I would like to specify that my function makes me do some traveling abroad, but not quite a lot, as you said. All these duties at the head of various delegations have meant that, with very few exceptions, I saw almost nothing of the countries I visited. If the schedule for the delegation members is somewhat more flexible and allows them to also tour a given city, my program is usually so heavy that I can hardly see anything of it at all. Let me give you an example. I attended a NATO meeting in Denmark and I did not even find the time to go out into Copenhagen's streets even once. If I were to return to one of these countries, I think I would choose one of the two Asian countries I visited, and not because they happen to be among the ones I visited recently. I would choose Japan because it managed to achieve a formidable blend of historical tradition and the people's spirit of sacrifice and devotion to work. I would also go back to India, the country I fell in love with when I was invited there in the 70's to give some lectures in physics at three or four university centers. India has instilled in me a certain philosophy of peace and nonaggression. [Lucaciu] You have recently returned from Japan, where you had the honor of being received by Japan's emperor. At this point in history, Japan is one of the important economic forces of the world. It is an overdeveloped country headed by a traditional monarchy. How do you see the relationship between the monarchy and Japan's development? [Gherman] There is no contradiction between the monarchy and the development of that country. Japan has built its political balance around the Imperial Court and around the structures that have led to the existence of the Imperial Court. I visited several homes of shoguns from the last century. There was a prevalent cult of power and of the master, and this has reached extraordinary dimensions in Japan. In 1868, the powers that be came up with the current solution of an imperial family, which took over the country's leadership, with all the shoguns accepting that solution. The life of the Japanese society, which first developed around the courts of the shoguns and later around the Imperial Court, has created a most respectable tradition. You must realize that there is no contradiction between monarchy and progress, as there is no contradiction between the republic and progress. They are accepted forms in various countries. One cannot say that the Nordic countries, which are all monarchies, are economically backward. That would be a formidable gaffe. I do not believe that a certain form of government, be it monarchy or republic, could be the key to success per se. It is more a matter of choice by the respective society and none of the aforementioned models of government can open the gates of paradise by themselves. Politics Are Being Played by Ear [Lucaciu] I know that you are a great lover of classic music. Could you make an analogy between our political life and a famous musical score? [Gherman] Paradoxically, I would compare our political life to Bartok's orchestra concerto. There is a great sound potential, both in our life and in Bartok's music. Bartok managed to produce complete order in his music, although a superficial listening to his concerto might not reveal this complete order. There is a sensation of musical cacophony there, but if you listen carefully, you realize it is an extraordinary score. If you look at the political effervescence of our society, everything seems to be a political cacophony. However, I believe that there is a basic substance there which, if one watches carefully, can be discovered in our social and political life. However, we will have to create some order in our own backyard. [Lucaciu] You mention the need for order. It does not seem to exist in many parties. Let us take for example the liberal movement, which is almost entirely crippled. [Gherman] The liberal movement in Romania -- just as the other political orientations in our country -- is substantially influenced by the people that head it. The liberal movement only stands to gain a lot if the egos of the various figures belonging to the movement's subdivisions are put in the service of the movement. Our country needs a liberal movement. I have talked to older and more recent liberals and I can tell you that the distance between the older approach and the neoliberal concept is as from heaven to earth. They will have to clarify and substantiate their neoliberal arguments and solutions, because, right now, politics is being too much played by ear. But this applies not only to the liberals, it also applies to other parties, as well. [Lucaciu] You are heading a social-democratic party. In its turn, the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] also considers itself to be a social-democratic party. Then, there is also Sergiu Cunescu's Social Democratic Party [PSDR]. Therefore, it is not only the liberal trend that has several directions, but also the social-democratic one. Do you see the likelihood of a unification of the social-democratic movement? [Gherman] Not only that it is possible, but, over the medium term, that it is also an obligation of the social-democratic movement in Romania. One will have to establish the landmarks of social democracy, regardless of the figures that currently dominate the various social-democratic groupings. I believe that not enough has been done to clarify the content of the social-democratic concept. To this, one should add the confrontation of egos, which is quite apparent both in the case of the social democracy and in the case of the liberal movement, something which hampers the movement's natural regrouping. It is like a typical childhood illness at the beginning of Romania's political life. Within a reasonable period of two, three, or four years, we will eventually reach a balance in our political life with its basic components: neoliberalism, Christian democracy, and social democracy. [Lucaciu] You are a politician of vast parliamentary experience. In your capacity as president of the Senate, you often have to quell your colleagues' outbursts of temper. In your opinion, how can one avoid such outbursts in the future, as they occasionally cast an unfavorable light upon our parliamentary life as a whole? [Gherman] I would like to remind you that in 1926-1927, a great statesman who made an enormous contribution to Turkey's progress, namely Ataturk [Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey], was confronted by one of the ministers during a cabinet session he attended. Ataturk took out a pistol and shot the minister. In general, I do not carry guns and I do not plan to shoot anyone. To answer your question, I will cite to you a Japanese joke. Two students, one Japanese and one French, were sharing the same room in a students' hostel. Each day the French student used to punch the Japanese one, who did not reply at all. After a year, the French guy told the Japanese that he has had enough of hitting him without riposte. At which, the Japanese told him that was a wise decision, since he himself had gotten fed up spitting into the French student's tea.... I Do Not Consider Myself President of the Party [Lucaciu] You are the president of the ruling party. However, many analysts claim that the true president of the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] is Mr. Ion Iliescu, who is allegedly making the important decisions in your party. [Gherman] The analysts are right, but only half way. They are right to the extent that I do not consider myself the party's president and that President Ion Iliescu has been our party's polarization factor. In this respect, they are right. However, as far as the taking of decisions is concerned, they are totally wrong there. President Iliescu -- regardless of the way or the light in which some people want to present him -- has a certain kind of delicacy and does not want to impose his viewpoints, not even in political matters. We often consult each other, out of a sense of being colleagues in our civic duties. It will soon be two years since I began -- unfortunately for myself -- to fulfill this task as PDSR president and I have never had the feeling that President Iliescu was imposing a certain viewpoint upon me. Usually, during the discussions we have, we reach a viewpoint that is the result of arguments and not of pressures coming from either side. Therefore, regarding your question and the assessments of political analysts, I can say that the truth is somewhere in the middle. [Lucaciu] As your colleague Alexandru Popovici [senator of the Civic Alliance Party, PAC] very well expressed it, the recent governmental reshuffle was done in a conspiratorial manner. You were in the middle of negotiations with other parties when you brusquely proceeded to change four ministers. Will this reshuffle not affect the further negotiations with the opposition and the parties of the governmental coalition? [Gherman] I would like to tell you that all reshuffles come rather brusquely in any society with a serious political life. Reshuffles that are announced with much ado weeks in advance do nothing but harm the political life. I must tell you a little secret. We are deliberately introducing viruses, that is, misleading information. [Lucaciu] We call them intoxications. [Gherman] We are causing such intoxications of the mass media so that we can be left alone to thoroughly examine the situation in peace. I believe that -- if the political forces with which we are engaged in talks take a dispassionate look at the reshuffle and think of the country's future -- the reshuffle should not only fail to negatively affect the negotiations, but on the contrary, it will become an argument in the hands of our partners in the future talks. If you read the press of recent years, you will note that it has insistently demanded the replacement of the ministers of defense and interior with civilians. Now that we have done just that, we are being accused for having done it! If you read the newspapers of April-June 1993, you will see with what satisfaction the papers wrote about the failure of the talks with the IMF; when the talks ended with the signing of the "Memorandum," the same newspapers began finding fault with the "Memorandum" as such. There is a kind of journalistic infancy at the level of our mass media, too. It does not bother or upset me. Anyhow, coming back to the substance of these reshuffles, they should not really upset anyone; on the contrary, they should be an additional proof of our openness. The Ministry of Industry Is a Colossus [Lucaciu] The appointment of civilians at the Ministry of Defense and Interior is a good chess move on the part of the ruling party, since it is in agreement with the requirements of the Council of Europe. However, I would like to remind you that both the government party and President Ion Iliescu admitted that we are going through a period of serious economic crisis. Therefore, it seems at least strange that, at a time of economic crisis, with its inherent blockages, you are changing the ministers of defense, interior, or justice. One would have rather expected a change in the sphere of industry or agriculture. [Gherman] The timing you are suggesting does not always coincide with the timing one can politically accept. Apropos the productive spheres, since you were talking about industry and agriculture, it is up to the prime minister to replace the respective secretaries of state whenever he wants, since this is part of his prerogatives. On the other hand, such a change cannot be done without planning. I am against frivolous moves in the political life. I believe that one should proceed from the bottom to the top in the aforementioned areas. This does not mean that one cannot operate some changes at the top, too. One should first see what can be done to amend the situation where irregularities occur. Let us take for instance the Ministry of Industry, which is a colossus; it has 14 or 15 secretaries of state, in charge of various directorates. Decentralization could not be achieved here overnight. The ministry still suffers from the centralized economic coordination of certain industrial sectors. If anyone believes that Minister of Industry Dumitru Popescu can be blamed for various shortcomings in his ministry, he is wrong. This does not mean that there may not be some shortcomings in Dumitru Popescu's own activity; if we ever come to the conclusion that these shortcomings exceed his merits, then we will replace him at the right moment. For the time being, we do not intend to do so. Therefore, any attempt by you, no matter how able it is, to channel the discussion toward second-guessing our future approach to the government's activity is doomed to failure. You will not get any information out of me. [Lucaciu] You said that a change does not necessarily mean to operate at the top, but rather to go from the bottom to the top. The PDSR, which has been in power for almost one and a half years, is accused of contributing to the phenomenon of restoration, through this concern with consolidating the basis. [Gherman] In this respect, the opposition has been quite ingenious in using all the possible pejorative terms it could find against the PDSR. We thank it for this lesson, because it is also teaching us how to treat it when it has the pleasure of coming to power. The metaphors they are using are the most authentic proof of a typically dictatorial frame of mind, which they themselves criticize in another context. In the communist regime, everything was placed in little boxes clearly labeled: leftism, opportunism, and so forth. Now we have more "ism"-endings than we could ever imagine. It looks like the mirror has turned the other way round, toward the opposition. We have become used to these invectives and each time we discover another one, we nurture a feeling of satisfaction, since we are confronted with yet another argument that unmasks the users of those metaphors for what they are -- their way of thinking is an accusation against themselves. [Lucaciu] Since you have talked about "ism"-endings, you are also being accused of centralism. [Gherman] Well, it is incomparably easier to criticize than to do something. We are in the unpleasant position of people obliged to do something. It is very easy to see everything that is wrong or looks like being wrong. As a matter of fact, this is why I agreed to become involved in political life. I never liked to sit in judgment of others without doing anything. I prefer to be judged and cursed. It is a feature of my character. Everybody Votes as He Deems Fit [Lucaciu] There was much talk about the PDSR being a united and monolithic party. However, it has ceased to manifest itself as such for some time and speculations are now being made about the existence of two trends within the PDSR. For instance, on Monday 7 March we were taken by surprise when the former minister of justice, Mr. Petre Ninosu, did not obtain the necessary vote for his election to the position as vice president of the Senate from some of his own party colleagues. Mr. Ion Solcanu managed to obtain it, but with difficulty. [Gherman] When you show me a united and monolithic party in Romania, then I will start being again afraid of a restoration and the revival of dictatorship. As for the incident you mentioned, well some people liked one solution, others another solution. The only thing they did not think of during the vote was that their gesture took place at a time when the people had already been taken by surprise by the governmental reshuffle. There has not been enough time to let things settle and quiet down; otherwise, that incident might have been avoided. From a human viewpoint, I am very upset with what happened to Mr. Ninosu, as I can well imagine what he must be feeling right now. [Lucaciu] I gave an example that involved people, therefore, one could conceivably say that subjective considerations might have been at play here. However, one gets the same feeling of the existence of various trends within the PDSR when seeing the fate of the Law on Radio and Television Societies. After it passed through the Senate, it is now bogged down in the Chamber of Deputies. The PDSR deputies tried to introduce a lot of substantial amendments, after the PDSR senators passed it in a certain formula. We are talking here about different and even divergent concepts. [Gherman] The law has been worked out by the Senate Culture Commission, which did not pay due attention to my observations during its discussion in the Senate. Some of these observations coincide with the amendments brought now in the Chamber. One should also take into consideration the fact that the Senate Culture and Mass-Media Commission is headed by Mr. Adrian Paunescu [vice president of the Socialist Party of Labor-PSM], who is a real volcano. Sometimes you can block a water overflow or you can put out a fire. But I have not yet heard of anyone managing to contain a volcanic eruption. Therefore, the law that has emerged from the Senate bears the imprint of Adrian Paunescu, with all its good and bad points. Generally speaking, all the cultural laws we promulgated bear his imprint. The rule of the game is that man creates history, not the other way round. Consequently, we are dealing here with a natural evolution within this legislative process. [Lucaciu] I have to insist on another subject, namely the Law on Land Leasing. There are divergent opinions on this subject within the PDSR. Some party people, particularly the senators, favor leasing the land to AGROMECS [agricultural-mechanization stations], others, particularly the deputies in the Chamber are against this measure. [Gherman] We fully observe a constitutional provision that forbids compulsory mandates. We put forth arguments and counterarguments, after which everybody votes as he deems fit. That famous Article Four of the law is hard to evaluate. It is like launching a cosmic missile from a l9th-century cannon. Maybe the leasing of some lands by the AGROMECS will prove beneficial. If the world were ideal, it would certainly have proved beneficial. But the world is not ideal, and here comes the doubting. I, for instance, doubt that an AGROMEC that is leasing land will resist the temptation to pass part of its expenditures onto the poor peasant, who has nobody to apply to for machinery but the AGROMEC. Others say that if we do not permit the leasing of the land, then the fields will remained untilled. Both are right in their way. As the famous rabbi of Buhusi said: "You are right and you are right." The political decision is not an easy thing and not absolutely univocal. Here lies, maybe, the unique appeal of the political life. Time will prove who better foresaw the effects of a certain deed. Let me give you an example: When the law on the legislative elections was discussed in Parliament, I foresaw some effects, which eventually proved right. My colleagues did not accept my conclusions at the respective time. I said that the proportional variant that was accepted can lead to aberrations. In a given county or constituency, one may not obtain enough votes to obtain a seat as senator, but may obtain two seats, through the redistribution of the votes. There are other aberrations, too. But they did not accept my arguments. We do not give "directives" or "precious recommendations" to our colleagues about how to compulsorily vote a certain law. [Lucaciu] The curious thing is that, regardless of the law submitted to discussion, the same people are making up the two groups. Hence, the conclusion of the analysts that there are two trends within the PDSR. [Gherman] But it is only natural that it should be so. I can tell you that even I, of today, no longer coincide with the I of yesterday, and I hope not to coincide with the I of tomorrow. [Lucaciu] But you must remain faithful to a certain belief. [Gherman] If I come to the conclusion that this belief is detrimental to society, then I must accept that other beliefs are better. Despite the fact that I am not a great admirer of Liiceanu's [prominent member of the Civic Alliance] political opinions -- actually, the reverse is true -- I would like to quote a very good statement of his: "Stupidity means to be frozen in blueprints." We must realize that each one of us is duty bound to change, if we do not want to be frozen in a blueprint." Early Elections -- A Disastrous Solution [Lucaciu] Apropos freezing, there is much talk about being "frozen" in the likely parliamentary blockage. This situation should inevitably lead to early elections. [Gherman] I believe that the greatest tragedy for our country would be to interrupt the normal process of reform already started and enter a period of early elections. Whoever does not see this, should remember that he stood for this disastrous solution, when disaster strikes. Now, more than ever before, we need tranquillity so that all political forces can focus on implementing the process of reform. We also need a timetable of the reform, as implied by the "Memorandum" [with the IMF]. If somebody does not learn from experience, then he will have to break his own neck before he learns anything. [Lucaciu] At the Cotroceni [presidential palace] meeting between the PDSR and Mr. Ion Iliescu -- a meeting that launched the second round of negotiations with the political parties -- Mr. Adrian Nastase, your party's executive president, said that if these negotiations yield no solutions, then the PDSR will call early elections. You were absent from that meeting. [Gherman] We must first try to find all possible solutions! We are not against early elections because we are afraid of the results our political grouping will obtain. We are afraid of the eight to nine months that we will lose from the process of the reform, which will cost the country dearly. I am also afraid that some people's vote will not be for a political solution but rather a negative, protest vote against certain failures. Generally speaking, negative votes are detrimental to society in the long run. I repeat, we do not fear early elections, but we do not wish them, since they will delay the reform by eight to nine months. We are not only talking about a delay here, but also about a leap backward of Romanian society by more than one year. Moreover, it is also possible that the extremities of the political landscape will increase their numbers. If this is what some people want, then let us go for early elections. However, I repeat, they are against the country's interest. [Lucaciu] Do you recognize that we have extremes in our political spectrum? [Gherman] There are definitely extreme positions, particularly individual. From a programmatic viewpoint, I have seen so very few coherent programs, that I even got scared. Some of them cannot even be labeled. I have heard of a colossal program of some party, which I do not even want to name, only to ascertain that it was nothing but an enumeration of mediocre slogans. There is plenty of noise, but no programs. Consequently, the political landscape covers a whole spectrum, with individual presences in all zones, but with much fewer programmatic presences in some of these zones, except for certain programmatic presences that scare me and remind me of the horror years of the 40's. I Have No Spirit of Adventure [Lucaciu] It is usually lawyers who become involved in top politics. You are a scientist, a known physicist. How does physics go with politics? [Gherman] You touched a sensitive cord here. Maybe my answer will be interpreted as a political gaffe, but, believe me, I do not consider myself a politician. I only consider myself as the owner of a floating bridge, that carries things from one bank to the other. Political life in our immediate past was totally anomalous. I am referring to the dictatorial period. I hope that a normal political life will prevail in our country over the medium term. I am only a raftsman, trying to transfer the Romanian society, with as little damage as possible, from the aberrant zone of the dictatorial past to a zone of normalcy. Consequently, I am now a kind of political clerk, who regrets that he cannot be a very good, as he would hope, physics professor. However, someone had to ensure the crossover of the Romanian society to the other bank of the river. I never liked to stay on the sidelines with my arms crossed. [Lucaciu] Professor, I would like you to answer another question from the sphere of physics. What are microwaves? [Gherman] There are all kinds of microwaves. It depends on where they are placed. Microwaves in the electromagnet field are placed in the extreme zone of mechanical access to electromagnetic waves. It is a kind of extreme zone of waves produced by normal oscillating circuits. Consequently, the zone of electromagnetic waves is pushed up to the remote infrared optical range. I would say that the microwaves are electromagnetic waves that are accessible through special means of production, not through the traditional oscillating circuits. [Lucaciu] Please, stop this scientific explanation. I was never any good at physics. Actually, I wanted you to tell me whether these microwave devices are good in the kitchen. I am referring to microwave ovens, which, even though they are not "accessible" to us -- because of their stiff price -- have conquered the world. [Gherman] They are very good for heating up food without altering its vitamin content. [Lucaciu] Are there any similarities in politics with the microwave phenomenon? [Gherman] You cannot find similarities there. Politics is a step by step phenomenon. To find something similar to microwaves in politics, there must be a political continuum there. But then, there is no such thing as a political continuum, since only undulating phenomena are typical of such a continuum. One can talk about a hypothetical kind of communication, through suggestion or extrasensory means, in politics. Some believe in that, some do not. That is a sphere of adventure, and I have no spirit of adventure whatsoever.
