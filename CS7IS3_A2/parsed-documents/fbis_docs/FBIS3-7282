[Nishijima, YOMIURI SHIMBUN] I would like to ask the president: Mr. President, you will soon leave Japan for China. What are you going to discuss with Chinese leaders in connection with the issue of North Korea's nuclear development? What did you and Prime Minister Hosokawa discuss in connection with this issue at the second round of summit talks? And, would you explain what was agreed and affirmed between you and the prime minister on issues other than that of North Korea's nuclear development? [Kim] The issue of North Korea's nuclear development was high on the agenda of the summit talks, and the prime minister and I devoted much time to discussing the issue. As for the issue of North Korea's nuclear development, I believe that the ball is now in North Korea's court. Prime Minister Hosokawa and I agreed North Korea should not be isolated in the international community, and it should not become an orphan of the international community. The issue of North Korea's nuclear development is the most important issue that could directly affect peace in Northeast Asia, especially on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, I, and the prime minister, agreed that South Korea, Japan, the United States, and China should make utmost efforts to solve the issue through discussion. I will leave for China today. Regarding your question about China's attitude toward the issue, I do not think it is expedient to predict what attitude China will take prior to my visit to that country. What is clear, however, is that China takes a resolute position opposing North Korea's development of nuclear weapons. I think you are aware of that. [Cho Chung-min, MBC] I would like to ask Prime Minister Hosokawa: Mr. Prime Minister, at the summit talks on 24 March you said that if the UN Security Council decides to slap sanctions on North Korea, Japan will make a responsible response to the sanctions within the limits of the Japanese Constitution. Mr. Prime Minister, would you specifically explain what responsible response means? And, did you and the president discuss South Korea's bid for nonpermanent membership, and Japan's bid for permanent membership on the UN Security Council at the summit talks? [Hosokawa] I would like to answer your first question. You asked me to confirm whether, at the summit talks, I said Japan will make a responsible response to sanctions against North Korea within the limits of the Japanese Constitution if the UN Security Council decides to impose them. At the present stage, the UN Security Council has not discussed imposing sanctions on North Korea and therefore, I would like to refrain from answering your question. In any case, I think it is very important that countries in the international community unite to indicate their solid attitude toward North Korea. At the same time, it is also important to leave open the door for dialogue with North Korea. President Kim and I confirmed that point. You asked about Japan's bid for permanent membership, and South Korea's bid for nonpermanent membership on the UN Security Council. Japan's bid was not on the agenda of the summit talks, but President Kim asked Japan to examine positively South Korea's bid for nonpermanent membership. [Unidentified official] The scheduled time is up and I would like to conclude this news conference.
