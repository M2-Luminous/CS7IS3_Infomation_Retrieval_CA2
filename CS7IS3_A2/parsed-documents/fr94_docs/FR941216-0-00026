FR941216-0-00026 FR941216-0-00009 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Parts 1 and 22 [CC Docket Nos. 92&hyph;115, 94&hyph;46 and 93&hyph;116] Public Mobile Services; Correction AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Correction to final rules. SUMMARY: This document contains corrections to the final rules that were published on Thursday, November 17, 1994 (59 FR 59502). These rules regulate licensing and use of radio stations that provide public mobile services, including paging and cellular telephone services. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: B.C. ``Jay'' Jackson, Jr., Commercial Radio Division, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, (202) 418&hyph;1310. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The final rules that are the subject of these corrections are part of a revision of 47 CFR Part 22 in its entirety and certain related rule sections in 47 CFR Part 1. Need for Correction A few of the final rules, as published, contain errors that cause the publication to be inconsistent with the current CFR in one instance and to contradict other portions of the FCC document in the other instances. These errors have already caused some confusion among regulatees and as a result industry organizations have requested clarification. Therefore, this correction is necessary. Correction of Publication The amendatory language contained in instruction number 3 states that the phrase ``Except as specified in §22.6'', is to be removed. However, this instruction can not be carried out in reference to the current CFR, because the indicated phrase has already been removed by a previous amendment (59 FR 30984, published June 18, 1994). Consequently §1.742 will not be amended. In §22.121, paragraph (d) reads in pertinent portions ``If an authorization is voluntarily cancelled or automatically terminated *␣*␣* on the same channel (or, in the case of a 931 MHz paging station, the same frequency range) *␣*␣*.'' However, the FCC stated in the discussion of this rule section in Appendix A of the Report and Order that the waiting period would not apply in the case of authorizations submitted voluntarily for cancellation. Furthermore, in the Report and Order, the FCC decided to require that applications for 931 MHz paging stations specify the channel(s) for which authorization is desired, rather than continuing to require that such applications request authorization for channels to be selected by the FCC staff. Because of this decision, the waiting period applies only to the specific 931 MHz channels involved, and not to the entire 931 MHz frequency range. In §22.165, the word ``in'' was inadvertently omitted. In §22.901, the language adopted reflected an earlier version of the CFR rather than the current version. Accordingly, the publication of November 17, 1994, FR Doc. 94&hyph;27415, of final rules in CC Docket Nos. 92&hyph;115, 94&hyph;46 and 93&hyph;116 is corrected as follows: §1.742 [Corrected] 1. On page 59503, in the second column, remove amendatory instruction 3. §22.121 [Corrected] 2. On page 59514, in the third column, in §22.121, the first sentence in paragraph (d) is corrected by removing the two phrases ``voluntarily cancelled or'' and ``(or, in the case of a 931 MHz paging station, the same frequency range)''. §22.165 [Corrected] 3. On page 59523, in the first column, in §22.165, in paragraph (d)(2), the words ``set forth §22.411'' are corrected to read ``set forth in §22.411''. §22.901 [Corrected] 4. On page 59560, in the second column, in §22.901, in the introductory text of paragraph (d), the phrase ``communication channels in'' is corrected to read ``spectrum within''. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30540 Filed 12&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M
