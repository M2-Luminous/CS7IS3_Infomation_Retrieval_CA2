FR941207-0-00088 FR941207-0-00015 A. Assessment of Arbitrator Costs in Distribution Proceedings We concluded in the Interim Regulations that we did not have the authority to deduct the costs of the CARPs from the relevant royalty pool, and could only deduct our costs. We noted that this was an unsatisfactory result, and described our effort to have Congress amend the statute. 59 FR 23977 (1994). Our proposed statutory amendment would allow the Librarian and the Copyright Office to deduct a CARP's costs from the relevant royalty pool, and pay the arbitrators with such deductions, before the fees were distributed to copyright claimants. Copyright Owners noted a problem with our proposal, specifically the provision which provided that deductions would be made ``before the fees are distributed to any copyright claimants.'' Copyright Owners submit that this sentence could be interpreted as suggesting that all royalty fees must remain on deposit until the final deduction for the costs of a CARP proceeding has been made. Such an interpretation, they argue, ``would contradict the authority to make partial distribution as found elsewhere in the statute and present a serious hardship to Copyright Owners because of the potential long delay between collection of royalty fees and their distribution after an arbitration hearing.'' Copyright Owners, comments at 35. They therefore recommend that the provision be amended to read ``Such deduction shall be made before the fees are fully distributed to all copyright claimants.'' Id. Aside from the legislative solution, the commentators offer other ways for handling the payment and costs of the CARPs. Copyright Owners offer a unique proposal: make a substantial partial distribution of royalties at an early stage of each distribution proceeding to an escrow account administered jointly by all of the claimants. The sole purpose of the escrow account would be to make funds available for timely payment of monthly CARP member billings, while avoiding the need for advance cash outlays from the claimants. Copyright Owners, comments at 33. Further partial distributions to the escrow account could, if necessary, be made during the proceeding, and any excess remaining after all CARP bills are paid could be distributed in accordance with the final distribution determination. Id. RIAA/AARC generally supports the proposed escrow account, but expresses concern that in DART proceedings, the escrow account could be depleted by monthly CARP payments before the end of the proceeding. RIAA/AARC also points out that monthly payments in a DART distribution proceeding are problematic since there has not yet been a DART distribution decision and there is no precedent to follow for division of royalties among the claimants and each claimant's pro rata share of expenses. RIAA/AARC, reply comments at 2&hyph;3. RIAA/AARC therefore recommends that the Copyright Office deduct all CARP expenses from the royalty pool at the end of a distribution proceeding, citing 17 U.S.C. 802(h)(1) and 802(c) as providing the Office with authority to make such deductions. RIAA/AARC, comments at 5. The method of payment of the CARPs is a problem, especially given our lack of statutory authority to pay the arbitrators directly. Unfortunately, the legislative solution discussed in the Interim Regulations, 59 FR 23977, failed for this Congress. Thus, we cannot pay the CARPs. We will seek the necessary statutory authority in the 104th Congress. Because of our lack of authority in this area, we are not adopting any regulations governing the method of payment of CARP costs. As discussed above, the Copyright Owners proposed the creation of an escrow account, administered by the parties, to pay the arbitrators. Compensation of the arbitrators is the responsibility of the parties to a proceeding. 17 U.S.C. 802(g). If Copyright Owners wish to establish such an escrow account, and can obtain the consent of all parties to the proceeding, they are free to do so. We note that in the proceeding to adjust royalty rates for the section 119 satellite carrier license in 1991, the parties paid an upfront sum to those arbitrators to begin the proceeding, and a final payment at the conclusion of the proceeding. We offer no opinion as to whether this is the appropriate manner in which to proceed, but offer it as a possibility to be considered by the CARPs who have the authority to direct the ``manner and proportion'' of payment of a CARP's costs. B. Assessment of Library of Congress and Copyright Office Costs in Rate Adjustment Proceedings Section 251.65 of the Interim Regulations allows the Library and Copyright Office to deduct their costs in rate adjustment proceedings from the ``relevant royalty pool,'' and, if no such pool exists, to assess the costs directly to the parties to the proceeding. RIAA/AARC and Copyright Owners oppose deductions from royalty pools for rate adjustment proceedings. RIAA/AARC submits that ยง251.65 is contrary to the intent of the CRT Reform Act. They note that 17 U.S.C. 802(h)(1) provides for assessment of costs directly to parties where ``no royalty pool exists from which [the Library and Copyright Office's] costs can be deducted_i.e. a rate adjustment proceeding.'' Thus, according to RIAA/AARC, deductions can only be made from royalty pools in distribution proceedings and not in rate adjustment proceedings. RIAA/AARC, comments at 10&hyph;11. Furthermore, if costs are deducted from the relevant royalty pool for rate adjustment proceedings, then copyright owners will bear the entire brunt of the proceeding in contradiction to the Office's determination that both owners and users should share the cost of rate adjustments.
