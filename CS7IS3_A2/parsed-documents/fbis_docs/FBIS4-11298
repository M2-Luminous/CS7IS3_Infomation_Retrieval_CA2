The ones who are coming want positive ties with Cuba. They have started by feeling the need to defend their land, families, and fellow citizens and by expressing their opposition to the U.S. economic, commercial, and financial blockade against Cuba, Espin stated. She added that interesting and constructive proposals could result from this meeting. The head of the FMC, which comprises approximately 3.81 million women over the age of 14, referred to the unequal characteristics of Cuban emigrants, not only since the revolutionary victory in 1959, but also during the past century, and even during the bloodiest phase of Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship. She said that during the 1950's, a large number of Cuban emigrants in several countries in this continent and even in other parts of the world, received our then-young revolutionaries, Fidel Castro among them, and expressed their solidarity and support as fellow citizens. Espin added, among the current emigrants, there are those who left because they felt cheated by the measures adopted at the initiation of the current system (nationalization of factories, organizations, properties); others who left the country totally confused; and those who left for economic reasons, the reasons for most of those who have left in the past decade. Espina observed, however, that even if other categories can be included in the exodus of the past four decades, not all are against Cuba and some even agree with the revolution and its leaders. According to the FMC president, the meeting also has special importance because it addresses issues basic to the FMC, such as the need to give priority attention to children and the family. Cuban women currently represent 40 percent of the active labor force, 61 percent of mid- and upper-level technicians, 40 percent of investigators, and more than half of family physicians (health program that gives personalized family attention in each territory).
