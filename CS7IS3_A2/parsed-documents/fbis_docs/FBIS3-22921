"In case of air strikes, all foreigners in the (self-proclaimed) Serb republic in Bosnia, including UN employees, Red Cross representatives and journalists, will become hostages," Milovanovic told the bi-monthly Serb newspaper INTERVJU in an article published Thursday. He said his troops would retaliate against the air strikes and that "a massacre of international representatives could take place." Milovanovic made the threat in an interview February 10, the newspaper said. In Germany Thursday, the humanitarian aid organisation Cap Anamur said one of its representatives, Nedim Goletic, had been arrested by Bosnian Serb troops. Rupert Neudeck, the head of Cap Anamur, which specializes in emergency medical aid, said Goletic was arrested Wednesday as he was travelling in a bus transporting Norwegian UN doctors between the towns of Zvornik and Kladanj. He said Goletic, 32, is a native of Sarajevo but became a German citizen in 1988. He worked for six months in the Moslem enclave of Tuzla, providing medical aid to injured women and children, and was unable to catch a UN flight to Split earlier this week. The Norwegian doctors had then offered to give him a ride aboard their bus. Serb authorities said they arrested him because he was not part of the United Nations.
