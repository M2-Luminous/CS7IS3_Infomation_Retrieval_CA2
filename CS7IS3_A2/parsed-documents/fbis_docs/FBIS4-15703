The Russian leadership, and not extremist circles, is a good and reliable friend of the leadership of the Serb Republic," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today during the talks with Radoman Bozovic, chairman of the Chamber of Citizens of the Federal Assembly (parliament) of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is possible to reach such a settlement which could be implemented in practice, the Russian minister said. "The settlement in Bosnia is not possible without the Serbs. The Russian side advocates lifting the sanctions, which have already become an anachronism, as soon as the agreement on the settlement in Bosnia has been signed," the Russian minister said. Andrey Kozyrev appreciated Belgrade's goodwill to continue a political dialogue in Bosnia.
