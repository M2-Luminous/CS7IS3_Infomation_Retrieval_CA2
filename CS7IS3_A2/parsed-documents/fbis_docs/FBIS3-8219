In the bestial bombing, the chetniks destroyed the old bridge in Maglaj. The headquarters of the supreme command of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina immediately informed the UN command for Bosnia-Herzegovina about the situation in Maglaj. At 1015, the Serb aggressor's combat planes again attacked Old Maglaj, and at the same time chetnik units launched a fierce combined tank and infantry attack. Soldiers of the 201st Knight Brigade of the Bosnia-Herzegovina army successfully repelled the attack. In preparation for a fresh tank and infantry attack, with air force support, the chetniks are regrouping their forces while still attacking the town of Maglaj. Army General Rasim Delic, commander of the headquarters of the supreme command of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, informed General Michael Rose [UN Protection Forces commander for Bosnia] personally about the attacks by the Serb air force on Maglaj and demanded that NATO planes take more effective action to stop the bombing of Maglaj, which is primarily aimed at civilian targets and infrastructure. General Rose promised urgent intervention by NATO forces to protect the air space above Maglaj. This is what was said in a statement of the press center of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army.
