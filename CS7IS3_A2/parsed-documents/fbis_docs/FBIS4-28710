The Foreign Exchange Control Law governs remittances overseas and, in the past, there have been instances of remittances banned on Iraq and Libya pursuant to UN resolutions on sanctions. But among bank officials there are now growing voices saying, "An impact from suspension of remittances to North Korea, with which Japan has deep relations, will be different from those of the past." Ashikaga Bank Is the Sole Channel Japanese banks, which want to remit money overseas, need to have agreements with overseas banks on receiving and paying of such remittances. This arrangement is called a "correspondent contract." As far as dealings with North Korea are concerned, there are now 18 Japanese banks that have such a contract with Choson Foreign Trade Bank [CFTB] (main office in Pyongyang). But the correspondent contracts agree only on how the remittances are instructed and how payment is settled. For people to be able to actually remit money, they have to have payments settled at a bank that has an account with the CFTB. The only Japanese bank that has a two-way deposit account with the CFTB is said to be Ashikaga Bank (main office in Utsunomiya city). A banking source explained: "It appears that the arrangement is made so that not just the Japanese banks but also all banks throughout the world have to go through Ashikaga Bank when they remit money to North Korea. The currency dealt with is not only yen, but all other major currencies, including dollar and pound." The source added that until last year, money had been remitted through several banks including London branches of Asian banks, but "early in the fall last year, North Korea asked all payments to be made to its account with Ashikaga Bank. Dollar-Based Remittances Already Suspended At the end of March, Ashikaga Bank notified all banks that it was suspending its functions as an intermediary for remitting dollar-based money to North Korea. Until then, banks that wanted to make dollar-based remittances to North Korea normally asked Tokyo branches of U.S. banks to pay Ashikaga Bank for it to make the remittances. But Ashikaga Bank is thought to have stopped acting as an intermediary as it expected the U.S. Government's watch on it to grow more wary as a result of the nuclear issue. However, one said: "Dollar-based remittances to North Korea were in small amounts to begin with; an impact from it will be not much." Besides, remittances in yen and pound are still possible. A measure to control remittances that the government is studying now envisions subjecting all remittances overseas from Japan to government approval, thus tightening flows of money into North Korea. Article 16 of the Foreign Exchange Control Law provides that if neccesary, "for faithful implementation of treaties and other international commitments," the government can subject the remittances from Japan to other countries to its approval, and this provision was exercised for the first time against Iraq in the wake of the Gulf crisis. Since then, it has been applied on Serbia, Montenegro, Haiti, and Libya. Remittances Through Third Nations Cannot be Controlled Among bankers there are voices questioning the effectiveness of a Japanese Government action intended to stop remittances to North Korea. They note that if new channels of remittances -- going through such third countries as Hong Kong and China -- are used, there will be no way of controlling flows of money into North Korea. A man said: "If the government wants to control those going through third countries, it will have to watch and inquire into all remittances overseas. That will take enormous costs, and it is questionable, despite all that, if the government can determine what is really happening." But if all the nations of the world do control remittances into that country, there is no doubt that it will become difficult for foreign currencies to flow into that country. In particular, Japan's suspension of remittances means that the payment account of Japan's only existing bank with a payment account [with a North Korean bank] will become useless. As such, "an impact therefrom will not be small by any means."
