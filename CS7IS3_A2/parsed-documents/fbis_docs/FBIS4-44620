As revealed to this writer today by CAS Academician Zhou Bingkun, major steps forward have also been taken in domestic industrialization of these products. Some specific accomplishments include development of a distributed-feedback (DFB) laser diode that passed a 100,000-hour lifetime test, is now being used in a fiber optic project undertaken by a Chongqing joint venture firm, and has been provided to Bell Labs [i.e. Bellcore] in the U.S. as well as to laboratories in Italy, Germany, and elsewhere. In the area of quantum well optoelectronic devices and integration technologies, a batch of high-performance devices have been developed, among which a short-wavelength quantum well low-threshold-current laser diode meets current international standards. Some of the 863 Program-supported devices are now in the initial stages of industrialization: for example, a 0.808-micron-wavelength high-power semiconductor laser has been incorporated into a 10-element phase-locked quantum well laser diode array, 1000 units of which are now being manufactured annually. It is understood that over 1200 technologists nationwide are engaged in 863 Program-supported optoelectronics research; over a 3-year period, they have taken on 110 projects, of which 30 have passed formal technical appraisal, while at least 10 have received State patents or Minis try/Commission-level S&T advancement awards.
