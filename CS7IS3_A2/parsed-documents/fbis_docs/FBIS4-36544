More details with Abdelkader Djeridi. [Djeridi] Minister of Finance Ahmed Benbitour stated at yesterday's news conference that the agreement on rescheduling Algeria's official debts, signed on 31 May 1994, stipulated a gradual repayment as from the fifth year [1999]. The minister of finance pointed out that such a method, known as a shared repayment, was different from the method drawn up by the Houston Club for debtor countries with a low income. As concerns Algeria, whose $5 billion in debts were rescheduled over 16 years with a four-year grace period, it would be paying from the fifth year 1.39 percent of the original loans. It would be paying 2.17 percent in the sixth year, 3.06 percent in the seventh year, 4.08 percent in the eighth year and so forth. Accordingly, in eight years Algeria would have paid 10.7 percent of the original loan and in 10 years 22.5 percent, he added. Houston conditions would, according to the minister, have cost the country 28.6 percent more in 10 years. The minister of finance also pointed out that the agreement with the Paris Club would allow Algeria to go back to the financial markets. He affirmed that the agreement, which was supported by a letter of intent, would open the way for another meeting with the Paris Club next year. As far as commercial debts were concerned, Mr Ahmed Benbitour pointed out that talks on the technicalities were under way between Algerian banks and foreign banks in order find out whether such debts could be refinanced or rescheduled with the London Club. In either case, however, commercial debts would not exceed the amount of the official debts that were recheduled recently. As far as banking system was concerned, the minister said he would support any initiative to set up private banks for the sake of creating competition within the Algerian banking system. [Announcer] On the other hand, the minister of finance has given more details on the agreement with the Paris Club, and asserted that Algeria had big development potential, had made a great leap forward in the economic reforms, and had the ability to find solutions. [Djeridi] Mr Benbitour has affirmed that Algeria has, in addition, human, hydrocarbon, agricultural, and huge infrastructural potentials which could be developed further. When these winning cards are well utilized, Algeria can overcome its crisis, he added. However, population growth, which is serious, would create huge social demands and require a production mechanism which would reach 50 percent of its potential. In this context, Ahmed Benbitour pointed out that Algeria could achieve growth of 3 percent this year and 6 percent in 1995, without having to look for further investment. The potential of the existing installations was sufficient to meet such a target as long as there was a good supply of semifinished raw materials. In a second stage, production could be increased to more than 70 percent through industrial restructuring, more investment, and fruitful partnership. At his news conference, Minister of Finance Ahmed Benbitour dwelt on the economic program. It is based on economic growth through developing the gas sector as well as small and medium companies, creating jobs and economic stability, and controlling the money supply and inflation.
