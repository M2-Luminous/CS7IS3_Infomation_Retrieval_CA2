This was announced yesterday by Oleg Rumyantsev, former Russian Federation people's deputy and secretary of the Constitutional Commission of the Russian Federation Congress of People's Deputies. At present, he is an expert on this problem in the Crimea presidential administration. The drafts that Yuriy Meshkov is to submit to the Crimean parliament bear on Crimean citizenship, its treaty-based relations with Russia and Ukraine, and also restructuring its executive power branch, according to Mr. Rumyantsev, toward creating "a strong presidential republic." The concept for Crimea's state and legal structure, commissioned by Mr. Meshkov, has been worked out by the Reform foundation under Academician Stanislav Shatalin.
