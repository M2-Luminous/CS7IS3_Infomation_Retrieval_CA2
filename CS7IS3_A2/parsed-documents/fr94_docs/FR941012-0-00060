FR941012-0-00060 FR941012-0-00011 OSHA is in agreement with ITA that safety in industrial truck operation is important in the logging industry as well as all other industries. OSHA believes that the issue of training of industrial truck operators is more appropriately addressed in more detail in OSHA's forthcoming proposed standard on industrial truck operator training. OSHA believes the major safety issues involving industrial truck operation can be fully and specifically examined and addressed in that rulemaking. c. Portability of training. The third issue raised regarding training involves the portability of training; that is, whether current and new employees who are experienced and previously trained must receive additional or supplemental training. The proposed rule would have required that each new employee be trained, regardless of whether he/she had been trained previously. Some commenters supported the proposed requirement (Ex. 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;9, 9&hyph;13). Several commenters disagreed with the scope of employees that need training, stating that trained and experienced loggers should not require the same training as an inexperienced new employee (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;39, 9&hyph;2; Tr. W1 63, OR 85). OSHA believes that training is important for all loggers regardless of whether they have no logging experience or have many years of experience. The need to provide training for even experienced loggers is buttressed by the WIR survey of injured loggers, which indicated that over one third of those injured had never received training (Ex. 2&hyph;1). In addition, more than 60 percent of those injured had worked 5 years or more in the logging industry. In fact, only 22 percent of those injured had worked in the logging industry for one year or less. At the same time, OSHA does not want to penalize those employers who already have instituted training programs that meet the requirements of the final rule or can easily be brought into compliance with the final rule. In addition, OSHA does not want to impose an unnecessary burden on an employer who hires loggers who have received the training required by this section on a prior job. In order to eliminate unnecessary duplication of training in the final rule, OSHA is not requiring employers to retrain employees who have received training in the specific requirements of this section. The final rule only requires the employer to train employees in those elements in which the current or new employee has not been trained. For example, an employee may need to be trained to recognize hazards that are specific to the terrain in which the work is being done, and to utilize safe work practices to avoid or control these hazards. In addition, a new employee, even if experienced in logging operations, may not be familiar with various work site procedures of the new employer, such as signals to be used. It is important for new employees to be brought up to speed with the current logging practices so other members of the logging crew are not placed at risk by the actions or inactions of the new employee. OSHA has included in the final rule a provision that each new employee and each employee who must be trained work under the supervision of a designated person until they can demonstrate the ability to perform their new duties safely. OSHA's position on the supervision requirement was supported by various hearing participants. For example, various witnesses at the hearing noted that close supervision of new employees, regardless of their experience, is a widely accepted practice in the logging industry and a means of determining whether the employee's previous training was adequate (Tr. W1 91&hyph;92, OR 95&hyph;97, 204&hyph;05, 275&hyph;76, 374, 456&hyph;57, 635&hyph;36). As such, OSHA believes that the inclusion of the supervision requirement in the final rule will provide the necessary safety to both the new and current employee, and will not impose a significant burden on the employer. 2. Personal protective equipment. In the hearing notice OSHA raised the issue about who should pay for personal protective equipment (PPE) that employees are required to use or wear. The Agency proposed that employers provide PPE and assure it is used by employees when required. OSHA's intent in the proposed rule was that the employer provide personal equipment at no cost to the employee. PPE items included in the proposed rule were gloves, leg protection, logging boots, safety helmets (hard hats), eye or face protection, and respiratory protection.
