In an interview with the Tunisian EL-CHOUROUK, published today, he said: Entering war is an easy task we had cautioned against, but getting out of war is a difficult operation. He attributed the military fighting in Yemen to the existence of forces he described as influential and clinging to their positions, which reject the provisions of the agreement signed by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid in the Jordanian capital Amman last February. He added: These forces have waged war to maintain their control -- particularly the tribal one -- influence, and narrow interests in the country, throwing experience, the union, and everything away. He added that the current situation in the Republic of Yemen mixes up the militarization of the regime and the tribe and the state, and this is the core of the problem and the main motive of the war, which has been fed by the influential forces in the country. Mr. al-'Attas accused the previous leadership of Northern Yemen of not respecting the unity agreement signed in May 1990 between the two northern and southern parts of Yemen. He said the previous leadership of North Yemen had resorted to "the elimination of the leading members of the Yemeni Socialist Party through intimidation, assassinations, and various other actions." Al-'Attas denied the existence of a regional factor in the fighting currently raging in Yemen. "There is no country influencing the events in Yemen or interfering to settle accounts," he said. "The reports talking about a role for the neighboring states to feeding the conflict are mere hearsay and misinformation designed to cover up the practices and behavior in this war, in which every Yemeni is a loser, and because of which unity, democracy and the future of Yemen in general are being slaughtered." Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Salih dismissed yesterday evening Prime Minister Haydar Abu Bakr al-Attas and appointed a new defense minister, Staff Brigadier Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, to replace the dismissed southern Defense Minister Haytham Qasim Tahir.
