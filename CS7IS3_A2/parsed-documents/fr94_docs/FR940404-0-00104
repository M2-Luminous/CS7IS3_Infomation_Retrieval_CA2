FR940404-0-00104 FR940404-0-00023 5. Newly designated §540.105 is revised to read as follows: §540.105 Expenses of inmate telephone use. (a) An inmate is responsible for the expenses of inmate telephone use. Such expenses may include a fee for replacement of an inmate's telephone access code that is used in an institution which has implemented debit billing for inmate telephone calls. Each inmate is responsible for staying aware of his or her account balance through the automated process provided by the system. Third party billing and electronic transfer of a call to a third party are prohibited. (b) The Warden shall provide at least one collect call each month for an inmate who is without funds. An inmate without funds is defined as an inmate who has not had a trust fund account balance of $6.00 for the past 30 days. The Warden may increase the number of collect calls based upon local institution conditions (e.g., institution population, staff resources, and usage demand). To prevent abuses of this provision (e.g., inmate shows a pattern of depleting his or her commissary funds prior to placing collect calls), the Warden may impose restrictions on the provisions of this paragraph (b). (c) The Warden shall limit the telephone privileges (collect and debit billed calls) of an inmate who has refused to participate in the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP) as specified in 28 CFR part 545. (Effective date of this paragraph (§540.105(c)) is delayed until January 3, 1995.) (d) The Warden may direct the government to bear the expense of inmate telephone use or allow a call to be made collect under compelling circumstances such as when an inmate has lost contact with his family or has a family emergency. PART 545_WORK AND COMPENSATION 6. The authority citation for 28 CFR part 545 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 18 U.S.C. 3013, 3571, 3572, 3621, 3622, 3624, 3663, 4001, 4042, 4081, 4082 (Repealed in part as to offenses committed on or after November 1, 1987), 4126, 5006&hyph;5024 (Repealed October 12, 1984 as to offenses committed after that date), 5039; 28 U.S.C. 509, 510; 28 CFR 0.95&hyph;0.99. 7. In §545.11, the following concluding sentences are added to introductory paragraph (b) and paragraph (d)(10) is added to read as follows: §545.11 Procedures. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* In developing an inmate's financial plan, the unit team shall exclude from its assessment $50 a month deposited into the inmate's trust fund account. This $50 exemption shall be calculated after subtracting from the trust fund account the inmate's IFRP minimum payment schedule for UNICOR or non-UNICOR work assignments, set forth below in paragraph (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. This $50.00 is excluded to allow the inmate the opportunity to better maintain telephone communication under the Inmate Telephone System (ITS). * * * * * (d) *␣*␣* (10) The inmate will be allowed to place no more than one telephone call every month, as provided in 28 CFR 540.100(b). Any exception to this provision requires approval of the Warden, and is to be based on compelling circumstances. (Effective date of this paragraph (§545.11(d)(10)) is delayed until January 3, 1995.) Dated: March 30, 1994. Wade B. Houk, Acting Director, Bureau of Prisons. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8008 Filed 4&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;05&hyph;P
