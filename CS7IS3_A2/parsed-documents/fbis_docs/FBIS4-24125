A communique received in our newsroom says the timetable already represents a one-month delay in relation to the dates set by the May 1994 UN Security Council resolution. The international members of the CSC noted that between 14 and 21 June only 821 men reported to government assembly points. Taking into account the personnel involved, the joint communique said 11,448 troops still need to report to the assembly points. The deadline for the confinement and demobilization of troops expires on 30 June.
