They were implementing the humanitarian plan and policy of the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic toward families of American personnel missing in action during the war in Laos and responding to the U.S. side's request for cooperation in conducting surveys and excavations and investigating and searching for American MIA's. During the period, technicians from both sides jointly conducted excavations at two points in Houa Phan Province -- points 2935 and 1336. In addition, the Lao Government granted permission for the American technicians to investigate and find out about American MIA's at a former detention camp in Viangsai District, Houa Phan Province. These are MIA's whom the U.S. side believes to be still alive. Through the excavations at the two points, the technicians of both sides satisfactorily found a lot of evidence and information. Following the investigation, the team discovered that there are no living American MIA's as suspected by the U.S. side. The joint operation in Houa Phan Province began on 4 May and ended on 19 May. Later, the technicians of both sides continued their work in Xieng Khouang Province according to plans. In Xieng Khouang Province, they conducted excavations at four points -- points 1558, 1432, 1926, and 1786. The joint excavation in this province began on 19 May and ended on 30 May. It brought about satisfactory achievements to the U.S. side. The joint operation in Xieng Khouang Province, however, has not been completed yet. Three more points remain to be excavated. The excavations at these three points will be conducted in accordance with the 1993-94 plan. In this plan, in addition to jointly conducting excavations, the Lao side allowed the U.S. side to investigate two cases in Xieng Khouang Province at point 0060 and point 0925.
