Official Spokesman Eloy Cantu stated last night that the government had virtually recovered control of San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, and Altamirano, population centers occupied by the so-called Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. Nevertheless, in reporting on the events that took place in Chiapas, the aforementioned Mexican Government spokesman explained that "there are still specific areas where conditions of insecurity still persist." "Institutional life and normalcy are painstakingly being recovered, in other words, with each passing moment civilian authority is being reinstated," Cantu stated. Dozens of bodies with evidence of bullet wounds where laying along Ocosingo's streets after the Army was able establish control of the last population center taken by the armed group. The rebel groups decided to withdraw to the mountain region located in the north-central part of Chiapas. In Ocosingo, located 800 kms south east of Mexico City, Zapatista members attempted to hold on to the last population center it originally took. After taking over the first four communities, the up until now unknown EZLN began to appear in other communities such as Abasolo, Chanal del Carmen, and Oxchuc. During the last few hours the rebel group also withdrew from Oxchuc. [Passages omitted]
