Tian Jiyun had worked in Guizhou Province for 20 years. When he saw old comrades who worked with him before, he intimately chatted with them and asked them to extend his regards to his former colleagues. He said with deep feelings: It seems people's congresses at various levels will need more comrades in their prime in the future to suit the new situation. Now we are establishing a socialist market economic structure, and it is all the more necessary to strengthen the work of legislation and implementation of laws. Therefore, the work of people's congresses will be more and more important and the comrades of people's congresses will have a heavy burden. Tian Jiyun also held that young comrades can temper themselves in legislative work at people's congresses and later work on the frontline of economic work. He said that in this way they could greatly help economic development. In meeting with deputies of the Jiangxi delegation, Tian Jiyun was very glad after hearing news on the steady development of agricultural production in Jiangxi. He said: Agriculture is the foundation for the overall national economic development. If we stabilize agricultural production, we can have stability in the rural areas; and if we have stability in the rural areas, we can provide a guarantee for the steady development of reform. Touching on Jiangxi's village and town enterprises, Tian Jiyun said: Village and town enterprises started relatively late in Jiangxi, so it is necessary to catch up with other localities. To get rid of poverty and promote development, agricultural provinces and poor areas must develop village and town enterprises and rely on economic benefits of village and town enterprises. NPC deputies from Jiangxi also made a report to Tian Jiyun on Jiangxi's progress in adjusting the structure of agricultural production and in promoting agricultural production. Tian Jiyun satisfactorily said: I hope Jiangxi can achieve success in agricultural development.
