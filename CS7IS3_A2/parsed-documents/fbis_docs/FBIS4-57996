The likelihood of Mr. Blau's resignation has prompted several meetings and concern among the other ARI directors. ARI adviser Adolfo Obarrio commented to "Telemetro Reports" on the possibility of the resignation of the current ARI general manager. [Begin Obarrio recording] All I can say is that we have been working normally and have even progressed significantly. I am not aware of anything out of the ordinary taking place at this time. I am aware, however, of the reports that have been circulating through the media. It would seem that there is a report that speculates that Mr. Blau could be thinking of resigning. Why? I do not know since I have not yet spoken to the other ARI directors. Therefore, I am not aware of any specific reason that could prompt such a decision. [end recording] Mr. Blau's replacement is an issue the ARI Board of Directors will have to evaluate. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] If Mr. Blau did decide to resign, who would replace him? [Obarrio] That is a good question because at this time there is no deputy general manager. I am not a lawyer and would not like to get involved in an area that is out of my competence. Nevertheless, I understand that no government official can resign from his post if there is no replacement. I also understand that the law requires that a replacement be selected from among several candidates. Therefore, Mr. Blau would have to remain in his position until the new general manager is selected. [end recording]
