In a series of speeches, Mr de Klerk said he had spoken on the telephone to Chief Buthelezi, the KwaZulu leader, reminding him that the people of his semi-autonomous state had the right to vote in the elections. The Inkatha decision not to participate in the election created a dangerous situation for the whole country, he said. An angry Mr Buthelezi, whose Inkatha party failed to register candidates by the weekend deadline, said Mr Lucas Mangope, the Bophuthatswana leader, had been deposed illegally, betrayed by Pretoria and the ANC [African National Congress]. "What they did to Bophuthatswana they want to do to KwaZulu," he said. "All I can say is that KwaZulu is not Bophuthatswana." The exchange between the two leaders served to switch the focus to KwaZulu as a possible flashpoint for further pre-election violence. Mr Buthelezi's mood cannot have been helped by rumours that senior members of Inkatha were considering defection to Mr de Klerk's National Party. Dr Ben Ngubane, an Inkatha executive member, fuelled the rumours when he said that Inkatha could still participate in next month's elections. "Last Friday's deadline is immaterial as to whether we decide to participate in the elections," he said in Durban. Inkatha's internal problems were only a small part of the fractures in the Freedom Alliance, the improbable grouping of white Rightwing parties and conservative homeland leaders . Gen Constand Viljoen, the former South African military commander, resigned from the Freedom Alliance after registering his Freedom Front party for the elections. At a hastily-convened meeting of the Alliance in the northern Cape city of Kimberley yesterday, Mr Mangope arrived to declare that he still considered himself the legal leader of Bophuthatswana. He said he was considering legal action against Pretoria. If nothing else, his presence at the meeting ended speculation that he was under some form of house arrest. Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the Conservative Party, said "a communist revolution" had taken place in Bophuthatswana. The events there had proved to all that Mr de Klerk could not be trusted, he said. The extremists on the Right were conspicuous by their absence. The neo-Nazi AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement], in particular, was licking its wounds after several hundred of its members were routed. Armed and uniformed AWB men had converged on Mmabatho, the Bophuthatswana capital, last week, ostensibly to support Mr Mangope's tottering administration. They were internationally humiliated when three of their number were shot dead by Bophuthatswana police-two executed by a policeman as they pleaded for their lives. Even so, Mr Eugene Terreblanche, the AWB leader, called a press conference in his home town and "Afrikaner heartland" of Ventersdorp in the western Transvaal yesterday. He declared his movement's intervention in the Bophuthatswana crisis "a shining victory". Another white extremist group, the Boerekommando, under its fanatical "commandant", Mr Willem Ratte, occupied an historic but derelict fort at Wonderboom north of Pretoria at the weekend, declaring they would "hold out to the death". They were still occupying the fort last night, despite being given assurances by the police and the Pretoria city council that they would be totally ignored as the area was remote, little used by the public and of "no significance whatsoever".
