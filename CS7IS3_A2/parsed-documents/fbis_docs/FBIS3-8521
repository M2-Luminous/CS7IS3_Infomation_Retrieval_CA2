Zdenko Vranjes, reporting for Croatian Radio: [Passage omitted] Examining the implementation of the Muslim-Croat political and military agreements, the Presidential Council of the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna reached the conclusion at its session today that the Croatian Defense Council had fully complied with the obligations from the cease-fire agreement and confirmed its permanent orientation to the cessation of hostilities. The Council said that the exchange of prisoners was a fundamental precondition for the continuation of the implementation of the agreement and the restoration of trust. The Presidential Council reiterated that the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina would enter the setting-up and the establishment of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, but only with the simultaneous setting-up and establishment of a confederation between the Republic of Croatia and the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. Lending its full support to a delegation of the Croat people at the Vienna negotiations led by [Council President] Kresimir Zubak, the Presidential Council at the same time stressed that the delegation was duty-bound to coordinate its views daily with other members of the Council who are not attending the negotiations. In negotiations, it is necessary to secure and emphasize the inherent sovereignty of the Croat grand counties with the precisely set out procedure for the realization of the right to self-determination, conclusions from the session say.
