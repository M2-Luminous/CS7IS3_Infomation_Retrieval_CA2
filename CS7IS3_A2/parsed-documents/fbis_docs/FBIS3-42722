The exclusive right to publish the interview was granted the ASSA-Irada Agency. [Akhundova] Esteemed speaker, did it come as a surprise to you that Geydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, offered you the position of head of parliament and did you personally have any doubts as to whether you should accept this offer or not? [Kuliyev] Of course, I could not make so responsible a decision on the spot. I had spoken with the president on this subject on more than one occasion and had weighed all the pros and cons. And I ultimately agreed because I am accustomed to independent work, I am accustomed to adopting responsible decisions, for which I myself have to answer first and foremost. I hope that in this office I will have more opportunities to influence a change in the course of events in the republic for the better. It was with this in mind that I agreed to let my name go forward. [Akhundova] It is said that your confirmation was preceded by quite a tumultuous discussion and that not all members of the Milli Majlis accepted your candidacy without question. This is shown by the results of the voting also: 38 in favor, six against. Your opponents voiced misgivings as to whether you had sufficient diplomatic, political, and, finally, legal experience and knowledge to lead parliament--after all, you have hitherto been involved mainly in industry and economic activity. How would you respond to your opponents? [Kuliyev] As though all our previous speakers had attended a school of diplomacy or had been professional politicians. As far as I am concerned, as director of the republic's biggest oil refinery and then vice premier in charge of the oil sector, I repeatedly took part in negotiations and in the elaboration of agreements with leading overseas companies. And would, what is more, frequently get into legal niceties which some members of parliament have not even dreamed of. In addition, I have been a member of parliament for about three years and have in this capacity on a par with everyone taken part in the preparation and adoption of several dozen laws regulating at the present time the most varied spheres of our society's political and economic life. As far as the lack of theoretical knowledge is concerned, first, this assertion does not correspond to reality either and, second, many at first sight fine and necessary laws have been adopted in parliament here in recent years which, however, have not worked, virtually, remaining to a large extent on paper only. And all because the people at the helm of administration of the state have not known how to make them work, how to put them into practice. It seems to me, therefore, that the experience of business leader, hands-on knowledge in the sphere of enterprise, and a precise vision of how the economy should be reformed and in which direction will help me make the right decisions. [Akhundova] The opposition's main demand is for early parliamentary elections, for the present parliament, in the opinion of the opposition parties and movements, is conclusively discredited. Your opinion on this score? How do you view this parliament, with which you will have to work? [Kuliyev] You know, I do not believe that this parliament is as bad as the opposition says. This demand--for early parliamentary elections--incidentally, was made before also, at the time of rule of the Elchibey regime. However, both Isa Gambar, former chairman of parliament, and other leaders were in no hurry to dissolve parliament, preferring to work with the "illegitimate," as they put it, Milli Majlis, for whose creation they had expended so much effort. I personally believe that our parliament has matured considerably on the professional level. It has performed a great deal of law-making work, and it is not, I repeat, its fault that the laws it has adopted have not worked. As was the president and his style of work, so also was parliament. I am sure that we can and should work with the present parliament through the end of its term. Not violating the constitution and not resorting to forcible measures. [Akhundova] What will be for you the priority in the office of speaker of parliament? [Kuliyev] The main thing in the economy today is to open the way to truly market relations and to give honest enterprise freedom in order to chop off at the root the causes of bribe-taking and corruption demoralizing our society. And the main thing in social and political life is to put an end as quickly as possible to the enervating, bloody war. I will work in this direction. All members of parliament also should step up their activity in this direction. [Akhundova] And what do you prefer--a continuation of the negotiating process with the Armenian side or tougher, power measures? [Kuliyev] Political dialogue and peace negotiations under the aegis of the international organizations should, of course, continue. At the same time I am for the creation of a strong professional army, which could serve as a dependable guarantor of the state independence and territorial integrity of our republic.
