Preface The economic growth, which started in late 1950s, invited the concentration of population into urban areas, and the volume of city water consumption shows an uneven distribution by area. For this reason, water is stored once in a dam or the like, then is used as the water source for city water as necessity arises; therefore, the water is not fresh enough, besides presents various problems, including the odor caused by algae, and the increased possibility of generation of trihalomethane (THM) due to the deposits of organic substances. Moreover, as compared with the ratio of population served with city water, that of sewage does not even reach a half. And, sewage often contains substances, that are unable to treat with ordinary sewage treatment method, which in turn invited the increase of materials that cannot be treated by the ordinary water purification method. For this reason, there arose the increased need of advanced water purification treatment; and, the construction of advanced water purification facilities is rapidly pushed ahead mostly in the Kanto and the Kansai areas. Under such circumstances, studies are being made about the ozone treatment for advanced water purification treatment. In this report will be explained the recycling of treated sewage. 2. Effects of Improving Water Quality by Ozone The most typical water quality improving effects by ozone may include (1) decolorization, (2) deodorizing, (3) disinfection, (4) prevention of adhesion of organic slime, and (5) decrease of COD. Figure 1 [not reproduced] shows the examples of decolorization and deodorizing by ozone of sewage after secondary treatment. In these examples, both hue and odor were reduced with as little as 5-10 mg/l. For recycling the treated sewage to landscaping water, the decrease of hue and odor becomes necessary; and, the effects of ozone treatment are recognized in this field too, and the method has already been applied to over a dozen places. If colitis germs are dispersed in water, and the ozone treatment test is realized, only as small as 0.25 mg/l of ozone would be required for almost completely killing germs whose initial bacterial count is 10[.sup]6[/] per milliliter. Figure 2 [not reproduced] shows the results of the ozone treatment test realized with the waste water after secondary treatment; the amount of ozone required for reducing the colitis germs increases to about 10 mg/l. This is because ozone reacted with contaminating materials; and, when disinfection is realized by ozone treatment, if the amount of contaminating materials is large, the amount of ozone required also increases. The latent heat energy of the sewage after secondary treatment is increasingly used for heating and cooling of building, and heating and cooling of a wader area. But, organic materials remaining in the sewage after secondary treatment or components of scale may cause organic slime or scale in the heat exchanger or the piping, thus preventing the collection of the necessary heating value. For this reason, preventing organic slimes or scales would be indispensable for the recycling of heat energy. For preventing the deposition of organic slime, about 5 mg/l of ozone may be injected intermittently (normally once or twice a day) for about 5 minutes once a day, thus the running cost may prove to be economical. If oxygen is used as the raw material gas, it is also possible to use an ozone generator, which generates and stores ozone, may be used, when no ozone injection is realized; in the case, the running cost and the initial cost would prove to be further lower. [sentence as published] 3. History of the Development of Ozone Generator Production of industrial ozone generators was started in Japan around 1965; but, ozone generators introduced then resulted in fairly high running cost and initial cost. Since then a series of improvements was made to the ozone generator in order to respond to the requirements about ozone at water plants, sewerage facility, human wastes treatment plants, and manufacturing plants, thus reaching to the ozone generator we know these days. Figure 3 [not reproduced] shows the change in the power consumption and that in the density of ozone generated. As compared with when 32.5 kWh power was needed, including auxiliary equipment, for producing 1 kg of ozone in 1972, at present the required power dropped to the 18 to 20 kW range, that means nearly 40 percent saving in energy. And, significant technological innovation was also achieved, as a result of which the density of ozone also nearly doubled from 10 g/Nm[.sup]3[/] to 20 g/Nm[.sup]3[/]. During the same period of time, of ozone generating capacity of each unit when air us used as raw material was 38 kg 03/hr, the ozone generator by using oxygen as raw material produced 60 kg 03/hr; and, the number of units produced already exceeded 1,000. Ozone generators currently available feature high efficiency, reduced space required, low price, high controllability, and high reliability. These advantages may be attributed, mainly to (1) Thanks to the high-frequency and high-density discharge by using the constant-current type inverter as the power source, the charge power per unit area of discharge tube could be largely increased; thus, the space required for the equipment could be reduced, and at the same time the density of ozone at the time of generation was raised, thus successfully reducing the amount of the raw material gas; (2) As the dimensional precision of glass electrode was remarkably improved, thus, making it possible to obtain smaller and ave [as published] discharge gap length, which in turn brought about optimum cooling effect in the discharge space and stable discharge, thus the ozone generation efficiency was improved; (3) Through the use of the constant-current type inverter, the control range of ozone generation volume expanded to 5 to 100 percent, besides the response property of generation volume regulation was improved; thus, promising superior response to load fluctuations in the volume of water or the quality of water; and, (4) Thanks to the development of an integral exclusive ozone generator and the energy-saving type air cooler/dryer unit, energy saving and space saving were made possible. 4. Ozone Reactors In order to cause ozone to effectively react to the object material, the following should be taken into account regarding the ozone reactor: (1) Generally speaking, the smaller the LV is, the better the ozone absorption efficiency (ozone use efficiency), and the smaller becomes the amount of discharge ozone. However, for reducing the LV, the reactor has to be increased in size; thus, the LV for sewage should be kept at 25 m/hr or so. (2) At the same amount of ozone generation, the higher the supply ozone density, the smaller becomes the volume of ozonized air; therefore, the value of LV may become smaller, thus the ozone absorption efficiency may be improved; but, the difference at 20 g/Nm[.sup]3[/] is small. (3) The greater the water depth, the higher the solubility of ozone into water, thus the ozone absorption rate is improved. But, the ozonization air pressure at the ozone generator output is 0.7 kg/cm2-G; for this reason, the water depth in many cases is 4 to 5 m. (4) The smaller the air bubble diameter, the higher the solubility of ozone into water, thus the ozone absorption efficiency is improved. However, in order to reduce the air bubble diameter, the diffuser pipe's air hole diameter should be made smaller, which in turn brings about a greater pressure loss; thus, the air bubble diameter is normally kept at 3mm or so. 5. Treatment of Residual Ozone For carrying out the ozone treatment, it is necessary to treat the residual ozone remaining in the ozone treatment water, and the discharged ozone (non-reacted ozone) that was not used, and remains in the gas as redundant ozone. (1) If there exists residual ozone of high density and high water volume, ozone comes out of water into the atmospheric air, causing strong odor. In such event, discharge ozone treatment should be realized by ventilating air with fan, etc. As the degradation time of residual ozone in water is short, thus it is necessary to let the residual ozone self-degrade by setting aside a sufficient retention time by using the retention time as needed, by taking into account the effects on to the following steps. (2) The discharge ozone (non-reacted ozone), that was not used in reaction and remains in the gas as redundant ozone should be treated. If no treatment is realized, there remains a strong odor of high-density ozone. Moreover, the discharge ozone in the air corrodes equipment, mainly the electric appliances, found nearby; and, if the discharge ozone is of high density, it may cause negative effects to human body. Activated carbon is normally used for treatment of the discharged ozone. Activated carbon is filled in the discharge ozone degradation column, and is replaced once every 3 to 4 months. The ozone degradation capacity of 1 g activated carbon is about 2 g of ozone for sewage. Ozone is discharged into air at the safe concentration level of 0.1 ppm or less from the outlet of the discharged ozone, manganese-based catalyst and activated carbon may be used together if the scale of the treatment facility is large. 6. Comparison of Ozone Treatment and Other Treatment Methods The ozone treatment brings about the water quality improvement effects and the disinfecting effects. When comparing the ozone treatment with other treatment methods, it will be necessary to select the object treatment method depending on the purpose: (1) For purpose of the water quality improvement, to compare with the treatment with activated carbon. (2) For disinfecting purpose, to compare with the NaClO (sodium hypochlorite) treatment or the ultraviolet ray treatment. 6.1 Comparison With Activated Carbon Treatment Method In addition to the decrease of the hue, odor, COD, and surface active agent, both ozone treatment and activated carbon treatment bring about the following effects: (1) Disinfection and increase of dissolved oxygen by the ozone treatment. (2) Decrease of BOD by the activated carbon treatment. For the water quality items, both methods have their own advantages and disadvantages; but, in many cases, both methods would bring about certain positive effects to such problem points as hue and odor. Moreover, the ozone treatment promises disinfecting effects, besides reducing space of installation, and lowering the cost of construction and maintenance. And, as the quality of the treated water does not change over the passage of time, the ozone treatment would be suitable, generally speaking, for the sewage water after secondary treatment. 6.2 Comparison With NaClO Treatment The NaClO treatment, thanks to its sustainable disinfecting effects, is used in many fields whether for city water or for sewage. But, the ozone treatment may promise a wide range of compound effects, in addition to disinfection. As compared with the chlorine-based disinfectants, ozone treatment offer stronger disinfecting power against bacteria, and stronger inactivating power against viruses. THM is generated, if NaClO treatment method is used, but it can be reduced through the ozone treatment; thus, the ozone treatment method is known to be superior. In the future studies will be made for the combined use of the two methods, or using the ozone treatment mainly for killing germs by making the best of its characteristics; and, using chlorine-based disinfectant, which is less likely to form THM, if prolonged disinfecting effects are expected. 6.3 Comparison With Ultraviolet Ray Method The ultraviolet ray treatment method, thanks to the easiness of installation, is often used for disinfecting clean water or air, which is not polluted much. However, for the ultraviolet ray treatment, the treatment effects may be halved if the lamp is stained; and, as the irradiation depth is shallow, a large number of lamps has to be set up. Furthermore, the lamp life is as short as half year to one year, besides durability is unpredictable; and, the lamp replacement cost is also high. As compared with this, the ozone treatment promises stable effects, besides being able to handle from small to large quantity. As the running cost is also lower, the ozone treatment method would be more acceptable as compared with the ultraviolet treatment method. 7. Examples of Advanced Sewage Treatment Facility Figure 4 [not reproduced] shows an example of the actual treatment flow diagram of the advanced sewage treatment (when used to the intermediate water). The advanced sewage treatment is often applied to the landscaping water, water used for hydrophilic (waterfront facility) purposes, intermediate water system, etc. But, from the viewpoint of preservation of water quality, the ozone treatment would be increasingly used for improving the quality of discharged water. The advanced sewage treatment facilities by using ozone currently operating in Japan are classified as follows by the purpose of application (main purposes): ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Landscaping water, hydrophilic (water-|9 facilities | |front) use water | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Improvement of quality of discharged |7 facilities | |water | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Intermediate water system |3 facilities | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Prevention of organic slime |2 facilities | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8. Conclusion The ozone treatment facility already has history of nearly 100 years in other nations; it has a history scarcely 20 years in Japan. However, in Japan where urban areas are highly populated, this requiring a large amount of water, the recycling of treated sewage would be indispensable. And, the expectation on the sewage treatment by using ozone will continue increasing. Thus, we are more than ready to push ahead with our R&D efforts regarding the ozone generator and the ozone treatment facility.
