The CDA [Christian Democratic Alliance] is crawling up laboriously, but remains far behind its fellow coalition member. The Christian Democrats' support, converted into seats, would put them at the same level as the VVD [People's Party for Freedom And Democracy]. D66 [Democrats 66] and Green Left are giving ground. This was shown in a NIPO [Netherlands Institute for Public Opinion and Market Analysis] opinion poll released on Monday [25 April] afternoon. If elections were held now, then the PvdA would get 35 seats (22.4 percent). Last week's NIPO poll gave the party led by Kok 33 seats. The CDA has managed to reverse the decline of recent weeks into a cautious recovery. The NIPO poll confirms the upward turn indicated by the Interview pollsters, although the CDA's gain remains modest. Compared with a week ago the Christian Democrats managed to win one seat and climb to 29 seats. This takes them to the same number of seats as the VVD. In percentage terms the CDA (with 18.6 percent) is still slightly behind the liberals (with 18.8 percent). D66 had to give further ground, according to the NIPO poll. The party could count on 25 seats compared with 26 a week ago, according to the latest poll. A few weeks ago D66 stood at 28 seats in the opinion polls. The strong loss in support of the CD [Center Democrats] is a striking feature of the NIPO poll. According to the figures published on Monday Janmaat's party would gain four seats. Last week the CD would have gained seven seats. The senior citizens' parties are holding their support. The AOV [General Union of Senior Citizens] is stable at five seats while the +\55 Union will also gain one seat, according to the NIPO poll. The leading candidates of the four main parties did not discuss the new opinion poll in detail. They concentrated more on the question of who will presently form a cabinet with whom. The PvdA leader pointed to the big differences in the programs of his party and the VVD. Therefore he did not want to form a purple coalition with this party and D66 simply with the goal of putting the CDA in the opposition. The CDA's leading candidate Brinkman indicated that he was happy that Kok was not further accentuating the differences. VVD leader Bolkestein is continuing to insist that one of the two present coalition partners should go into opposition, since both the CDA and PvdA are facing heavy losses of respectively 25 and 14 seats, according to opinion polls. D66's leading candidate, Van Mierlo, continues to support a purple coalition. If that does not succeed, then his party is ready to cooperate with another coalition. As the most central party of the center, D66 appears to be in the comfortable position that it is indispensable for a three-party cabinet. On Monday the NCW [Netherlands Christian Trade Union Federation] attacked the positions of the two leading PvdA candidates, Kok and Wallage. It rejected Kok's call for a long-term central agreement and Wallage's comments on redundancy rights.
