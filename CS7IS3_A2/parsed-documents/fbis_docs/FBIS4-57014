FBIS4-57014 "drlat092_a_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-092 Daily Report 12 May 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Hoarders To Be Prosecuted Regardless of `Backgrounds' Hoarders To Be Prosecuted Regardless of `Backgrounds' FL1105233494 FL1105233494 BFN [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 1600 GMT on 11 May features the program, "Straight Talk," with host Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE and guest Maribel Acosta from Cuban television. In relation to Decree-Law 148, Rodriguez opens the discussion by asking: How are we going to identify the money hoarders? Acosta answers that, "the measures against the money hoarders is the only popular, truly popular measure of the group of measures being implemented to heal national finances. This is not news. It has been clearly stated that the other measures are not popular measures, that they involve sacrifices, and the people's understanding is needed." Acosta adds that other measures cannot be implemented without first implementing measures against the money hoarders. Rodriguez adds that the money hoarders are corrupt, in addition to being great corruptors. Returning to how to identify money hoarders, Rodriguez states: "We would have to check with the authorities as well as the police. I believe they have been working at this for awhile. A year ago, I was told certain files were being put together to identify who these people were and how they operated." Acosta points out that the decree-law mentions "disproportionate amounts in relation to legal income." Acosta adds: "Official reports reveal that 80 percent of the Cuban population has direct or indirect ties with the black market, and this is illegal." Rodriguez goes on to say that the decree tries to confront those "people who are millionaires" and that these people are well known. Rodriguez adds that in El Cerro Municipality, "a very modest area, where most of the neighborhoods are humble, and where most people live even below a modest level," he witnessed a money hoarder's son receive privileged treatment and found it offensive. Rodriguez stresses that "this virus is an ulcer that is almost becoming a social class" and is developing its own corresponding ideology. Rodriguez adds that hoarders "live differently and think differently." Acosta adds: "Many people have told me that this should have been done a long time ago. This reveals the essence of the people's opinion to which you referred. This is the most popular measure. Therefore, it is necessary to implement this measure quickly, correctly, in an organized manner, and fairly in every sense and in every sector, upon whomever it ought to be implemented because if this is not done and our principles are not preserved, which evidently this decree is trying to do, then it demoralizes the people, demoralizes the Revolution, and could demoralize it to the point of becoming the beginning of a gradual erosion of power. If the Revolution loses its power, then the essence of what we are discussing becomes meaningless -- if measures are not taken against profiteers in a country were measures of adjustment and strong economic measures are being taken." Rodriguez points out that the actions ought to be drastic, but implemented without fear. He closes by saying: "I believe no one should be exempt, no matter who the individuals are, and regardless of their backgrounds. I believe the law has to be applied to anyone who has acted illegally, has become wealthy illegally -- the decree specifies this clearly -- not only through theft and illegal operations, but also through embezzlement within state entities or entities with links to the state. I believe there are going to be such cases. If this is done thoroughly, it is likely that such cases, which we might even lament, will come up."
