The report is expected to be finalized by the headquarters' Housing and Real Estate Policies Subcommittee before the end of this month. The advisory report calls for relaxation of industrial standards so that the Japanese construction market can accept building materials approved by foreign standards. Regarding real estate development, the advisory panel takes a prudent stance toward a sweeping relaxation of regulations on building volumes. On the other hand, the report advocates a review of local government authorities for controlling land development projects, noting local government bodies are excessively strict to developers. The Housing and Real Estate Policies Subcommittee has already submitted the draft report to the headquarters. Hereafter, the draft will be finalized by cabinet ministers composing the Administration Reform Promotion Headquarters, and the final draft will be incorporated in the outline of external economic measures which will be released in the end of June. The subcommittee's draft report is calling for "deregulation measures focused on urban areas," and, in tangible measures, deregulation requests are made in 39 fields. With respect to housing construction policies, the report proposes the following deregulation measures: 1) international standards and inspection data from foreign countries should be broadly approved for accepting foreign-made building materials; 2) Japanese standards, such as the Japan Industrial Standards (JIS) and Japan Agricultural Standards (JAS), should be relaxed; and 3) water service departments and energy supply companies should review their contractor systems to break certain local contractors' monopoly for service work. The advisory report is likely to arouse controversy on its note that local government bodies' development guidance policies have "some excessive restrictions." On that ground, the report says local governments "must stop" allotting sewerage work charges to developers. Local governments are likely to react strongly to the proposal considered "lenient to developers."
