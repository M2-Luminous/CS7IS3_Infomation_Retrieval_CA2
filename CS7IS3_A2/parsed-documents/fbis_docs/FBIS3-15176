The chairman of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament did not specify what he meant by this. He went on to say that "some forces in the world today want the confrontation in former Yugoslavia to continue." The Bosnian Serbs' decision to allow Tuzla airport to be opened for humanitarian aid deliveries "knocks the ground from under the feet of those forces." During his meeting with journalists, Karadzic said that Bosnian Serbs are ready to work for a peaceful solution to the Bosnian crisis and that mechanisms for achieving this goal are being discussed in the talks in Moscow. In reply to a question, the president of the Serb Republic said that the Serb side is ready to join the agreement on a federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina signed in Washington by the Croats and Muslims, "if it is in our interest." Karadzic supported an initiative by Russian President Boris Yeltsin for a summit meeting of Russia, the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany. This afternoon Radovan Karadzic had talks in the Russian Ministry of Defense with Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov.
