FR941026-2-00022 FR941026-2-00016 [Docket No. TM95&hyph;3&hyph;21&hyph;000] Columbia Gas Transmission Corp.; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff October 20, 1994. Take notice that on October 17, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets: Eighth Revised Sheet No. 25 Eighth Revised Sheet No. 26 Eighth Revised Sheet No. 27 Eighth Revised Sheet No. 28 The proposed tariff sheets bear an issue date of October 17, 1994 and proposed effective dates of November 1, 1994. Columbia states that the instant filing revises the base TCRA rates to (a) reflect the impact of paying an exit fee of $37,556,308, plus a pre-petition administrative claim of $3,498,728, inclusive of interest, to Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) on October 7, 1994, (b) remove $34,701,618 of annual demand costs included in the current TCRA rates that would have been paid under the 858 contracts with Tennessee but for the Exit Fee Settlement, (c) flow through a refund of $13,708,920 (inclusive of interest) received from Tennessee pursuant to a Commission order issued in Tennessee's Docket No. RP91&hyph;203, and (d) eliminate the portion of the estimated capacity release revenue attributable to Tennessee. Columbia requests waiver of the 30-day notice requirement and also requests waiver of the Commission's requirement in a September 30, 1994 order in Tennessee's Docket No. RP91&hyph;203 that it make a special compliance filing to adjust its rates to reflect any future refunds in that docket, and requests permission to return any future refund through the normal operation of the tariff since the refund would only be demand charges for one month amounting to less than $500,000. Columbia states that copies of the filing were served upon Columbia's wholesale customers and interested state regulatory commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before October 27, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of Columbia's filings are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26524 Filed 10&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
