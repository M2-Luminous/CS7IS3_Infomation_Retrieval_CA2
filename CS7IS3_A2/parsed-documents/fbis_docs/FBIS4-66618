"Some were wearing military uniforms." "There were vehicles in which the death row inmates were driven away." "No. There weren't any vehicles." Even if they seem contradictory, these reports by escapees--who were either arrested or taken into custody--tell us one thing at least. Or rather they confirm something. The breakout was carefully organized down to the tiniest detail. We spoke with five of the recaptured prisoners. [sentence as published] Their statements are more than eloquent. M.M. (Serving a Life Sentence): "Get Out or Die" [Benmohamed] How did you escape? [M.M.] I have been in jail for three years. I was sentenced to life in prison. I was alone in my cell, I had just broken the fast and heard shouts of "Allahu Akbar." For me, that was the usual thing, so I didn't try to find out anything else. Suddenly there were shouts. Some people were breaking the locks on the cells. One of them opened the door to my cell with some keys and he spoke to me saying: "Get out!" He had a Kalashnikov rifle and I was standing opposite him, next to the bed. I asked him: "Where?" He answered: "The mountains." "Why?" I asked. He then loaded his weapon and told me: "Either you get out or I shoot you. You have a choice. It's up to you to decide but do it soon or I'll decide for you." What should I do? I got out. Once I was at the main entrance gate, another armed man pointed out the road I should take and repeated "go up to the mountains." There were a lot of us. I was among the last ones. [Benmohamed] Did you notice any vehicles in front of the prison's entrance gate? [M.M.] No, no vehicle. [Benmohamed] Then what happened? [M.M.] A few minutes later, maybe a half hour, we stopped running to rest. [Benmohamed] How many of you were there? [M.M.] Between 50 and 60 prisoners. We were in the middle of the forest. One of the armed men asked us to split into two groups. In one there were those who had been sentenced by the special courts and in the other the common criminals. Then he spoke to the common criminals saying: "As of now, we don't know you; may Allah help you." He was the oldest one, 35 or 36 years old. He had a beard. He was wearing a prison guard uniform. He set off together with the men who were accompanying him and the special court prisoners. As for us, we went in our direction. We walked day and night in the mountains. There were 10 of us. We consulted one another. On the second day, the eve of the Aid, I couldn't fast. We had nothing to eat. On Sunday I suggested to my companions that we become prisoners. We were eating grass. They didn't agree with me because they were afraid. We were in the Ain Touta mountains. As of that moment, my companions began to distrust me. In the evening, I pretended to go off to tend to my bodily functions in the forest and left them. I walked for a long time at night. I was cold and hungry. I made a wood fire to warm up. I was very tired. On Tuesday, at dawn, I saw a military roadblock. I came down from the mountains and went straight towards the soldiers. I raised my arms as a sign that I meant no harm. I became a prisoner. That morning I was introduced to the prosecutor. I have just been sent to the Lambese prison. Between yesterday, when I was an escapee, and today, when I'm a prisoner, it's the difference between life and death. These aren't human beings. [Benmohamed] Why? [M.M.] They get us out of prison, they send us to the mountains, then they leave us in the middle of nowhere. Nothing to eat, no notion of the road, no money...No. I was forced to escape. Either escape or die. Anyone else in my shoes would have done the same thing. That's what I told the prosecutor. I wasn't the only escapee in his office. There are others who are waiting to be questioned. [Benmohamed] Have they become prisoners? [M.M.] Some yes. Most were arrested. There are a lot of them. B.M. (Sentenced by the Special Court in Constantine, the "Fax Network"): "Why Escape?" [Benmohamed] Could you say why you took part in the breakout? [B.M.] I was sentenced by the special court in Constantine as part of the fax network. I taught computer science at the university of Batna. I've got three years left to serve. I didn't take part directly in the escape. [Benmohamed] But you're an escapee... [B.M.] Yes, I'm an escapee. I got out of the prison because I had problems. The prison gates were open for everyone. I had to leave the prison just like everyone else. Together with all the prisoners who had been sentenced by the special courts, I was in room 10. We heard rounds of gunfire; we started to look through the windows and we didn't understand. The lights were out for about a half hour; then the door to the room was opened by an armed man who told us: "All your companions have gone; you have to leave the room." So we all left, no problems, no obstacles, all the doors to the cells and the prison were open, everyone got out without any problems. I did the same thing but I understood that it wasn't normal. I didn't want to have any problems. [Benmohamed] Did you notice something unusual on the day of the breakout? Was it planned for that day? [B.M.] Everything was normal. Personally I wasn't warned. I'm convinced it was the same for my fellow prisoners. We were all thinking about a general amnesty on the eve of the Aid. Nobody, as far as I know, was informed with regard to this escape. [Benmohamed] What happened once you were outside? [B.M.] The prisoners were sent towards the mountains. There were a lot of people. I too went in the direction of the mountains but I stopped just behind the houses of Tazoult. Two hours later, once there was nobody else around, I decided to return to the prison. From afar, I saw that the prison gates were shut. There were also some gendarmes, policemen, and soldiers. I was afraid. So I took the Batna road. On the road I met a police car. I turned myself over to them and I spent the night at the police station. [Benmohamed] Why did you turn yourself over to the policemen? [B.H.] First, I've been sentenced to a short term. So why should I escape and risk a longer one? Second, I was expecting an amnesty. What the newspapers are writing proves that the situation is going to improve with the arrival of the president. So why should I escape? I'm not convinced about escaping, about creating anarchy and experiencing other problems. That's my opinion. When he came the president said two words to us: "Fraternal dialogue." That's the main thing. I'm convinced, so why push? It's better to wait for a solution for everyone. Furthermore, I didn't want to leave because the mountain isn't easy. You need an organization and I'm not part of it. I don't have any weapons. To go means dying. I have five children. I chose to analyze the situation. [Benmohamed] Were your fellow prisoners of the same opinion? [B.M.] Some were. These were university teachers and engineers who were expecting a pardon. They were expecting a rahma. They were even afraid of even more serious problems. I should mention to you that these were prisoners sentenced by the special courts, all for terms of under five years. They have nothing to do with the blood that's been shed. The others think the president should demonstrate his sincerity and accessibility by, for example, issuing an amnesty to the prisoners to encourage dialogue. I'm speaking of amnesty on behalf of prisoners who have no link to crimes connected with terrorism. Who forced this multiparty system of which we're the victims? They wanted to imitate Europe. There are other problems to solve. Personally I'm back in prison while my children have been left to themselves. B.M. (Sentenced to a 12-Year Term): "I Turned Myself Over to the Gendarmerie" [Benmohamed] What happened at the time of the breakout? [B.M.] I'm the No. 2 man in room 20, where there were only special court prisoners. Two or three minutes after the Maghreb, there were gunshots. We thought there was a revolt in room 11. Certain prisoners told us: "No. The brothers are here." [Benmohamed] In your opinion, did they know about the escape? [B.M.] Perhaps. You can't tell. No one trusts anyone. There were 42 of us. Next, there was some noise, some shouts, and some rounds of gunfire. One of us broke a bed to break the lock with an iron bar. That didn't help. Some of us prevented him from breaking down the door. Through the window we saw a guard run upstairs. Behind him there were some armed men. We called to them to open our door. They asked us to wait. We were the last ones to leave. Then we escaped. When I got to the entrance gate to the prison I saw a Golf that was taking one of the death row inmates away from the infirmary. He had lost both his legs in an altercation before his arrest. It seems he's their chief. Everyone was in a rush. I saw the death row prisoners in the vehicles. As for me, I left on foot. With me were only special court prisoners sentenced to detention. Some were accompanied by cars up to the edge of the forest. I decided to part company with them because I knew it would end badly. I slipped between the houses. I met a men I asked to show me where the police headquarters were. You could hear rounds of gunshots everywhere. He advised me to flee saying they were going to kill me. This man was one of the attackers and I didn't know it. I was going to tell him that the prison had been attacked but I shut up when I saw he was dressed strangely. He asked me if I was a brother and I answered that I was. Then he pointed behind the buildings to show me the mountains. I pretended I was following. Once I had escaped I hid. Then I recognized some guards in town. I went up to them and I explained things to them. Finally the gendarmerie came. I became a prisoner. [Benmohamed] Did you notice anything abnormal before the breakout? [B.M.] No. That morning some prisoners were pardoned. Those who were in the same room with me weren't affected. They said they would leave the prison by force just as they had been jailed. We'll get out by force, they said. S.D. (Serving a Life Sentence): "I Followed Them, I Was Forced To" [S.D.] At the breaking of the fast, there were rounds of gunfire and gunshots. We went to the windows. I saw the prisoners leave and run. I hadn't understood anything because we saw people wearing uniforms and carrying weapons. They opened the door to our room and told us to get out. We were all special court prisoners. As we left the prison, we were sent towards the moutnains. As we were walking, there was an armed man practically every 100 meters. I couldn't follow them because my leg hurt. I tried to flee them. I left because I was afraid they'd kill me. After 2 km, we stopped. One of them spoke to us. He told us that we weren't obligated to follow him to the mountains. He gave 200 Algerian dinars to anyone who didn't want to go up to the mountains. I thought and I decided to go to Batna. I walked through the night and I hid in the countryside. It was cold and I was hungry. My leg hurt. In the morning in Batna, I bought some bread and I hid in order to eat. I couldn't fast... Truly, I was afraid when I saw all those armed men. I'm not trying to justify myself; it was the truth.
