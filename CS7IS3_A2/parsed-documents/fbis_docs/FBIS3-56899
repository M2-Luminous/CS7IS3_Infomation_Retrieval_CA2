He has switched from peremptory accusations against Ukraine to the search for forms of cooperation. Asked whether he is not afraid that Kiev will block the second round of elections, Yu. Meshkov answered: "I trust Leonid Kravchuk very much; he is one of the most eminent politicians of the present day, and he knows how to settle the situation in Ukraine and abroad. He has stated that the actual disposition of forces in the Crimea precludes the use of strong-arm methods to influence the situation, and I believe that he is speaking sincerely." Yuriy Meshkov stressed: "The people of Crimea have voted for change, for a departure from the old nomenklatura-based laws of life, and for a close alliance with Russia" and the CIS countries. This will make it possible to improve relations between Kiev, Simferopol, and Moscow. He said that by this vote the people have legitimized the institution of the presidency in the Crimea and that Kiev's dissatisfaction with the first round results is a "reaction to personalities, not to the legislation and constitution of the Crimea.... It is a short-term dissatisfaction and will soon evaporate."
