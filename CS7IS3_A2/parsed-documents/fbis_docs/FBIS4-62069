The head of the government, who sent a letter defending his position on "currency" issues to the Ukrainian president, is confident of this. KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI has the complete text of this letter and cites its main provisions: "The exchange rate of the Ukrainian karbovanets, which was artificially reduced by the Ukrainian Interbank Stock Exchange, did not correspond to the purchasing power of these currencies [as published], because the stock exchange did not conduct actual purchases or sales, while the agreements, which were concluded there, accounted only a percentage of the currency turnover in our state." This is how Yukhym Leonidovich explained the reason for shutting down the stock exchange. However, the decision to perform obligatory sales of obtained hard currency -- according to the fixed rate -- is aimed at "deducting part of the subsidies that enterprises receive for exporting products from the state budget, which will not in any way encroach upon the interests of export enterprises." What kind of subsidies does he mean? Yukhym Leonidovich clarifies: "In 1992-93, the National Bank issued huge loans to the Ukrainian Government to subsidize industry, transportation, and agriculture. A considerable portion of these subsidies was used to produce products for export. So, when exporters sold products for convertible currency, they received additional profits because of state subsidies, the falling karbovanets exchange rate, and exemptions from VAT and stock holdings." To whisk through the Cabinet of Ministers the decision on a karbovanets exchange rate, Yu. L. Zvyahilskyy clarified his commitment to the issue -- how to put it, in advance -- to the Ukrainian president. What is its essence? "Due to the fixed karbovanets exchange rate, the agricultural sector will be provided with fuel and lubricants, spare parts, and pesticides to carry out the spring sowing campaign. We managed to stabilize prices -- including those on food, fuel, and lubricants -- on the domestic market. The monthly inflation rate fell from some 50 percent in 1993 to 19 percent in January 1994. The demand for karbovanetses on the Moscow Currency Stock Exchange remains high. The fixed karbovanets exchange rate promises stable conditions for buying critical imported goods, primarily, energy resources and timber used in mining for the coal industry. A stable currency rate creates opportunities to decrease production costs and increase production for the domestic market. The latest factor encourages the purchasing power of the national currency and stabilizes the state's financial system. In addition, a fixed currency rate stabilizes prices on products of export enterprises, which makes it possible to conclude long-term treaties on the delivery of Ukrainian goods to the global market... It also makes it possible to attract foreign investment to the Ukrainian economy...." Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk: "We Should Take Into Consideration the Opinion of the New Supreme Council and the Government on the Fixed Karbovanets Exchange Rate...." This is how Leonid Makarovich answered my "currency" question when he was in our editorial offices. The current system of a fixed currency rate prompted the situation when 1993 currency profits in Ukraine -- according to estimates made by Ukrainian and foreign experts -- constituted 20-40 percent of the expected total, that is, some 60-80 percent of the earned currency remained abroad. What is your and your advisers' opinion on a fixed currency exchange rate? Do you know how to bring back the money -- earned by Ukrainian exporters -- which is currently not doing anything to help Ukraine? This issue is of a broad nature, stressed Leonid Makarovich. Until now, there has been no single opinion on this issue. Even the National Bank does not have one. When representatives of the National Bank of Ukraine, other interested organizations, members of the Cabinet of Ministers, and myself held a meeting, our viewpoints differed once again. The current economic situation -- the decreasing inflation rate, cheapening of some products -- also speaks in favor of a fixed exchange rate. Therefore, we cannot simply reject this idea outright. All agree that when we have no national currency (we really lack it because the karbovanets is a deficient currency) we cannot move to a currency market. There exists the opinion that to introduce a national currency, we should cover it in our financial and credit relations. The president's advisers support the following position: We require more freedom. In my opinion, before we adopt a money market, a fixed, or a floating exchange rate, we should analyze all of the pros and cons. One of the arguments against this is that we should change the scale of prices and salaries and financial indexes in the national economy. By the way, we should introduce extraordinary increases -- by two or three times. That is, the scale of cash and pricing mechanisms should be changed. The budget should also be changed. However, it has already been adopted. It would be necessary to consider the opinion of the new Supreme Council and the government, which will be nominated by it. In my opinion, this is a problem of our tomorrow. Ukrainian National Bank Chairman Viktor Yushchenko: "Given Hyperinflation, the Policy of the Fixed Currency Rate Will Make Ukraine a Multibillion Debtor!" This answer, please note -- which is diametrically opposed to the opinion of the head of the government -- was contained in a letter from the chief banker. He addressed this letter to Andrey Pecherov, former chairman of the legislative commission for planning, budget, and prices. A stormy discussion of Yushchenko's letter, according to UNIAN, did not resolve this issue. The president's commission will probably hold a roll-call vote on a fixed exchange rate in the legislature. It would not be difficult to guess the results because there will not be many brave men "to turn the steering wheel by 20 points" from Zvyahilskyy's course. However, Viktor Yushchenko's position will not be the last in legislative debates. "The use of the fixed currency exchange rate" when hyperinflation is in full swing, according to the Ukrainian National Bank chairman, "will lead to a further shift from the true market rate. The longer the fixing period, the higher the difference in currency rates." "According to IMF experts, the volume of currency means, which did not return to Ukraine in 1993, stood at $1.3 billion. According to trade statistics from the United States, Germany, and Italy, the volume of Ukrainian exports and imports to these states is four times more than those registered in the customs statistics of Ukraine. "Let us take into consideration the fact that the trade in currency to a specific group of importers at the lower rate simply provides them with additional income. The result of this policy is as follows: Given the situation of hyperinflation, the policy of fixing a currency rate, the limiting of exports and increases in imports will make Ukraine a multibillion debtor, because it liquidates the only source of currency generation -- the production of goods for export..."
