In the recent talks, the ministry has become convinced that there is no problem with the United States' insecticidal and disinfecting technologies, as well as with its inspection methods. A similar judgment has been passed by the United States on the Japan-produced apples. Accordingly, it has become certain that the ban on trade regarding apples between the two countries will be lifted. The MAFF intends to hold public hearings during the coming summer and to decide on formal lifting of the ban by autumn.
