In Bonn, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) hoped for the continuation of the "excellent cooperation, above all in the European integration process," with his new counterpart, Antonio Martino. However, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, deputy chairwoman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, said that the appointment of five neofascist ministers is "a shame for Italy and Europe." The Christian Social Union is concerned that "Mussolini's grandsons" were able "to gain part of the power." [passage omitted]
