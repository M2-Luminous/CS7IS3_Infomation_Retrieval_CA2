She arrived here yesterday [15 February] to receive the doctor honoris causa degree of the St. St. Cyril and Methodius University of Veliko Turnovo (northcentral Bulgaria). We considered the problem of former Yugoslavia sharing the opinion that NATO's ultimatum is absolutely necessary because the bloodshed there must be stopped and because it is high time that the international community prove it can really do something to save the civil population, Prof. Suessmuth told reporters at the Sofia Airport before her departure. Prof. Suessmuth and Dr. Zhelev discussed Bulgarian-German relations. After the meeting President Zhelev told reporters that Germany's economic presence in Bulgaria should be felt stronger. Germany can do this using the potential of its large companies, Dr. Zhelev said. Bulgaria's hope was expressed at the meeting that Germany would show understanding for its wish to conclude a debt settlement agreement with the London Club the soonest possible. Meeting yesterday, Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth and National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov considered the situation in ex-Yugoslavia and the possibilities of expanding German investments in Bulgaria.
