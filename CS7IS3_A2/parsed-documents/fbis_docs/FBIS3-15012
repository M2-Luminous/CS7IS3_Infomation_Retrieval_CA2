Also located in that building are the independent TURAN NEWS AGENCY, Democracy Development Fund, Cultural Fund "Yurd", the Independent Centre for Economic and Political Researches and the International Centre "Polyglot". During the past three days the police, armed with machine guns, as well as employees of the Procurator's Office of the republic, continued their searches of offices in the building, and checked people entering and exiting the building. Today the journalists of "AZADLYG" and TURAN NEWS AGENCY held a joint press conference and provided details about the arbitrary lawlessness of the police to foreign diplomats and journalists. Having found nothing in the rooms and basements of the building, the police and the employees of the Procurator's office were compelled to leave. Earlier they had said that "journalists hid weapons and ammunition in the rooms." But having found nothing, the policemen seized several issues of TURAN daily news reports and several issues of independent newspaper, CHESHME ("MOSAIC"). Due to the lawlessness by the police, the employees of Turan news agency and the remaining organizations located in the building were unable to work for the entire day.
