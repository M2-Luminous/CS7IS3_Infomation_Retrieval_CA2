Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa agreed that the government will settle the divisive tax-cut issue by midday Tuesday, announce its delayed economic stimulus package in the evening and meet its Friday deadline for the Finance Ministry to craft its fiscal 1994 budget draft, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi takemura said. After a day of fruitless meetings and dashed compromise plans, coalition leaders agreed in the evening to essentially scrap Hosokawa's plan to change the 3 percent consumption tax to a 7 percent "National Welfare Tax" in 1997, sources said. Instead, they will meet at 10:30 A.M. Tuesday to deal with setting up a consultative body of coalition members to decide within a year on funding the income tax cut, a key component of the stimulus package, the sources said. Divorcing the stimulative tax cut from a hike in indirect taxes has been a key demand of the coalition's biggest member, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which has threatened to quit the coalition if Hosokawa did not revise the welfare tax scheme he announced early Thursday. But the powerful Finance Ministry has been dead-set against the decoupling, insisting as late as Monday afternoon that any law cutting income taxes must explicitly set out the timing and rate of the offsetting tax hike. Despite Hosokawa's apparent confidence in getting the budget draft out as planned by Thursday, when he leaves for a Washington summit with President Bill Clinton, the Finance Ministry indicated that the prolonged bickering was straining an already tight schedule. The U.S. Government has repeatedly called for Japan to spur its domestic demand to boost imports and cut Tokyo's huge trade surplus. But the ministry will not be able to complete its draft budget for the coming fiscal year by Friday if the coalition does not settle the funding issue Tuesday, a ministry official said. As it is, the coalition's failure to agree Monday on funding the cuts will make it "very difficult" for the government's Tax Commission to complete its final tax reform report for fiscal 1994 by its Wednesday deadline, which could affect the timing of the draft budget, a senior ministry tax bureau official said. On the other hand, SDP leaders indicated approval of the plan to set up a consultative body to seek a funding agreement within a year, a plan that closely resembles the SDP's latest compromise proposal. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met with other party leaders and appeared ready to accept the plan, but he chose to hold off on formal approval until the government made its next move, sources said. The agreement on the 6 trillion yen in tax cuts, of which 5.3 trillion would be income and residential tax reductions, while putting off the thorny question of funding, followed three meetings of coalition leaders Monday and vain attempts to placate the SDP, sources said. The SDP rebuffed proposals through the day. The party has said even talking about tax hikes is bad for the teetering economy and that any eventual revenues must be earmarked for welfare-related spending. The day's proposals included one ordered by Hosokawa and crafted by his colleague Hiroyuki Sonoda, leader of the alliance of Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Japan New Party, combining a new indirect tax with the tax cuts. In the rush to cobble together new plans, Hosokawa summoned Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to direct him to draw up a new ministry plan, then phoned Fujii minutes later to explain that the ministry was instead to help with the Sonoda plan, a bewildered ministry official said in the afternoon. When the SDP balked at the Sonoda compromise, the secretary of coalition member party Komeito, Yuichi Ichikawa, stepped in with the plan that sealed the evening's half-agreement, sources said. Under the plan, the name "welfare tax" would be scrapped and the consultative body would try to "deal responsibly" with the funding within a year, the sources said. It remained unclear how the Finance Ministry and Tax Commission would respond. As late as Monday afternoon, both continued to blast the idea of cutting taxes now with only the vague promises of politicians as collateral for repayment. A ministry official said in the afternoon there was no change in the ministry's stance. Fujii has repeatedly rejected any such unspecified funding scheme as "untreated," using a word usually reserved for raw sewage or human incontinence.
