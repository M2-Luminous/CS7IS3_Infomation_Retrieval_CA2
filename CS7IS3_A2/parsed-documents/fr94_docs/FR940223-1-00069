FR940223-1-00069 FR940223-1-00014 Description of Changes GSA proposes the following changes: 1. Most of the existing regulatory instructions regarding the use of MAS and single award Federal Supply Schedules will be deleted from the FPMR and FIRMR. 2. GSA regulations will not require agencies to place orders against future MAS contracts. 3. The current requirement that an ordering activity publicize in the Commerce Business Daily its intent to place an order against an MAS contract for federal information processing (FIP) resources valued in excess of $50,000 will be eliminated. This requirement is the product of regulation, (i.e., order synopsis not required by statute) for MAS contracting, and is inconsistent with GSA's efforts to empower its customers, and streamline and maximize the efficiency of the program. 4. GSA will not dictate an across-the-board Maximum Order Limitation (MOL) for MAS schedules. Instead, contracting officers will establish MOL's on a schedule-by-schedule basis. Contracting officers will set MOL's at levels appropriate for negotiation of volume purchasing prices. 5. GSA will generally award MAS contracts as indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity type contracts. Indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity type MAS contracts will normally obligate the Government to purchase a minimum amount during the contract term. Contractors must deliver up to the MOL for each delivery order they receive. 6. The clause entitled ``Price Reductions'' will be modified to delete paragraph (c), ``Price Reductions to Federal Agencies''. The modified clause will be incorporated into the GSAR. Other MAS provisions and clauses will be amended as necessary to reflect revised ordering procedures. 7. GSA will streamline existing ordering procedures and state them in the form of guiding principles. The resulting non-regulatory guidance will read as follows: a. GSA awards Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contracts for a variety of commercial products and services at prices determined to be fair and reasonable. The administrative cost of placing a MAS order can be significantly lower than purchasing by other means. Accordingly, for orders of minimal dollar value (e.g., $10,000 or below) ordering activities are given wide latitude to order items at those prices that represent the best value for the money. b. To reasonably ensure that a selection meets the agency's needs at the lowest overall cost before placing an MAS order of significant dollar value (e.g., greater than $10,000) an ordering activity should: (1) Consider reasonably available information about products offered under MAS contracts; this standard is met if the ordering activity does the following: •Consider products and prices contained in any GSA MAS automated information system; (e.g., Information Resources Management_On-line Schedule System, Federal Supply Service_Automated Product Listing Service); or •If automated information is not available, review at least 3 price lists. (2) Make reasonable efforts to compare differing functions, performance characteristics and prices of MAS items. The nature and degree of such comparisons should be commensurate with the value of the order. The agency's administrative costs should be considered in making a best value determination. (3) Give preference to the items of small business and/or labor surplus area concerns by following the order of priority in FAR 14.407&hyph;6 when two or more items at the same delivered price will meet an ordering activity's needs. c. MAS contractors will not be required to pass on to all schedule users a price reduction extended only to an individual agency for a specific order. There may be circumstances where an ordering activity finds it advantageous to request a price reduction, such as where the ordering activity finds that a schedule product is available elsewhere at a lower price, or where the quantity of an individual order clearly indicates the potential for obtaining a reduced price. d. Ordering activities should document MAS ordering files in accordance with internal agency practices. Agencies should keep documentation to a minimum. Dated: December 28, 1993. Richard H. Hopf, III, Associate Administrator for Acquisition Policy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3706 Filed 2&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;61&hyph;M
