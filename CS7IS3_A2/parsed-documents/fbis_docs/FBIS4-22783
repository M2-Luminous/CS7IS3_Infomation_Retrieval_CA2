Degtyarev: "Three Misfortunes in Russia: Fools, Roads, and Taxes"] [Text] The chief misfortunes in present-day Russia are three: fools, roads, and taxes. Taxes, moreover, are looked on as a misfortune not only by the economy, which has been assessed to the max, but also by the government, which has been utterly unable to collect them and so keeps coming up with new ones. The three misfortunes seem primordially given us. Let us turn, for example, to the era of Ivan the Terrible, since just like our blessed perestroyka, it developed smoothly into a great Time of Troubles. Over the third quarter of the sixteenth century, sovereign assessments increased by a factor of 10. The peasantry answered this increase with a massive curtailment of taxable landholdings, moves, and wholesale flight to the south--to the frontier. The government parried the popular challenge with edicts on enserfment and a new increase in collections. By the beginning of the seventeenth century, the situation had become absurd. A landholding that had been worked for half a century before by a single peasant now came to accommodate 150 households. Not that each of them began to till less; the tilled fields simply became secret, and so not subject to the heavy tsarist assessment. To put it in modern terms, the economy became substantially a shadow economy. As a result, many fewer taxes now reached the treasury. And the government, in the person of the expanded departmental apparatus, never tired of devising more and more new assessments. All kinds of money was collected: from the Strelets special military corps, from colonists, from town dwellers, from convicts, gross taxes, road taxes, and so on and so forth. The state just couldn't get rich, though! Because collecting taxes from a shadow economy, as we well know today, is impossible in principle. At the time the clerks of the Boyars Council, the glorious Gaydars of those times long past, decided to replace the land tax with a household tax. The unexpected result was not an increase in taxes collected but a sharp increase in household size. Within a few years there were 20-30 huts behind a single gate, with tens of families living in each hut. But it was a single household! The same taxes were paid as on a single household. The keen struggle between state and subjects continued for a hundred years--until the Great Transformer introduced the per capita tax, which functions in the form of an income tax even now. However, it is not enough to introduce a tax. You have to know how to collect it. The methods Petr I used to collect them in our homeland are remembered to this day. One way or another, though, taxes began to flow into the treasury, and the state was even able to carry out a few investment programs--for instance, to build our nation's supremely powerful navy, whose three hundredth anniversary we are about to celebrate. The current rulers are a long way from achieving an effectiveness of tax policy on Petr's level. They seem to be somewhere in the early seventeenth century, for their actions (like taxpayers' answering measures) are stunningly reminiscent of the situation sketched out above. The situation that arose around the drafting and approval of the 1994 budget convinces us without a doubt that the mentality of the present-day Russian government has not advanced very far from the experience of previous centuries. I will cite merely the latest observation of parliament economic figures, published last Thursday in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. The tax burden is increasing notably, they state gloomily, after studying the draft budget. The profit tax has been increased to 6 percent, a 3-percent "special tax" has been introduced, property tax has been raised to 2 percent, a 1-percent transportation tax has been introduced, and duties have been raised on imports. But to promulgate an edict about raising taxes is by no means the same as increasing the income to the budget. The same parliamentary authors state with a heavy sigh that even with an increase in the total tax burden, the government is too weak to pass specific and real measures to increase the income to the budget. Or, to speak in ordinary language, they don't have what it takes to collect the taxes. They write up a resolution increasing them with one hand, and with the other pass out (or cannot cancel) various tax privileges, "tax breaks" for giant bankrupts, and so on. Finally, the state lacks effective means for influencing the shadow economy with the goal of its speedy emergence under the bright spotlight of the tax department. Collecting taxes even close to in full is a task that is far from resolved. The gloomiest skeptic-observers say that only 10-20 percent of taxes are actually collected. The rest--by various legal but primarily illegal methods--are hidden from the state. In other words, the greater part of the contemporary economy is essentially a shadow economy, that is, concealed from the state. Let me emphasize that we are not talking about the criminal economy--the drug business, or traffic in arms or children. We are talking about the Snickers trade and the production of stockings, about unregistered transportation, unreported services, and the uncontrolled traffic in securities. For a year and a half, for example, a voucher bacchanalia has been raging in the country; 150 million vouchers have changed hands several times each already. The count of operations with these securities is going into the several billions, but what profit has the treasury gained from this traffic? A big fat--nothing. And so it goes in any sphere of economic life you like. Compare two figures. Over the last three years, production has been cut by a half, and energy consumption only by 13 percent. How is this paradox to be interpreted? In my opinion, it speaks to the fact that at least one-fourth of production has gone into the economic "shadow," hidden away from state statistics and tax assessment. This is the problem to end all problems. But cabinet members and the gigantic apparatus of the executive power are involved in everything--the creation of political parties, trips to international fora, excursions to halted factories, fruitless clashing with deputies and journalists--except the main thing they are up against: the provision of vital activity to the state organism, which is impossible without an efficient system for tax collection. There isn't one today. And the paralysis of the state budget everyone has observed is engendered not by disagreements over the size of its articles. The matter is both simpler and more tragic. That which the authorities have been able to collect from subjects in principle cannot be enough even for the most essential state expenditures, to say nothing of investments in forward-looking branches, subsidy support, and so on. It cannot be said that nothing is being done about creating a system for collecting taxes. No, money is going to this and is being spent successfully by numerous budgetary mouths. Lobbying groups are attempting with varying degrees of success to pull strings for their foreign developers--some for Americans, some for Taiwanese, some for Siemens, some for somebody else. As usually happens in Russia, the authorities as yet have paid no attention to our own prophets, which, as always happens in Russia, we have. Well known, for example, is the so-called Kemerov Task, a program that can help increase significantly the efficiency of mid-level tax departments. Promised developments connected with the problem of coordinating tax and investment policy have been carried out at the initiative of the State Committee for Industrial Policy. However, one of the most effective automated information systems for a territorial-level tax service has been developed not with state money but in the private sector. About five years ago, a group of economists, graduates of TsEMI, other institutes, and state structures, joining together into the Bureau of Information Technologies, addressed the problem of resolving this task given the special prose of Russian economic life. Today a system has been created with the Bureau's funds and introduced in several tax inspectorates. The developers were counting on their product finding a relatively quick demand, given the market reforms, and the costs being paid off. So far this hasn't happened, and when it will is unclear; in the Russian market its own special laws are operative. The Sprut [Octopus] system that the Bureau people worked out truly does correspond to its name. According to the testimony of the head of the Moscow Thirtieth State Tax Inspectorate, L. N. Grin, introduction of the system made it possible to increase additional payments to the budget by a factor of eight in a single quarter. It takes only a few months to pay off the costs of introducing Sprut, and for a few tasks--for example, exaction of fines--just two or three weeks. For those who are looking for a tax-collecting body overseas, let me cite the testimony of a foreign authority, the kind people so love to cite nowadays. Specialists from the U.S. federal tax department, under the leadership of the director of the tax service's programming department, F. Konrad, having acquainted themselves with Sprut, gave the following written testimony: "The computer program shown to us is well elaborated, and we think that it is a solid basis for further work." The conclusion is dry enough, of course, and short on ecstasy, but it was made by people who know how to collect taxes like no one else in the world.
