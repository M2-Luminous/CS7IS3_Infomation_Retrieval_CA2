First: the volume of sources which will be available, at the disposal of Palestinian citizens and authorities. Unfortunately, although Palestinian rights and demands are clear, it is not clear what natural and economic sources will be granted to Palestinians and the Palestinian authorities. Here we are speaking principally, or most importantly, about land, water, and about tourist resources, specifically Jerusalem. Additionally, we may be in a position to exploit the fishery resources in Gaza and the Jericho area. The other part, regarding resources, is decision-making power in the management and independence of these sources, which is another very important topic in these negotiations. The other important matter is the nature of relations with Israel. It is a known fact that over the past 27 years of occupation, interlocking economic relations were imposed unilaterally. These relations were characterized by hegemony and inequality; will the negotiations bring about a reformulation of these relations on new bases of equality, mutual benefit, and the right of reciprocity? This is a very important issue, and may be even more crucial than the time factor, given the vagueness that surrounds these elements. Perhaps if we wish to adopt a development strategy, we may be compelled to get into strategic scenarios and not into defining strategies. In addition to these factors, which, as I said, will be settled by the negotiations, there are some factors or relatively stable, or more stable characteristics, and some utterly unstable ones, but because they are linked to some extent with some objective factors, these factors, too, influence or form, with other factors, the framework in which this strategy will be built. These elements are: First: Limited Natural Resources It is well known that, even should we obtain all independent Palestine's sources and resources (God willing), we must look to a development strategy. This is because in general it does not possess natural resources and raw materials sufficient to supply local industry and local agriculture with input. This means an inability to obtain foreign parts and foreign currency by exporting resources. There will be a significant dependence on commercial markets to supply our productive sectors with input. This is very important, and sheds light on the importance of foreign trade and our freedom to gain access to other markets. Second: The Small Local Market Palestine's market is known to be very small, and this in turn means that the expansion of production or of commodity production basically rests on our ability to gain access to new markets abroad. This is another example of the elements defining our development strategy; that is, the growth of the Palestinian economy will depend to a large extent on our ability to market our products in foreign markets. If they are closed, or if we do not succeed in that, there will be severe limits on the growth of our commodity markets. Third: Structure of the Economy There is no easy way out of this. The general structure of the economy is known to depend greatly on agriculture, which comprises 25-30 percent of the economy; on local products and weak industry, which represent no more than 10 percent; and the building and construction sector, which represents 15 percent. The rest is mostly domestic services and other services. If we go into the makeup or structure of the sectors in depth, we note that they were formed under the influence of many factors; chiefly, and most ominously, perhaps, is that the structure of our industries was formed by Israeli demand. This is highly significant when we look at our strategic options in the nature of the relations we want to establish and create with neighboring countries. Fourth: The Palestinian Economy's Level of Development There is no escaping from this when the development strategy is released. And so this means that our ambitions, in order to be realistic, must be linked to our level of development. We cannot say, "Our strategy must include..." and then add, for example, possibly complex and intense industries, such as are sometimes considered. At our level of development, we must look at the most important elements, and the most important elements or components at the level of development. Our economy suffers from very severe infrastructural backwardness in all areas. I would here like to point out that over the past 27 years the Israelis have spent no more than $15 per Palestinian on infrastructure, while spending per Israeli on infrastructure was $1,000 per year. In Jordan, the figure is more than $100, at various times; even in the current period of crisis, with the dinar crisis and the economic crisis in Jordan, this spending has not fallen below $100 per person; it remains, practically, seven times what is spent here. According to World Bank experts' very conservative estimates (with which we do not agree), the Palestinian people have the infrastructure necessary for its economic level. I believe we have one third of the infrastructure needed for a balanced economy; the importance of the material and social parts of an infrastructure is well known. The second issue that characterizes our backward economy is the lack of and severe weakness in institutions, specifically the economic institutions that will be responsible for managing the funding process. It is well known that most of these are locally run institutions; we all know how marginal and weak the municipalities' role is. In practical terms, we need a major strengthening process in order for them to play a significant role in the development process regarding the official authority or institutions of civil administration that the Palestinian authority will appoint. We may say that qualified people capable of playing a leading role in the development process in the future are few and far between. In spite of all the factors that represent a framework in the development process or adoption of a strategy, one must note some of the positive elements that should be taken into consideration when we formulate a development strategy. They are: The first element: the relatively excellent level of human resources provided or available to the Palestinian economy. When I speak of human resources, we must not forget that it is possible to multiply their capabilities if we can attract qualified Palestinian people from abroad. This is highly significant, and I hope the coming Palestinian authority will offer incentives to qualified Palestinians abroad to come here and work on developing their economies. The second element: in our economy, also, we have a relative distinction in the agricultural sector, and this relative distinction has limits, as a matter of course. I may say, however, that it will play a basic role when it comes to new funding for the other sectors, the relative distinction we have in terms of work productivity and reliable technical ability. This could be of primary benefit during the transitional period, in order to form a basic tributary of development. The third element, also important and positive, and to which attention must be given, is tourism potential, or the power of the Palestinian economy to turn tourism into a key element and primary funded sector of the Palestinian economy. But this requires great attention in this sector, and an infrastructure. It could be taxable in the early phases, and as a matter of course I do not expect the Palestinian authority to be capable of adopting sufficient funding for this sector, but it can create an appropriate framework and sufficient incentives for the Palestinian, Arab, and foreign private sectors. The fourth element, important, though perhaps not of great importance, but necessary to take into consideration: our economy, which has faced major confiscation by the Israelis. The Palestinian economy has been a commercial free zone for the Israelis; this in itself powered our industries, in some form or another, industries that were faced with very intense competition, and that were able to survive and evolve in highly competitive circumstances. They compelled them to increase productivity and improve quality, in order to open horizons, as there would be competitive industries abroad, especially in Arab markets. These are the components of the general framework on which the strategy is built, but where is the centerpiece of these components? This is the real question. I believe--and I may be wrong--that the nature of the commercial system upon which we are agreeing with the Israelis--as is known from the negotiations--is based on two contradictory positions. The Israeli Position It desires and seeks to consolidate the status quo, with some minor improvements, in the sense of maintaining the customs union as a limited framework for the commercial system, a system of exchange between Israel and Palestine. This means that the Palestinian market, and the Palestinians, will not be able to achieve the freedom of foreign markets, but that they would have the freedom to formulate their foreign trade policy. This framework might allow Palestine to benefit from the agreements Israel has concluded with the Common Market and the United States. It will be easy for Palestinians to get concessions from these groups, but it will completely deprive the Palestinians of the fabric of independent economic relations in some markets, including the Arab markets. This is, in my view, a very great problem, because the markets--and I have spoken of the factors that make foreign trade for Palestine very important, with a very great role in economic growth--our markets are not the EEC, or America. If we were to succeed in this phase (the development phase) in finding markets abroad, these markets would be Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Africa, and the Arab countries. These are the markets in which we can find wide areas for marketing our agricultural and industrial surpluses. At the same time, we can get raw materials and industrial input from these groups more cheaply, meaning lower production costs. Thus it is possible, if we are deprived of this framework, for us to have very great development problems. In return, we Palestinians ask for the customs union to be replaced by a free trade agreement and a trade accord that would mean our continued benefit from the Israeli market. We depend on the Israeli market for our imports and exports. The Israeli market is the primary market now, and we cannot do without it. A trade accord would allow us access to the Israeli market as before, but as a matter of course there will be barriers to re-exporting some of the products we import, and we can re-export them according to the free trade agreement. This is the key point that would enable us to have an independent economic policy suited to the needs of our economy and developmental level; at the same time it would enable us to benefit from our existing relations with the Israeli market. With this definition of the strategy in the transitional phase, my view is that our strategy in the transitional period perhaps must focus on primary elements: The first and most important element, in my estimation, despite the fact that the necessary investments for it are less, is the building of institutions and the creation of an administrative and organizational structure for the development process. Without it, I believe, it would be difficult to rely on the present structure: the civil administration framework is fragile and incapable of handling the development process. At the same time, the local rule framework and the municipalities too require a great deal of effort in order to be able to play a primary role. The second element, which might be less costly, but of greater importance, is the creation of an appropriate legal climate for the launching of the development process. Here the issue of military orders and their replacement with contemporary laws provides an appropriate framework for private sector activity and the use of foreign investments, which is a side issue. The third element is a basic one in the field of development: the rebuilding of the infrastructure. All interest is now focused on the infrastructure, without which appropriate services cannot be provided to the people and citizens; at the same time, investment cannot be facilitated, so this is a key issue. The fourth element in our developemnt strategy is education reform. Education reform begins with basic education, and education reform is a key issue, and possibly merits a conference to itself. The fifth element in the features of the strategy is to accelerate the developemnt of the banking system. Without a banking system, one which provides investors access to facilities, it will be difficult to achieve development. Here I hope I have succeeded in setting out the features of a strategy. I say, and emphasize, that the strategy must be based, and generally is based, on specific political goals. The political goals thus far are clear, and yet they are not sufficient. Our political goal is to establish an independent Palestinian state, and bring back the refugees. This goal in itself does not give or contain information sufficient for the adoption of a development strategy. We are familiar with and have begun to introduce the transitional period we speak of. Also, in a general way, we have said it is a step on the road to an independent Palestinian state. From another aspect, at various levels, the phase, as it is structured, lacks clear details upon which one might base the adoption of a sound and appropriate development strategy.
