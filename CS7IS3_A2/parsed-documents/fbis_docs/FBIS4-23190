Dr Hartzenberg told a news conference he intended to raise the amnesty issue again at his meeting with Mr Mandela in Pretoria on Monday. It might be necessary to adjust the cut-off dates contained in legislature for amnesty, Dr Hartzenberg said. Distancing the AVF from violence, Dr Hartzenberg announced that the organisation would establish a team to directly negotiate with the government on an Afrikaner Volkstaat [homeland]. He was speaking after an AVF Executive Council meeting in Pretoria to review the AVF's position after the elections. A volks [people's] republic committee had been established to do the necessary planning and formulate input for negotiations, he said. Dr Hartzenberg likened the position of Afrikaners to that of the Palestinians before their settlement, saying Afrikaners had lost their freedom and did not have a land. The Afrikaner had two choices: They could struggle, destroy and use violence to reach a settlement or they could reach a settlement without following that route. "It would be wise (verstandig) to reach a settlement without violence." During negotiations with Mr Mandela, they agreed that this was the correct method, Dr Hartzenberg said. Asked why the AVF did not join General Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front [FF] to obtain a volkstaat through the "volkstaat raad" [homeland council] dr hartzenberg said the constitution and the April accord between the FF, government and the ANC, ruled out complete self-determination for Afrikaners. Analysis of the votes cast during the elections indicated that more people abstained from voting than those who did vote for the FF route, he added.
