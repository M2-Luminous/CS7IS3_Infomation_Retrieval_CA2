FR940110-0-00040 FR940110-0-00012 8. Final rules governing regulatory classification of mobile services may not be available on or before the February 10, 1994, filing deadline. We recognize that this presents private land mobile licensees with the potentially difficult decision of whether they should file petitions for waiver. Therefore, in instances where there is any chance at all that the licensee might later be classified as a CMRS provider, we strongly encourage the licensee to err on the side of filing and thereby preserve all of its rights under the new statutory provisions. Similarly, if a licensee is uncertain of whether it would be affected by section 310(b) restrictions absent a waiver, we strongly recommend that the licensee file a petition. B. Contents of Waiver Petition 9. As noted above, section 332(c)(6) permits the Commission to grant waiver petitions only where two conditions are met. First, the waiver can only cover ``the [licensee's] extent of foreign ownership interest [that has] not *␣*␣* increased above the extent which existed on May 24, 1993.'' Consistent with the legislative history quoted previously (see note 4, supra), we interpret this language to refer to the precise identities of persons or entities and not merely to preexisting levels of foreign ownership interests. Petitioners must therefore identify in their petitions all foreign interests in the licensee as of May 24, 1993, that would, absent a waiver, be subject to the section 310(b) restrictions and for which a waiver is sought. For instance, except as noted below, petitioners should specifically identify all foreign persons or entities holding an ownership interest in the licensee and the percentage of ownership interest of each and identify all foreign partners, 13 officers, and directors, regardless of whether they have any ownership interest. While we will not require publicly traded corporations 14 to identify each foreign stockholder in instances where this requirement would be especially onerous, 15 we note that it is the responsibility of all petitioners to ensure that all foreign ownership listed in the petition, including that held by individual stockholders, did exist as of May 24, 1993, and to retain documentation substantiating that ownership. 13 Petitioners must list all foreign partners regardless of whether they are general or limited partners, except that petitioners need not list a limited partner (1) whose level of ownership interest in the licensee does not exceed the level allowed by section 310(b), and (2) who is ``insulated'' from the management and control of the partnership. See, e.g., Wilner and Scheiner, supra, 103 FCC 2d at 517 n. 31, 520 n. 43; Attribution of Ownership Interests, Memorandum Opinion and Order in MM Docket No. 83&hyph;46, 58 RR 2d 604, 619&hyph;20 ¶¶48&hyph;50 (1985). 14 For a definition of such corporations, see First Report and Order and Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration in CC Docket Nos. 90&hyph;6, 85&hyph;388, 6 FCC Rcd 6185, 6213 ¶63 (1991). 15 See, e.g., Advanced Mobile Phone Inc., 54 RR 2d 354, 362 ¶29 (Com. Car. Bur. 1983) (applicant demonstrated sufficient compliance with the requirements of FCC Form 401 by indicating the percentage of its common stock held or voted by aliens, and by listing the identities of its ten largest stockholders and stating that none of them was an alien, and would not be required to circulate a questionnaire to all of its stockholders). The burden will be on any entity claiming such an onerous burden to explain why identifying individual shareholders would be extraordinarily burdensome. 10. The second condition is that the waiver cannot permit any ``subsequent transfer of ownership to any other person in violation of section 310(b).'' We interpret ``subsequent'' here to mean subsequent to May 24, 1993. Petitioners must therefore certify in their petitions that the identity and percentages of each listed component of foreign ownership are unchanged since May 24, 1993, and that each listed foreign officer, director or partner continues to hold the same position. The waiver can recognize only the particular person or entity that held the ownership interest on May 24, 1993; it cannot recognize any subsequent transfers to other foreign owners or foreign officers or directors. 16 If, following the grant of a waiver in light of the above condition, a licensee wishes to transfer ``grandfathered'' foreign ownership interests, the waiver will remain valid (for the remaining ``grandfathered'' interests) only if the transfer is made to a domestic person or entity. 17 The same is true for ``grandfathered'' partners, officers, and directors. 16 See note 4, supra. Thus, transfers to aliens that occurred after May 24 are not covered by the grandfathering provisions of the Budget Act even if they occurred before the Budget Act was enacted on August 10, 1993. Where such a transfer is found to create an ownership interest in violation of section 310(b), the licensee will be required to comply with section 310(b) with respect to that interest, regardless of whether alien ownership in the licensee that existed prior to May 24 is grandfathered. 17 Licensees seeking to transfer their ownership or control would also be required to comply with section 310(d) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 310(d), and with applicable Commission rules.
