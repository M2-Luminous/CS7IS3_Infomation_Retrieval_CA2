There is talk that one of our departments was apparently contacted, but there was neither any special group formed nor an exchange of official letters on the topic, NBP Chairwoman Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz told NOWA EUROPA. In the Program, activities of the NBP were assessed quite critically. It was said that, while issuing money, supervising other banks, and performing ownership functions at the same time, the central bank does not perform any of these functions properly. According to Gronkiewicz-Waltz, there are no reasons to support such an argument. The central bank always forces the government to grant it concessions to decrease the budget deficit. We are the ones who make the reduction of the inflation rate happen. There is already some progress in the area, even though things could be better. As for supervision, the NBP knows what is happening among other banks, and it has compiled a detailed diagnosis on the topic. Still, if the state budget wants to take over banks being supervised by the NBP, I will gladly give them up, stated the chairwoman. So, as to taking the NBP's suggestions into account, a provision on separating banking supervision out of the central bank's structure and on organizing the supervision in the form of an independent institution was removed from an initial version of the Strategy program. The independent institution form exists in only four EC countries. When it comes to Belgium and France, the independence of banking supervision is only apparent, while, for instance, in Finland, there is a trend to merge the functions. The NBP chairwoman also expressed the view that, if one wants to establish several strong banks, one must consolidate them first and privatize them later. Once the banks go onto the stock market, any mergers will be practically impossible. Still, privatization is also needed because state-owned financial institutions are characterized by low efficiency dynamics. Their higher profitability, compared with the average value for the sector as a whole, is not a result of better management but is, instead, a result, for instance, of lower costs for obtaining money.
