The authority citation for Part 233 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 301, 602, 606, 606 note, 607, 1202, 1302, 1352 and 1382 note; sec. 6 of Pub. L. 94&hyph;114, 89 Stat. 579; Part XXIII of Pub. L. 97&hyph;35, 95 Stat. 843; Pub. L. 97&hyph;248, 96 Stat. 324; Pub. L. 99&hyph;603, 100 Stat. 3359; and sec. 1883 of Pub. L. 99&hyph;514, 100 Stat. 2916. 2. Section 233.20 is amended by adding a new paragraph (a)(15) to read as follows: §233.20 Need and amount of assistance. (a) *␣*␣* (15) For Medicaid eligibility only, pursuant to section 406(h) of the Act: (i) Each dependent child and each relative with whom such a child is living (including the eligible spouse of such relative pursuant to section 237.50(b) of this chapter) who becomes ineligible for AFDC wholly or partly because of the initiation of or an increase in the amount of a child or spousal support collection under title IV&hyph;D will be deemed to be receiving AFDC, but only for purposes of this paragraph (a)(15), for a period of four consecutive calendar months beginning with the first month of AFDC ineligibility. To be eligible for extended Medicaid coverage pursuant to this paragraph (a)(15), each dependent child and relative must meet the following conditions: (A) The individual must have become ineligible for AFDC on or after August 16, 1984; and (B) The individual must have received AFDC in at least three of the six months immediately preceding the month in which the individual becomes ineligible for AFDC; and (C) The individual must have become ineligible for AFDC wholly or partly as a result of the initiation of or an increase in the amount of a child or spousal support collection under title IV&hyph;D. (ii)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(15)(ii)(B) of this section, individuals who are eligible for extended Medicaid lose this coverage if they move to another State during the 4-month period. However, if they move back to and reestablish residence in the State in which they have extended coverage, they are eligible for any of the months remaining in the 4-month period in which they are residents of the State. (B) If a State has chosen in its State plan to provide Medicaid to non-residents, the State may continue to provide the 4-month extended benefits to individuals who have moved to another State. (iii) For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section: (A) The new collection or increased collection of child or spousal support results in the termination of AFDC eligibility when it actively causes or contributes to the termination. This occurs when: ( 1 ) the change in support collection in and of itself is sufficient to cause ineligibility. This rule applies even if the support collection must be added to other, stable income. It also applies even if other independent factors, alone or in combination with each other, might simultaneously cause ineligibility; or ( 2 ) The change in support contributes to ineligibility but does not by itself cause ineligibility. Ineligibility must result when the change in support is combined with other changes in income or changes in other circumstances and the other changes in income or circumstances cannot alone or in combination result in termination without the change in support. (B) In cases of increases in the amounts of both the support collections and earned income, eligibility under this section does not preclude eligibility under paragraph (a)(14) of this section or section 1925 of the Social Security Act (which was added by section 303(a) of the Family Support Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 139r&hyph;6)). Extended periods result from both an increase in the amount of the support collection and from an increase in earned income must run concurrently. * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28317 Filed 11&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4184&hyph;01&hyph;M
