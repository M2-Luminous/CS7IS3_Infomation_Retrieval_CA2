The scale of investment was too large, and the distribution of the investment was not rational. The problem was rather prominent. The actual amount of investment arranged by the state-owned institutions for capital construction in the 14 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions exceeded the state plan by $60.9 billion, or 11.7 percent. The State Council leadership stressed the need to increase the intensity of macrocontrol this year; otherwise, the gross amount of investment in fixed assets this year will exceed the planned ceiling of 1,300 billion yuan. The recent inspection found that, although Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Shanxi, and other provinces and municipalities arranged their own investment according to the state plan, prefectures, cities, and counties increased the scale of investment level by level. As a result, the total exceeded the plan laid down by the provincial and municipal authorities. Another problem found in the inspection was the lack of rationality in the distribution of investment, and there was a serious degree of duplication of investment in similar projects. For example, international airports were built at the same time in Xiamen and Fuzhou of Fujian, which are just 300 kilometers apart; moreover, Quanzhou, 81 kilometers away from Xiamen, and Zhangzhou, closer to Xiamen, also planned to build their own airports. Similar infrastructural facilities were built in the same area without proper coordination according to local capabilities. Duplicated layout of investment was also found in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan. The inspection report also pointed out that, because various localities vied with one another in starting new investment projects, the gross amount of investment continued to swell. This took away money and affected the state's key construction projects. For example, a city in Henan arranged 30 construction projects this year. Only two were state-level key projects and seven were provincial-level key projects, with the rest being arranged by the city on its own. As localities launched a large number of projects on their own, priority was not actually given to the state's key projects. As another example, a coastal city planned to rebuild its airport, and the state approved 200 million yuan in investment. The local government decided to expand the airport according to the standard of an international airport, however, and made this a fait accompli in order to require that the state authorities approve a commercial loan of $90.6 million. The total investment thus exceeded 2 billion yuan. According to the investigation, the airport project was started even before it was approved by the state authorities. The State Planning Commission pointed out that, if this year's actual investment exceeded the planned ceiling of 1,300 billion yuan, it will have serious consequences for China's macroeconomic ratios. In particular, as prices are now increasing sharply and inflationary pressures are increasing, firmly controlling the size of investment in fixed assets has become a pressing task of the moment. The projects which should be suspended must be resolutely suspended so that the state's key construction projects can be actually guaranteed. The local authorities have appropriately centralized investment management according to the State Council's instruction on further intensifying the state's macro-control over investment in fixed assets, and have changed the situation in which investment projects were managed by different departments without proper coordination.
