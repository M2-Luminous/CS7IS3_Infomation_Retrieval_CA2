Last Friday, the Rwandan Government brought a lot of arms and ammunition into the country. The UN Mission to Rwanda [UNAMIR] is said to have known this and is still waiting for an explanation--which is not forthcoming. [passage omitted]. Currently, there is also a plan being carried out against UNAMIR using radio RTLM [an FM radio station broadcasting in the Kigali area]. It is reported that these same messages are being repeated by Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise. Their plan is to use terrorism to make the work of UNAMIR difficult. As we said before, the Rwandan Government is said to have brought in arms last Friday. UNAMIR learned about this and is still waiting for an explanation. The Defense Ministry itself accepts the fact that it brought arms into the country, contrary to the peace agreements, and Rwandans cannot tolerate those who want jeopardize these agreements. Meanwhile, the U.S. organization Human Rights Watch has recently expressed its concern and has asked the international community and all international organizations to stand up and stop anything that might bring about a resumption in hostilities between the armies of both parties. All this, as you have just heard, is because of provocations carried out by the Rwandan Government by bringing arms, ammunition, and other military equipment into the country, clearly bringing to light a plan to cause a war in the country.
