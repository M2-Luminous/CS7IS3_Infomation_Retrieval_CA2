SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. OMB has determined that this rule is significant. Executive Order 12372 This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). Executive Order 12778 The Office of General Counsel has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of this Executive Order. Paperwork Reduction Act The amendments set forth in this proposed rule do not generate any new or revised information collection or recordkeeping requirements on the public. Regulatory Flexibility Act It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this proposed rule because it has been determined that this rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small businesses because licensing under the United States Warehouse Act is strictly voluntary on the part of the warehouseman. The actions taken herein are required by statute. Executive Order 12612 It has been determined that the policies and procedures contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. National Environmental Policy Act This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety. Therefore, either an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. Background The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 requires the imposition of fees for federally licensed warehouses. That Act stipulates that: The Secretary of Agriculture *␣*␣* shall charge, assess, and cause to be collected a reasonable fee for (1) each examination or inspection of a warehouse *␣*␣*; (2) each license issued to any person to classify, inspect, grade, sample, or weigh agricultural products stored or to be stored *␣*␣*; (3) each annual warehouse license issued to a warehouseman to conduct a warehouse *␣*␣*; and (4) each warehouse license amended, modified, extended, or reinstated *␣*␣*. Such fees shall cover, as nearly as practicable, the costs of providing such services and licenses *␣*␣* including administrative and supervisory costs *␣*␣* This proposed rule would add to and change the fees charged and collected, discontinue publication of fee amounts in the Regulations for Warehouses (7 CFR, chapter VII, subchapter c), and allow fees to be adjusted annually in order to cover program costs. Fees that will be charged beginning October 1, 1994, are contained below. When subsequent fee changes become necessary, fees will be announced prior to July 1, to be effective the following October 1, by Notice in the Federal Register . ASCS' goal is to have the added and revised fees implemented at the beginning of fiscal year 1995 due to the projection of a continued shortfall in the USWA user fee account. Annual program obligations require about $3.5 million. If public comment leads the agency to reject fee increases, other methods of statutory compliance would be required such as severe manpower and service adjustments. Any changes must be implemented by October 1, 1994. Because of budget constraints, it is imperative that ASCS implement a final rule before October 1, 1994. ASCS will consider all comments received regardless of whether the comment addresses the addition, increase, or the method by which fees will be announced. ASCS is requesting a 15-day comment period. Good cause is shown for a priority notice and comment period of less than 60 days, because ASCS must implement these fees for 1995 fiscal year. Affected parties should not be disadvantaged, because ASCS issued a Notice requesting comments in the Federal Register on August 20, 1993 (58 FR 44320), and held several meetings with various warehousing organizations. These organizations have alerted their members and others as to the effect of this rule. Proposed Warehouse and Service License Fees Warehouse license fees for cotton, grain, tobacco, wool, dry beans, nut, syrup, and cottonseed are proposed to be increased from $50 to $65. Service license fees issued to individuals and entities to inspect, sample, grade, classify, or weigh commodities are proposed to be increased from $20 to $26. Proposed Warehouse Annual and Inspection Fees The annual and inspection fees are outlined in the following tables by the agricultural product stored. The inspection fees are based on licensing a first-time applicant and adding space to an existing license. The purpose of the inspection fee is to cover the cost of licensing space while the annual fee is applicable to performing unannounced inspection and is assessed independently of the inspection fee.
