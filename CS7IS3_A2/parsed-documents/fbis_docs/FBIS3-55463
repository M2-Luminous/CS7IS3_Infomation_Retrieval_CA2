The Azerbaijani forces, backed by armoured vehicles, were heading toward Mardekert in northern Nagorno-Karabakh and toward Askeran in the east, some 30 kilometres (18 miles) from the capital Stepanakert, the army headquarters said. Heavy fighting was also continuing around Agdam, a strategic Azerbaijani town two kilometres east of the Nagorno-Karabakh border, which was captured by Armenian separatists six months ago. The Stepanakert headquarters confirmed that Goradiz, a key town near the Iranian-Azerbaijani border, had been recaptured by the Azerbaijani Army. But it denied Baku's claim Saturday that Azerbaijan controlled the road linking Goradiz and Fizuli, on the southern border of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian separatists had "succeeded in halting the Azerbaijani offensive" in that area, the headquarters said.
