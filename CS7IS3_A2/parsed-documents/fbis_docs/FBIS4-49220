The busy season for spring farming has begun. To lose no time in successfully doing this year's agricultural production and rural work, He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, led the comrades in charge of pertinent provincial departments to the rural areas of Nongan, Qian Gorlos, Fuyu, Qianan, and Changling to conduct investigation and study and guide work shortly after the televised rural work conference held by the provincial party committee. In view of the current problems in rural areas, he emphasized: It is necessary to comprehensively analyze and acquire a better understanding of the current rural situation from the overall and long-term perspective, conscientiously implement the guidelines of the central rural work conferences and the rural work conference held by the provincial party committee, fully stimulate and develop peasants' enthusiasm, make the current spring farming successful, and aim at moderate prosperity and the market economy in deepening reform, restructuring the economy, and developing the rural economy in an all-round manner to promote Jilin's rural work to a new stage. During the investigation and study period, Comrade He Zhukang went deep into townships, towns, township and village enterprises, and large households specializing in diverse production and livestock breeding to learn about their production and conditions of the people. He held a series of forums of various types to hear the opinions of the grass-roots levels and to pool the wisdom of the masses. He exchanged views with city, county, township, and village cadres as well as peasants on how to correctly assess the rural situation, how to make peasants affluent as soon as possible, how to promote agricultural modernization, the issues affecting peasants' enthusiasm and rural economic development, how to fully stimulate peasants' enthusiasm, how to strengthen leadership over rural work, and the specific problems to be addressed. He also held discussions with them to explore the ways to accelerate Jilin's agricultural development and to make peasants affluent and lead a moderately prosperous life at an early date. Comrade He Zhukang publicized the guidelines of the central rural work conference and the rural work conference of the provincial party committee wherever he went, summarized and extracted the rich experiences rural grass-roots cadres and peasants had created in the course of practice, and gave many important opinions on the work concerning rural areas, agriculture, and peasants. He Zhukang said: Thanks to the attention of the central authorities and the hard work of cadres at all levels, peasants' enthusiasm for production is high. This has not been seen for many years. In addition, thanks to the deepening of reform, the concepts of the vast number of rural cadres and peasants is effecting a profound change, the correct principle of developing agriculture in an all-round manner as defined by the provincial party committee has become the people's common understanding, the idea of the market economy has begun to take root deeply in people's hearts, and it has become a common topic and urgent desire to attach importance to information, stress the market force, look forward to affluence, and march toward a moderately prosperous life. The overall rural economic development trend is very good, and the situation encouraging. We may say that the current rural reform and development are in a new crucial period, and, in particular, the rural economic development is in a period of transition. Party committees and governments at all levels should seize the current favorable opportunity to guide action according to circumstances, step up work, pay attention to implementing the guidelines of the central rural work conference and the rural work conference of the provincial party committee, fully stimulate peasants' enthusiasm, and promote faster economic development in rural areas. He pointed out: To develop rural economy further, we should first comprehensively and accurately analyze and acquire a better understanding of the rural situation, think more deeply over the development trend from the overall perspective, and be more farsighted. In particular, we should see the problems. We should not overestimate peasants' income, investment capacity, and agricultural development and be unrealistically optimistic. Judging from the entire situation, rural areas are far from being moderately prosperous, and tasks remain very arduous to achieve a moderately prosperous life ahead of schedule; capacity for sustained agricultural development has yet to be enhanced, and to enhance the capacity, to a certain extent, is more difficult than developing industry, involves more complicated factors, and takes more time; and how to protect and persistently develop peasants' enthusiasm remains an issue to be properly addressed. Therefore, leaders at all levels should further enhance their understanding of the position of agriculture as the foundation, have a strong sense of work responsibility and urgency, and, in compliance with the target of moderate prosperity and the requirement for the market economy, further emancipate the mind, deepen rural reform, liberate and develop rural productive forces, proceed from and aim at making peasants affluent and lead a moderately prosperous life when carrying out the work concerning rural areas, agriculture, and peasants, fully stimulate and develop peasants' enthusiasm, and consolidate and develop the excellent rural situation. How to increase peasants' income and accelerate the pace of attaining a better-off level of moderate prosperity? This is an issue to which Comrade He Zhukang has paid great attention. He stressed on several occasions that the task of prime importance is to raise the agricultural labor productivity and let peasants have work to do all the year round and generate profits daily. The fundamental way out is to readjust the rural economic structure, and make full use of and tap all sorts of natural resources potentials in the rural areas. To readjust the structure, it is most important to proceed from our own reality, act in line with market demands, and accurately select items with our own advantages and our own characteristics. Each and every county, township, and village have different conditions. We must not strictly demand uniformity. It is better to develop things that suit a locality, grasp the characteristics, and gradually make it grow more intensive, specialized, and industrialized to form an optimal scale. Actively developing township enterprises is an important aspect in readjusting the structure. Developing township enterprises, however, needs certain conditions. As far as the broad masses of villages and households are concerned, during the initial stages, it is necessary to pay attention to seeking avenues that are mostly acceptable to peasants, and can be easily learned and understood, with less investment and risks but noticeable efficiency. Judging from the situation in various localities, animal husbandry, courtyard economy, and diversified undertakings can be initiated rapidly; they require less input and a low degree of socialization; peasants are able to easily approach them; and they have a vast market. They must be regarded as a major task during the current structural readjustment, and must be grasped well. In this aspect, we must pay attention to summing up and popularizing typical examples, and give play to their exemplary and initiating role. Peasants are most practical. When they see typical cases with their own eyes, they will follow them without having to be mobilized. Nongan and Qian Gorlos have done a good job in giving play to the role of typical examples and achieved structural readjustment and economic development rapidly. In the development of township industry, it is necessary to accurately select the projects, pay attention to quality, and not seek output value in a lopsided manner. Strenuous efforts should be made to build a batch of dragon-head enterprises, and through serial development, such as "all forms of integrated management of trade, industry, and agriculture, and the link-up operations of production, supply, and marketing," and such form as using companies to bring along peasant households, effectively link the production of all households with the domestic and foreign large markets, increase efficiency, and reduce risks. In the development of diversified economy and township enterprises, we must persist in taking a high starting point, try our best to adopt technologies of the present age, and have them attain the level of our time. To accelerate development, it is not realistic to do without advanced technology. He Zhukang said: To readjust the industrial set-up and to raise the labor productivity in the rural areas, it is most important to raise the quality of peasants and solve the issue that some peasants want to become prosperous but they do not know how to do it and have no way to do it. Chairman Mao said during the 1950's, the serious issue is to educate peasants. This task has become more urgent today. Rural development should be finally determined by the enhancement of the overall quality of peasants. Nurturing a generation of peasants of a new type with scientific, technological, and cultural mind that fit the rural economic development, particularly the demands of the market economy, is an arduous task. Relevant departments at all levels should grasp it as a major task. In practice, all localities should have some good methods and experiences. For example, rural scientific and technological winter activities, peasants' vocational education, the "three plus one" middle school education, and "green certificates," are all feasible methods which must be upheld and popularized with continued efforts. Meanwhile, governments at all levels and all educational and administrative departments should put peasants' vocational and technical education high on the agenda and study specific implementation measures. It is necessary to train the existing labor forces in a planned manner, have plans, and set demands on them. We should give consideration to adding agricultural technology classes in the broad masses of rural schools starting in junior middle schools this year, in addition to running peasants' vocational and technical schools. Senior middle schools, if conditions permit, should popularize Jian's "three plus one" experience, strengthen agricultural science technological knowledge training among peasants of a new generation, and fundamentally intensify the agricultural development momentum. This is a foundation work. All localities must pay high attention to it and grasp it firmly and well. He Zhukang pointed out: Peasants are the mainstay of the rural economic economy. The key to effecting a fundamental change in the rural outlook and accelerating the pace of agricultural modernization is to fully mobilize the broad masses of peasants and to give play to their enthusiasm. Cadres at all levels should firmly cultivate the viewpoint of believing in the masses and relying on them, change ideological concept, improve work style, and through emancipating the mind and deepening reform, break the shackle of traditional mechanism and the mode of thinking on peasants, give full play to the role of market mechanism as an incentive for peasants, give a free hand to peasants, and rely on the markets to solve the issue of funds and technology. It is necessary to strengthen peasants' organizational work, mobilize peasants through some carriers, and boost the mass enthusiasm of peasants. It is necessary to let peasants participate in policymaking in rural reform and development, strengthen democratic management, make the masses understand and support all sorts of rural work, and turn it into their conscious action. Peasants have tremendous wisdom and enthusiasm. If we let peasants participate in solving difficult problems in the rural areas and mobilize their endeavors, all problems can be solved and all undertakings will be a success. Many localities can prefulfill the great project of making the vast land of Jilin green in 10 years if the enthusiasm of the masses is mobilized. All levels should fully understand this. Agriculture is a weak industry. In the process of transition into the market economic structure, the state should continue to implement all sorts of effective supporting and protective policies. But specific methods should be relatively changed in line with the new situation. Continued efforts should be made to reduce the burdens of peasants, and prevent the "reappearance" of burdens. It is necessary to conscientiously resolve the issue on hot topics which the masses of people in the rural areas have paid close attention, do practical things for peasants, help them eliminate misgivings, and enable them to participate in the development of the rural market economy with all-out efforts. Developing and expanding the collective economy is the material basis for forming cohesion of the rural party organizations and appeal of grass-roots cadres, the fundamental way for reducing peasants' burdens and resolving the rural social security issue, and an important means for enabling rural grass-roots cadres to lead the rural economy under market economic conditions. On his way, He Zhukang repeatedly explored ways of developing the village collective economy along with rural cadres. He said: What can be managed by the peasant households can also be managed by the village collectives. One of the important targets of evaluating rural work and the building of grass-roots organizations is to see whether they have developed a collective economy. All localities should adopt measures, be determined to make all villages have collective economic units within the next two years, and enable all villages across the province each with an annual revenue of over 20,000 yuan at the least. In addition to formulating specific plans, we should also implement target management and work in a down-to-earth manner. Regarding those villages whose collecive economy lacks development, we should organize efforts to study them one by one so that all villages have collective economic development items. Concerning villages with weak leadership, we should make up our mind to send cadres to assume posts and to define work objectives for changing their poverty and backward outlook. In addition to developing their economy, we should help them cultivate a good party branch secretary and form a good leading body. We should care for the living of peasant households with special difficulties, analyze their situation one by one, give them suitable remedies, and adopt practical and effective methods, such as giving social mutual assistance, encouraging them to engage in development and production, and providing them relief by the civil administrations, in an effort to guarantee their basic life. He Zhukang pointed out: In developing rural market economy, we must invigorate the rural commodity circulation and pay attention to cultivating and building rural markets, including rural internal market cultivation and formation. The key to linking production with supply and marketing lies in the dragon head which means marketing, and market is the crux. At present, the information for peasants is not quick and accurate and their products are unmarketable. In a final analysis, these problems are caused by the uncultivated and imperfect rural markets. It is necessary to exert efforts to develop the market. In this aspect, we should broaden our thinking, not only make good use of the existing markets but also develop new markets, develop small cities and towns in a planned manner, and realize an integration of rural and urban efforts. This is not only a necessity for developing the market economy but also the only way for enabling peasants to become prosperous without making them leave the rural areas. During discussions with rural cadres, He Zhukang repeatedly emphasized: New ideas and new methods are needed in leading rural economic development. The past traditional leadership methods characterized by giving orders, defining plans, and hastening production and harvesting should be changed into ones emphasizing guidance, support for peasants to enter the market, and efforts to address the difficulties and problems in developing the market economy. We should provide peasants with market information, help them explore the market, establish the socialized service system well, and render good service prior to, during, and after production. In the transition to the market economy, new conditions and new problems will emerge one after another, of which many will be ones we do not understand. Therefore, to lead the market economy, cadres at all levels should intensify study, and those in the dark are in no position to light the way for others. They should study the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the knowledge on the socialist market economy, and modern scientific and technological knowledge. The recently published two books, "What Is the Socialist Market Economy" and "Modern Scientific and Technological Knowledge," are very good teaching materials, and all levels should earnestly study them. We should attach equal importance to the two civilizations and strengthen grass-roots organizations. In particular, we should strengthen the activities of party branches and leading party groups, hold democratic meetings frequently and party branch sessions at regular intervals and fully develop the role of party organizations as leadership cores and the role of party members as leaders and models. We should pay attention to establishing village plans and village rules and regulations, crack down on various criminal offenses, and check evil trends and bad customs and habits, such as gambling, superstitious activities, and lavish weddings and funerals, and transform social traditions so that peasants can live and work in peace and contentment. He Zhukang also emphasized on many occasions: A pressing task is to concentrate efforts on spring farming and plant crops well to stabilize Jilin's grain production. As 60 to 70 percent of peasants' current income comes from grain production, rural areas will be stabilized when attention is given to grain production. It is hoped that all localities will lose no time in spring farming and lay a good foundation for this year's bumper grain harvest. During the discussions in various localities, He Zhukang affirmed the work of rural grass-roots cadres on many occasions and expressed gratitude to their industrious work. He said: We should both set strict demands on grass-roots cadres and fully trust them to protect their enthusiasm well. Grass-roots work is very complicated, and some of it is very difficult. We should have a full understanding of the difficulties of grass-roots cadres, support their work, and ensure the implementation of the party's line, principles, and policies in rural areas. Participating in the investigation and study activities were responsible comrades of the general office and the rural work office of the provincial party committee, the provincial agricultural bank, provincial agricultural department, provincial water resources department, provincial township enterprise bureau, and provincial supply and marketing cooperative. Responsible comrades of Songyuan city party committee and government participated in the inspections and discussions in the various counties and districts of Songyuan city. Wang Yunkun, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the Changchun city party committee, and pertinent comrades of Changchun city party committee and government joined the investigation and study activities in Nongan.
