Elections have been postponed several times amidst complaints of fraudulent voters lists and about procedures at polling booths. Edem Kodjo is leader of the UTD [Togolese Union for Democracy] party. They have agreed to take part in the election but with certain reservations. Our man in Lome, Ebow Godwin, asked him about his main concerns. [Begin recording] [Kodjo] There are still two problems, and especially one--the problem of the Supreme Court. We don't accept the principle that the constitutional branch of the Supreme Court to be in charge of the elections petitions and we are proposing that the whole Supreme Court should be in charge of these petitions. It is a very important problem because we don't trust the constitutional branch of the Supreme Court. [Godwin] Why don't you trust the constitutional branch of the Supreme Court? [Kodjo] Because the composition is too biased, and this branch is composed only with the members of the RPT [Rally of the Togolese People]. We cannot accept this kind of thing. The second one is the problem of the distribution of the cards. We are concerned because the district commissioners in charge of issues in the districts are not very well equipped, and we are not sure that the timing which has been adopted is going to be fulfilled. [Godwin] I see that you have fielded 70 candidates. Given the right conditions, do you think that you and the other opposition groups can beat the RPT party hands down? [Kodjo] I think that we will make a good score. I am not going to be too optimistic. The problem is that we don't know how things are moving really inside the country, especially in the north, in the northern part of our country. But we still hope that the mobilization of our parties will make sure that there are not too many tricks and make sure that our elections are going to be fair. [Godwin] Since the last attack on Lome, the slightest noise made by even a burst lorry tire, you know, sends people running, panicking, do you think this will affect the security situation during the elections? [Kodjo] Let's say that the security situation is not very, very good. We in the UTD, we have proposed that we should be given a period of what I called neutralization, which will permit security to be reinforced, strengthened. Then people will have confidence in themselves and confidence in the system. Unfortunately, this proposal has been rejected. [end recording]
