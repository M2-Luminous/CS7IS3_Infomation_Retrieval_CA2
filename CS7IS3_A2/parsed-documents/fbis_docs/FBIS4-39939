In a statement issued today by CHECHENPRESS, the Foreign Ministry of Chechnya says that "Groznyy has never received any proposals or documents from the Russian leadership for the forthcoming talks," and therefore the Chechen leadership "strongly refutes the accusations that it has undermined the allegedly planned talks." The document also states that "the Chechen Republic is willing to start talks with the Russian Federation only on the principles of equality, with no preconditions, and only if Russia abandons the policy of state terrorism." The CHECHENPRESS report says that the Chechen Foreign Ministry has been provoked to issue the statement because "Russian mass media has published reports in which officials from the administration of the Russian President and from the Ministry for Nationalities and Regional Policy are blaming Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of Chechnya, for the collapse of the allegedly planned talks between the Chechen Republic and the Russian Federation."
