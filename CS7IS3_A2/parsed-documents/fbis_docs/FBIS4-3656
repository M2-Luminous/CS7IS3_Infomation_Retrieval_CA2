The message says: We are shocked to learn that Mr. Richard Nixon has died of illness, and we wish to express our profound condolences. Mr. Nixon was a statesmen with strategic foresight and political courage. When he was U.S. President, he and the late Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai opened the gate of Sino-U.S. relations and created a new situation for the relations between the two countries. After he was relieved of his office, Mr. Nixon continued to concern himself with Sino-U.S. relations and make important contributions to safeguarding and developing the two countries' relations. We are convinced that, under the joint efforts exerted by China and the United States, Sino-U.S. relations which the late Mr. Nixon cared about certainly will continue to improve and develop. We wish to express our sincere sympathy to Mr. Nixon's family. Zhu Rongji and Qian Qichen also sent messages of condolences.
