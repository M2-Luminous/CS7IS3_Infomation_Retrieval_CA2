FBIS4-36705 "drnes113dd_94013" FBIS-NES-94-113 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Security Forces Continue Implementation of Authority Security Forces Continue Implementation of Authority Talks With Hamas, Islamic Jihad On-Going JN1106154094 Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic 11 Jun 94 p 27 JN1106154094 Amman AL-DUSTUR Arabic BFN ["Exclusive" report by Samir Sa'd-al-Din from "occupied Jerusalem"] [Text] Mazin 'Izz-al-Din, official in charge of political guidance for the Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip, has said that the Palestinian military has taken over police duties because it was capable and was ready to take over that authority from the political apparatus and that the military would continue to exercise that right until the political and civilian institutions were prepared to assume that responsibility. Therefore, the fear of some brothers in the opposition that the military will continue to assume authority and that the role of the members of the authority would be confined to administrative duties is unfounded. He also said: We are planning to build political and civilian institutions and to hold elections for the authority's legislative council. He added: Dialogue between the Fatah Movement and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has been going on for a long time, and it began even before the arrival of the police in the National Authority's area. We are willing to continue that dialogue until we reach common ground because we believe that the Palestinian police do not belong to one faction but to all the Palestinian people's segments and factions. It is true that we fought Israel, but this is not allowed among our political forces. Now, we are holding a dialogue with Israel, but it is more appropriate that we should argue with each other in a democratic way. He asserted that we have achieved positive results in our dialogue with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. Referring to the existence of a dialogue with the other organizations, he said: We argued with them in Beirut, the jungle of rifles; we all reached common ground; we all participated in formulating our legislative councils and our political frameworks; and we conducted joint patrols. He then urged the leftist and pan- Arab forces to exercise their right under the warm wings of the Palestinian people and democracy to which we all belong. Regarding the alertness of the Palestinian police, 'Izz-al-Din said that the police forces, which were originally Palestinian forces, were properly trained in various countries, including West European and East European countries and some Arab countries. Several months ago, we sent personnel to the United States, Europe, and France, and we will send others to Japan and some Arab countries to take courses on administration, typography, map drawing, and computer usage. The problem is that we do not have the necessary institutions and departments for police missions. For example, the policemen do not have telecommunications devices to organize work between patrols, branches, and centers. Mazin 'Izz-al-Din also said that the Palestinian police have actually begun to exercise police missions. For example, they asked drivers to keep proper papers for themselves and their cars, they have organized visits to beaches in Gaza, and they have removed tents and huts on the beaches. The policemen also cleaned the Strip's cities and camps. Senior officers and soldiers took part in that work. He said: We want opposition factions and organizations to participate with us in removing the slogans they have written on walls in Gaza. Everyone took part in removing similar slogans in Jericho. Colonel Khalid Mismar, official in charge of information in Jordan, who was appointed official in charge of political guidance for the Palestinian police in the West Bank, is expected to arrive within the next few days.
