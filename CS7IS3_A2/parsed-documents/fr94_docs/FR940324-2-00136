SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: In April, 1993, the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport Authority and its consultants submitted a Preliminary Draft Environmental Assessment to the FAA for the proposed airport. In May, 1993, the FAA determined that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was warranted. A Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS was published in the Federal Register on May 28, 1994. The FAA intends to consult and coordinate with Federal, state, and local agencies which have jurisdiction by law or have special expertise with respect to any environmental impacts associated with the proposed project. The FAA is currently making the DEIS available to Federal, state, and local agencies and the public in order to allow a review of the document and to solicit comments. A Final EIS will be prepared following the forty-five (45) day comment period. Project Description The Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport Authority proposes to construct the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport which would replace commercial service at Drake Field. The primary components of the proposed action would consist of the following items: (1) Land acquisition; (2) 8,800-feet by 150-feet runway with high intensity runway lights, medium intensity approach lighting system and approach light system with sequence flasher; (3) 8,800-feet by 75-feet parallel taxiway with high intensity taxiway lights; (4) instrument landing system for both ends of the runway (to include localizer, glide slope, and middle and outer markers); (5) terminal building with associated motor vehicle parking and support facilities; (6) terminal area ramp paving; (7) air traffic control tower; and (8) an airport access road. Alternatives to the proposed action include no action, expansion of Carter Field in Rogers, Arkansas, and development of a new airport at another site. Agencies and members of the public may submit written statements to the following address: Federal Aviation Administration, Airports Division, Fort Worth, Texas, 76193&hyph;0630.
