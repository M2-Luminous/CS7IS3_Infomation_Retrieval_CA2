FR940503-0-00072 FR940503-0-00022 Recognizing all these factors, the interim rule provides for supporting documentation to be drawn from a variety of sources. These sources are identified as being either ``primary'' sources, or ``secondary'' sources. The interim rule provides that if at least one of the primary sources clearly establishes that a project was originally designed for elderly families (seniors), the owner of this project may elect the system of preferences provided by subtitle D. However, if another primary source establishes a design contrary to the primary source upon which the owner would base support that the project is a covered section 8 housing project, the owner cannot make the election of preferences provided by subtitle D without finding support in secondary sources. Secondary sources may then, as discussed in this interim rule, be used to establish the use for which the project was originally designed. If there are no primary sources clearly establishing the original design of the project, then original design may still be established through secondary sources. At least two secondary sources must support that the project was designed as elderly (seniors) housing in the absence of primary documentation in order to establish such intention for elderly housing. Additionally, in the case of conflict between primary sources, and the owner chooses to rely on secondary sources, then at least two secondary sources must support that the project was designed as elderly (seniors) housing. Primary sources. Primary sources that would evidence that a project was originally designed for occupancy by elderly families (seniors) include any of the following: the application in response to the notice of funding availability (NOFA); the terms of the NOFA under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement, the loan commitment, the bid invitation, the owner's management plan, or any other underwriting or financial document collected at or before loan closing. If any one of these project documents clearly evidence that the project was originally designed primarily for elderly families (seniors), the owner would be eligible to elect to apply the system of preferences provided under these regulations so long as the primary documents do not conflict. Secondary sources. As discussed above, if primary sources do not evidence that the population intended to be served by the project were elderly families (seniors), an owner may elect the system of preferences provided by subtitle D if the owner is able to produce evidence from two secondary sources that clearly evidence that the project was originally designed primarily for elderly families (seniors). Secondary sources include: (1) Lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse, or sole member is 62 years of age or older; (2) evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; (3) project unit mix with a higher percentage of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of ``elderly families'') from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of ``elderly families'' which includes disabled families]; or (4) any other relevant type of historical data unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence. As discussed above, the lack of uniform documentation, and the possible lack of distinction between: (1) Elderly projects which are seniors housing, and (2) elderly projects which planned to serve disabled families equally with seniors, make the determination of whether a project is a ``covered section 8 housing project'' a difficult one. The Department is specifically interested in public comment on this issue, particularly with respect to the existence (or lack thereof) of documentation that would show the original population group intended to be served by the project, other types of evidence that might be considered, and how to distinguish between: (1) Projects for elderly families, which included, and intended to include, disabled families, from (2) projects for elderly families which served disabled families only incidentally. B. Projects That Do Not Elect Subtitle D System of Preferences: Section 657 The Department emphasizes that the system of preferences provided by subtitle D and these regulations is not mandatory, and is available at the election of the multifamily housing owner. In accordance with section 657 of the 1992 HCD Act, an owner of a covered section 8 housing project that does not elect to implement the system of preferences provided by subtitle D would continue to provide housing for elderly families without incurring any obligation (beyond that mandated by the specific authorizing statutes and any other applicable statutory requirements) to provide housing for elderly families and/or non-elderly and disabled families. For covered section 8 projects for which the owner does not elect the subtitle D system of preferences, the new definition of ``elderly families'' established by section 621 of the 1992 HCD Act would not apply. Rather the former definition in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act, which includes the non-elderly disabled families in the meaning of ``elderly families,'' would be applicable, and elderly families under this broader definition (i.e., elderly families and disabled families) would be eligible for units in these projects for which the election of preferences was not taken to the same extent that such families were eligible before enactment of the 1992 HCD Act. The non-election of the subtitle D system of preferences does not override any occupancy requirements affecting covered section 8 housing designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families based on the authority of regulatory agreements or statutory provisions governing the FHA mortgage insurance programs. By way of example, the enabling statute for the Section 231 Program (``Housing Mortgage Insurance for the Elderly'') mandates that not less than 50 percent of the units in a Section 231 project must be designed for the use of elderly persons, meaning any person, married or single, who is 62 years of age or over. Accordingly, not all members of the entire population group encompassed by the pre-1992 HCD Act definition of ``elderly families'' ( i.e., elderly families and non-elderly disabled families), are eligible for elderly units in Section 231 projects. Application of the pre-1992 HCD Act definition could make it impossible to meet the statutory percentage requirement of the Section 231 Program or a higher percentage that may have been specified in the regulatory agreement or in other authority. Therefore, owners of Section 231 projects (where the projects are also covered section 8 housing designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families) who do not make an election to be covered by the subtitle D system of preferences will continue to follow the standards of Section 231 of the National Housing Act and the terms of their regulatory agreement or other controlling documentation in determining the eligibility of elderly families for occupancy in their projects. This position is consistent with section 657 of subtitle D which provides that where the owner does not elect the preference scheme, ``elderly families'' as defined by the pre-1992 HCD Act definition, shall be eligible for occupancy `` to the same extent that such families were eligible before the date of enactment [of the 1992 HCD Act.] (emphasis added.)''
