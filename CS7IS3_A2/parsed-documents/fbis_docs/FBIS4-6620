Watanabe was speaking about the possible timing of a dissolution of the House of Representatives and subsequent election at a general meeting of Diet members belonging to his faction, the third largest within the main opposition party. The election "will not be called for a certain period," the former deputy premier said, adding that "moves toward the general balloting will surface after the fall of next year." The veteran conservative politician was apparently referring to the likelihood that a new government under Tsutomu Hata would press ahead with Hata's proposal to contest the next general vote under a new election system that combines single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. Heads of coalition parties on Friday picked Foreign Minister Hata, who is head of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], as its candidate for the premiership. Hata, 58, is almost certain to win the two elections to be held Monday in plenary sessions of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors due to the coalition's majority.
