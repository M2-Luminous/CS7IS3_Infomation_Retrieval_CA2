China not only has leaped to a new height in scientific research in the nuclear field and in the peaceful use of nuclear technology, but at the same time it has also achieved a new glorious round on the major front of the national economy. At a news conference held today by the China National Nuclear Corporation, its President Jiang Xinxiong summarized the achievements the nuclear industry made in 1993 as follows: The nuclear power industry has developed steadily; new progress has been made in the nuclear fuel industry and in related scientific research; civilian production has achieved relatively large growth; the nuclear industry has further developed domestic and foreign markets; and scientific research has yielded a number of significant achievements. Nuclear power construction, being the main focus and strategic objective of the second pioneering undertaking, has achieved major progress since the beginning of the nineties. Since it started to generate power after hooking up with the power grid two years ago, the Qinshan Nuclear Plant, the first nuclear plant designed and built by China itself, has successfully increased its generating power in stages to full capacity, and fulfilled all its trial assignments. Currently, it is in a stage of safe, reliable, and high-power trial operations, which signifies that China's nuclear technology has entered a mature stage of development. The Daya Bay Nuclear Plant is one of the largest Sino-foreign joint ventures since the implementation of reform and open policy. The No. 1 generating unit, which successfully generated power after hooking up with the power grid in August this year, and fulfilled full-capacity operations in November, is expected to go into commercial production in February next year. The No. 2 generating unit will also be completed and put into operation in June 1994. It has been learned that when the two generating units are wholly put into commercial production, their annual generating capacity can reach 10 to 12.6 billion kw-hours. The designing of the second phase of the Qinshan Power Plant is in full swing, and gratifying progress has been made in site preparation work, with the recent opening of nearly 1,000 meters of tunnels. This shows that nuclear power has become an option for clearing the energy "bottleneck" in China, especially in the southeast coastal provinces and regions. The achievements in nuclear scientific research have been remarkable. Over the last 10 years, the nuclear industrial established has won state-class science and technology prizes for 330 projects. Research and designing work on the 300,000-kw Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, research into controlled nuclear fusion for China's No. 1 convector, the construction of a tandem accelerator laboratory, ground heap leaching technology in mineral and metallurgical fields, and the technology of separating uranium isotopes through centrifugal means have all yielded a number of significant scientific and technological achievements. It is learned that the key scientific research project for constructing a 600,000-kw nuclear plant is making good progress. Research into the disposal of radioactive wastes generated by nuclear installations has yielded results in various stages. What is even more eye- catching is that new breakthroughs have been made in enriched uranium production technology and equipment. The production line for producing components for a 900,000-kw pressurized water reactor imported by the 812 Plant from France has already been completed and has been appraised and examined by the French side. It will acquire production capacity next year and provide replacement fuel for the first furnace in the Daya Bay Nuclear Plant. Our country has also actively developed and utilized nuclear and related technologies to serve national economic construction. At present, our country has developed a number of pillar-type nonmilitary industries by using those technologies, including chemical fertilizers, titanium dioxide, metal magnesium, and fire alarms. The output value of items for nonmilitary use now accounts for more than 70 percent of the total output value of the nuclear industry. The application of radioactive isotopes in agriculture, industry, and medicine has created "nuclear agriculture," "nuclear medicine," and other specialized sciences. The radiation processing industry is developing in our country with an annual output value of more than 400 million yuan. All these have shown that nuclear technology has unnoticeably entered our daily lives. Meanwhile, our country has also actively strengthened economic and foreign trade work in the field of nuclear technology. Our country has exported nuclear products, nuclear technology, and nuclear engineering for peaceful use. We have exported nuclear power stations and nuclear reactors for research purposes to Pakistan, Iran, Algeria, and other countries [deng guo jia 4583 0948 1367], and China's nuclear-electric technology is now entering the international market.
