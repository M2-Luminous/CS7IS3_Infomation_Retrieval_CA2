In our country, experts from the nonferrous metals industry are used to setting every million metric ton of annual output of nonferrous metals as an output target. Last year, the annual output of our country's nonferrous metals industry exceeded 3 million metric tons, which implies that China's nonferrous metals industry has advanced its production forces and technical standards to another new level. Nonferrous metals, which have a wide application, are important resources for economic construction. As far as the electric industry is concerned, 800 metric tons of copper-aluminum are needed to generate every 10,000 kw of power; whereas 90 percent of structural materials of aircraft are aluminum-magnesium alloy. For quite a long period after the founding of new China, our country's nonferrous metals were treated as important strategic resources and the nonferrous metals industry was treated as a classified industry. At that time, information on the production and consumption of nonferrous metals was considered a secret, and the nonferrous metals industry developed slowly. In 1978, the output of our country's nonferrous metals was 996,000 metric tons, which had trouble meeting the needs of state construction. The nonferrous metals industry became a "bottleneck" industry which hindered the development of our national economy and society. Our country's nonferrous metals industry has achieved unprecedented large-scale development since China's National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation was founded in 1983. Over the past 11 years, our country's nonferrous metals industry achieved 2 million metric tons of net output increase and also doubled or redoubled taxes, fixed assets, and profits retained by enterprises. The brilliant achievements can be attributed to reform and opening up. It was precisely during the 15 years of reform and opening up that our country's nonferrous metals industry achieved rapid development. Up to 1988, the output of nonferrous metals surpassed the "second high plane" of 2 million metric tons, and, during this period, the output showed an annual average increase of 7.5 percent. On the other hand, only five years were spent moving from the "second high plane" to the "third high plane" of 3 million metric tons of annual output, with the annual average increase at 10 percent. Apart from output increase, the variety structure has also been optimized, and a more rapid development of varieties which have great market demand, such as aluminum and zinc, has been achieved. When the output of our country's nonferrous metals reached 1 million metric tons, aluminum accounted for 30 percent, and zinc accounted for 20 percent. In 1993, the proportion of aluminum and zinc increased to 38 percent and 23 percent respectively. In the 1990's, China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation has accelerated the pace of bringing enterprises to the market. At present, products which are priced according to the state plan only account for 1.5 percent of the total output; almost all products have entered the market; and the domestic and international markets have basically been merged into a single whole. Moreover, the China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation took the first step by setting up our country's first metal exchange in Shenzhen. In particular, it is worth mentioning that, apart from the 10 percent increase in output last year over that of the previous year, our country's nonferrous metals industrial sector also fully implemented the "three systems" reform in its subsidiary enterprises and vigorously called for "diversification with one business at the core." As a result, 10 percent of the total personnel of the whole industry were transferred to other trades and professions, and labor productivity was improved by 11 percent. People from economic circles consider that this phenomenon has major practical significance. Fei Ziwen, president of the China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation, said a few days ago that our country's nonferrous metals industry is now deliberating a major reform: The Corporation will turn over the function of administering the industry to a professional association, which is currently being organized, and will carry out the experiment of setting up state holding companies. It was learned that the professional association of China's nonferrous metals industry is expected to be founded during the first half of this year. The professional association, which nonferrous metals institutions and enterprises are going to join on a voluntary basis, will be a legal person which is an institution in nature and which will act as an intermediary between the government and enterprises. The government will entrust the professional association to administer the industry. When the professional association is officially founded, the China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation will go all out to run economic entities properly and will no longer administer the industry.
