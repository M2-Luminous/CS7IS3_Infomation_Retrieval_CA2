He said: Public security comprehensive management work, whether good or bad, will directly affect the success or failure in reform. Without stability as a guarantee, nothing can be accomplished. According to Xie Yong's introduction, our province will base on the guidelines of the NPC session and the national Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference session to strengthen public security comprehensive management work and proceed the work from six aspects in an effort to guarantee the creation of a good social environment for reform and economic construction. These six aspects of work are: 1. Urge leaders at all levels to assume responsibility over public security comprehensive management work, define the specific responsibilities on grasping public security comprehensive management work of the party and government leaders at all levels and the specific methods of supervision, restraint and award in line with the specific rules issued by the province earlier this year. 2. Enhance the degree of dealing blows to criminals and strengthen its social effect. This year Heilongjiang province will continue to carry out the work of dealing strict blows to criminals with an emphasis in cracking major cases, dealing blows to criminal cliques, and capturing escaped criminals in an effort to check the upward trend of major and appalling cases. 3. Eliminate repulsive social phenomena and consolidate the cultural markets. 4. Strengthen control over the crime development trend, intensify socialized security defense work, and further raise the level of socialized security defense in all places across the province. 5. Strengthen education and settlement of people who have been reformed through labor or education, and help and educate delinquents who have done misdeeds. 6. Give priority to improving areas and neighborhoods with disorderly public security situation. Xie Yong said: To fundamentally guarantee social stability, it is not realistic to rely only on the efforts of the public security, judicial, and procuratorial departments. All social sectors, particularly the party and government leaders, should also exert efforts, set examples with their own conduct and with the work of their own departments and units, and strive to eliminate all sorts of corrupt and unfair distribution problems which the people are much concerned about. In addition, we must proceed the work from the formulation of systems and establish and improve supporting reform measures to promote social stability. The establishment of the socialist market economic structure is a profound social reform, which will inenvitably bring some social vibrations. In order to reduce contradictions, we must step up efforts to establish and improve all supporting reform measures. Xie Yong believed that it is necessary to encourage all social sectors to use funds at their disposal to run all kinds of economic entities and industries, to gradually set up and develop all forms of labor markets, and to establish a complete set of social security systems, such as the unemployed insurance system, old-age pension insurance system, medical insurance system, and workers' injury insurance system, which are well coordinated with the new labor and distribution system so as to eliminate people's trouble back at home. Xie Yong said at the end of his speech: It is also necessary to try by all possible means to consolidate the mass security defense teams in the urban and rural areas, resolutely solve the issue that the formulation of laws can not catch up with the public security situation, and form a situation in which all levels and sectors jointly grasp and manage public security work in line with law.
