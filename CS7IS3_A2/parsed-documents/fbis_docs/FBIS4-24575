But she stressed that the settlement of the MFN issue does not mean sustained smoothness in Chinese-U.S. relations; instead, there are still many latent problems. Yuan Ming pointed out: As a matter of fact, the MFN issue has gone beyond the scope of bilateral relations. When making a decision on this, it was impossible for the United States to consider it in isolation from other issues, and, to a great extent, the United States was also restricted by other countries. She was of this opinion: Three forces made the Clinton administration unconditionally extend China's MFN status. The first was Europe and Japan. At a meeting of the U.S.-Japanese-European Trilateral Commission at the end of March this year, Japan and Europe strongly signaled relevant messages. The second were the multinational corporations, which have interests in the Chinese market. The third were China's neighbouring countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and so on. Yuan Ming pointed out that the settlement of the MFN issue is unquestionably good for Sino-U.S. relations and enables China and the United States to concentrate their attention on other important world affairs, including security in East Asia. But she stressed that the settlement of this year's MFN issue does not mean sustained smoothness in Chinese-U.S. relations. There have been changes in China, and the United States is also experiencing change, but due to prolonged historical and cultural differences, she pointed out that there are latent problems in Sino-U.S. relations. For example, theoretically, the United States acknowledges that China is important, but in reality it does not know how to proceed with this matter; U.S. companies in the Chinese market are not as competitive as Japanese, South Korean, Taiwan, or Hong Kong companies. In addition, following the economic development of East Asia, the awakening of "East Asian self-confidence" is regarded as an anti-Western ideology by the United States. She pointed out that China and the United States need to cooperate extensively in international affairs, which are linked to each other and cannot be viewed in isolation from each other, adding that China and the United States have many problems to resolve on security issues in Asia-Pacific in particular.
