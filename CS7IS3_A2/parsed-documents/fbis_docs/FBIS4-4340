But bureaucrats continue the foot-dragging while the public sentiment shifts from expectation to indifference. Where can creative energy for transcending the "Kim Yong-sam-style reform" be found, and how? Phase One of the Kim Yong-sam administration saw the civilian president lead the way with reforms based on his initiative and carry out the shifting of power within the ruling group to form a new clique. Also in this period, we saw a political world making little change in both players and in their performance, the vested interest groups persisting in obstinate resistance, the bureaucrats continuing the foot-dragging, and the public mood shifting, psychologically, from expectation to indifference. The first-year reforms, while proving successful in various sectors, demonstrated the limitations in strength and vision. As they encountered the "upheavals from the blitz" and the "post-Uruguay Round political crisis," the need for a turnabout in the atmosphere proved to be inevitable. As for President Kim, he must be hoping that his second year will be a period for him to expand reforms he launched and, at the same time, to prepare for major elections to be held successively, beginning in 1995. Consequently, the president is expected to maintain his initiative through continued reforms in specific sectors, such as those in the political, administrative, educational and other sectors, rather than the sort of reforms that accompany the shifting of power, and at the same time to put emphasis on internationalization and the revitalization of the economy. In political management, he will try to remove elements of political harassment and to focus--through a working-type staff--on intensifying his administrative push. On the other hand, the overall enhancement of economic logic will result in increased pressures on the workers. Kim Yong-sam's decision, announced in the New Year news conference held on 6 January, to postpone the national convention of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] was a multipurpose card. In connection with the postponement, media described it as if it had added to the importance of Kim Chong-pil, DLP chairman. As for Kim Chong-pil, however, who is a veteran politician, he must have sensed that it meant nothing more than an extension of his unstable political status, for the deferment deprived him of an opportunity to bolster his influence through a reelection. Furthermore, the decision seeks to prevent the election of a new party chairman from triggering a full-blown power struggle within the DLP, and the formation of a new party leadership from weakening the president's centripetal power. Thus, Kim Yong-sam sees a political realignment--in whatever form--as premature. The simple patch-up work with the DLP shows President Kim's will to continue his way of political management relying on Chongwadae staff and cabinet members. The DLP national convention was put off, ostensibly, for "sustained changes and reforms to build up the nation's economic strength." It actually is a move designed not only to suppress elements of political harassment within the DLP but to neutralize offensives from the opposition, thereby enhancing the cohesiveness of the executive power of the president. Needless to say, how it will work out is another question. The underlying tone was in evidence in the way the party and cabinet reshuffles were carried out. The late-December reshuffles and changes of Chongwadae staff could be viewed as the deployment to forward positions of figures close to President Kim and personalities of the new regime. They included Choe Hyong-u, minister of home affairs; Kim U-sok, minister of construction; So Chong-won, first minister of state; Yi Won-chong, senior presidential secretary for political affairs, and Mun Chong-su, a member of the former Democratic Party [DP] faction in the DLP who was appointed DLP secretary general. Also included were many promoted from among Phase-One staff members such as Yi Hoe-chang, who was appointed prime minister; Chong Chae-sok, director of the Economic Planning Board; Hwang Yong-ha, minister of government administration; Yi Pyong-tae, minister of national defense, and Kim Yang-pae, minister of agriculture and fisheries. An overall view of this new, Phase-Two lineup--including those retained from the previous lineup such as Pak Kwan-yong, Chongwadae secretary general--suggests that it is not a compromise arrangement but a measure giving priority to a setup that puts Kim Yong-sam more strongly in charge for an effective exercise of power. Also, the party and cabinet reshuffles seem to be aimed at straightening out the present bureaucratic system. The changes in administrative posts such as the new Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u, Government Administration Minister Hwang Yong-ha, and Yi Ui-kun, senior presidential secretary for administrative affairs, can be seen as a step to deal with the foot-dragging by bureaucrats and prepare for the gubernatorial and mayoral elections scheduled for next year. While President Kim is expected to take some actions for administrative reforms too, as he suggested in his New Year news conference, he seems to be also planning to use the local elections for a major step to correct the hardened arteries of the nation's officialdom. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that Assemblyman Kim Tok-yong, previously regarded as an influential person, was placed on "political probation." While it is in part an aspect of the power game within the DP faction, the development demonstrates President Kim's firm will to tolerate no potential elements that could weaken the president's power. Assemblyman Kim Tok-yong's comeback is of course possible but the fact that his associates, including some personalities of the 6.3 generation, were left out from the new lineup are full of suggestions, in many ways. Put simply, through the reshuffles and the decision to postpone the DLP national convention, the president let his strong will not to let go of his political centripetal power and his political initiative be known. However, the moves were passive and defensive ones in nature, rather than positive and offensive. As some called it "the DP-faction regime," they were tantamount to rearrangements of the line of battle inside the closed circuits of the president's men. The moves were made against the backdrops of the successes--and limitations--of reforms that were pushed on last year, and of the sociopolitical dynamical relationships as unveiled in that process. The series of reforms carried out in 1993 were in fact remarkably successful for the original limitations surrounding the regime, thanks largely to the will of the president and expectations of the people. Powers were restructured through the public disclosures of property owned by high officials, the successive audit-and-inspection probes, the by-elections, the rush of personnel changes, as well as the presidential decree outlawing the uses of aliases or borrowed names in financial transactions; as a result, President Kim succeeded in dismantling the political military leadership that had been the core of power in this country. However, except for securing power in the very core of government and implementing partial reshuffles in several departments, he failed to deliver fundamental reorganizations of power and politics. The fate of the probe into property owned by public officials that ended in an anticlimax, and the proposed amendments to political laws that failed to be acted on, demonstrated this reality symbolically. President Kim, preparing for his second year in power under such circumstances, had these options: arriving at some power-sharing compromises with the vested interest groups; on the contrary, bringing in pro-reform forces from outside to expand his reform hegemony; or putting off such political maneuvers until the political season of candidate endorsing for the scheduled elections and, for now, strengthening his direct exercise of power through aides close to him. He chose the last option, as seen in the party and cabinet reshuffles. The action is, of course, based on the consideration that this is the only election-free year of his tenure, but it also reflects the present situation where the power balance is not in favor of an immediate settlement of a political deadlock and where the time is not ripe for it either. In the final analysis, the recent reshuffles were made not in the direction of expanding the reform hegemony, involving either vested interest groups or pro-reform forces, but took the form of placing the president's men in forward positions; therefore, it became difficult to expect an expansion, horizontal or downward, of the power base. This also means that there will come a time sooner or later when the existing human resources for replacements will be exhausted. Considering these factors, it is more appropriate to view the recent reshuffles as a passive defense of the existing front than as an expression of President Kim's self-confidence. It can be said that Phase One was dedicated, basically, to political reforms to liquidate military rule and authoritarianism, reforms to end irrationalities in the financial and other branches, and to the New Growth economic line. The broad framework defining the nature and depth of future reforms is not likely to surpass that of the Phase One program. However, things noteworthy will be: In his push for administrative and educational reforms, how successful will the president be in overcoming the reactions of the vested interested groups? And what kind of social tensions will the pressures on the workers from various internationalization programs create? Some observe that a breakthrough in North-South Korea relations may emerge as a political factor; however, while there may come some partial improvements in relations, it is difficult to expect an epoch-making change. After all, the speed and intensity of specific reforms will be fluid, not fixed, depending on the outcome of competition and cooperation between the forces involved. Although big-size reforms on the second-year agenda will be fewer than in the first year, the offensive and defensive battles will intensify between forces over specific reforms--and over how the turf boundaries, left ambiguous by the first-year reforms, should be reestablished. I referred, in the opening part of this article, to the political world with little change, with the same players playing in the same fashion, be it the ruling camp or the opposition; the obstinate resistance of the vested interest groups; the continued foot-dragging of bureaucrats, and to the mood of the public shifting psychologically from expectation to indifference. Over the period from the Yellow Sea ferry disaster to the furor over the opening of the rice market, we saw President Kim's initiative running into difficulties everywhere, and a strange mood of indifference proliferating in public opinion. It can be said that the Phase One reforms actually entered a new critical stage immediately after the financial reform--"the reform of all reforms"--was put into effect. As asserted by many, it is true that this situation basically stemmed from the limitations inherent in the Kim Yong-sam government, but such rhetoric alone cannot solve the problem. In fact, we see more fundamental limitations with the reform capabilities and the vision of our whole society, do we not? Debates merely highlighting "the limitations of the president" can be a way of political offensive but they do not serve the purpose of finding a way for true, in-depth reforms. And it is the task of history unaffected by personal interests of any individuals that our society needs overall reforms and that they have to be more thoroughgoing ones than the Kim Yong-sam-style reforms. Criticisms against the ruling party can be effective only when backed up by counterproposals superior to theirs instead of indulging in faultfinding. A look at the various difficulties confronting the reform program shows that we cannot afford to sweep everything under the carpet by blaming it on the "original sin of the three-party merger" and that we ourselves have a great deal of homework to do, namely, self-reforms in various fields. So, we will examine a few points in this respect, from the viewpoint of how to revitalize the reform capabilities of the entire society, let alone the conservative, vested interest groups whose ears are "deaf to any preaching." Let's begin with problems inside the civil society. De Tocqueville and many scholars after him maintained that the civil society is the very stronghold of democracy. Despite degrees of difference, the latest line of debate on democracy basically holds that we should revitalize the independent, critical energy of civil society and intervene in the coming onslaught of the logic of power and economy with the principle of democracy, forcefully and to the maximum degree. Democratization has become the general trend since the June Uprising despite turns and twists. Progress in democratization means the process of ending the suffocation of civil society at the hands of state power. As democracy advances, the days of almighty state power are fading into the past, giving way to an era in which the civil society has a distinct role of checking antireform reactions of the vested interest groups. However, our civil society today lies in a state of "too much money power and too little citizen power." In other words, vacancies created by the retreating state power are being filled not by the sound citizen power but by the exorbitant money power. Furthermore, forums and media are largely in the grip of established journalism which is weak in its consciousness of history and not positive for reform (and is even conservative). The logic of citizens for establishing their autonomous, collective identity is suffocating under the pressures of parochialism and built-in connections, which make rational judgment itself impossible. The creative energy of citizens is far from being revitalized. Viewing the present situation in this light, we find that the overall strengthening of the reform fronts through self-reforms of the civil society and struggles against the vested interest groups entrenched in it, along with the unity of the sound energy of the civil society, is our major task. And social movements, precisely, provide opportunities for positive demonstrations of the autonomous energy and critical power of the civil society. There is a need to further develop diverse citizen movements, including environmental, consumer, women's, civic legislation, media reform, human rights, watch-parliament, and political reform movements and movements for economic justice, as well as the traditional mass movements such as labor and peasant movements. To that end, the government should lift not only economic controls but also various other restraints on social movements. At the same time, each social movement should make self-reforms to ensure support and participation by a majority of the people. This process involves the abilities of self-reflection and solidarity, including those to reexamine one's own vision, stamp out factional vestiges, renew the sense of responsibility toward the state and the times, and to wage criticism backed up by alternatives. Also, it is necessary to do away with the way of thinking that what a certain person says or what a certain group does is always right or always wrong, and to develop maturity in perception so that we can weigh any specific position on its merit. In particular, it is important in this period of transition that in countering the resistance of vested interest groups, we actively focus on pending reform issues. Without changes in the political power and political camps, social movements alone have their limitations, in many ways. Speaking of political camps, the problems are far more serious. Earlier in this article, I pointed out that President Kim employed a stop-gap policy toward the ruling camp to preserve his centripetal power. The opposition party did the same thing. While the viability of Chairman Yi Ki-taek and his faction in the Democratic Party remains a question, it also appears difficult for the increasingly visible "nonmainstream alliance," led by Assemblyman Kim Sang-hyon and Supreme Committee members Yi Pu-yong and No Mu-hyon, to free itself from the magnetic field of Kim Tae-chung, the former party chairman. Thus, the two-Kim era is still on. With a view to keeping their own political influence from being weakened, the two Kims are deliberately preventing a new leadership from emerging. To make it worse, the TK [Taegu-Kyongsang] force says it will carry on the "Taegu sentiment," while the Sinjong Party of Assemblyman Pak Chan-chong is trying to take advantage of anti-DLP, anti-Democratic Party feelings and fish in troubled waters. From all this, we can reconfirm a political world in which reforms are being stalled because of the same old regional political turfs. The Kim Yong-sam administration has entered its second year, with no change at all in this respect. A political landscape like this renders it impossible to promote a productive competition between a reform plan and its alternative. President Kim emphatically stated that his administration will seek justice based on facts and promote pragmatic well-being. For now, success with the policies is difficult to expect, however. They are bound to end up in unproductive skirmishes between political forces; moreover, they will basically impede the development of a desirable public opinion structure in our society. Furthermore, the continued presence of the regional political turfs means that there will be unopposed elections in many districts once candidates obtain party endorsements. Government for the people is simply impossible under such circumstances. It also means that the rooms are extremely narrow for both the ruling and opposition camps to bring in fresh forces from outside. This would even disrupt the normal relationships among the state, the political communities and the civil society, and we will see only reports of the political sphere's foul power games fill up the pages of the media. As long as that sort of situation continues, the nonresponse of the majority of our people to President Kim's reform program--and to the activities of the political world--will also continue. The nation's political sector remains least competitive of all in this era of internationalization. The problem is that the range of possible reform within the established political world is extremely narrow. This raises the question: Should we remain a spectator to the power games that continue to be waged over parochial interests--or pry the established political world with a lever of realignment from outside? The civil society is indeed faced with the dual tasks to further elevate the levels of its movements on one hand and, on the other, to form new political forces to usher in a truly new era. This is not to say that the established political world should be shunned in its entirety, but that there is a need to first establish a leadership to speed up its reforms and changes and lead it in a desirable direction. What is truly needed at this point of time is a challenge and practice to bring an end to the era of epigones, rather than commentaries on the same old things. If we should seek a career in the shadow of existing authority or be content with peace within our private castle, we can neither open the horizon of reform forcefully nor produce a dignified political leadership worthy of a transition period. The need to transcend the era of epigones is not confined to political practices. The roaring tide of the transition period demands that the administration, the legislature, the judicature, businesses, schools, research institutes, media, citizen movements and all other organizations launch sweeping reform drives. The political world may be adrift as it is, but our society, having no surpluses of time and resources, cannot afford to delay those reforms in any specific sectors. In conclusion, let me add that I firmly believe that each and every sector has its reformists with true passions.
