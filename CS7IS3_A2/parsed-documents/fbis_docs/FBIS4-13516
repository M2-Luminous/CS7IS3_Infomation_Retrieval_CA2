The participants from more than 40 countries and organisations also approved offers by several industrial states to provide technical assistance and training to the region to enable it to ease a chronic water shortage. Oman's proposal for setting up a water desalination research centre won unanimous approval and a committee would be formed to carry out the project. "As a first step to enhancing water supplies, the working group approved an Omani proposal for a desalination research and technology centre in Muscat," a statement said. Delegates described the water committee's fifth round as the most successful since the negotiations began two years ago in Vienna as part of the multilateral phase of Middle East talks launched in Madrid in 1991. But the final session hit a snag when Jordan, attending as an observer, threatened to oppose the meeting's decisions if the United States did not raise the issue of its boycott at the talks. Jordan is boycotting meetings with Israel to press Western forces to ease their naval interceptions off the port of Aqaba under the UN embargo of Iraq. Delegates said the final session was held up for more than six hours as Palestinians and other Arab delegates mediated to end the standoff by holding contacts with the US representative and Jordan's observer Ali al-Ghazzawi. "Al-Ghazzawi insisted he would deliver a speech demanding that the US delegates mention the reason for Jordan's absence from the talks," a conference source said. "He threatened to express reservations on the results at the meeting and to refer them to the Jordanian government. This could mean that the decisions of the meeting were not reached by consensus." The sources said the problem was resolved following intensive contacts between Washington and Amman. The statement said the other four projects covered a US proposal for waste water treatment and re-use facilities in the region, an Israeli proposal to rehabilitate municipal water supply systems, a German study on supply and demand, and a joint US-European Union training programme. It said the participants supported the idea of enhancing data availability in the region and welcomed the announcement of the creation of a Palestinian Water Authority (PWA). "The Israeli delegation welcomed the announcement of the PWA and expressed an interest in working with the Omani research centre on solar energy for desalination," the statement said. It said the participants approved an Israeli proposal to rehabilitate and make more efficient municipal water supply systems in small-sized committees. Experts from concerned parties will be convened to plan the next steps, it added. Delegates at the three-day talks, opened by Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin-Alawi bin-'Abdallah, [title as received] said most of the funds for the projects would be provided by Japan and other key industrial nations once the agreements were signed. "We are very happy with this meeting," an Israeli delegate said. "Results like these will encourage all of us to press on with moves to establish confidence and cooperation in the region."
