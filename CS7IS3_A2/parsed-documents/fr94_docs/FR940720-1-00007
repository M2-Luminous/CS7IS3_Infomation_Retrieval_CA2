FR940720-1-00007 FR940720-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;48&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Aerospatiale Model ATR42&hyph;200, &hyph;300, and &hyph;320 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive that is applicable to certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42&hyph;200, &hyph;300, and &hyph;320 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the wiring in the elevator controls and the pitch trim dissymmetry monitoring equipment. This proposal is prompted by a report of loss of a propeller and engine gearbox, which resulted in damage to the fuselage. There has also been a report that a modification was implemented in the elevator control cables during manufacture, which reduced the maximum physical separation between the elevator controls and the monitoring equipment. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent reduced controllability of the airplane in the event that debris from an engine burst or propeller failure were to strike the fuselage and sever the elevator flight controls. DATES: Comments must be received by September 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;48&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
