FR940418-1-00033 FR940418-1-00008 FEDERAL COMMUNICATION COMMISSIONS 47 CFR PART 64 [CC Docket No. 91&hyph;281; FCC 94&hyph;59] Calling Number Identification Service_Caller ID AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rules. SUMMARY: In a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking adopted March 8, 1994, the Commission required that carriers participating in the offering of calling party number based services must inform telephone customers regarding the availability of identification services and how to invoke the privacy protection mechanism. For ANI or charge number services for which such privacy is not provided, the rules require that the notification inform telephone customers of the restrictions on the reuse or sale of subscriber information. In the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking adopted March 8, 1994, the Commission seeks comments on whether the Commission should prescribe more detailed instructions regarding subscriber education requirements, and on whether the policies for calling party number delivery adopted in the Report and Order should extend to other services. DATES: Comments are due May 18, 1994, and reply comments due June 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications, Commission, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Suzanne Hutchings, Domestic Services Branch, Domestic Facilities Division, Common Carrier Bureau, (202) 634&hyph;1802, or Olga Madruga-Forti, Domestic Services Branch, Domestic Facilities Division, Common Carrier Bureau, (202) 634&hyph;1816. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This summarizes the Commission's Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the matter of Rules and Policies Regarding Calling Number Identification Service. The item was adopted by the Commission on March 8, 1994, and released March 29, 1994, and bears the title of ``Rules and Policies Regarding Calling Number Identification Services_Caller ID'', Report and Order (R&O) and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Further NPRM) (CC Docket 91&hyph;281, FCC 94&hyph;59). The R&O is summarized elsewhere in this issue. The Further NPRM and supporting file are available for inspection and copying during the weekday hours of 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the FCC Reference Center, room 239, 1919 M St., NW., Washington, DC, or copies may be purchased from the Commission's duplicating contractor, ITS, 2100 M St., NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, phone (202) 857&hyph;3800. The Further NPRM will be published in the FCC Record. Analysis of Proceeding This summarizes the Commission's Further NPRM in the matter of Rules and Policies Regarding Calling Number Identification Services_Caller ID, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (CC Docket 91&hyph;281, FCC 94&hyph;59, adopted March 8, 1994, and released March 29, 1994). In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, adopted October 23, 1991, (56 FR 53700, November 8, 1991), the Commission proposed to establish federal policies and rules concerning interstate calling number identification service (caller ID). On March 8, 1994, the Commission adopted a Report and Order which found that a federal model for interstate delivery of calling party number is in the public interest, that calling party privacy must be protected, and that certain state regulation of interstate calling party number (CPN) based services, including interstate caller ID, must be preempted. Specially, the Commission's rules require that common carriers using Common Channel Signalling System 7 (SS7) and subscribing to or offering any service based on SS7 functionality must transmit the calling party number parameter and its associated privacy indicator on an interstate call to connecting carriers. The rules also require that carriers offering CPN delivery services provide, at no charge to the caller, an automatic per call blocking mechanism for interstate callers. The rules require that terminating carriers providing calling party based services, including caller ID, honor the privacy indicator. The Commission found that the costs of interstate transmission of CPN are de minimis, and that the CPN should be transmitted among carriers without additional charge. The rules adopted in the R&O require that carriers participating in the offering of any service that delivers CPN on interstate calls inform telephone subscribes that the subscriber's number may be revealed to called parties and describe what steps subscribers can take to avoid revealing their numbers. Further, the Commission adopts rules restricting the reuse or sale of information generated by automatic number identification (ANI) or charge number services, absent affirmative subscriber consent. In the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Further NPRM) adopted March 8, 1994, the Commission seeks comment on whether it should prescribe detailed instructions regarding what form education should take or prescribe more precisely responsibilities of various carriers. The Commission stated a particular interest in specific joint industry education proposals. In the Further NPRM, the Commission tentatively concludes that its policies for calling party number delivery should apply equally to services delivering calling party name, and seeks comment on this tentative conclusion. It also seeks comment on whether the policies adopted in the Report and Order should be extended to other services that might identify the calling party.
