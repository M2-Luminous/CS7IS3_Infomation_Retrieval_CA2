FBIS4-33715 "drlat112_m_94009" FBIS-LAT-94-112 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 Brazil `Elite' Land Ownership Contributes to Poverty `Elite' Land Ownership Contributes to Poverty PY0906001794 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2010 GMT 7 Jun 94 PY0906001794 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO Portuguese BFN [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 7 June (AE) -- Less than 1 percent of the farms throughout the country are larger than 1,000 hectares, yet they occupy 43.73 percent of Brazilian rural territory. Paradoxically, farms of 10 hectares represent 52.83 percent of the establishments, yet occupy only 2.66 percent of rural territory. This concentration of land in the hands of an elite of farmers is causing the expulsion of peasants and increasing the population in urban areas. Consequently, 21 percent of the Brazilian population, or 32 million people, are destitute. This phenomenon is causing another unsolvable problem: conflicts between the landless and farmers. In 1993 alone there were more than 900 conflicts over the possession of land in the Amazon region. This information is contained in research conducted by geographer Dora Hess of the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE), which was published in Rio de Janeiro today during National Environment Week. According to Hess, the 32 million destitute result from the excessive concentration of income (10 percent of the poor receive only 0.8 percent of the income, while 10 percent of the rich receive 48 percent); 12 million workers (20 percent of the economically active population) barely earn one minimum salary; and the purchasing power of the poor and middle class salaries has deteriorated. Hess asserts that "for the past 15 years Brazil has been living in recession because the employment levels have remained unchanged, the consumption power has dropped, and investments have been made in highly qualified jobs such as industrial automation." In the survey, which will be published in France, Hess quotes economist Paulo Schilling to refer to the generalized impoverishment of workers. In 1960, according to Schilling, a family basket cost 26 percent of the minimum salary. In 1992 it cost 78 percent of the minimum salary. Early this year, the minimum salary did not cover the cost of the family basket. Another consequence of this prolonged recession is the increasing number of children between the ages of 10 and 13 on the job market. Hess states that "almost 14.15 percent of children at this age already work, and this percentage increases to 58.89 percent in the rural regions." There are 3.8 million Brazilians living in shantytowns in nine metropolitan regions, according to another survey conducted by IBGE geographer Helena Balaciano. The Recife metropolitan region occupies first place with 678,586 (24.6 percent), followed by Belem (19.2 percent), Fortaleza (15.6 percent), Rio de Janeiro (12 percent), Belo Horizonte (10.9 percent), Sao Paulo (7.5 percent), Curitiba (5.9 percent), Porto Alegre (5.3 percent), and Salvador (4.1 percent). According to Helena Balaciano, the suburbs of the large and medium-sized cities currently have to deal with the shantytown phenomenon because Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are no longer attractive to migrants. Another phenomenon is that the largest number of people living in shantytowns are concentrated in the suburbs of municipal districts rather than in the capitals themselves, such as in Betim (15 percent, ouutside Minas Gerais), and Diadema (20 percent, outside Sao Paulo). Moreover, Curitiba district, with 6.9 percent of the population living in shantytowns due to the expulsion of landless people from the rural region, holds the record for all metropolitan region suburbs.
