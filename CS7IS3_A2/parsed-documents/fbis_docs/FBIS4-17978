Two soldiers from the Russian "blue helmets" battalion had been taken as hostages, but they were released the next morning. The warring and interested parties are in a state of some confusion. The "lessons of Gorazde" are still being assessed, and this they are doing in the State Duma. The flames could have been extinguished before the bomb attacks, Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma International Affairs Committee, believes. Before the Bosnian Serbs were "forced to show they were not afraid" in response to the "deterrence strategy." The latest spiral in the crisis in Bosnia, Lukin believes, demonstrated the "ineptitude" of the U.S. Administration, which is linking bombing raids in former Yugoslavia to the domestic political situation at home, the fact that the West Europeans are "easily persuaded," since they opted for a "diplomatic facade rather than political decisions," and also the "weakness and incoherence of Russian diplomacy." The deputy paid tribute to the flexibility of the West, which had "given the Serbs a way out," and to Boris Yeltsin's timely intervention, which was carried out not through "Russian diplomats in the field," but directly, although "within the framework of nonpublic diplomacy." Although the departure of the president's special envoy from the trouble spot was seen as a positive contribution, Moscow's actual participation in the efforts to unravel the Balkan knot of tension was not called into question. Bosnia has demonstrated, though, that neither the West nor Russia "will be able to handle it alone." There was criticism in the Duma of the Clinton administration, which is following ideologized precepts: The Serbs are an enemy who must be punished, but U.S. soldiers must not die and the U.S. taxpayer must not bear the extra cost. Lukin, Russian ambassador in Washington, observed: "The methods of indoctrination employed in the United States often remind me of the methods used in North Korea." The head of the parliamentary committee suggested that Russian shuttle diplomacy should not be so closely linked to the "personal factor," so that "people like me do not begin to suspect that ambition plays too great a part in it." "Personal resentment and disappointment" must not be allowed to come into it, a diplomat must not lose his cool," Vladimir Lukin said, although he did not once mention the name of Vitaliy Churkin. You might say the gist of the speech was that you have to "play as a team." The Duma delegation, made up on a factional basis, which toured the republics of former Yugoslavia, showed how to play as a team. In a statement for ITAR-TASS in Belgrade, Duma Deputy Konstantin Zatulin expressed regret that "mature diplomats preferred vexation to patience," by echoing the "rhetoric on the benefit of ultimatums." Delegation head Nikolay Bezborodov expressed his colleagues' view that the Duma must raise the question of lifting sanctions against the Serb Republic of Yugoslavia and pass it to the United Nations for a final decision. It is believed that, before ending up on the president's desk, the Duma's recommendations will absorb two traditional elements from the diplomatic arsenal -- "pressure and encouragement"; the latter will incorporate a proposal on a stage-by-stage lifting of sanctions.
