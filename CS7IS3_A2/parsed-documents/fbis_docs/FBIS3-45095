Yeh Men-sheng, vice chairman and executive director of the Commission of National Corporations, said the Legislature in mid- December approved a proposal to privatize the Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corp. (TMMC), BES [expansion unknown] Engineering Corp., and China Petrochemical Development Corp. (CPDC) before fiscal 1994 ends on June 30. Of these, the TMMC will be sold to the private sector directly through an open tender, while the BES and the CPDC will undergo public underwriting prior to open tender. Yeh said his commission is stepping up related preparations for the privatization of these three enterprises. He continued that the BES and the CPDC will release 170 million shares and 330 million shares, respectively, for public sales before the end of June. Meanwhile, the state-run China Steel Corp., which will be fully turned to private hands before fiscal 1995 ends on June 30, 1995, will release as many as 1.535 billion shares, some 22 percent of its total shareholdings, before the end of June 1994. Accordingly, there are more than 2 billion shares to be made available for public sales in the coming six months. In order not to affect the performance of local stock market, the release will be enforced in several stages of time before June 30, Yeh said. He added that Taiwan Fertilizer Corp. will go private in fiscal 1995, and China Shipbuilding Corp. in fiscal 1997. And the remaining six enterprises under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, such as Taiwan Power Company, Chinese Petroleum Corp., Taiwan Sugar Corp., and Taiwan Salt Works will be privatized before fiscal 2001. Statistics showed that in the third quarter of last year, the 10 state-owned enterprises recorded total earnings of NT$ [New Taiwan dollars] 37.6 billion, some NT$7.4 billion higher than the firms' projected earnings. The reasons cited for the higher-than-predicted earnings included reduced costs for power generation at Taiwan Power Company, cheaper crude oil prices which cut costs for the Chinese Petroleum Corp., a stabilization of the market for a variety of products manufactured by state-owned companies, and improved efficiency at the firms. Nevertheless, the investment growth rate of the state-run firms was estimated to slide to only 1.6 percent in 1993 to hit a five- year low, compared with 9.59 percent in 1991. The sluggishness of investment activities by government enterprises was attributed to the established policy of privatization, slowdown of economic recovery and in increase in environment-related protests.
