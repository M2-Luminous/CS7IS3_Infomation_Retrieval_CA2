Differences continue to exist over the Jericho region, control of the Gaza-Jericho autonomous region's borders with Egypt and Jordan, and the security situation in the Zionist occupied settlements in Gaza and Jericho. It is said that Yasir 'Arafat, representing the Palestinian side, lacks effective levers or pressure on the Zionist bully, and that he accepted some mediocre solutions in the Davos talks and passed on suggestions through Shim'on Peres, foreign minister of the Zionist regime, to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of the occupying regime so that he could announce the final view regarding them. At the end of yesterday's discussion 'Arafat tried again to create the illusion that differences between the Palestinian and Israeli sides are being solved, and hoped that a new agreement will soon be signed between Rabin and himself in the presence of Mubarak. However, Shim'on Peres declined to express hope over the Davos talks. Some political analysts believe the failure to determine a date for signing the new agreement indicates the vagueness and lack of clarity rather than a definite outcome of talks between 'Arafat and Peres -- in particular because it has been decided that they should continue the discussions in Cairo. Meanwhile it seems that 'Arafat hopes, through concessions to the Zionist side, to take over the internal affairs of Gaza and Jericho soon. Thus 'Arafat's hopefulness is more a result of concessions to Israel but it is not clear whether the occupying regime will be satisfied with the new concessions, particularly because from the point of view of the Zionist regime the issue of controlling the borders of Gaza and Jericho with Egypt and Jordan is related to the security of the Zionist regime and this is not an issue over which Israel would easily come to an arrangement or hand over completely to the Palestinians. From the point of view of the Zionist regime, the security of the occupiers is supreme to any form of credibility and it must be maintained at any cost, even with the violation of the security and national sovereignty of others. However, it is possible to predict that talks between 'Arafat and Tel Aviv will continue endlessly over differences and obstacles to the Gaza-Jericho plan. 'Arafat has burned all his bridges behind him and Israel feels that the present buoyant situation is in its interests because, without giving any rights to the Palestinians, it is receiving concessions from the Arabs and the West. This situation was predicted earlier because the autonomy agreement was designed to have sufficient ambiguity and contradictions as to allow excuses for delays to its implementation. However, the problem is not limited to the Davos talks. The main crisis lies in the occupied lands. Israel has intensified its suppression and the Palestinians have intensified the conflict with the Zionist occupiers. The presence of 'Arafat's Fatah forces alongside the Islamists in confrontation with the Zionist regime is significant. This is an indication that 'Arafat has lost the game not only to Israel. A more important card is the people of the occupied lands and the younger radical Fatah forces whom 'Arafat has lost to the Islamists and the Islamic intefada. In the past few days, while discussions were under way between 'Arafat and Israel, radical Fatah youths carried out at least two anti-Israeli operations which indicate that differences between Fatah and 'Arafat are increasing.
