FR940323-0-00071 FR940323-0-00020 §2523.70 Will the Corporation give special consideration to Federal agency applications that address certain needs? Yes. The Corporation will give special consideration to those applications that address the national priorities established by the Corporation. The Corporation may also give special consideration to those applications that demonstrate the agency's intent to leverage its own funds through a Corporation-approved partnership or consortium, by raising other funds from Federal or non-Federal sources, by giving grantees incentives to build service opportunities into their programs, by committing appropriate in-kind resources, or by other means. §2523.80 Are there restrictions on the use of Corporation funds? Yes. The supplantation and nondisplacement provisions specified in part 2540 of this chapter apply to the Federal AmeriCorps programs supported with such assistance. §2523.90 Is there a matching requirement for Federal agencies? No. A Federal agency is not required to match funds in programs that receive support under this chapter. However, Federal agency subgrantees are required to match funds in accordance with the requirements of §2521.30(g) and § 2522.240(b)(5) of this chapter. §2523.100 Are participants in programs operated by Federal agencies Federal employees? No. Participants in these programs have the same employee status as participants in other approved AmeriCorps programs, and are not considered Federal employees, except for the purposes of the Family and Medical Leave Act as specified in §2540.220(b) of this chapter. §2523.110 Can Federal agencies submit multiple applications? No. The Corporation will only consider one application from a Federal agency for each AmeriCorps competition. The application may propose more than one program, however, and the Corporation may choose to fund any or all of those programs. §2523.120 Must Federal agencies consult with State Commissions? Yes. Federal agencies must provide a description of the manner in which the proposed AmeriCorps program(s) is coordinated with the application of the State in which the projects will be conducted. Agencies must also describe proposed efforts to coordinate AmeriCorps activities with State Commissions and other funded AmeriCorps programs within the State in order to build upon existing programs and not duplicate efforts.
