FR941103-0-00011 FR941103-0-00003 Based on these facts, we anticipate that competition between United States-produced dry-cured pork products and the proposed imported dry-cured pork products will be insignificant. In 1990, the United States produced 9,652,933 metric tons of pork and pork products, valued at about $11.3 billion. Additionally, the United States imported about 232,253 metric tons of pork. Imports accounted for about 2 percent of the pork available in the domestic market during 1990. Figures for 1990 indicate that approximately 429 metric tons of dry-cured pork products were imported under the current regulations. This compares with 349,119 metric tons of all pork products imported during 1990, or 0.0012 percent. Potential imports of dry-cured pork products would therefore account for less than 1 percent of total annual pork imports. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
