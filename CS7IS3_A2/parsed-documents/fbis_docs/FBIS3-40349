This was the major point made by the Commission speaker at a well attended IETT [Institute of European Trade and Technology] conference on the subject in London on November 9th. The speaker was Dr. Maurice Lex, who, before moving to the CEC's [Commission of the European Community] Biotechnology Unit in Brussels, was Acting Director of SERC's [Science and Engineering Research Council] Biotechnology Directorate. He went on to list what the Commission sees as Europe's chief weaknesses in the area. These are: -- Lack of consensus on the scientific objectives to be aimed for; -- The relative isolation of academic research; -- A complex regulatory system which many find hostile to research; -- Under development of the SME sector; -- A poor and declining public perception and understanding of biotechnology. (This Dr. Lex identified as perhaps the most significant weakness. Even a small amount of negative coverage on TV, he said, can have a powerful effect on public opinion, even putting students off deciding to specialize in the subject). It was sad to see European companies moving their research activities to the United States where regulations are easier, he commented. So far, Member States had come together in joint projects as part of CEC programmes. More collaboration is needed. But Europe does have its strengths, too: -- Biotechnology is given reasonable priority in the Member States; -- There are substantial investments in R&D by large companies, mainly chemical, agro-chemical, seed and pharmaceutical companies; -- Collaborative behavior has been stimulated by previous EC programmes; -- There is strong involvement of a large cross-section of industry in horizontal activities -- CEFIC [European Council of Federations of the Chemical Industry], SAGB [Senior Advisory Group on Biotechnology], National Biotech Associations, Industrial Platforms etc.; -- High expectations from various parts of society for various reasons. There would be a very significant increase in the funds available for supporting biotechnology research in the fourth framework programme, Dr. Lex told the conference. He also referred to three recent reports issued by the industrial R&D committee (IRDAC) of the EC on the life sciences programmes -- covering in particular biomedical research, and agriculture, biochemical and food, with reference to the fourth Framework Programme. IRDAC calls for more industrial participation in all projects, and identifies a number of lateral issues which merit special attention including training, productive systems, safety regulation, intellectual property and education.

As previously reported, there is a third call for proposals under the current CEC Biotechnology programme with a deadline of 12.1.94. An information pack may be obtained from: E. Magnien, DGXII-E/1.
