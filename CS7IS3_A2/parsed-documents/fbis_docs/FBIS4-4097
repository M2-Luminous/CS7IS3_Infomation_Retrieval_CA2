Chiang said on Tuesday [26 April] that cross-strait economic and trade ties put on hold in the wake of the Qiandao Lake disaster are anticipated to resume as before. Chiang called the incident an isolated happenstance, and said that now that Beijing has concluded its inquiry into the case, the barrier that has blocked cross-strait ties for more than three weeks should be partly removed. Beijing announced last week that three suspects had been seized for robbing and killing 24 Taiwan tourists, two mainland guides and six crewmen aboard a cruise boat touring the lake, which is in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Beijing's handling of the incident included a cover-up attempt and the restriction of the victims' relatives' movement, and prompted the government to put a brake on bilateral ties. The Ministry of Economic Affairs earlier in the month suspended screening applications for mainland-bound investments and said it would not continue to raise the quotas for mainland raw materials and semi-finished products allowed into Taiwan. Chiang said the purpose behind the ministry's decision was to call attention to the high risks Taiwan investors face on the mainland. Now that this has been accomplished, he said, mainland investment and expanded import of mainland materials can continue, as long as the Mainland Affairs Council approves. Chiang's remarks are seen by many here as a gesture of eased tensions between Taipei and Beijing. Just after the disaster, President Li Teng-hui was indignant, saying the mainland was ruled by a group of "bandits" who should be overthrown by the people.
