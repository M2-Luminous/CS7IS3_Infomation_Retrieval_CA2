As Yemen is the current chairman of the Arab League, Yemeni Charge d'Affaires Ahmad Shahir Sayf opened the meeting by thanking Egypt for calling this meeting to stop the bloodshed in Yemen, halt the military operations, and invite the concerned parties to sit at the negotiating table instead of arguing with guns. The Yemeni official said he finds it very difficult to continue chairing this meeting as a Yemeni citizen whose heart is bleeding because of the developments in Yemen. He announced that he had relinquished the chairmanship to another country. After the Yemeni delegate's speech, Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid announced Ambassador Nayif Sa'ud al-Qadi, Jordan's permanent delegate to the Arab League, would chair the emergency meeting, being next alphabetically. Opening the session, Ambassador Nayif al-Qadi said: I would like to express deep sorrow and pain at the situation in a country we love. He expressed his regret that the Yemeni leaders had abandoned dialogue and reason and resorted to guns. He added: We do not take what is happening in fraternal Yemen lightly, because the developments will not be confined to Yemen and its people. Their repercussions will affect us all. No Arab country will be removed from what has happened and the bleeding wound will expand if we do not hasten to bind it. Al-Qadi noted that Jordan was among the first parties to seek to mediate to help resolve the Yemeni crisis. He said, with help from the Omani brothers, his country managed to broker the Pledge and Accord Document which was signed in the Jordanian capital by Yemeni leaders in the presence of several Arab leaders. The Yemenis wanted this document as a means out of the crisis. He added that mediation did not cease after the signing of this agreement, and noted the efforts of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and the Arab League, which all sought to provide controls to prevent military friction and avert what we had expected and feared. He called on the Arab League Council to work in its emergency session to adopt a practical and objective stand that would help stop the bloody fighting in Yemen and preserve the fraternal Yemeni people's interests. Concluding his speech, the Jordanian delegate thanked Egypt for calling this emergency meeting out of concern for the Yemeni people's interests. After his speech, the Arab League Council held a closed session to discuss an Egyptian proposal to send Arab forces to maintain peace in Yemen and to carry out measures guaranteeing an end to the fighting.
