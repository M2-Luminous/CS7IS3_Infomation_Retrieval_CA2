[passage omitted] Unnecessary Publicity Weakens President President Martti Ahtisaari and his advisers are fascinated by the idea that the direct election method calls for the president to exercise power differently than his predecessors did, notes HELSINGIN SANOMAT (independent), which takes a critical view of what it calls Ahtisaari's regal tours through the nation. HS [HELSINGIN SANOMAT] points out that while of course it is good that the president can signal his responsiveness to the public through his trips around the country, it will become a problem if he constantly makes spontaneous offers of help right and left. "And the problem will just get worse if there are many unresolved matters that the president is involved in one way or another. Then it will be hard and in the long run also impossible to stand above the political parties. ``Under the Constitution, the president of the Republic is in charge of foreign policy. That is the chief of state's most important task. Where domestic policy is concerned the president should mainly hold himself in reserve, to cite Koivisto. He should be ready to offer ideas in situations where the parties get embroiled in conflicts that cannot be resolved without outside mediation and an arbiter. ``Resolving such problems requires a president who has a natural dignity with the attendant reserve of prestige. It is precisely this kind of thing that the public has become accustomed to demanding from the chief of state. In light of this it is rash to appear on entertainment programs on TV and answer serious questions that undermine the institution of the presidency. ``One of Ahtisaari's problems is his spontaneous reaction, his desire to take a stand on issues and to answer when he is asked something. When it is used correctly, this is a good and important characteristic. Ahtisaari and his advisers must determine what kind of publicity suits the president. This involves solving a difficult problem: how to strike a balance between the institution of the presidency and the demands that a modern society places on public disclosure. ``The president cannot make one pronouncement after another. That is a very short route for political actors regardless of their nation or era. As strange as it may seem, silence is also one of the president's resources, especially in the age of broadcast media.'' [passage omitted]
