According to the director general, on 1 January this year a major structural reform became effective in China's industrial and commercial taxes; and a new system was implemented for the main tax categories, including value-added tax, consumption tax, business tax, enterprise income tax, individual income tax, resource tax, and land value-added tax. Judging from the progress in implementing the new system over the past 10 or more days, the transition from the old to the new taxation system has been rather smooth. Jin Xin particularly discussed tax reform issues concerning enterprises with foreign investment and foreign enterprises. He said: The implementation of the new taxation system will not change the provisions on tax incentives in the income tax law for foreign-invested and foreign enterprises which went into effect on 1 July 1991. Changes for foreign-invested and foreign enterprises involve mainly tax categories such as the nationally unified value added tax, consumption tax, and business tax which are to be levied on foreign-invested enterprises and foreign enterprises effective 1 January 1994 in accordance with a decision adopted by the fifth meeting of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee. Jin Xin pointed out: The levying of the nationally unified value-added tax, consumption tax, and business tax on enterprises with foreign investment and foreign enterprises is to satisfy the requirements of establishing and developing a socialist market economy and to equalize the tax burden; it has also been the request of the majority of foreign-invested enterprises and foreign enterprises. To keep foreign tax policy successive and stable, the tax reform has followed an important policy principle of not increasing the tax burden on enterprises with foreign investment. This is to say that the redesigning of tax rates will neither increase nor decrease the aggregate tax burden. In this way, the state can be guaranteed of no decrease in its financial revenue, and enterprises, of no additional tax burden as a result of reform. Jin Xin said: Due to changes in the structure of the taxation system and in the chain of tax payers, increased or decreased tax burdens on products and enterprises will be unavoidable. As far as this is concerned, the state will adopt necessary policy measures to ensure the smooth transition from the old to the new tax system. He added: In line with the regulations adopted by the NPC Standing Committee, enterprises with foreign investment licensed before 31 December 1993 will be refunded any tax burden increase resulting from the introduction of the value-added tax, consumption tax, and business tax as approved by the tax authorities. This will be limited within the time period of the approved contract of operation, with a maximum period of five years. Any foreign-invested enterprises approved after 1 January 1994 will be subject to the new tax system.
