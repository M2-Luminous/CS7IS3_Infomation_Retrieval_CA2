The hitherto good cooperation is, to a great extent, also a result of the work and efforts of the U.S. Embassy in Ljubljana. [passage omitted] The claims of the U.S. Embassy were also supported by our Defense Ministry. A brief statement says that Lieutenant (Leach) has, from 3 November 1993, lead very successfully a liaison group within the Army to Army program, which is aimed at exchanging experiences in the military sphere. Claims that Lieutenant (Leach) has been recalled is insulting to Mr. Leach -- who has, in the meantime, become a great friend of our country -- and harms diplomatic efforts, the international reputation of Slovenia, and cooperation of our ministry with the U.S. Defense Ministry, the Defense Ministry statement says.
