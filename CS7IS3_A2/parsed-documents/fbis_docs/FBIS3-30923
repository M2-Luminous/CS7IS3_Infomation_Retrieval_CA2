"Despite this ultimatum, the Serb artillery will not move an inch," said their main spokesman, Miroslav Toholj. "We are ready to retaliate." He called the NATO threat to hit Serb positions with air strikes if the artillery is not pulled back within 10 days as "a terrorist threat" and said the Serbs would respond "by all means" to any attack.
