The finding, by researchers at St. Mary's hospital medical school in London, challenges the view that prostitutes are a key point from which the virus can spread into the heterosexual population. Researchers interviewed 280 women living in London who attended a special women's clinic at the medical school. They also interviewed women on prostitution charges at magistrates' courts and women at a special drop-in centre and other places where prostitutes are known to gather. Dr. Sophie Day, senior research fellow at the school and a member of the team, said most of the questionnaires were backed up with blood or saliva tests to compare answers with HIV infection rates. Eighty percent of the women were white, 25 or 9 percent were Afro-Caribbean and the rest were of mainly Asian or Middle Eastern background. The tests disclosed that about 1 percent, or just two women, had the virus which can cause AIDS. Both reported a history of drug abuse involving injections. Most of the women, aged between 14 and 51, claimed to be using condoms in nearly all liaisons.
