Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is quoted on the future status of the port: Grachev says: "Sevastopol should be the main base of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. We consider that in addition to Sevastopol, the fleet should also be based in Balaklava, Feodosiya, Kerch, and Donuzlav where the main forces of Russia's Black Sea Fleet are deployed and also where units and formations are stationed. It is clear that we do not have the right to, and we will not undermine the combat readiness of the Black Sea Fleet, a battle-worthy and full-blooded formation of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, as this would create a real threat to the security of Russia in this region. Nor do we have the right to worsen the already difficult social position of many Black Sea sailors."
