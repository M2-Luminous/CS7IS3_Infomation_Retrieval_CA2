He said that such a review does not necessarily have to aim at cutting back on the defense forces. Questioning the cabinet at this afternoon's session, Yutaka Takeyama of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] asked about the review of the national defense program being carried out. He noted that regional tensions remain high even after the end of the Cold War, as on the Korean peninsula, for example. He said that the current situation does not warrant a cutback in the Self-Defense Forces [SDF]. In reply, Prime Minister Hosokawa said that a review needs to be carried out of the concept of the program, including on the question of what Japan's basic defense capabilities should be. He stated that the review is currently under way in the government, and he insisted that the review is not necessarily aimed at reducing defense. Yutaka Shimomura, a member of the Niin Club [upper house floor group], was the last speaker at the interpellation session today. He noted that the Hosokawa government retains high popularity, although it is perhaps not as popular as it once was. He said this means that Mr. Hosokawa should keep in mind that he must live up to the expectations of the people and that Mr. Hosokawa himself should come up with measures to make this possible. In his response, Hosokawa stated that his government was born surrounded by the warm expectations of the people on reform, and that it continues to receive the support of the people as it proceeds with these reforms. He said he continues to be committed to the structural reforms of politics and the economy to give a new priority to working people.
