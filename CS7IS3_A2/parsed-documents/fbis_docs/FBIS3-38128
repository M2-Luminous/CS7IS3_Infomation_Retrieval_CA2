According to a confidential list of projects from the Finance Ministry in Bonn, in October 1993, government guarantees for military exports amounted to 2.3 billion German marks -- three times more than in the previous year. According to the list, which contains 10 projects, transactions with Indonesia account for more than half of the amount. The second major client is Turkey, which took the lion's share of Hermes guarantees for export deals in 1992. Both countries have promised billions in orders for German shipyards. In addition, the Federal Government provided several minor guarantees for the sale of helicopters of the Munich Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm company to Botswana, Swaziland, Argentina, the Czech Republic, and the Philippines.
