After the talks, which were held behind closed doors, Akashi briefly addressed journalists, telling them that he and Kontic discussed the declaration issued at the NATO summit, which asks UNPROFOR to study the possibilities of protecting Srebrenica and Tuzla airport. Akashi announced that he will go to Geneva to meet Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and hold consultations on these issues. He explained that he and Thorvald Stoltenberg will have different obligations and that he will stay on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. I will help the negotiators in Geneva as much as I can. They will rely on the information that I will send them from the field. I think that this will help, and hope that it will bring about positive results sooner, Akashi said. Prime Minister Kontic and I discussed bilateral relations between the Yugoslav Government and UNPROFOR, and must say that I am quite encouraged by his views, Akashi told journalists.
