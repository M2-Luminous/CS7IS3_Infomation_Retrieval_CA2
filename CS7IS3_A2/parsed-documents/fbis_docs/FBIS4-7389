In comparison with the last quarter of 1993, this is a decrease of 27 percent in the number of cases. Of these cases, five have resulted in the conviction of 11 accused persons, one of them getting a life sentence. The different forms of corruption and bribery activities mainly include: intentional violation of budgetary transaction procedures, keeping funds without bookkeeping documents, improper expenditure, and violation of income and expenditure principles. Typical of these offenses are the cases of the Lam Dong Tea Company, with 1.4 billion dong involved, and the Company of the Trade Union of the Metallurgy Sector, with 1.8 billion dong. There were also cases of violation of the regulations on building construction (in the bidding process, capital allocation, use of capital, and cost of materials), obtaining property by deception, illegal sales, setting prices contrary to principles, and spending land fees improperly. Though the number of discovered cases has been reduced in comparison with the same period last year, the corruption situation is still very complicated. The tasks of investigation and discovery still lack concentration, even though some progress has been made. The handling process is still sluggish. The practice of bribing to get construction capital and licenses for joint ventures is still beyond the scope of the investigation work. The practices of receiving bribes, embezzling state property, using public property as presents to solicit favors, and so forth are still rampant. At many places, government directives on antiwaste and thrift practice have been ignored or poorly performed. The Interior Ministry recently held a meeting to discuss measures to overcome the tardy progress of the anticorruption activities, and to further push the campaign to suppress and prevent corruption.
