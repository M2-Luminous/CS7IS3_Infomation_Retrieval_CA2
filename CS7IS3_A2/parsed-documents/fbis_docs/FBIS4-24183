In a statement on the incident, Councilor Phillip Banks, who has [words indistinct] for the Ministry of Justice, condemned the killings, noting that such acts not only violate the Cotonou accord, but are wanton violations of several international human rights conventions to which Liberia has subscribed, as well as the violation of human rights of innocent unarmed civilians. The councilman further noted that there can be no justification for the barbaric atrocities committed against unarmed, helpless civilians. The council, he said, has therefore instructed the Ministry of Justice to launch a full-scale investigation into the incident, and to promptly bring the perpetrators to justice. Inveighing the directives of the Ministry of Justice, Councilor Banks stated that the violators must be subjected to trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He called on the Ministry of Justice to put necessary machinery in place for that purpose. The council, he noted, will not countenance such acts against the citizens of Liberia. The councilor noted further that while the council has not pursued persons who violated the human rights of the Liberian people prior to the Cotonou accord and since the council's seating, it has no intention of permitting the perpetration of crimes against innocent Liberians by any person or a group of persons, or of allowing those who have committed such crimes to go unpunished. Such war crimes, the council emphasized, are not covered by the amnesty provisions in the Cotonou Accord and therefore those identified as being responsible for the perpetration of such crimes must be formally charged, and when convicted should be bear the full punishments prescribed by the relevant international conventions and the penal laws of Liberia. This, he said, includes punishment by death. Meanwhile, the councilman has instructed Justice Ministry to have the area where the incident occurred and other areas of the city securely covered and monitored, so as to avoid a repetition of the incident. The council, he said, is calling upon ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] to (?fully) coordinate with and involve Liberians [words indistinct], especially personnel of the Liberia National Police, to ensure the maximum protection of all citizens and residents in areas under the control of ECOMOG and the Liberia National Transitional Government.
