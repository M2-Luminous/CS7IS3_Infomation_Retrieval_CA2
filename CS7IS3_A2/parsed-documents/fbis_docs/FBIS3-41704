This ailment has already taken the lives of 104 persons (131 last year). The most unfavorable situation has evolved in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Krasnodar, Moscow and Leningrad oblasts, Maritime Kray and Saratov Oblast. This was communicated to this ITAR-TASS correspondent by Anatoliy Monisov, deputy chairman of the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight. Specialists believe the main cause of such swift growth of diphtheria morbidity to be insufficient vaccination of the population. Many parents protest against immunizing their children, while the adults themselves rarely get reimmunized. Nonetheless, vaccine remains the most dependable defense against diphtheria. Anatoliy Monisov is also troubled by the fact that Russia's supply of the needed preparations is short. You see, the enterprises weren't ready to produce such a large quantity of vaccine, and the production process takes 4-8 months. Such that we can't expect the situation to normalize until next year, the specialist feels. Anatoliy Monisov noted that the government has developed a special ``antidiphtheria'' program, which has now been forwarded to the Supreme Soviet. In order to hasten the process of implementing this document the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight asked the government to begin its financing sooner. The cost of the program is 6 billion rubles over 3 years (disregarding inflation), and a significant share of this money will go to reinforcing the production capacities of enterprises making the vaccine. In addition the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight has sent a plan of diphtheria control measures to local agencies, which should help medical workers in remote regions in their fight against the disease.
