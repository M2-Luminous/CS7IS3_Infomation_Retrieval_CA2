They said the proposed treaty, agreed on in an international conference in Washington, calls for holding an annual convention among the signatory nations to set the total fish catches and national fishing quotas on the basis of a scientific resources survey. In case the nations failed to agree on the total catches, the treaty would ban alaska pollack fishing if the resources were estimated at less than 1.67 million tons, the officials said. The total catches would be set at 130,000 tons if the estimate ranged from 1.67 million to 2 million tons and at 190,000 tons if the estimate ranged from 2 million tons to 2.5 million tons. Japan, China, South Korea, Poland, Russia and the United States suspended alaska pollack fishing in the waters in 1993 and 1994 following a sharp decrease in catches.
