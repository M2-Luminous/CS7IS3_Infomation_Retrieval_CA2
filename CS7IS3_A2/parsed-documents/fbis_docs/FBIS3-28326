The ASAHI SHIMBUN said, "the attitude to scrap everything could not get support from the people nor understanding from the international community." The major daily was referring to Friday's decision by the seven ruling coalition parties to scrap Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to introduce a new indirect tax and implement a tax cut. Hosokawa's package calls for a 6 trillion yen reduction in income tax and for replacing the current 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax." The leading daily urged the coalition to make its decision-making process transparent, noting that bureaucrats at the Finance Ministry might have pulled some behind-the-scene strings, hand-in-hand with a few influential coalition members in drawing up the tax plan. The ASAHI also asked the coalition parties to calm down and immediately unify their views on economic policies. "Otherwise, the centripetal influence of the coalition would decay," the ASAHI said. The MAINICHI SHIMBUN also slammed the government for its blurred process that brought about the plan, labeling it as "a decision without the people." "If those who participated in making the decision were only a few people as reported, including Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader Ichiro Ozawa and those from the Finance Ministry, without holding sufficient discussions within the government and the coalition, it is a reckless act that tramples the basic principles of democracy," the MAINICHI said. It is rational for the Social Democratic Party, which was suddenly pressed to accept the tax plan, to have threatened to quit the coalition, the national daily said. The prime minister should adjust opinions on a tax cut and its resources, and start drafting the fiscal 1994 budget after gaining a happy compromise, the MAINICHI said. The largest circulation YOMIURI SHIMBUN said, "the Unusual situation revealed the structural limitation of the coalition government which is a hodgepodge of political parties with different political stance and basic policies." "Under ordinary circumstances, a cabinet that committed such a serious blunder would have to resign en masse. However, it is not allowed to create a political vacuum in the face of such urgent problems as pump-priming, the fiscal 1994 state budget and relations with the United States," it said. "Revocation of the prime minister's tax plan leaves deep cracks in the coalition and seriously deteriorates the leadership of the government," the daily said. The YOMIURI urged the government to restructure itself to deal with the political quagmire. The leading economic daily NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said, "The government should recognize the severity of the economy bogged down in the worst recession in the postwar era and rush to fine-tune pump-priming measures by returning to its original stance of first implementing tax reductions." "The government and the coalition should recall that what is needed for the Japanese economy in the serious recession is to carry out a large-scale income tax first," it said. The NIHON KEIZAI asked the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to offer concrete proposals to the government if it recognizes the Japanese economy is facing a crisis.
