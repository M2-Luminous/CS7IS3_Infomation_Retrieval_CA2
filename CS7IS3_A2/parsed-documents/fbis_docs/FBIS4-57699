According to some residents, those murdered were followers of President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide. They reportedly were killed shortly before dawn by a group of unidentified armed men. Since the toppling of President Aristide on 30 September 1991, Cite Soleil has been the site of numerous acts of violence aimed at his followers. It was also reported today that 278 "boat people" (fragile vessels packed with Haitian refugees) were intercepted on the high seas as they were trying to reach Florida. They were escorted back to Port-au-Prince by U.S. coast guard vessels. Meanwhile, a Haitian business organization, the Center of Free Enteprise and Democracy (the equivalent of the young economic chambers), denounced today the "immorality" of UN a resolution reinstating a nearly full embargo against Haiti and the "inconstitutionality" of provisional President Emile Jonassaint and his government.
