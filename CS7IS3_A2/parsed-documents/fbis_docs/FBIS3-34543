Does Moscow believe that it can restore peace in Nagorno-Karabakh and Tajikistan all by itself, or does it need the assistance of countries such as the Islamic Republic of Iran and the international organizations? [Tretyakov] The visit by ambassador Kazimirov, the Russian presidential special emissary, to Iran is a clear answer to your question. Russia does not wish to take any measures in these regions alone. It has been repeatedly stressed by the Foreign Minister and all other high level officials of our country that Russia has taken and continues to take steps independently as well as in relation to international organizations such as the CSCE Minsk group. At the same time, Moscow attaches great value to cooperation with regional countries such as the Islamic Republic of Iran, and around the world. We consider our recent consultations with Iranian officials extremely important and worthwhile. The officials of the two countries announced that Tehran and Moscow can cooperate in resolving the wars in Nagorno-Karabakh and Tajikistan. They have also announced that they support the peace efforts of international organizations and other countries. [ABRAR] Are you optimistic about resolving these conflicts or do you believe that the Nagorno-Karabakh and Tajikistan conflicts will continue? [Tretyakov] It is natural for Russia to be sincerely interested in a solution to these conflicts, which not only affect the countries involved but will also have negative effects on the CIS politically, economically, and militarily. Therefore, we are seeking to end these conflicts as soon as possible. [ABRAR] How do you view the scope for cooperation between Russia and the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)? Some Russian media recently threatened the Central Asian countries and the Caucasus that have joined the ECO, saying that in the event of their broadening ties within the ECO, they will be expelled from the CIS. Do the Russian political circles also contribute to this view? [Tretyakov] Perhaps some individuals and officials have aired their personal views. Russia maintains that the domestic and foreign policies of the countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus are to be respected above all else. It is up to them whether they wish to be members of the ECO or the CIS. [ABRAR] In your opinion, is it a problem if they are simultaneously members of the ECO and the CIS? [Tretyakov] We have always stressed that we are opposed to competitiveness among various countries in this region. However, on the other hand we favor constructive cooperation in the region. In this regard, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani had stressed that the aim of the ECO is constructive cooperation among countries and the creation of a climate of confidence and security in the region. Russia has bilateral relations with all the ECO member countries. As for Russia joining the ECO, we must wait and see the working of this organization. Naturally, when joining any organization every country should keep its own national interests in mind. [ABRAR] What is Moscow's policy with regard to the Middle East? For example, there are potential dangers such as altering Iraq's borders and the possibility of the creation of an independent Kurdistan in that country. What is your opinion in this regard? [Tretyakov] Issues pertaining to national boundaries and their territorial integrity are among the most sensitive issues for all the countries of the world. In some cases, border issues have evolved into disputes. For this reason, not only are we in favor of safeguarding the territorial integrity of all countries, we do not want any border disputes among countries to threaten the peace of the region and the world with instability and insecurity. [ABRAR] So is Russia opposed to changes in the borders of Iraq? [Tretyakov] All issues should be resolved within the framework of international rights. One determine the objectives of the circles suggesting these actions. [ABRAR] How do you appraise the Tehran-Moscow relations in the Middle East? [Tretyakov] In all the meetings that take place between the two countries, we exchange views on the issues of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, and on most occasions there is a unanimity of views. [ABRAR] It appears that Russia has recently made some moves in the Persian Gulf, for instance a military-security pact with Kuwait. Similarly, we may refer to the remarks by Lukin, the Russian ambassador in Washington, who has stressed the sale of arms to Iraq and criticized the U.S. policy of refraining from arms sales to other countries. Does Russia intend to become active again in the Middle East and in the Persian Gulf? [Tretyakov] If the United States, Japan, and Western Europe are to pursue their economic and political interests in the various regions of the world including the Persian Gulf, why should we not act accordingly? Geographically, the Persian Gulf is closer to Russia and has a special importance to us for economic and security reasons. [ABRAR] The West is competing with Russia for arms sales in regions such as the Middle East and East Asia. It is for this reason that the West wishes to prevent sales of Russian arms to these regions and is opposing them. In this regard, Bill Clinton signed an agreement with Yeltsin during his visit to Moscow. What is your opinion on this? [Tretyakov] It is natural that Russia, which is one of the major arms producers of the world, should be interested in expanding its arms market. I do not believe that this rivalry is commercial, as you state. At the same time, this competition does not have a political aspect. Here I should assert that Russia is one of the signatories of the treaty banning the production and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Therefore we will act only in accord with this treaty in dealing with other countries on armament matters. [ABRAR] In the wake of the victory of the nationalists and communists in Russian parliamentary elections, U.S. policy toward Russia has become dichotomized. On the one hand, it declares full support for Yeltsin and his free market policies, while on the other hand it seeks to counter Moscow's influence in the neighboring countries? What is your analysis of this two-pronged U.S. policy? [Tretyakov] Some Western circles have greatly magnified the result of the Russian parliamentary elections when it is not nearly so bad.
