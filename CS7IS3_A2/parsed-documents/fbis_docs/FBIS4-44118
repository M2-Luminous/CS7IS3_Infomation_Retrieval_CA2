For example, the partnership agreement with Moscow: Whether Russia will one day be part of the European free trade zone depends on its political developments in the next few years. If, in the Russian power struggle, the forces of the bureaucratic-military-industrial complex hold their own -- Prime Minister Chernomyrdin belongs to this group -- then the agreement with the European Union [EU] will not materialize. Yeltsin's short visit to Corfu would then remain another attempt to boost the Russian president's image, which is declining at home, through international support actions. The principle of hope also stands behind the signatures, which seal the EU's "northern enlargement," at least at the official government level. The matter with Austria, where the citizens voted in favor of accession with a surprisingly large majority, seems to be the only issue genuinely settled thus far. In Finland, Sweden, and Norway, party majorities have spoken out "in favor of Europe" recently; however, the voters have not been asked yet. In Norway, in particular, it is more than dubious whether the people will follow the advice of Prime Minister Brundtland, who is not tiring in her struggle for membership. Their small chance is based on the fact that the Norwegians will be the last ones to hold a referendum, on 28 November, and might be scared of becoming isolated in case their Swedish and Finnish neighbors vote in favor of accession first. The heads of government are dealing with a long agenda on Corfu. At the top of it is the decision on who will succeed French Commission President Delors; on such issues, the political microcosmos tends to turn on its own axis at a high speed. What is more important is that, by establishing a preparatory group for the 1996 government conference, the EU will embark on its path toward "Maastricht II." Germany and France, which will now assume the presidency in the EU in succession, are expected to provide decisive impulses: In view of the election campaigns in the two countries, one can only count on the principle of hope here, too.
