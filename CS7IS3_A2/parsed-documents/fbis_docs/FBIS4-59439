[Bin-Husaynun] Al-'Anad has not been captured, nor have northern forces reached Dar Sa'd, as 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, and Planning Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani said. Maybe they do not know what is happening on the battlefield. It can be said that their claim is absolutely baseless. They must know that it is very difficult to reach Aden, perhaps not in their time, nor will it be by force. [passage omitted] [Al-Asadi] What is your opinion of the decision to dismiss you from the cabinet? [Bin-Husaynun] I do not recognize a decision of that kind, because those who made it do not enjoy legitimacy. The legitimacy collapsed on 27 April after the declaration of war on the Yemeni people. Anyone who declares war on his own people does not deserve or have any legitimacy. [Al-Asadi] Do you believe there has been Arab interference in current events in Yemen? [Bin-Husaynun] I believe that some elements from some Arab states are participating alongside northern forces in the fighting. It has been stated that there are some Iraqis and Sudanese elements on the battlefield. [Al-Asadi] Aden reports said today (Wednesday) that northern aircraft are using Sudanese airports to bombard targets in the south.... [Bin-Husaynun] The relationship between Khartoum and Sanaa and between President 'Umar al-Bashir and 'Abd 'Abdallah Salih shows Sudan's support for the northern forces which have declared war on the Yemeni people. We regret these matters and hope that Arab brothers will not become a party to this conflict. If they cannot contribute to resolving the crisis and securing a cease-fire, they should stay neutral. [Al-Asadi] What is your interpretation of the north's offer of an immediate cease-fire, provided Aden accepts the legitimacy? [Bin-Husaynun] That is up to them. Sometimes they accept and other times they do not. But conditions are not conducive to a cease-fire. Some say that a cease-fire should be announced first, and then a dialogue at the negotiating table should begin. For our part, we have decided to accept a cease-fire and responded to the appeal made by some brothers. This is because of the Socialist Party leadership's keenness to spare Yemeni blood, not as a result of weakness. [Al-Asadi] So do you accept the intervention of Arab forces to disengage the warring forces? [Bin-Husaynun] Any initiative or effort to stop the fighting, return to dialogue, and implement the Pledge and Accord Document is acceptable. [Al-Asadi] Including the dispatch of Arab forces to Yemen? [Bin-Husaynun] We are talking about any effort, including the intervention of Arab forces. [passage omitted]
