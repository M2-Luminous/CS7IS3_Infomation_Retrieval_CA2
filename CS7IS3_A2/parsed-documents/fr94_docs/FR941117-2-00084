FR941117-2-00084 FR941117-2-00054 Microsoft's contracts with its licensees whereby they have tied the purchase of MS-DOS to the purchase of accompanying hardware may be seen as a similar conspiracy as those found in patent tying United States v. Univis Lens Co., et al., 316 U.S. 241 (1942) and patent pooling cases see United States v. General Electric Co., 82 F. Supp. 753, 814 (D.N.J. 1949) as well as the seminal copyright block licensing case of United States v. Paramount Pictures, 334 U.S. 131, 156&hyph;159 (1948).

Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 14, and increasing the social cost of market power by facilitating price discrimination, thereby increasing monopoly profits over what they would be absent the tie. Jefferson, 466 U.S. at 15. From the standpoint of the consumer whose interests in the statute was especially intended to serve the freedom to select the best bargain in the second market is impaired by his need to purchase the tying product, and perhaps by the inability to evaluate the true cost of either product when they are available only as a package. Jefferson, 466 U.S. at 15. Microsoft may claim that it limits its licenses to hardware companies so severely for valid quality control reasons. Microsoft's effort to enlarge the scope of its monopoly by using the market power it confers to restrain competition in the market for a second product will undermine competition on the merits in that second market. Jefferson at 16 citing United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 156&hyph;159, 92 L.Ed.2d 1260, 68 S. Ct. 915 (1948). Such restraint of trade violates the Sherman Act ยง1.
