The place and date of the interview are not given. The latter edition of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY also publishes, on page 2, a 350-word TA SR report on a news conference on the second wave of privatization given by the same Privatization Minister Janicina in Bratislava on 28 March. In the first installment of the interview, Janicina speaks about the "successful launching of coupon privatization being the number-one priority"; he goes on to say that "on 2 May, we move to Senec, where we are going to prepare privatization so that the list of enterprises offered in the second round can be published on 22 August. We expect the beginning of citizens and privatization funds registration on 1 September 1994. Before the end of our term of office, we intend to reach an irreversible stage in the launching of coupon privatization, regardless of election results." The most important thing to guarantee a smooth privatization process is uncequivocally, according to Janicina, "the precise processing of property-related legal documentation for the privatized enterprises." Asked about the criticism that coupon privatization does not provide the funds needed for developing the enterprises, the minister says that, "even within the framework of coupon privatization, it is possible to obtain capital by setting aside a part of the enterprise property for a direct sale." Furthermore, he argues, constant delays prevent the completion of individual projects of so-called wild privatization, and, in the process, they do not generate any capital, either. When the interviewer observes that the government has canceled 13 decisions made by its predecessor, "all of them projects within the framework of so-called wild privatization," and asks whether this trend is to continue, Janicina replies that "there were problems with privatization even earlier, but they became throughly obvious on 14 February." On the other hand, the minister says, "because of the great amount of work and the limited capacity of the ministry, I would not want to concentrate on checking all projects. We want to do some positive work." The strategic enterprises--arms industry, power generation, etc.--pose a problem because of the need to guarantee the strategic intentions of the state. So far, a permanent participation of the National Property Fund was considered the solution. According to Janicina, however, "the strategic interests of the state must be clearly identified, the manner of their implementation formulated, and the statutes of the specific companies adjusted according to the needs. If that is accomplished, the strategic intentions can be realized even with a minority participation of the fund, and the majority can be offered in coupon privatization." The second installment of the interview opens with a question concerning Janicina's opinion on employee stockholding companies. The minister first notes that the law does not define anything like that, then continues to say that he does not claim bad intentions in all such companies but that the experience he made in this respect is not good. He illustrates this point by quoting letters from workers at such enterprises who believe it better "to sell the company to foreign capital than to leave it to the comrades who are still in the company management." After all, "these companies are usually founded with a 50-percent stake going to three- or four-member management and 50 percent to all other employees." The assessment of the first round of privatization identified numerous problems. Nevertheless, Janicina says that, "because of the government's limited time in office, a change of laws is not feasible. We will influence the legislation by government directives." The interview concludes with Janicina addressing a major problem of Slovak privatization--namely, that "the book value of the enterprises is very high, while the market price is relatively low, and the price offered by foreign investors is frequently even lower. That is the reason standard privatization methods are so slow." The difference in prices is dealt with in lengthy talks. Janicina says he would be glad "if at least three or four sales to foreign investors could be realized before his term in office expires." Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY on 29 April carries a TA SR report on news conference given by Janicina in Bratislava on 28 March. Here, Janicina says that he, together with the ministers of the founding sectors, is to prepare "the list of the state enterprises, the property of which is to be offered in the second wave of privatization, by 20 May. The schedule and rules for coupon privatization are to be detailed by 10 May." Janicina promises to exert every effort so that "the value of property offered amounts to at least 80 billion Slovak korunas." At the same time, he says, "if I remain minister, under no circumstances will I support, and will, in fact, do everything in my power against, direct sales to prearranged owners such as fellow party members." The ministers states, however, that a direct sale to a prearranged owner could still possibly take place if "a foreign investor with a good reputation appears on the scene with an offer interesting to Slovakia." State Secretary Palacka calls the phrase (direct sale to prearranged owner) unfortunate and emphasizes that "all projects will be published, and counterproposals can always be submitted. One of these projects is then selected, so there is always a certain amount of competition."
