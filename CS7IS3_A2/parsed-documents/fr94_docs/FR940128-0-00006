FR940128-0-00006 FR940128-0-00002 Two of the 13 exempted operational controls are also exempted for all other borrowers. These are the requirement to obtain REA approval of the purchase of data processing equipment and system control equipment (except when REA loan funds are used), and the requirement that distribution borrowers notify REA in writing of proposed changes in electric rates 90 days prior to the effective date of such rates. The required notification period has been changed to 30 days. Although the rule exempts REA approval of the selection of a manager for borrowers that meet the 110 percent test and are not in default, REA wishes to emphasize again the critical importance of the selection of fully qualified and capable managers. It is the most important of a board of director's responsibilities. REA will shortly be issuing new guidelines on manager selection. For the convenience of the public, paragraph (d) of ยง1710.7 lists examples of the operational controls and requirements that are not exempted. The controls and requirements not exempted fall into two categories: (1) Requirements and operational controls that are necessary to ensure that the security for loans made or guaranteed by REA is reasonably adequate and that the loans will be repaid, or to accomplish other fundamental purposes of the RE Act, and (2) requirements imposed on REA or on borrowers by law. The nonexempted controls and requirements include, for example, area coverage requirements; following REA construction standards and listed materials; certain borrowers having to maintain a power requirements study on an ongoing basis; the maintenance of minimum levels for the Times Interest Earned Ratio and Debt Service Coverage ratio; REA approval of certain retirements of capital credits; controls on borrower investments; certain borrowers having to maintain an equity development plan; requirements on maintenance and repair of the mortgaged property; and REA accounting and auditing requirements. These requirements and controls are believed to be reasonable in comparison with requirements imposed by private lenders on customers presenting similar credit risks. Paragraph (e) of ยง1710.7 authorizes REA to reinstate exempted controls and requirements if the borrower is in default on any requirement of its mortgage, loan contract with REA, or any other agreement with REA that has not been exempted. REA will notify the borrower in writing of the reinstatement, and it will remain in effect until REA determines that it is no longer needed to help ensure loan security. Paragraph (f) is intended to make it clear that if controls are reinstated because the borrower defaults or its net worth drops below 110 percent of outstanding REA debt, the controls and approval rights will apply to all applicable subsequent actions by the borrower, including REA approval of amendments to contracts entered into by the borrower while it was exempt from controls. Section 1717.860_Lien Accommodations and Subordinations Under Section 306E of the RE Act Section 1717.860 promulgates the requirements of section 306E of the RE Act as they relate to lien accommodations and subordinations. In determining which borrowers qualify under the 110 percent net worth to REA debt criterion, the same calculations and procedures are used as in ยง1710.7, except that the determination is made at the time of an application for a lien accommodation or subordination and there is no annual notice to borrowers. Paragraph (c) of ยง1717.860 establishes that REA will expeditiously approve a lien accommodation or subordination for financing of capital investments by borrowers that meet the 110 percent test, if the borrower is in compliance with all requirements of its mortgage, loan contract with REA, and any other agreement with REA that have not been exempted pursuant to REA regulations, and if the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed by REA will remain reasonably adequate. The paragraph also lists the information that must be included in the application for the lien accommodation or subordination.
