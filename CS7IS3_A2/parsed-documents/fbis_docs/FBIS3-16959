The polemics which tends to involve more and more political forces has distracted the Ukrainian public from yet another plebiscite in the Donbass coal basin scheduled for March 27. Residents of the region were supposed to say whether or not the Russian language should be considered as a second state language in Ukraine and express their attitude towards Ukraine's administrative division and participation in the Commonwealth of Independent States. The decision to hold the referendum was adopted by the regional council on February 22. However, it had taken Kiev authorities a month to respond by ordering the public prosecutor to protest the council's decision. The Russian-speaking region said it will convene an urgent session of the regional council on March 23 to discuss further steps. Meanwhile, the Lugansk region of Ukraine has announced its decision to hold a similar poll on the state language.
