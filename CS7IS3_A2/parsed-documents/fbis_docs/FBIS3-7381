In an interview with the daily LIBERATION, Pak said Thursday that the Korean peninsula is at "a negative turning point." If the United States and its allies including France imposed economic and other sanctions, North Korea would regard it as a declaration of war, Pak said. "As North Korea is ready to wage an all-out war, it is also ready to resume dialogue," he said. "This is not just idle talk." He also threatened that a "catastrophic situation" would develop on the Korean peninsula if the United States and South Korea resumed their annual military exercise Team Spirit. "Dialogue is always possible," Pak stressed, "but Team Spirit will have to be cancelled before it can take place." U.N. sanctions against North Korea or deployment of Patriot anti-missile missiles in South Korea could force Pyongyang to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, he added.
