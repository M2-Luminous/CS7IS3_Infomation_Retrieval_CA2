For the first time in the history of independent India, the vital sector of agriculture will be subjected to an international discipline which has been basically evolved to suit the interests and requirements of industrialised countries and which shows little understanding of the problems and needs of a country like ours where trade considerations are marginal and subsidiary and where the process of economic development is essential, says Mr S.P. Shukla, former Finance Secretary to the Government of India and former ambassador of India and Permanent Representative to GATT at Geneva. The main objectives of the Dunkel Draft on agriculture are to free the agricultural sector from all forms of controls and interventions by the government and from all restrictions on imports, so that the dominant multinational corporations (MNCs) in the agribusiness find easy access to the markets of developing countries such as India. Changes are being sought on four fronts: (a) Lowering of subsidies given to various agricultural inputs, such as fertiliser, electricity and water, (b) importing a given percentage of domestic consumption even if the country is able to meet its needs from domestic production; (c) introducing patent rights in agriculture; and (d) scrapping of priority sector credit programmes that would directly affect agriculture. The Dunkel draft also places strict restrictions on the subsidation of food, as in India's public distribution system (PDS). According to Dunkel, subsidised rations may be given to only those fitting certain "clearly defined criteria related to nutritional objectives." The World Bank, in various reports, has been demanding precisely the same. The Dunkel proposals require the countries to maintain the public distribution system only through purchase at market price. This means the government cannot interfere with the price settlement mechanism, as it can do now. The consequences of buying at market price may not be apparent in times of plenty, but in times of shortages, compulsion to buy at market prices can mean suicidal for the country's ability to procure and stock food and release for consumption at subsidised rates. This in itself would be enough to push us into a dependence on imports. The buffer stocks have been critical in stabilising the prices of essential foodgrains. The second threat for the agricultural sector would come from the open competition with the cheap imports, largely from the granaries of the Western countries. The Dunkel proposals stipulate minimum market access for imports to be provided by the countries which do not import foodgrains. India being only an occasional importer of foodgrains, would have to allow imports. In the first year of implementation of the Dunkel proposals two per cent of the country's domestic consumption would have to be imported and this figure has to go up to 3.33 per cent at the end of 10 years. The implications of such compulsory imports are two-fold: (a) domestic production would face competition from the cheap imports provided by MNCs engaged in agribusiness; and (b) attempts by the country to achieve self-sufficiency in food would be thwarted. The penetration of cheap imports could lead to a diversion of consumption from local products, resulting in a greater dependence on imports. This would cause (a) the uncertainty that comes with dependence on imports, and (b) the scarcity of foreign exchange required to pay for imports. Implications of a cut in subsidies in the European Community whose subsidy on agriculture amounts to something like $200 billion are being interpreted by the Commerce Ministry as a great benefit. A 20 per cent cut in the EC would mean roughly $40 billion less subsidy in the EC. This cut will get expressed in the increase in prices of temperate crops and not tropical crops which constitute India's export interests. The temperate crops include edible oil, wheat, sugar, meat and milk products, fruits and vegetables. In edible oil we are not self-sufficient and still import a large part of our consumption. The market access compulsion and higher world prices will increase our import bill. So also for sugar. Importing at the 1986-88 level would mean importing significant amounts of sugar. As for wheat, rice and major cereals, we are just about self-sufficient. And depending upon, whether it has been a good crop or bad, we still are on the threshold of importing. So in signing the GATT our negotiating position would be not only as net exporters but with the stagnant growth of foodgrains after a period of 15 years, we may even become net importers. Thus higher world prices of these commodities will be to our disadvantage and not advantage. According to Mr S.P. Shukla: "The most draconian aspect of the new discipline is in the area of domestic support regimes. The industrialised countries have enjoyed, for a long time, complete autonomy in the management of their agriculture. They pursuade strong and complex regimes of domestic support policies through direct state intervention as well as indirect support measures. Having reached a stage where agriculture constitutes a very small component of their economy both in terms of their national product as well as the employment potential, and also having reached a stage where the trade angle is far more important for their agriculture, they have now prescribed a strict discipline on domestic support which has to be followed by everybody." Between 1982-1987, Japan extended 72.5 per cent subsidy to its farmers, the European Community 37 per cent, and the US 26.17 per cent. Whereas India extended a negative subsidy of 2.23 per cent, i.e., India taxed its agriculture. Introducing intellectual property rights (patents) in agriculture would have far-reaching consequences. In the developing countries any improvement brought about in the plant varieties are not considered an exclusive private property of the individual or organisation undertaking this activity. Developed countries on the other hand give exclusive rights to anyone developing new varieties of plants or seeds for a definite period during which he or she can use the monopoly rights to exploit the market. This system, as prevailing in the developed countries, is now sought to be forced on the developing countries. If this system is adopted by the developing countries, the farmers would get into a serious problem as agriculture would be based on imported varieties as under the Green Revolution in India. The use of seeds over which a patent holder may have an exclusive patent right would create a permanent dependency. Indeed the rights enjoyed by the owner of the patented seeds are such that they do not allow the harvested seeds to be sown for the subsequent year's production. Every year the farmer has to approach the company supplying the seeds to meet the requirements for sowing. The inimical consequences for the farmer can be better appreciated when one remembers that all major seeds companies in the world today are MNCs which trade not only in patented seeds but also in the patented chemicals that would have to be used to obtain best results. The advent of biotechnology and the pressures on developing countries like India to patent biotechnological innovations has given rise to the possibility that domestic agriculture in these countries would be facing dependency syndrome. Biotechnology has been presented as the future technology for agriculture and is being developed in the laboratories of the MNCs. Claims have been made (which are largely unsubstantiated) that biotechnology has the potential of bringing about rapid increases in productivity in agriculture. But the adoption of this technology would lead to permanent strings of dependency on the MNCs. The Dunkel proposals have yet another dangerous implication for agriculture. The priorities of the financial sector (bank and insurance) are being altered through the new rules for trade in services which the Dunkel proposals are seeking to introduce. Priority sector lending, a policy in banking which many countries like India have claimed to follow, would have to be discontinued. The agriculture sector, one of the major beneficiaries of priority sector lending would be deprived of funds. Sweeping changes being attempted through Dunkel proposals have met with widespread opposition, especially from the farmers worldwide. The Asian women peasants, Korean farmers, cultivators in Japan, French farmers (most serious threat to GATT) and American people's networks, feel alarmed at the designs to take away control of all agricultural inputs--land, seeds, etc.--from the hands of small farmers by the powerful agribusiness firms. Collectively they are voicing their concern over the attempts to control agriculture and the lives of those dependent on it, by the corporate interest through seeds. In Korean farmers have launched an anti-GATT campaign to resist further opening of Korean markets to rice imports. There are reports of various massive protests from Japanese and South Korean farmers against rice imports under American pressure, (while writing this article December 7, 1993). Mr Shukla who is also co-chairman of the National Working Group on patent laws (India) warns: "The long-term implications of the threat to autonomous policy-making as a whole are too serious to be assuaged by complacent calculations of the present level of support, by unsubstantiated and vague hopes about increased exports or by private clarifications sought from the GATT bureaucrats about some unclear formulations."
