The letter and the declaration express the position of the Republic of Bulgaria that both the need for an increase of UN forces in this region and the prospects for future stability should be considered, reads the press release sent to BTA. The Republic of Bulgaria consistently supports all constructive initiatives aimed at a swift and lasting settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I would like to point out that in our opinion the non-participation of Balkan states in UNPROFOR is a stabilizing factor, promoting regional security and stability in the long run, the statement says.
