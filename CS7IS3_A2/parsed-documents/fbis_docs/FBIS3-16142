The inspection group had just returned from Belgrade. They said the United Nations had not yet determined the necessary number of personnel, or working and living conditions for the Russian staff. After examining the Tuzla airport's runway, the Russian group came to the conclusion that it was ready to handle planes. Flight navigation equipment must be set up soon, fences must be restored, and some areas still have to be de-mined. Because of the complicated military situation in the Tuzla area, humanitarian aid should not be flown into the airport before an agreement on safety guarantees is reached with all the sides involved in the conflict, the Russians recommended. Humanitarian flights should begin no earlier than one week after the airport is reopened.
