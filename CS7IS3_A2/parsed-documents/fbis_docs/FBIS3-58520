The dividend peace was supposed to bring has yet to be seen. The cancers of obscurantist nationalism, frozen under the Communist regimes, have reappeared with ferocious virulence. And the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been growing worse for 20 months. I am shocked. We all are shocked at the fate met by these women, these men, and these children who succumb to the hail of bullets, shells, rockets, and sniper fire. Yet how can we forget? The inhabitants of Sarajevo are dying for our values and the for the ideals we defend in Europe: democracy, human rights, the rejection of borders changed through force, tolerance, and multinational and multicultural coexistence. The malaise and impotence of the UN troops on the ground have become more noticeable since the announced departure of General Briquemont. Moreover, at the NATO summit, it was decided to open up Tuzla, whose airport is essential for channeling humanitarian aid, and Srebrenica, where three hundred UN troops cannot be relieved. NATO is again talking of air strikes if the Serbs try to prevent these actions. This decisive tone is something new. To say that we let the situation rot away until we reached the current impasse is an understatement. Those people, and I am one of them, who have always fought for peace in the world, have long demanded more energetic action be taken in Bosnia -- apart from the required humanitarian aid -- against militias on all sides which hold the civilian population hostage and commit intolerable crimes. One such person bitterly summed up the position of the international community: "It is striving tirelessly to try not to be able to do anything." If NATO, with the agreement of the United Nations, finally decides to move, and if all this is not just another gesture like some Serbs are already saying, then we must be pleased that Europe and the international community are finally taking their responsibility without waiting for new disasters; without waiting for war and winter to once again forge their horror or for thousands more deaths and refugees to be added to a long list; without looking for a scapegoat -- the United Nations -- or ways out, such as the lie of the land, guerrilla warfare, or the price to be paid. Coherence between the decisions made in the Security Council and NATO, on the one hand, and their application, on the other, must have a double objective: first a humanitarian one, and then a political one -- because nobody believes that a military solution alone is possible. However, Europe and the international community must become credible again in the eyes of public opinion -- and in the eyes of the ethnic cleansers. Public opinion wants peace and remembers that in a democracy, it is the one in charge. This time, public opinion will not find it acceptable if these words are not followed up with action. It will keep a close eye on the action taken. And it will not forget Sarajevo.
