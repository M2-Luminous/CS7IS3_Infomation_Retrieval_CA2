FBIS4-63898 "drsov102_h_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-102 Daily Report 25 May 1994 Moldova Prime Minister: Economic Restructuring Top Priority Prime Minister: Economic Restructuring Top Priority LD2505175294 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1636 GMT 25 May 94 LD2505175294 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] [Text] Prime Minister Andrey Sangheli says his government's main priority is to try to carry out an economic restructuring which provides either for winding up or updating the loss making enterprises. He believes this can help slow down production slump, stimulate the manufacture of competitive products and set conditions for the development of more promising sectors to update the country's economic potential. In an interview with INTERFAX, Sangheli said that the state sector would continue to be the backbone of the economy though after being reformed. The government sees restructuring as one of the important directions for enhancing the manageability of the state sector. Sangheli said that "management machines" would be set up in sectors depending on their specifics: from direct government support to sectors such as power generation and transport down to corporations, holdings, stock companies with the participation of state capital. He said that as a form, stock holding companies were more preferable than others. On the other hand, this can help privatize state property by the use of bonds (Russian-style privatization vouchers--IF). On the other, it will help plants achieve greater economic self-reliance, give them an opportunity to merge with their counterparts, promote stable contacts with related industries and lure foreign investment if need be. Starting from this month, said the prime minister, large profit-making businesses will be put for sale for privatization vouchers on a regular basis. Together with the reorganization of state and leasing businesses into stock companies, the government plans, starting from July, to launch a massive campaign for selling state-run businesses as integrated property complexes and to finalize privatization of retail trade, catering and services later this year. Sangheli said that a group of large state enterprises would be transformed into closed-end stock companies with a government stake running at more than 80 percent. The operation of such businesses also involving private investment is to be regulated both by existing and new laws. Government regulation is needed to help retain their production capacity and carry out measures for the conversion or updating of production. Sangheli said that under a parliamentary resolution, part of the state-owned businesses in a number of sectors were not subject to privatization. These, he said, will be transformed into stock companies, wholly government-owned or with foreign participation, but with the government holding to the controlling package. The government is also to remain in control of businesses relating to its natural monopoly. The government is planning to bring a new law on state enterprises and work out a package of measures to enforce it. Sangheli also spoke of government plans to launch a campaign this year to reorganize debtor plants. Expertise is also to be held in the next two years of key sectors of the economy to test out their possible advancement from the point of view of new technologies and socioeconomic policies.
