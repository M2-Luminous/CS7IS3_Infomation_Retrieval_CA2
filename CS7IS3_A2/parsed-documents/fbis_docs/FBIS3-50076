Granic also said that the government of the Republic of Croatia was deeply convinced that both sides will from now on act strictly in accordance with the provisions laid down by the Helsinki Final Document of 1975, and especially in line with the principle whereby international borders cannot and must not be changed by force. Granic stressed that the joint declaration was on no account directed against the third side [Muslims] and that it should ensure a modus vivendi for Croatian territories under UN protection, in keeping with the European Union plan and UNSC Resolution 871.
