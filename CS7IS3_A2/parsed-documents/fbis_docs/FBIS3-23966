The dynamics of price indices for consumer goods and services in January were as follows (as a percentage of the preceding date): 01/18 01/25 01/31 Average + daily price increase January December Consumer 105.8 103.4 102.4 0.68 0.42 goods and services including: foodstuffs 104.3 103.8 102.4 0.68 0.42 nonfood items 103.2 102.2 102.3 0.40 0.39 for-fee 126.3 107.6 103.2 2.38 0.52 services for the population According to current data, prices in the consumer market increased in January overall by 21.4 percent, including those for foodstuffs--by 21.1 percent, nonfood items--by 12.5 percent, and for-fee services--by 73.8 percent. Food Prices for basic food products rose last week by 2.8 percent in organized trade and by 0.7 percent in nonorganized trade. Price changes from 25 to 31 January by main categories of foodstuffs are shown below: As % of the preceding observation date, including: Total in organized in nonorganized trade trade All foodstuffs 102.4 102.8 100.7 including: Meat and meat 102.1 103.0 99.8 products Fish and fish 102.4 102.5 96.3 products Milk and milk 104.8 105.0 103.1 products Eggs 103.0 103.2 100.6 Sugar 100.3 100.3 100.6 Bread and bakery 104.0 104.0 - products Cereals and pasta 102.8 102.9 100.9 products Vodka 100.7 100.6 103.6 Potatoes and 102.3 102.6 102.1 vegetables In organized trade over the past week the fast pace of price rises continued with respect to milk and milk products and bread and bakery products. The greatest increase in prices over January was registered with respect to milk and milk products and bread and bakery products--by 34-35 percent, as well as eggs--by 23 percent. Prices for potatoes and vegetables rose by 22 percent, meat and meat products, cereals, and pasta products--by about 15 percent. Sugar prices remained practically unchanged. In nonorganized trade, unlike organized trade, prices over the last week of January changed insignificantly (up 0.7 percent). Milk, sour cream, and vegetable prices went up by 2-3 percent, and prices for meat and meat products remained unchanged. Prices for vegetables and potatoes increased over January by 28.4 percent, for milk and milk products--by 33 percent. Meat prices rose by 11.1 percent. The cost of the monthly basket of 19 basic foodstuffs rose over the week by 2.7 percent and amounted as of 1 February to 37,500 rubles [R]. Magadan remains the most expensive city, Ulyanovsk, the least expensive. The price differential between them measured a factor of 4.2, having shrunk over the week by about 15 percent because of the rise in prices for basic foodstuffs in Ulyanovsk. Moscow is 35th on the list of 132 monitored cities in terms of the cost of the basket (R41,000). Nonfood items Over the past week prices for light industry products increased by 1.9-2.4 percent, for household and cultural goods--by 2.8 percent, and for fuel sold to the population--by 1.3 percent. The greatest price increases over January was registered with respect to sewn items (by 14.1 percent) and fuel sold to the population (by 23.8 percent). Gasoline prices went up over the month by more than 30 percent. As of 1 February the average price per liter was R228 (R179 at the end of December). For-fee Services for the Population Prices rose over the week by 3.2 percent. Railroad transportation and communications services rates more than doubled over January. Apartment rents, the cost of keeping a child in preschool facilities, and health care services increased by a factor of 1.5. Prices for consumer services increased at a lesser rate (by 20-30 percent). Dynamics of Producer Prices for Industrial Goods The level of wholesale prices charged by producers for industrial goods rose in January 1994 as compared to December 1993 by 19 percent (in January 1993--by 32 percent). As compared to January 1993, wholesale prices increased 8.2-fold. The most significant price increases in January 1994 occurred in power engineering, fuel, and chemical industries. In sectors producing consumer goods prices in January rose at a somewhat slower rate than in sectors producing producer goods. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |January 1994 as % of | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |December 1993 |January 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industry total |119 |8.2 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |power engineering |122 |14.2 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |fuel industry |124 |6.7 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |ferrous metallurgy |108 |9.6 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |nonferrous metallurgy |113 |5.5 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |chemical industry |124 |9.1 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |petrochemical industry |115 |6.8 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |machine building |121 |8.2 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |timber, woodworking, and |120 |8.7 times | |pulp and paper industry | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |construction materials i-|120 |11.8 times | |ndustry | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |light industry |112 |6.0 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |food processing industry |115 |7.9 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the fuel industry prices for the main categories of energy resources rose in January on average by 24 percent, which was more than twice the average monthly rate of increase in this industry in the fourth quarter of 1993. Average prices for coal and oil in Russia increased over the month by 20 percent and amounted, respectively, to R12,000 and R39,000 per tonne; for gas they increased by a factor of 1.5 (R2,600 per thousand cubic meters). Oil refining enterprises raised prices for their products on average by 26 percent. The wholesale price of gasoline at the end of January was R129,000, diesel fuel--R119,000, and fuel oil--R41,000 per tonne. Because of rising coal and gas prices, electric power rates in January went up by 22 percent as compared to prices in effect in the fourth quarter of 1993 and amounted by the end of January on average for all categories of consumers to R20.2 per kw-hour. The greatest rate increases took place with respect to electric power supplied to electricity-powered transport, municipal services, and other nonindustrial consumers. In some regions power rates per kw-hour increased more significantly (by a factor of 1.4-1.5). Among them are Perm, Orel, and Tula Oblasts, Chuvash Republic, and some others. In the chemical industry prices, after slowing down somewhat in the forth quarter of 1993 (to a level of 13 percent a month on average), took off again in January, increasing by almost one-quarter, and with respect to some categories of products (nitrogen, phosphate, and combination fertilizer, hydrochloric acid, soda ash, synthetic dyes, detergents, and some others)--by more than half. In machine building the greatest price increases were registered at enterprises in railroad, chemical, petroleum, road construction, and municipal services machine building, and in the electrotechnical industry, where prices in January rose on average by 122-128 percent as compared to 115-199 percent a month in the fourth quarter of 1993. Because of diminished demand for domestically produced goods and increased competition from imported goods, prices for light industry goods and household and cultural goods rose at a slower rate than in the past. The average rate of prices increases in light industry dropped in 1993 from 45 percent in January to 8 percent in December; in January 1994 these prices rose by 12 percent, including by 5 percent in leather, fur, and footwear industry; by 8 percent in the garment industry; and by 10 percent in knitwear industry. Prices for household and cultural goods in January increased on average by 10 percent, and for furniture--by 18 percent. In the food processing industry in January prices for butter and oil, cheese-making, and dairy industry products increased by more than one-quarter; in the bread-baking industry--by 18 percent, and in the meat-processing industry--by 14 percent. Fish industry enterprise raised prices for their output in January by 20 percent as compared to December. Results of Industry Operations In January of this year Russian industry produced more than R15 trillion worth of output in current prices. The physical volume of production fell by 23.1 percent as compared to January 1993. As compared to the level of December 1993 the total output fell by 17.2 percent, and the average daily output--by 11 percent. Production in the fuel and power generation industries and nonferrous metallurgy declined by 5-9 percent as compared to January 1993. In most processing industries the scale of decline was considerably greater. In the light and food processing industries production declined by 19-28 percent. In the sectors producing producer goods the scale of decline ranged from 23 percent in ferrous metallurgy to 28-35 percent in the construction materials, chemical and petrochemical, timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industries, and 52 percent in machine building. Data on the output of the main categories of industrial products in January 1994 are shown below: Produced January 1994 as % of For reference: in January 1994 January December January 1993 as 1993 1993 (by 1993 as % % of average of 1992 daily January output) 1992 Electric 89.5 95 97 93 95 power--billion kw-hours Oil, including 27.5 90 101 86 88 gas condensate, million tonnes Natural gas, 57.2 100.1 102 100.6 97 billion cubic meters Coal, million 25.3 92 92 88 91 tonnes Finished rolled 3.0 80 100.2 97 91 ferrous metals, million tonnes Steel pipe, 327 53 97 101 72 thousand tonnes Alternate 48.2 63 102 81 81 current electric motors with the 63-355-mm axle height, thousand units Metal-cutting 1.8 53 93 80 79 machine tools, thousand units Trucks, thousand 16.5 40 66 77 81 units Passenger cars, 21.3 29 35 92 99.3 thousand units Buses, thousand 3.8 107 100.6 87 98 units Tractors, 2.1 23 1.8 times 99.3 65 thousand units Grain harvesting 14 0.6 1.2 59 78 combines, units Excavators, 685 82 86 50 82 units Mainline freight 522 35 54 82 67 railcars, units Synthetic 660 73 90 91 93 ammonia, thousand tonnes Sulfuric acid, 511 65 95 82 85 thousand tonnes Chemical 18.3 54 81 80 74 filament and fiber, thousand tonnes Mineral 547 74 102 72 78 fertilizer, thousand tonnes Automotive 1.8 63 86 85 86 tires, million units Commercial 9.4 65 100.9 73 71 timber, million cubic meters Commercial 101 70 82 85 79 cellulose, thousand tonnes Paper, thousand 215 82 100.4 75 80 tonnes Cardboard, 87.7 58 81 84 73 thousand tonnes Cement, million 2.3 60 76 61 81 tonnes Wall-building 1.1 78 82 83 90 materials, billion units of standard bricks Soft roofing and 28.3 61 82 63 76 insulation materials, million square meters Window glass, 7.0 69 99.0 103 88 million square meters Fabrics, total, 232 95 81 39 73 million square meters Hosiery, million 31.2 74 98 73 85 pairs Knitwear, 18.0 72 84 52 74 million units Footwear, 4.8 46 72 45 66 million pairs Television sets, 259 90 92 98 108 thousand units Radio receiving 104 44 65 66 71 devices, thousand units Refrigerators 249 105 99.5 89 109 and freezers, thousand units Electric vacuum 161 52 103 96 82 cleaners, thousand units Washing 185 59 84 85 90 machines, thousand units Meat, including 192 76 93 78 84 subproducts, category I, total, thousand tonnes Whole-milk 546 84 94 79 84 products, recalculated as milk, total, thousand tonnes Butter, total, 23.6 71 102 90 94 thousand tonnes Bread and bakery 999 89 91 83 90 products, thousand tonnes Distribution of Population of Russia by Size of Per Capita Monetary Income and Size of Subsistence Minimum By the end of 1993 differentiation with respect to family income continued to grow. The income of the population in the top 10 percent bracket exceeded almost by a factor of 11 the income of the same share of the lowest-income population, while at the end of 1992 this value was measured by the factor of 7.5 to eight. The index of income concentration (the Gini coefficient) increased in January 1994 to 0.352; at the end of 1993 it measured at 0.346, and in 1992--0.327.

The average per capita value of the subsistence minimum (according to the methodology of the Russian Ministry of Labor approved in November 1992)--in January 1994 prices--was calculated to be R51,400, including R58,000 for a work-eligible person, R36,200 for a pensioner, and R51,300 for a child. The cost of the consumer food basket (19 products) amounts to 68 percent of the minimum subsistence value. The income of a considerable part of the population does not cover even the cost of the consumer food basket factored in the calculation of the subsistence minimum, as may be seen from the following data. Population with monetary income below subsistence minimum value of the consumer food basket factored in the subsistence minimum calculation million as % of the million as % of the persons total persons total population population November 44.5 29.9 17.3 11.6 1992-January 1993 November 44.9 30.3 20.3 13.7 1993-January 1994 The subsistence minimum value varies greatly across Russian regions: from R18,000-30,000 in Ulyanovsk Oblast, Republic of Tatarstan, and Kursk, Tula, Orel, Smolensk, Voronezh, and Penza Oblasts to R73,000-97,000 in Moscow, Amur Oblast, Khabarovsk Kray, and Republic of Sakha and R117,000-119,000 in Sakhalin and Magadan Oblasts. Construction of Processing Sectors Facilities in the Agro-Industrial Complex In 1993, R659 billion from all sources of financing, or 16 percent of all capital investment in the APK [agro-industrial complex], was used for development of the material and technical base of the complex's processing sectors. As compared to 1992, this investment decreased by almost one-quarter. The 1993 targets for putting into operation capacities for processing and storing agricultural output were met only to a small extent, as may be seen from the following data. Put into operation As % of For reference: in January-December the 1993 Put in 1993 target operation on average over 1991-1992 Meat--tonnes per shift 23.0 4 59.7 Whole milk 384.6 14 510.9 products--tonnes per shift Cheese--tonnes per 0.6 2 3.3 shift Granulated 1.0 5 5.5 sugar--thousand quintals of beet processing a day Confectionery 16.5 25 47.8 items--thousand tonnes Vegetable oil--tonnes 125 16 14.3 of processing oil-yielding seed a day by extraction method Margarine--thousand 3.7 3 35.5 tonnes Commercial fish from 82 2 578 fish-breeding farms--tonnes Over the past year no capacities were put into operation for production of processed cheese, fish processing, or elevators and cereal-making enterprises. In 1993 construction of 355 facilities was envisaged with federal budget financing in accordance with targeted federal programs for development of the baby food industry, "Sugar," "Bread for Russia," "Vegetable Oil," and "Fish;" 122 of them were supposed to be put into operation in 1993. Actually, only nine facilities were put in operation over January-December of last year. Construction of 46 facilities has not yet began. Of the enterprises that were supposed to be put into operation in 1993 but were not, 10 were in the program for development of the baby food industry, 11 in the "Sugar" program, two in "Vegetable Oil" program, 57 in "Fish" program, and 34--in "Bread for Russia." Among those not put into operation were capacities at dairy combines in Novocheboksarsk in Chuvash Republic, Krasnodar, and St. Petersburg; at the sugar factories Bolshevik in Belgorod Oblast and Meleuz in the Republic of Bashkortostan; at oil extraction plants in Millerovo in Rostov Oblast and Georgiyevsk in Stavropol Kray; at the fish combine in Ivanovo and fish-breeding farm Zheleznogorskiy in Kursk Oblast; an elevator in Dimitrovograd in Ulyanovsk Oblast; a cereal production department at a bread-baking combine in Tolyatti in Samara Oblast, and others. Construction of Nursing Homes As of 1 January 1993, 5,500 persons in the Russian Federation were on waiting lists for placement in a nursing home for the elderly and disabled. Over 1993 enterprises and organizations of all forms of ownership put into operation such facilities for 3,400 accommodations (including boarding homes for labor veterans), which comprises 113 percent of the 1992 level. Of 87 facilities envisaged to be put into operation over January-December, only 48 were completed. A dismal situation with respect to construction of nursing homes is developing on the territory of the Northern Economic Region, where 1,389 persons are on waiting lists for placement. Of the five territories in this region, only the Komi Republic put into operation a 240-bed nursing home. Construction of these facilities frequently exceeds the normative time frame. The opening date for a 170-bed nursing home for elderly and disabled in Yoshkar-Ola in Mari El Republic and a 110-bed home in Vladimir in Irkutsk Oblast has already been postponed for two years. The sleeping quarters in the 120-bed nursing home for elderly and disabled at Mukhinskaya station in Amur Oblast have been under construction since 1990. Among those not ready to open in 1993 were a 100-bed nursing home for the elderly in Verkhoshizhemye settlement in Kirov Oblast, a boarding home for retarded children for 300 accommodations in Shemordan settlement in the Republic of Tatarstan, and a 315-bed nursing home for elderly and disabled in Tolyatti in Samara Oblast. Capital Repairs of the Housing Stock Eleven percent of the state-owned housing stock in the Russian Federation is currently in need of immediate repairs. Because of the shortage of financing, repairs are done annually on no more than 1.5 percent of the housing stock. In 1993, R842 billion was spent on housing repairs. The cost of repairs on one square meter of living area amounted on average to R37,000, including R60,000 in municipal property buildings, and R19,000 in buildings assigned to organizations and enterprises. Total living area of housing that As % of 1992 underwent capital repairs in 1993--million square meters million square as % of the meters total area Total state-owned 22.8 1.3 109 housing stock including: municipal property 10.1 1.6 140 housing stock housing assigned to 12.7 1.1 92 organizations and enterprises The volume of capital repairs of housing increased 1.5-fold or more in 1993 as compared to 1992 in the Republic of Tatarstan and Altay Republic, Maritime and Krasnodar Krays, and Leningrad, Vladimir, Tula, Voronezh, Kaliningrad, Tyumen, and Rostov Oblasts. At the same time, in the Republics of Komi and Dagestan, Krasnoyarsk Kray, Arkhangelsk, Kirov, Saratov, Amur, and Kamchatka Oblasts, and Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast the volume of repair work decreased over this period by 40-50 percent. Despite existing five-year targets, not a single kilometer of the gas distribution system was built at economic entities in Irkutsk and Sakhalin Oblasts and Komi Republic or withdrawal branches in gas pipelines on the territories of Russia's 17 constituent republics, krays, and oblasts, including Komi and Sakha (Yakutia) Republic, Kemerovo, Kirov, and Tambov Oblasts, and Altay Kray.

The selection consists of 19 basic foodstuffs and is calculated on the basis of consumption norms needed for a male of work-eligible age. This selection (consumption volumes are indicated on a per-year basis) includes: rye bread (92 kg), wheat bread (86.7 kg), millet (18.1 kg), vermicelli (7.3 kg), sugar (24.8 kg), vegetable oil (10 kg), butter (3.6 kg), beef (42.0 kg), boiled sausage (2.2 kg), salami (1.1 kg), milk (184.3 kg), sour cream (4.2 kg), hard cheese (2.0 kg), eggs (183), potatoes (146 kg), fresh cabbage (29.8 kg), onion (10.2 kg), apples (11 kg), and cigarettes (96 packs). This listing was chosen by virtue of the relative stability seen in availability of these products for sale, enabling a well-founded analysis to be made of the cost dynamics of product selection. Only those cities were taken into consideration where not more than three items from the listing were absent during the given or preceding price registration. The value of the selection of basic foodstuffs shown is on a per-week basis.
