FR940118-2-00081 FR940118-2-00050 (e) The proposed sales will avoid an in-kind distribution of an undivided interest in the Assets to the participants and beneficiaries. Tax Consequences of Transaction The Department of the Treasury has determined that if a transaction between a qualified employee benefit plan and its sponsoring employer (or affiliate thereof) results in the plan either paying less than or receiving more than fair market value, such excess may be considered to be a contribution by the sponsoring employer to the plan and therefore must be examined under applicable provisions of the Code, including section 401(a)(4), 404, and 415. 4 4 The applicant represents that to the extent the Plan will receive greater than the fair market value for the Assets, the limitations, as set forth in section 415 of the Code, if applicable, will not be exceeded. It is further represented that the allocation of any gain on the sale of the shares will not violate the discrimination provisions of sections 404 and 401(a)(4) of the Code. Inasmuch as interpretations of sections 401, 404 and 415 of the Code are within the jurisdiction of the Internal Revenue Service, the Department expresses no opinion with respect to the applicant's representations of compliance. However, the Department does note that the applicant also represents that the sale of the Assets is being completed solely to prevent an investment loss which might result to the Plan by virtue of the Plan's holding of the Assets and to avoid, without admitting, any possible fiduciary liability with respect to the holding of the Assets by the Plan.
