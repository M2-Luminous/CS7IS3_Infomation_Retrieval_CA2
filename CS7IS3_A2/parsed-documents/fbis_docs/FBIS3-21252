More than 40% of the main body of the paper is used to explain that various measures are being taken to ensure safety. In regard to the safety of plutonium, the over-sea transport of plutonium by the Akatsuki-Maru was the turning point since which apprehension has been spreading among the people of Japan. For Japan, which puts the nuclear fuel cycle as the pillar of its government policies on atomic energy, wiping out this apprehension has become an urgent issue. Given that alone, it is a good thing that a definite assessment was given in the Nuclear Energy Safety White Paper. Nevertheless, in promoting atomic energy, which is a basis for non-fossil-fuel energy, constant effort aimed at molding public acceptance is essential, and, while making doubly sure about ensuring safety, the government should also use any opportunity to get the people's understanding. Excluding the data section, the main body of the Nuclear Energy Safety White Paper consists of two sections: ``The Current State of Nuclear Energy Safety Ensurance Measures'' and ``Ensuring Safety in the Use of Plutonium in Nuclear Power Plant Facilities.'' The two parts of the paper describe in detail the measures for ensuring safety in nuclear reactors when the plutonium formed in the nuclear fuel cycle is used. Plutonium is obtained by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. There is apprehension about the effects on the human body due to radiation and chemical toxicity if plutonium is ingested or inhaled. The chemical toxicity of plutonium is like that of heavy metals. Although plutonium is thought to cause kidney damage, the stance taken in the white paper is that there should be more concern about the effects due to its radiation because the specific radioactivity of plutonium is higher than that of uranium. For that reason the paper focuses on FBRs, ATRs, and LWRs in explaining how to prevent leaks and which other sorts of measures should be taken to guarantee safety when plutonium is actually burned in reactors to generate electrical power. It is made clear that everything possible at the present point in time is being done. However, what must be considered here is that the opposition to and unease about the use of plutonium are due in part to the many technical unknowns. Actually, the Monju prototype FBR has not yet reached criticality, and the Fugen prototype ATR is in the stage of continued operation. The use of plutonium in an LWR is slated to begin in the middle of this decade. Certainly the government is compelled to recognize that the technological incompleteness is what arouses anxiety. The government must also pay heed to the fact that the suspicions about undue information regulation for the purpose of protecting nuclear substances is one of the grounds of the argument against plutonium use. Although measures to guard against mishaps such as nuclear hijacking are essential, the government should recognize that opening up to public as much information as possible is an important scheme that will appease the opposition. Furthermore, we cannot ignore the fact that an increasing number of prudent nations in Europe and America are on the route to a nuclear fuel cycle. Rather than worrying so much about safety, the attitudes in Europe and America are based on reasons such as financial difficulties, doubts about the economy of FBRs, and preventing nuclear proliferation. Nevertheless, it is inevitable that doubts as to why only Japan sticks out will be stirred up. Safety is not the only problem with the use of plutonium.
