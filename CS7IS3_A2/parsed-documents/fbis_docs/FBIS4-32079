The tension between the two ethnic communities is rising in light of the upcoming public census in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. The Albanians, who officially constitute 23 percent of the population, boycotted the last census in 1991. They claim they account for 40 percent of Macedonia's population. In western Macedonia, which is seen as a potential hotbed of clashes, the Albanians make up approximately 70 percent of the population.
