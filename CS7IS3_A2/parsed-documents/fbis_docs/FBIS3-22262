It also emerged on Monday that public pressure had forced the company to stop all activities and business related to mercury. The first practical implementation of this decision means the import will be returned. The shipment, which was on Monday afternoon en route to Durban harbour from the United States, contains more than seven tons of activated carbon containing five percent toxic mercuric chloride. Weekend reports said the ship would be turned back after the American chemical company expressed concern about thor after recent events at the Natal plant. Criminal charges are pending after a Thor worker died of mercury poisoning. In spite of protests the cargo would be landed in Durban because, according to carrier Safmarine, all documentation for the load indicated it was activated carbon and no more hazardous than charcoal. But environmentalists Earthlife Africa, in cooperation with Greenpeace, trade unions and the African National Congress reportedly arranged with the American exporter to have the shipment returned. Safmarine spokesman Richard Warnes said on Monday afternoon that regardless of reports there had been no orders to stop the shipment. He said Safmarine viewed the matter seriously ``but at this stage there is nothing we can do. It is legally inappropriate for us to stop the process.'' The company could not open the cargo to test it because this might increase the environmental risk if it was toxic. Safmarine was committed to the environment and would not do anything to endanger it. He said the position might change before the ship docked on Tuesday. Earthlife Africa activist Mandy Jackson said she and eight others demonstrated outside Thor Chemicals to protest against the company's incineration of toxic waste. Thor is claimed to have accepted three imports of 7,500 kg of toxic waste, which Ms. Jackson said still had to be disposed of. Thor was urged to return the chemicals to sender, she said. Ms. Jackson said she had heard that Thor had agreed on Monday to stop importing toxic waste after a joint tour of its plant by an ANC environmental mission and the Environmental Justice Network Forum. A Thor spokesman confirmed this, saying: ``We won't receive it (the new shipment) and arrangements are being made for it to be returned.'' In ``all probability'' there would not be further imports, he said. ``There has been so much pressure, it takes up too much of our time and it means problems with the staff,'' the spokesman said, adding that business related to mercury constituted about 20 percent of Thor's activities and would be discontinued.
