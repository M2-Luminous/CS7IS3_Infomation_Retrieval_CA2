Speaking at a press conference Golhan discussed the reports of an extension of military service that had appeared on television and in newspapers. Golhan said, "There was a potential threat that led to the decision to extend military service by four months for those soldiers who were supposed to be discharged in February and May. Apart from this it is out of the question for military service to be extended to 19 months." The reason for extending service for the two groups was explained by Golhan: "Our struggle against terrorism would have been adversely affected if these soldiers had been released just when they had become fully familiar with the area of operations. New soldiers would not know the conditions and structure of the region. This is why we chose to extend their service. ``Our government was planning to totally wipe out the vicious, outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), a party which smuggles drugs and is enslaved to Armenia. Thus we had to plan operations aimed at finishing off the PKK, a group which does its training in the winter months and attacks in the summer, by the summer of 1994. Furthermore, we also had to take security precautions in the region for the local elections due to take place on March 27. And as things stand, with the operations they carried out, our brave soldiers have broken the backbone of the organization. They suffered heavy casualties. ``We have reached pretty far with our operations. I am not insinuating that we have put an end to PKK terrorism, but we are nevertheless half way there.'' Stressing that the PKK terror would be brought to an end in the summer months, Golhan said that an "economic terror" was also prevalent in Turkey. Golhan noted that it was now time to prevent economic terror, and said, "Turkey has a bright future ahead. Let's not be pessimistic about it. It is said that the automobile sector is currently undergoing a crisis. But, I watched the news on TV last night, and it was said that there has been a great increase in automobile sales. ``I don't understand how there could be a crisis when sales are increasing. As for the increase in the dollar, it is no more than a result of having kept it under pressure for many a year. All of these problems will be overcome. Terror in the economy will also be eliminated.''
