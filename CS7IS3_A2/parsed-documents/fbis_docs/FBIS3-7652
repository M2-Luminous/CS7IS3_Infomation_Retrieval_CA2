"They (North Koreans) might have something to give me, but they needn't tell me to do this or that," he said. A close associate said Yi thinks it undesirable to visit North Korea when the nuclear issue remains so touchy. "But there is no change in his plans to visit North Korea to help establish smooth inter-Korean relations when an opportune time comes along," the associate added. On Tuesday, an unidentified spokesman for North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly (parliament) issued a statement saying the speaker's invitation for Yi to visit Pyongyang is still open. The ruling Democratic Liberal Party also criticized the North Korean statement for its hidden motive to create confusion in South Korean politics.
