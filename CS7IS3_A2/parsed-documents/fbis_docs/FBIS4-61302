He is the head of a G-7 mission in Ukraine probing into the republic's nuclear security. At his meeting with the mission's officials, Ukrainian Environmental Protection Minister Yuriy Kostenko drew everyone's attention to the fact that his ministry was the only body which insisted on immediate shut down of the station. In Kostenko's opinion, measures taken to ensure the station's safety are not a guarantee that the surrounding territory would not be contaminated in case of an accident. Kostenko pointed out that under the difficult economic situation faced currently by Ukraine a prompt solution of the Chernobyl issue was possible only provided "adequate" financial and technical assistance by G-7 countries. The minister pointed out that the situation was further complicated by nuclear disarmament underway in Ukraine, "which is an expensive and laborious process." Commenting on dumping nuclear waste and exhausted fuel, Kostenko said the only acceptable variant for Ukraine would be storing such waste in temporary facilities until a stationary storage is constructed. As INTERFAX-Ukraine learned, the deputies' group preparing the first session of the newly elected republican parliament had failed to include the commission for Chernobyl issues in the panel of commissions to be approved by the new parliament's first session. The Ukrainian Party of Justice and the Chernobyl Union held a news conference in Kiev Wednesday calling on the deputies not to abolish the commission.
