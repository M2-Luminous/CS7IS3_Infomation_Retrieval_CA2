A YOMIURI SHIMBUN survey showed that support fell sharply in February to 58 percent, down 14.4 percentage points from the previous month. Meanwhile, the disapproval rate increased 11.6 points to 29.5 percent. Pollsters surveyed 3,000 eligible voters nationwide from February 26 to 27 and got responses from 2,081, or 69 percent. According to a separate nationwide survey carried out by the ASAHI SHIMBUN, support fell to 57 percent from 60 percent recorded in a December survey. The paper got responses from 2,318 eligible voters out of a sample of 3,000 surveyed from February 27 to 28. It said strong support for Hosokawa personally appeared to be putting a brake on the slide in his cabinet's popularity, with 66 percent of respondents expressing confidence in the prime minister's leadership abilities. Both dailies noted that the Hosokawa cabinet remains significantly more popular than previous Liberal Democratic Party administrations. But the YOMIURI said the plunge in support will come as a heavy blow to a government that has relied on strong popular approval ratings to compensate for its weak base in the Diet.
