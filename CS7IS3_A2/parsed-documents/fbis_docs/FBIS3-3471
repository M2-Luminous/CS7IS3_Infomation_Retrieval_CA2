Implementation is not an easy task; we should realistically think of a way to implement the blueprint." It is true that the current NPC session has been lively and fruitful despite its short duration. Deputies are aware that the session is being held at a time when our country's reform and opening up are entering a new phase and when various reforms of the economic structure are entering a crucial moment. The central authorities have defined the overall task of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability" for the entire party and country. Not only does this task accord with the aspirations of hundreds of millions of people nationwide, but also conforms to our country's reality and objective laws. Deputies attending the session, therefore, signaled their intention of applying centrally determined goals, major policies and principles, and development ideas to their jobs in good time; of relaying them to the masses; and of turning the intentions of central authorities into society-wide and nationwide actions at the earliest possible date. "We are thinking of a way to implement the blueprint." Deputy Ye Liansong, who is Hebei governor, was still busy at this desk in the dead of night. He said: "The government of the current term has proposed turning Hebei into an economically strong province? How shall we achieve this? By thoroughly and actually implementing specific aspects of the major policies and principles of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council at the earliest possible date." His remarks hit the nail on the head. The deputies are generally aware that "thorough implementation" carries exceptional significance this year, particularly with respect to the CPC Central Committee's call for "conceiving new ideas for economic development." This year is crucial to reform and opening up. Many major reform measures have been introduced. We shall encounter considerable problems and difficulties. This requires people to think more often, more closely, and more thoroughly. We should go to the front lines to find effective solutions to problems. Ye Liansong noted: The key to implementing the blueprint is to change leading cadres' work style. We must proceed in a down-to-earth manner. "Dishonest and substandard" work carried out by leading cadres are even more harmful than "counterfeit and inferior" products produced by enterprises. He cited an example, saying: Toward the end of last year, the provincial party committee and government experimentally implemented a new set of measures and regimes of incentives and restraints regarding the appointment of cadres. The purpose of these measures and regimes is to appoint cadres who work in a down-to-earth manner to important positions so as to create a situation in which "capable people will be promoted, people of average ability will make way for others, and mediocre people will be demoted," as well as to promote the habits of determining the true state of affairs, telling the truth, doing practical turns, and seeking tangible results. To implement the blueprint is to be practical. To be practical is to assess local advantages and disadvantages in an extremely objective and calm manner, and to pinpoint problems and their root causes in a down-to-earth manner before making great efforts to surmount them. In short, it means seeking truth from facts. Deputy Wang Guiming, who is secretary of Tianjin's Nankai district party committee, said: We still have a long way to go before we can turn the intentions of central authorities into actions at the grass-roots level and achieve tangible results. He maintained: Fund shortages aside, the greatest difficulty in seizing the opportunity to develop the economy stems from structural problems. We have yet to streamline the government apparatus and completely change the government's functions. Policies now come from different sources, and there are just too many departments in charge. In handling an affair, one has to consult 36 departments. By the time one has accomplished an affair, the market opportunity has long passed. It seems that establishing a leadership system consistent with the socialist market economy is a pressing task. What shall we do at the moment? Practical action is needed to implement the blueprint amid considerable difficulties and problems. Hebei deputies Li Ruichang and Bai Runzhang found themselves in agreement with Tianjin deputies Wang Guiming, Hi Zhikuan, and Kou Shiqing on this matter. They all said: "We still need to solve reform-related problems through reform means." They maintained: At present, we should draw on advanced management expertise at home and abroad in order to break free from the old management mode. We should carry out reform in our work and perform our work in the course of reform. Moreover, we should limit the time and simplify the procedures for handling matters by leaders at all levels and by general affairs departments. They also proposed: The government should change its functions in the course of reform, letting the market deal with things that should be handled by market forces and allowing enterprises to manage matters that fall within the scope of their authority. The government should only concern itself with exercising macroeconomic regulation and control, with coordinating actions, and with providing service. Savvy entrepreneurs are the most practical men of action. When the reporters asked deputies Ji Xuecheng and Liu Jianzhang -- respectively general manager of Tianjin Automotive Industrial Corporation and board chairman of Tianjin Hualian Trading House -- on how to "implement" the blueprint, they pronounced these two characters: "Practical deeds." They explained: "Stalling" is the dreaded character when it comes to implementing the blueprint. Postponing a matter from today until tomorrow and from tomorrow until the day after tomorrow is something to be worried about. Li Huisheng, a peasant deputy from Baoding District, said: "The NPC session stresses the importance of agriculture everyday. Nevertheless, relevant policies have not been implemented among peasants. At the end of each year, for example, peasants are left with just over 100 yuan for each mu of land tilled, although they had all along been anticipating additional incomes. When shall we ever become comparatively well-to-do? He said: We, peasants, have composed a doggerel: The prices of production means are soaring, the prices of agricultural and sideline products are crawling, and the benefits from agricultural and cotton production are sliding. The eight measures for strengthening agriculture outlined in Premier Li Peng's report struck a chord with us. We hope these measures will come to fruition. We, peasants, are waiting for results." It is true that people across the country are waiting for, looking forward to, and assessing actions to implement the guidelines of the current session.
