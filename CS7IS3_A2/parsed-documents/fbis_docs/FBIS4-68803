In the opinion of the leadership of the oblast, a 5 kilometer border zone will stop unscrupulous businessmen and poachers who are exploiting the natural wealth of Sakhalin in their own selfish interests, fishing for valuable marketable species of fish in coastal waters, and conducting raids on the spawning grounds at the mouths of Sakhalin rivers. In accordance with the Law of the Russian Federation on the State Border, the administrations of the krays and oblasts that adjoin foreign borders of Russia were given the right to determine the rules for the presence of citizens on their territories. Henceforth, in order to acquire the right to be in the rayons of Sakhalin Oblast, those who enter the 5 kilometer border zone will have to register here. Foreign citizens will have to secure the approval of competent organs. In the opinion of the deputy governor of the oblast, Viktor Gurevich, these measures are intended first of all to subdue poachers--citizens of Russia and CIS countries--and do not have a direct bearing on the illegal fishing business by Japanese fishermen in Russian territorial waters. "Japanese economic expansion is not threatening Sakhalin," said Gurevich to an OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent, "and you cannot lure them here for all the money in the world" (the Japanese--S.A.). While the toughened border regime in Maritime Kray and other rayons adjoining the Sino-Russian border has a political character--the prevention of purposeful assimilation of Chinese in Russia--the actions of the Sakhalin administration are the result of economic reasons. It is necessary to prevent the illegal export of valuable maritime products from the peninsula. Ocean delicacies are the only articles of income for the meager budget of the oblast. However, Sakhalin does not receive 1 kopek for the sale of fish and ocean products on account of the state order. According to Gurevich, the situation in the oblast is catastrophic, and the workers of budget organizations have not received their pay for half a year already. The quota of delicacy fish and ocean products allocated to Sakhalin by the Government of the Russian Federation is enough only to exchange them for fuel and vital products. According to the latest calculations, the cost of the consumer basket in South Sakhalin is R150,000. Prices here, given the same rates of pay as on the mainland, are higher than Moscow by a factor of five. "The Russian Government is doing everything to convince residents of the Far East that these territories are not necessary to Russia," declared Gurevich. The introduction of a border regime on the peninsula of Sakhalin will most likely bury the free economic zone that was established here. The result of this economic experiment is already that the counters of local stores, which were always filled with fish and ocean products, have become empty. The unpopularity of the SEZ [Free Economic Zone] at one time became one of the reasons for the defeat in municipal elections of Vyacheslav Fedorov, a former governor of the oblast and apologist of a free economy.
