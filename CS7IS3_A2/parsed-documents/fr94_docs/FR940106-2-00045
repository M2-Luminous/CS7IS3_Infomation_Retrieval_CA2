FR940106-2-00045 FR940106-2-00029 The Sumitomo Bank, Limited; Application To Engage in Certain Nonbanking Activities The Sumitomo Bank, Limited, Osaka, Japan (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and section 225.23 of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23), for approval to engage through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sumitomo Bank Securities, Inc., New York, New York (Company), in underwriting and dealing in, to a limited extent, certain municipal revenue bonds, 1-4 family mortgage-related securities, consumer receivable-related securities, and commercial paper. Applicant proposes to conduct the activities on a world-wide basis. Closely Related to Banking Standard Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity ``that the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto''. In determining whether a proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers, inter alia , the matters set forth in National Courier Association v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 516 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are: (1) Whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed services, (2) Whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the proposed services as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services; and (3) Whether banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require their provision in a specialized form. See 516 F.2d at 1237. In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y , 49 FR 806 (1984). Applicant maintains that the Board previously has determined by order that the proposed activities, when conducted within the limitations established by the Board, are closely related to banking and consistent with section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377). See, e.g., Citicorp , 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 473 (1987), aff'd sub nom. Securities Industry Ass'n v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , 839 F.2d 47 (2d Cir. 1988), cert. denied , 486 U.S. 1059 (1988); Order Approving Modifications to the Section 20 Orders , 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 751 (1989); The Sanwa Bank, Limited , 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 568 (1990); Order Approving Modifications to the Section 20 Orders , 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 226 (1993); and Supplement to Order Approving Modifications to Section 20 Orders , 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 360 (1993). Proper Incident to Banking Standard In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8). Applicant believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Applicant maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and result in greater convenience to Applicant's customers. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices, and that Company will conduct the proposed activities in accordance with prudential limitations designed to safeguard against such potential adverse effects that have been relied upon by the Board in similar previous cases. See, e.g., Citicorp, supra; The Sanwa Bank, Limited, supra. In this regard, Applicant has requested that one of the prudential limitations be modified to permit one officer or one director of one of its United States banking affiliates to serve as a director of Company, a modification which Applicant maintains is consistent with prior Board actions. See, e.g., Synovus Financial Corp., et al. , 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 954 (1991). In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application, and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets or is likely to meet the standards of the BHC Act. Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than January 26, 1994. Any request for a hearing on this application must, as required by section 262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 30, 1993. Jennifer J. Johnson, Associate Secretary of the Board. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;217 Filed 1&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6210&hyph;01&hyph;F
