Mr Mandela said he had been in Tunis attending a gathering of the Organisation of African Unity on Wednesday when the cabinet took the decision. "I'm not very clear on the actual decision that has been taken," he said. "I will be briefed on this on Monday." He added the cabinet was trying to resolve the matter in a way that would do justice to all the parties and unite the government. The people indemnified by Mr de Klerk include former Civil Co-operation Bureau head Maj-Gen Eddie Webb. Minister of Justice Dullah Omar said earlier this month the amnesties had been "frozen" and the matter was being handled by Mr Mandela. Lawyers for Human Rights National Director Brian Currin on Friday distanced himself from the cabinet decision. Mr Currin is chairman of an advisory committee set up by Mr Omar to review about 800 applications for indemnity. He said: "We understand that this decision was taken on the basis of a legal opinion received from the state law advisers. It was apparently not based on an assessment of any of the cases under scrutiny. I wish to place on record that the advisory committee chaired by myself had made no recommendations whatsoever as at Wednesday, June 15, regarding the indemnification or release of the persons under consideration. As chairman of this committee I wish to state that I therefore had nothing whatsoever to do with the release process now under way."
