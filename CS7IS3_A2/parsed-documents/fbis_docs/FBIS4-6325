Mun Ik-hwan slated for 27 April. The telephone message proposed that a working-level contact be held to discuss this matter on 22 April in Panmunjom. The National Unification Board announced that it will not respond to this proposal, claiming that Pomminyon has not only been described in the domestic laws as a pro-enemy organization but the proposal will not be conducive to alleviating today's tense North-South relations created by the nuclear issue.
