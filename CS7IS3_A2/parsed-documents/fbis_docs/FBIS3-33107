According to this source, there was gunfire during the incident. The armed men, who are being sought, left weapons including three M- 1 rifles and ammunition in the area. The incident took place near the village of Chantal near Les Cayes, some 200 km southwest of Port-au-Prince. Three Haitians from the diaspora, who had clandestinely reentered the country, were training young people of the region in the rural section of Le Pretre when they were discovered by a reconnaissance patrol acting on a tip, which then turned into a combat patrol, according to the same source. No Army personnel were wounded. There is no information about casualties among the opposing group. The plan to train for armed struggle is part of Operation Iron Cuts Iron aimed at liberating the country, which was announced by President Aristide from Washington in a New Year's message to Haitians, this source explained. In order to thwart this plan and maintain order, search operations were recently launched by the Army in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area where six weapons, including two with telescopic lenses, were seized and arrests made, this military source pointed out. He added that the situation in Les Cayes, where similar incidents have taken place since Aristide went into exile in 1991, was totally under the control of the local military command. Furthermore, the same source said that the fire that destroyed oil products clandestinely stored in a low-income neighborhood of Port-au-Prince on the night of 12 February might be the act of a criminal hand to raise fuel prices and exacerbate the crisis.
