The petition regarding the HADEP's foundation will reportedly be presented to the Interior Ministry today. After pro-longed discussions on whether the new party should be called the Democratic People's Party or the Peace and Democracy Party, the DEP members have finally decided to give it the former name. Former DEP Secretary-General Murat Bozlak has been appointed chairman of the new party, the emblem of which will be a butterfly with black spots on its wings. As the new party was being founded, the DEP rank and file took part in heated discussions, laying the foundations for division. The supporters of the Kurdistan Socialist Party (PSK) led by Kemal Burkay, the pro-Kurdistan Democrat Party-Unity (PDK-Hevgirtin) and the pro-Rizgari have not been included in the new party. Hasan Celalettin Ezman, a former Republican People's Party (CHP) deputy from Bingol between 1973-1980, will be given a post in the party. Arguments that the new party should tend towards the left and defend the rights of the Turkish and the Kurdish people, as the DYP [as published] has serious faults and inadequacies, have influenced the shape taken by the new party. However due to the fact that the majority of the founders of the new party are Kurdish gives a hint that it will not easily lose its Kurdish image. According to party sources the fact that the program mentions elements such as peace, brotherhood and humanism and that it is determined to use the political platform until the end will help it to gain a leftist image. With the foundation of HADEP, the Kurds in the political arena will have realized their ambition to establish a new party. If the DEP is closed, the HADEP will continue its activities. However it is known that some groups, who are not happy with HADEP, are trying to found a separate party. The PSK supporters have cut off their ties with the DEP and have not taken part in HADEP. PSK members are reportedly trying to found a legal Kurdish party. Halil Aksoy, a DEP member and active in the PSK, has resigned from the DEP. Refik Karakoc, Kmela Yuksel, Latif Epozdemir and Fethi Demir have also resigned from the DEP. Serafettin Elci is proposing to found another Kurdish party. It is known that Elci is continuing his activities in this respect but there have been no concrete developments as yet. Furthermore it is reported that Elci plans to exclude all radical Kurdish groups and found a party which has the support of pro state people and village guards. However it is said that this party will not have wide spread Kurdish support. However, the following view which is voiced in Kurdish circles is worth mentioning: "Let all the Kurdish groups found their respective political parties and led the legal channels in this regard be opened. This is very important to the solution of the Kurdish question. Let the Kurds have the possibility to represent themselves legally." The political spectrum will become more colorful with the foundation of new Kurdish parties but under existing laws no Kurdish words are permitted in their programs. We shall soon wee what formulas are found to circumvent this ban.
