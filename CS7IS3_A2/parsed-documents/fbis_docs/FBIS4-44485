China will soon enter the GATT, and our banking industry will soon encounter tremendous outside pressure. As far as the opening up modern rural financial undertakings is concerned, this all means challenges as well as rare opportunities: 1. According to figures revealed by the State Statistics Bureau, the per capita saving of a peasant household was only 7.05 yuan in 1978, a mere 5 percent of the per capita net income in that year. As of 1991, the per-capita saving of a peasant household had reached 271.91 yuan, accounting for 38 percent of the per capita net income in that year. If we take savings as a kind of financial asset, we can clearly see the upward trend of the percentage of a peasant's financial asset to the net income in each year. The growth of the peasants' financial asset shows that peasants are able to save more after their income increases. This is also a requirement for the development of modern banking industry in the countryside. In conducting an aggregate economic analysis, Western macro-economists often state that "savings are equivalent to investments." However, savings need an effective media to become investments. That media is the financial system composed of modern financial organizations and the money market. Nevertheless, the functions of the existing financial organizations in China are not so perfect. It is difficult for these organizations to play their role well in doing financing. When we carried out investigations in the rural areas during the past few years, we often found that some peasant families often keep tremendous amounts of cash locked in boxes at home. This situation is closely related to the slow development of the rural banking industry in China. 2) The rapid development of various rural industries and the vigorous rural economic activities to become market-oriented have greatly increased economic contacts and rapidly expanded the business of settling accounts in the same and in different areas. Right now the existing financial institutions are weak in settling accounts, the account-settling procedure is complicated, and there is endless carping and countless taboos in this connection. Methods used to settle accounts are also backward. On top of all this, the range of services provided by the financial institutions remains narrow. Their efficiency is quite low, and services are poor. As a result, many rural economic entities often use cash in business transactions, thus aggravating the situation wherein money is being circulated outside the bank. This kind of situation has not only increased the risk of the financial institutions in money circulation and their cost in settling accounts, but also made them lack of short-term loans. From the macro-economic point of view, it is a tremendous financial loss. 3) The contradiction between supply and demand of long-term capital in rural areas is becoming sharper and sharper in each passing day. The rural long-term capital includes social capital (roads, water supply and drainage channels, electric power and other infrastructural facilities) and industrial capital. The experiences at home and abroad show that it usually takes more than 10 years to accumulate long-term funds in support of social capital and that it also takes more than one year to accumulate medium and long-term funds in support of industrial capital. With the further development of the rural economy, the demand for long-term capital is becoming greater and greater. Due to the fact that China's market for long-term capital is nearly a blank, right now we can only fill this gap by relying on the various irregular flexible measures adopted in various localities for the supply of long-term capital such as raising social funds and soliciting public assistance and donations. The supply of such funds is unstable. In addition, the cost in raising funds in such way remains high. It is far insufficient to satisfy the requirements in developing China's economy. As a result, the contradiction between the supply and demand of the long-term capital is becoming sharper and sharper. 4) Impact from China's re-entry into GATT and opportunities to become export-oriented. If negotiations are carried out normally, China is expected to return to GATT (hereinafter referred to as "China's re-entry to GATT"). The "Uruguay Round" of talks -- the eighth round of multilateral GATT trade talks -- had entered the final stage since its inception in September 1986. The service trade agreement of the Uruguay Round (draft of the final agreement) had stipulated the detail provisions on the five aspects of market access, national treatment, market transparency, most-favored nation status and the special treatments to developing countries. In order to develop China's banking industry, we must earnestly deal with the following issues: A) Exclusion clause for suppliers of financial services. Those financial institutions owned or controlled by the government which mainly execute government functions or carry out activities for the government should not provide financial services. Therefore, China's current system of financial institutions with state-run banks, insurance companies and securities companies as its main entities will encounter serious institutional obstacles when it faces competitions from the international banking industry after China's re-entry into GATT. B) The right to go into business (business involvement). Each participating nation should give providers of financial services of other participating nations the right to set up offices in its own country to offer the same type of financial services. C) New financial service. It is the type of financial service that none of the financial service providers is offering in a specific participating nation except it is being offered in one participating nation. The latter should permit the financial service providers of other participating nations to offer new financial services in any form within its boundaries. In view of the tremendous differences in the form of shipment and delivery used by China's existing financial institutions in providing financial services, the provision on a participating nation's obligation to provide new financial services will create a strong shock wave on China's banking industry. D) National treatment. Each participating nation should permit other participating nations' financial service providers which have already set up offices in its boundaries to contact the disbursement and account-settling departments of this participating nation for access to the supply of government funds by refinancing through the regular commercial channel. Foreign financial service providers should be given equal treatments as their domestic counterparts in seeking membership of financial organizations and participating in any institution which has the rights to formulate its own rules and regulations, in securities or futures exchanges, and in account-settling organs or other organizations or associations. Moreover, when a nation gives direct or indirect special privileges or treatments to its own financial institutions in rendering financial services, the foreign financial institutions in the country should also enjoy the same privileges and treatments. With regard to the aforementioned mandatory clause, we naturally may gradually reduce the various restrictions which conflict with GATT rules in accordance with the special GATT preferential treatments to developing nations, while protecting our own financial institutions to a certain extent and within a limited period of time. However, China's re-entry into GATT will undoubtedly have a great impact on China's banking industry. It will put pressure on us, while providing us with a motivational force. Whether or not we can seize the opportunities, meet the challenges, turn the pressure into a motive force, the key lies in our efforts to deepen our financial reform, open our banking industry wider to the outside world and increase our competitiveness in the world market. II While we are faced with the aforementioned market changes in rural economy and the tremendous challenges and opportunities given us by China's chance to re-enter GATT, our rural banking industry deplorably fails to keep pace with this situation. Signs are manifested as follows: 1) Monopolistic short-term money market and backward methods for financing. As far as the whole country is concerned, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China and the rural credit cooperatives under its administration, the Bank of China, the Construction Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are the only national banks in China that have branches all over the country; and can accept deposits directly from the residents, serve various economic entities in settling accounts and extend loans to financial institutions which need money. Only they can handle "real banking businesses." Although the functions of the aforementioned five banks somewhat overlap each other since the development of the reform program, their monopoly in the realm of production is still not broken down. The 180,000 odd financial institutions which emerged in the 1980's had preliminarily shattered the monopoly of a single bank in the use of funds, but they have not become effective competitors of the specialized banks in China's banking industry, since they only have a few branches and they are short of capital. They cannot accept deposits. Nor can they settle accounts or build vaults. In the rural areas, the Agricultural Bank of China and the rural credit cooperatives under its administration have still monopolized the rural banking industry. As a result, the methods for financing in the rural district is still far behind the world advanced level. If we view China's entire banking industry, its standard is equivalent to that of the developed nations in the 1950's. If it is said that there is a gap between China's industry and that of the developed nations, then there is even wider gap between China's banking industry and that of the developed nations. Other direct consequences of the monopoly of the banking industry are less service items and poor service quality. 2) The long-term money market is nearly a blank. It badly needs development. According to our survey, long-term financing activities in China's rural areas are limited to loans between close relatives and good friends for the building of rural residential houses. Here, there are no modern financial institutions. Factors of the money market such as the interest rate, mortgage, equity and credit period are non-existent. This situation is no doubt a considerable obstacle to the accumulation of long-term capital needed to further develop the rural economy. 3) Weak, ineffective and insufficient number of nongovernmental financial institutions. In China's rural area, a group of nongovernmental market-oriented financial institutions have emerged in the course of developing the market economy during the past 13 years. These financial institutions have satisfied, to a certain extent, the needs of the rural money market at various levels and counteracted the weaknesses of the aforementioned monopolistic financial institutions in the supply of funds for the development of market economy in rural districts. Nevertheless, these nongovernmental financial institutions share common weaknesses of relatively incompetent personnel, insufficient of capital and backward methods for financing. The current state of affairs shows that it will be difficult to rely on the existing nongovernmental financial institutions to meet the challenges and competitions from the world banking industry after China's re-entry into GATT. Specifically speaking, China's major nongovernmental rural financial institution -- the Rural Cooperative Foundation --has made remarkable progress. However, its capital was only 10 billion yuan by the end of 1991, a fraction of the 300 billion yuan deposits in the Agricultural Bank of China. Moreover, it receives serious internal administrative inferences. Its rules and regulations are far from being perfect, and its management needs improvement. Meanwhile, private money houses, credit unions and other nongovernmental financial organizations are still sporadic, and they score little progress because of their traditional practices. III In order to bring about changes to turn China's rural economy into a modern market economy and increase China's competitiveness in the world market, we should reform the rural banking industry as follows: 1. We must resolutely break down the monopoly in China's banking industry, encourage competitions in the financial sector and vigorously develop modern nongovernment financial institutions. Under the macroeconomic guidance of the state financial policy, we must cultivate multi-level financial organizations in various economic sectors, draw on the advanced experience of foreign countries, adopt a series of feasible measures against financial monopoly in the banking industry, and encourage and safeguard competitions among various types of financial institutions. The major task of the governments at the central and provincial levels is to develop a group of modern financial institutions that may compete in the international market. Due to the requirement for high technology and professionally trained personnel in the development of a modern banking industry, one of the realistic measures is to encourage those staff members who had left the existing state-run financial institutions or those who returned from their studies abroad to set up or lead new financial institutions. The related departments and governments at all levels must work hard to create a good external environment for this type of new financial institution. The state financial administrative departments may also set different standards for modern financial organizations and encourage them to further improve themselves through competition. Meanwhile it is necessary to clearly define the government's function in working out financial policies and its function in the control of financial institutions; and adequately separate these two functions. The former is mainly aimed at harmonizing the relation between economic development and the money supply, stabilizing the value of money and controlling where to put the money is use. The latter is mainly aimed at guiding the financial institutions, developing modern financial organizations, helping them become more competitive and promoting and safeguarding fair competitions in the banking industry. 2. We must vigorously form and develop the long-term money market. Since the beginning of the 1990's, China had made preliminary breakthroughs in doing direct financing. The securities market had gradually grown out of nothing and opened up a new path for raising long-term capital. From now on, we must study and find new ways on how to channel the money in the securities market to rural areas. In the course of developing the long-term money market, we must pay particular attention to the role of the insurance industry. Generally speaking, the insurance companies sign insurance contracts with their clients who wish to guard against any contingency. They collect a fixed amount of insurance premiums from their clients, and pay indemnities according to the contract when the specified accident occurs. The insurance companies use this method to provide their clients with financial assets. At the same time, they keep the premiums they receive as reserve funds to pay indemnities in case something happens. In general, they have a considerable amount of money on hand. As a result, the insurance companies which are the main suppliers of industrial funds often play an important role on the securities market. This is particularly true in the realm of life insurance. The insurance companies are able to use modern technology to accurately predict the rate of mortality. Also, the insurance contracts they sign with their clients are usually extra long-term ones. Therefore, their capital is relatively long-term and stable. Life insurance, as the main body in the supply of long-term funds, plays a significant role in the long-term money market. The figures provided by the State Statistics Bureau indicate that insurance premiums in China grew from 2.57 billion yuan in 1985 to 20.97 billion yuan in 1991, with an average annual growth rate of 41.9 percent. Its old-age pension insurance premiums grew from 180 million yuan in 1987 to 3.31 billion yuan in 1991 with an average annual growth rate of 62.5 percent. The percentage of the old-age pension insurance premiums in the entire amount of premiums collected also rose from 6.9 percent in 1985 to 15.8 percent in 1991. The departments of civil affairs in various localities have also enthusiastically encouraged people to buy rural social old-age pension insurance. Right now, more than 800 counties (cities and districts) in China have carried out experiments in selling rural social old-age pension insurance policies. More than seven million peasants have underwritten the old-age pension insurance. This situation indicates that the insurance industry, particularly the old-age pension insurance which is the main long-term money supply already has a good start in China. It is expected to grow rapidly. The next step is how to tackle the issue of guarding against monopoly and safeguard competition and how to turn the insurance funds into long-term capital. 3. We must promote the modernization of the banking industry and further improve technologies in this connection. We should draw on the advanced experience of the banking industry abroad. To speed up the process of making full use of the foreign advanced banking technologies, we urgently need to carry out the following tasks: A) We must establish a modernized system for settling accounts. B) We must set up a modernized mortgage system and improve the relevant organizations. C) We must reform the system of loan administration, and use, wherever possible, the method of bill discount and that of bill rediscount by the Central Bank for extending short-term loans. Some of the major issues which have plagued China's banking industry are the fact that it is difficult to control where to actually use the credit funds and the misappropriation of funds. If we extend short-term loans by mainly relying on the method of bill discount, we would be able to solve, to a great extent, the headache in our banking industry. D) We must accelerate the process of computerizing the banking industry. In short, China is a developing nation with a shortage of capital. To maintain sustained and steady economic growth, we will have to rely, to a great extent and for a long time to come, on our family savings. How to effectively and smoothly turn family savings into social and industrial capital. Making the best use of our rare sources of capital (in different regions, different industries and different enterprises) is the unshirkable historic responsibility of China's banking industry for rejuvenating our nation.
