To uniformly build a market mechanism managed by the state in accordance with socialism: We will continue to build a new and uniformed economic policy, persist in the transformation to the market mechanism in parallel with the consolidation of an effective state management, and continue to perfect all mechanisms and policies so that the market mechanism can operate effectively: -- To ensure the independence of all business entities. State agencies will only manage state-related domains and will not directly control business activities. -- Prices are to be determined by the market. -- Lawful and healthy competition will be encouraged, while monopolies will be avoided. -- Businessmen are entitled to profit as long as they operate within the laws. -- The state will fix and subsidize the prices of certain merchandise that are vital socioeconomically within the scope of the market mechanism. -- The state encourages the uniformed establishment of various markets: merchandise, services, labor, capital, technology, real estate, and so forth. Which principles should a socialism-oriented state management apply? -- The state should manage the whole economy and all economic sectors, not limit itself to the state-owned sector. -- The centralization and unification of the government in macro-economic management should be strengthened in parallel with the expansion of responsibility and authority of sectors and localities in areas that they can manage more efficiently, while always respecting the independence of business enterprises. -- The relevant ministries should strive to satisfactorily formulate development strategies, plans, and policies for their sectors; guide, support, inspect, and control all business establishments of various economic sectors in the localities in accordance with the state economic-technical management function. -- The comprehensive inter-sectorial management of government ministries should be consolidated, so that all socioeconomic activities are put under the state's effective macro-management. -- State authorities at all levels should carry out state management duties in their respective areas in all business establishments regardless of them being centrally- or locally-owned. For the management task to be effective, we must: -- Complete the legal system and resolutely enforce the laws. -- Consolidate and develop the supervisory role the staff in planning agencies to strengthen planning for development. -- Continue with the comprehensive and profound reforms of the financial and monetary systems. 4. To Take Care of Cultural and Social Issues: The most thorough guiding concept of our party reflected in all cultural and social lines and policies is to care, nurture, and develop the human factor, which is both a motive and an aim of the revolution. The important issues in these domains at present are employment, social equity, level of public knowledge, a healthy and clean society, the development of national culture, and health care and protection. -- What are the most important ways to create employment? All people will cooperate with the state to invest more savings to accelerate industrialization and modernization, thus creating more jobs. All citizens and economic elements, domestic and overseas investors alike, are to be encouraged to develop their business activities and expand their external relations, as development will help solve the employment issue. -- On what basis do we set up our social equality policies? Economic growth must relate closely to social progress and equality at each stage of its development. Social equality is seen in the reasonable distribution of production resources and products of the economy, as well as in opportunities for development of each individual. We will apply the principle that allows higher income for those who are produce and contribute more, and vice versa. Distribution is based mainly on labor and on capital contributed to business and production activities. Talents and skills are to be encouraged and valued. The lawful accumulation of wealth should be encouraged, while programs to eradicate hunger and reduce poverty should be developed. We should see a growing number of people getting rich before others as a positive indication of development. We will carry out suitable policies in credit, tax, and career training to create conditions for the poor to improve their chances of making ends meet and becoming better off. We should also motivate the richer sections of society to help the state assist those who are poorer with capital, production resources, experience, and advice for their own businesses. The richer, developed regions should help the state assist poorer, and slower-developing ones. The state will have suitable policies to reserve investment subsidies for poorer regions, and will assign the richer regions the responsibility of supporting poorer ones. The state should also have suitable policies and special aid for regions with unique difficulties and disadvantages in comparison to others. These include mountainous and remote regions, ethnic minority regions, and former revolutionary bases. On the other hand, these localities also have to help themselves by developing their potential and using subsidized capital efficiently. (To be continued)
