Please tell me your frank impression. [Watanabe] It was because I was too optimistic in grasping the situation that I failed to realize my intention while creating the serious confusion within the LDP. I want to deeply apologize for creating such a confusion while the time was not ripe. However, it was a most noteworthy tendency seen during the recent confusion that there was a change of factional alignment based on policy consensus. The contents of the policy consensus originally reached between the coalition parties and me has changed considerably. I feel I can be proud of myself for separating from the coalition parties for that reason. The fact that our alliance turned out to be a failure proved, expressed reversely, that the policy consensus I proposed was regarded as a basis of factional alignment. Therefore, I do not feel ashamed at all. As I firmly believe, I am totally prepared to accept public criticism. I am not feeling as serious as people might expect. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] From an early stage, you have been using the words "save-the-nation cabinet." [Watanabe] I have been using the words for half a year. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] In declaring that you were to save the nation, you must have been seriously determined. Yet, the fact that, after all, you remained in the LDP makes the general public feel that your attitude is irresolute. [Watanabe] I suppose people will feel that way. I cannot help being criticized for my behavior. However, you cannot be allied since the difference between our policies have been revealed, can you? In dealing with the problem of security, the coalition parties do not express their positive support, but they are simply to maintain or to succeed the same attitude of the preceding administration. It is also not clear whether or not they are in favor of making emergency laws. At a midnight news conference held 21 April, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] chairman said that the party was opposed to making emergency laws. It is also not clear how the party is going to deal with the consumption tax. Besides, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the key party, had accepted the policy, which is different from ours. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] In the first place, when did the move to be allied with the so called "reformists" -- Shinseito and Komeito -- emerge within the [LDP]? [Watanabe] To explain the background, I have to trace back to the time when the Hosokawa Cabinet was formed. When it became necessary to choose whether the coalition government was to include or exclude the LDP, Hosokawa and Sakigake [Harbinger] members, being incited by the mass media, preferred to form a government excluding the LDP. In addition, Shinseito also strongly rejected the LDP. Then, though the reasons are not clear, Shinseito and Komeito were about to be allied. As a result, the Hosokawa administration was formed without any policy agreement. Seeing this process, I thought this government is fragile, and felt that, unless a policy agreement is reached, it will be inevitable that the government will collapse in the near future, in less than a year. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] It did not last even one year. The Hosokawa administration collapsed in eight months, did it not? [Watanabe] I thought the government would last at least until June or July. However, being unable to clear the suspicions cast upon him, Hosokawa suddenly threw out the government. I myself was surprised. His act is extremely irresponsible. Now, what is important for us is that, in forming a new administration, we should not repeat the same stupidity. The ship of state will not be able to move forward or backward unless boarded, at least, by people of the same thought. Why Watanabe Thinks the National Welfare Tax Is Reasonable Then, suddenly, the suspicion about nuclear development by North Korea surfaced. If North Korea refuses to accept UN inspection to the last, sooner or later, it will become inevitable for the United Nations to give economic pressure. In a worst case scenario, it is possible that an economic blockade may take place. When we try to see what Japan can do under such a situation, we realize that, not having an established emergency law system, Japan is totally unable to deal with such a situation. In short, it is my fundamental concept that, if a new government is to be formed, it should consist of members of the same opinion to be able to deal with various problems. If I refer to Japan-U.S. relations, I believe that Japan should support the Security Treaty. Some people say that, since the Cold War is over, it will be enough to maintain or to succeed the same policy as the preceding government in dealing with the Security Treaty. However, when trade conflicts are ceaselessly taking place between Japan and the United States, we should realize that the only way for Japan to keep ties with the United States is to support the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. By all means, we should be positive in supporting the Security Treaty to not have the important ties loosened. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] When the Hosokawa administration proposed introducing the national welfare tax, you were the only person in the LDP to support the proposal, were you not? [Watanabe] No, I did not necessarily give my consent to the national welfare tax. I agreed to the idea that indirect taxes should be increased to secure fund sources for welfare in the future. In fact, I myself was surprised. Anybody would be surprised if suddenly told that the consumption tax is to be abolished and a 7 percent national welfare tax is to be introduced. If I were him, I would have taken a more moderate way. I will fully explain the reason. Since the social security expenses are to largely increase toward future, we need to secure fund sources to support the long-living society. Then, I will tell the people that, if business conditions recover, the consumption tax rate may be increased by, for instance, 2 percent two years later. And, after that, taking the changing situation into consideration, I will tell the people that, maybe in five years, the tax rate will be increased another 2 percent. Basically, I simply wanted to say that it was acceptable to give more weight to indirect taxes and to review the ratio between direct and indirect taxes. I Wanted To Act As a Go-Between [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Anyway, some people within the coalition parties agreed that your idea was acceptable, did they not? [Watanabe] It is true that Shinseito, Komeito, and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], etcetera, thought that my opinion was agreeable. Of course, they made approaches to me. I could not say such a thing if there were no approaches at all. Though I cannot tell with whom I met and what we talked about, it is true that I felt I could work with them. It is also true that we discussed the possibility of forming a group centering around my policy, as I mentioned before. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] A news report says that there was a secret talk between Watanabe and Hosokawa on 23 February, and that you met with Ichiro Ozawa twice at the beginning of April. The report says that Prime Minister Hosakawa asked you to join the cabinet, and that Ozawa asked your intention about assuming the post of prime minister or deputy prime minister. What is the truth? [Watanabe] Well, since everything is over, I want to refrain from commenting on the subject. Anyway, though I felt that I could work with them, they had to save their own face. Since they have been acting as a non-LDP group, their face does not allow them to join the LDP. However, if they are seriously concerned about the state and the people, it is reasonable for them to ask for LDP assistance even if the next prime minister is to be elected from among the coalition parties. Even in case it is not possible to do so because of the time limit, it is possible for the people who maintain a sound conservative idea in a good sense and the people who maintain a nonsocialistic idea to join together since these people share the same idea with the majority of LDP members. Therefore, I thought I might be able to play the role of a go- between. I wanted to become a bridge between the two groups by forming a new political party by myself or with several other members. However, I gradually came to realize that there was strong opposition to my idea within the SDPJ, and that certain members of other parties were also against my idea. Under that situation, I had, in the first place, to secure members to support me to replace members who were against me. And, above all, through the repeated discussions, I had come to realize that we could not reach a policy agreement. Under such a situation, it became meaningless to form a new political party. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] After all, it was the SDPJ's opposition that became a bottleneck, was it not? [Watanabe] If we take the Constitution problem alone, it is true there are people of different opinions even within the LDP. I never intended to say that something should be done about Article 9 of the Constitution. It is all right to leave the article as it is. However, I wonder if the existing Constitution is totally flawless as it is. What I am saying is that we need to study the Constitution a little further. For example, the ownership of land and the right to use land are too strong, making it impossible to construct an additional runway at Narita Airport while 15 years have already passed. Not enough consideration is being paid to public interests. Also, not enough consideration is being paid to the claim on minimum legal inheritance, and no provision is being incorporated about environmental rights. In many aspects, the Constitution is outdated. Yet, the SDPJ's so-called absolute defenders group even prohibits studying the Constitution, not to mention reviewing it. I cannot work with such fellows. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] During the talks with Ozawa you referred to before, naturally you talked about forming, if you can secure the necessary numbers, a Watanabe administration excluding the SDPJ, did you not? [Watanabe] I leave my answer to your imagination. I should not make practical comments calling people by name. Though I do not think that anybody will believe me if I say there was no communication at all.... [BUNGEI SHUNJU] A political commentator says that Mitchii [a nickname for Michio] Watanabe was hypnotized and was made a puppet by Ichiro Ozawa. He says Ozawa kept two cards -- Hata and Watanabe -- and used them at his will. [Watanabe] I suppose so. He tried to shake the SDPJ with such tactics, and forced the party to accept their intention to the extent possible. It is not strange at all if he had such an intention. It is natural for him to use such a tactics as a professional politician. Yet, even if I was used as a card, I think I could contribute to the national interests if such a process could help the SDPJ grow to be a sound political party capable of dealing with the world situation. I think the SDPJ has also been brainwashed to follow a way of thinking similar to ours. That I was used as a card has its own value if the SDPJ changes its policy emerging from being blinded by avarice. Whatever the general public may say about me, I do not regret it at all. Besides, I understand that the SDPJ's rightist group is beginning to show their understanding about the problems of security and making emergency laws. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Let me trace the recent situation. On 13 April, the news reports said all at once that it had been decided that Tsutomu Hata would be the successor. However, the situation has suddenly taken a new turn as the news was spread on 14 April that Watanabe was leaving the party. Ozawa also said at a news conference that the wheel was turning, and that history keeps moving. It seems that, at this point, Ozawa was also thinking of forming a Watanabe administration. Can you explain where and how the scenario was changed? [Watanabe] After all, as I said before, it was impossible for me to be allied with the coalition parties while bearing the LDP label. I suppose Shinseito and other parties were also of the same opinion. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Under such a situation, there was a final choice of you leaving the LDP and running for prime ministership. In that case, you could have won a large number of LDP votes. [Watanabe] I suppose so. I was confident that there would be more LDP votes than I expected supporting my nomination for prime minister. However, there was no guarantee that all the members who voted for me would join my group. Similarly, I imagine Ozawa and other leaders will also be feeling anxious. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] You mean that to vote for you does not mean joining your group, do you not? [Watanabe] Yes, you are right. However, it is also possible that a new situation can be created through the voting process. After all, we are not sure whether it was a hen or an egg that came first. Repulsion Against the "Ichi-Ichi Line" [from Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa] [BUNGEI SHUNJU] The Hata Cabinet has been formed after much commotion. In your own words, the coalition parties are going to repeat the same stupidity, are they not? [Watanabe] So long as the Hata administration is formed including the SDPJ, the administration will face, sooner or later, a difficult situation. The coalition parties will face the difficulty because they are being connected simply because they want to be in power. If they are seriously concerned about policies, they may ally with us instead of the SDPJ. Perhaps they are not to be awakened unless they experience hardship once again. They will remain totally ignorant unless they take bitter medicine again. It is unfortunate. It is a very unfortunate thing for the people. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] When the political situation is in a great confusion, is it allowable that they "repeat the same stupidity"? [Watanabe] I think Ozawa also shares the same recognition that we are in a serious situation. That is the very reason why some people of the coalition parties feel that they should have been more broad-minded in forming the coalition. It is true that, even within the coalition parties, there is a furious repulsion against the "I-I lines" formed by Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa. Of course, there is also a serious repulsion within the LDP. After all, it is their tactics that are being opposed. Perhaps, they will have the bill proposing the divisions of the single-seat districts approved at the next Diet session. After that, they will force unnecessary candidates not to run for the Diet. They will threaten the candidates that the bill has already passed; that they are to fight the LDP at the single-seat districts on equal terms; and that, should the SDPJ, the DSP, and Shinseito put up their own candidates, there is no guarantee of winning the election if the LDP comes up with only one candidate, etcetera. This way, they intend to crash [the LDP]. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Formerly, you mentioned that Ozawa is too sharp in expressing his likes and dislikes about people, and that he is too hasty in doing things, did you not? [Watanabe] I think he is also doing the same thing this time. Therefore, as far as tactics are concerned, I do not think I can agree with him. Though the difference may come from the difference of age and character, I doubt he can keep his influence for a long time if he always behaves like Nobunaga [Nobunaga Oda, a dictatorial leader during the age of civil wars]. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Nobunaga first comes out of the castle by himself. Then, he orders his men to follow him. [Watanabe] We have the saying that an appropriate time, an advantageous position, and the people's harmony are important. After all, things do not go well if we disregard the people's harmony. Yet, even if the people's harmony is important, we should not compromise with parties having different policies as it means that we are being blinded by avarice. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Talking about the future situation, is it possible that you may be allied with Shinseito again? [Watanabe] I am willing to form a coalition. We intend to work together toward a future with those people who share the same philosophy with us. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] At this point, let me ask you a question. There is criticism about your being allied with Komeito because you have been severely criticizing Komeito. [Watanabe] Komeito has also changed. As we see from what they say, the party seems to have tacitly admitted the necessity of [increasing) the consumption tax, it does not express any objection about supporting the security structure, it admits the necessity of cooperating with the United Nations, and the party is even ready to review the Constitution. Though some people say that the nature of the Soka Gakkai [a religious group supporting Komeito] has also changed, it will take a long time before the people admit it. First of all, it is necessary for the Soka Gakkai to be recognized in the religious world. The group should no longer pursue its customary expansionism and exclusionism. The group that behaves as if the Soka Gakkai was the only religion should correct its attitude. Of course, it is not possible to correct its attitude in a year or two. At any rate, I think it is all right to be allied with Komeito as far as our policies agree. To be allied means to ignore details and to uphold principles. In short, it is an expedient. They do have the word expedient in the sutras (laughter). However, it would be a big problem to be merged into one party. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] What is your opinion about the Hata administration's future? [Watanabe] After all, I think they have taken a temporary measure -- an emergency evacuation. Even if I were asked to form an administration within the existing framework of the coalition parties, the only way for me would have been to form a temporary administration. Any administration formed without an agreement of fundamental policies reveals its fragility the moment it faces various practical problems. Since the people of different thoughts and beliefs are boarding the same vessel, some will pull their oars toward the east, and others toward the west. Regretfully, the administration will not last long. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Some people say the administration's life may be less than two months. [Watanabe] Though I am not sure if it will be two months, I do not think it will last long. Throughout the world, there have been few coalition cabinets that lasted very long. Through such a severe test, politicians are gradually classified either as rightists or leftists. Though, of course, it takes time. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] In case political confusion is created in the near future, do you think there is an opportunity for you to go on stage? [Watanabe] Though I am not sure if there is an opportunity for me, at any rate, I want to have the groups of the same political vision and of the same policies allied, and I want to act as go- between. I also want to play the role of a mediator to terminate the politics of hatred. When the time comes, I am willing to openly discuss the matter with dignity. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] When you were determined not to leave the party and not to run for the prime ministership, you mentioned that "I still do not have to be in a hurry." Is that your real view? [Watanabe] Yes, it is. There will be another opportunity. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Will the opportunity come in the very near future? [Watanabe] Yes, the opportunity will come in the very near future. The political regime will change again and again. The world is always full of vicissitudes.
