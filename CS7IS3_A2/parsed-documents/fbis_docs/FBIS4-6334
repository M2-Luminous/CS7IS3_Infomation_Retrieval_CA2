The UN Security Council imposed the sanctions in 1991 until the country met all demands of Resolution 687. To date, Iraq has entered into the last phase of its destruction program. If by initial difficulties it has cooperated with the UN inspectors over its nuclear arsenal site. The majority of the Security Council members and nonmembers are in favor of lifting sanctions. These countries are satisfied that Iraq had met all the conditions. But the United States and Britain want to impose political conditions before the sanctions were lifted. This is beyond what was agreed to originally under Resolution 687. It is unfair to impose new conditions. After all, the sanctions were imposed to punish Iraq for invading Kuwait in August 1990. By now, the Iraqis would have learned their lesson. They know very well that having designs of future invasions would be met with tough retaliatory military measures. Therefore, those obstructing the lifting of sanctions are not being fair to Iraq. Questions are being raised over the discrimination and policy selectivity with regards to Iraq's vis-a-vis UN's policies on Bosnia, Somalia, and the Israeli occupation of Palestine. So, is the Security Council fair in continuing to impose the trade and arms embargo on Iraq? Also, are the council's decisions dominated by the one or two countries and not the majority? By now, the sanctions will have served their purpose. Continuing to punish Iraq will merely cause further hardship on its people. Through the sanctions, the people of Iraq have been facing an acute shortage of food and medicine. Although the sanctions do not include food and medicine, the inability to trade means the lack of financial resources. So, it does not have enough money to buy the much required supplies. The country is also lacking humanitarian aid. Thousands of people will die if the sanctions are not lifted. Besides this, the country plunged into an economic doom since the Gulf war for which it finds difficulty to recover. It is about time some of the permanent members realize that the embargo is no longer justified. Only then will Iraq be able to put back its economy on the road to recovery. However, for Iraq, the lifting of the sanctions must not mean going back to old ways. Malaysia, along with the majority of the UN members, did not condone its invasion of Kuwait. This is more so since Iraq along with Kuwait and Malaysia are Muslim countries and members of the Organization of Islamic Countries, OIC. At the same time, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and certain Arab countries say that Iraq is still a threat to region's security. Three years after the Gulf war, Iraq still does not recognize the borders with Kuwait and refuses to free Kuwaitis it holds. Iraq, therefore, needs to be more forthcoming in meeting the demands of Resolution 687. It also needs to show sincere peaceful gestures to its neighbors in the Gulf. This is because Iraq's good ties with the OIC members will be crucial to ensure its survival in world trade. Also, Arab countries do not want a repeat of the invasion of Kuwait.
