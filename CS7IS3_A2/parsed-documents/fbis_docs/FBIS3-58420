Lambeck: "CDU Presidiums Express `Anger Over Waigel'"] [Text] Bonn -- A continuation of the dispute between the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and CSU [Christian Social Union] is expected at today's meeting of the CDU/CSU Bundestag Group and at the weekend meeting of the CDU's ruling bodies. Speaking to DIE WELT, members of the CDU Presidium expressed "anger over Waigel," because, at a conference in Wildbad Kreuth last weekend, the CSU prematurely and without discussing the matter with the CDU announced that the constitutional judge, Roman Herzog, 59, would be the CSU's candidate for president. Heinz Eggert, deputy chairman of the CDU and Saxony's interior minister, described the actions of the CSU as "a mass of ineptitude" and said that the CSU debate about who should succeed Weizsaecker was "a disaster." Horst Eylmmann, chairman of the Bundestag Law Commission, termed the CSU's haste "unwise" and "politically stupid." There are differences of opinion between Chancellor Kohl and his general secretary, Peter Hintze, about whether Herzog should be invited to the meeting of the CDU presidium and executive board of directors at the weekend at which Weizsaecker's succession is to be discussed. Kohl does not want Herzog to attend. Hintze is in favor of Herzog attending as a guest. In a radio interview, Friedrich Bohl (CDU), chief of the federal chancellery, tried to tone things down. He sees "no confrontation course between the CDU and the CSU." CSU leader Theo Waigel, who telephoned Kohl on Sunday [10 January], said yesterday that there were "no differences whatsoever" between him and Chancellor Kohl. "I cannot explain the uproar here and there at all." The schedule has been fixed. First, both leaderships will discuss Herzog separately, and then together, on 24 January. His official nomination by the CDU and CSU is to take place at a conference in March. Last weekend, the chancellor voiced annoyance over the statements made by the CSU as well as over the criticism of the CSU expressed by General Secretary Peter Hintze. Nevertheless, it was being said at the Chancellor's Office that the CSU wanted to "conceal its own weakness" by toying with ideas about making the party a national one and about the dissolution of the joint Bundestag group in the event that a grand coalition is formed.
