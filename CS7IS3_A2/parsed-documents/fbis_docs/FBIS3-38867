They approve of Belgium's participation in humanitarian missions. They want Belgian UN troops to remain in Bosnia and they consider it vital that their resources be increased. However, they reject recourse to air strikes except in the event of legitimate self-defense. The survey carried out by Survey & Action -- which monitors the evolution of Belgian society -- shows the Belgians to be a generous people refusing to resign themselves to impotence. Here we publish the results of the survey exclusively for the French-speaking press. According to the survey, 71 percent of Belgians considered it normal for the "international community to intervene with military resources to try to put an end to armed conflict and/or to protect the civilian victims of the war." Moreover, 62 percent approved of Belgium's intervention in Rwanda, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia. This is an enormous proportion and is surprising when you consider that the effectiveness of the UN troops and the blue helmets has been and remains highly controversial, especially where Somalia and Bosnia are concerned. Also surprising was the wish expressed by more than half of the Belgian people (53 percent) to see the number of our troops in the current Balkan quagmire maintained, or even increased. While the debate about the withdrawal or retention of UN troops rages on, especially in France, just three Belgians in ten were in favor of our troops pulling out or for their numbers to be reduced. Does what is at stake in the former Yugoslavia justify the loss of Belgian life? A very large minority said yes (41 percent), while 49 percent replied no. In effect, two people in five thought that a Belgian could die for Bosnia or to avoid the conflict from spreading. The consensus resurfaced on the question of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] resources. A very clear majority (73 percent) considered that resources should be strengthened, while just 7 percent believed them to be sufficient. Consequently six Belgians in 10 (57 percent) considered that Francois Briquemont's request to step down was an expression of his disapproval of this shortage of resources, believing that "the UN bureaucrats sent him to the front defenseless." Moreover, 46 percent judged that the general was right to resign. In addition, 43 percent would, if they had the power, authorize the UNPROFOR to use force in the event of it being attacked. This is what Briquemont wanted. What of possible systematic western air strikes? Those against were in the majority (59 percent), judging that bombing operations (especially of Serbian artillery positions) would be ineffective and morally unjustified. This refusal did not appear to be widely inspired by the fear of major UNPROFOR losses (14 percent). However, a little more than three Belgians in 10 (34 percent) were in favor of systematic bombardment, even if (17 percent) they led to heavy losses among the UN forces. In its conclusions, the survey institute explained this movement with regard to Bosnia primarily by what it called the "Briquemont effect" and the wide media coverage of the conflict. Speaking about a war and constantly showing images of it serves to remind people of its existence. It might also revive the pacifist issue through "a search for a new direction," and "the...disillusionment of a society that has lost its unifying values...."
