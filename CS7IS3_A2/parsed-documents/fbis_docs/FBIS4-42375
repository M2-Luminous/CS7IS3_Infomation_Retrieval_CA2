The Air Force will thus purchase four sets of kevlar plates, a light and resistant material, which will be used to protect the crew of the "Hercules" C-130 aircraft of the 15th Airborne Transport Division when overflying zones from where they may be fired at with light weapons. In addition, all aircraft will be equipped with anchor points so that the plates can be easily fitted if necessary. Military sources remind that three C-130 were hit by bullets during the "Silver Back" and "Blue Safari" operations [evacuation of Belgian nationals and UN troops from Rwanda] last month. Moreover, the Belgian planes that sometimes fly to Sarajevo are the only ones not to be equipped with a protection system, said a pilot. Several countries like the United States and Great Britain have been using different systems to protect the aircraft crews. The Belgian Air Force has thus decided to acquire a similar protection. It earmarked 25 million Belgian francs to purchase four kits and to have anchor points installed on its 12 aircraft. "Still, we will have to find the means to equip more planes," said General Major Wilfried de Brouwer, deputy Air Force chief of staff. The procurement request has been made and the first deliveries are expected before the end of this year. In addition, the Air Force is implementing the last phase of the modernization of its C-130 aircraft, which should make it possible for them to remain operational until the year 2010, i.e., 30 years after they were introduced. A new avionics system (electronic navigation system) is to replace the traditional navigation instruments which were designed in the sixties. Military sources said that the aircraft prototype is being transformed in the Sabena workshops at Brussels National Airport. It should be ready to fly by the fall to perform the necessary tests before it can be put into service.
