This is what the Serbs shouted at the three ORF [Austrian Radio and Television] journalists: Belgrade correspondent Veronika Seyr, camera man Valentin Certov, and a Yugoslav assistant. "We are happy to be alive," they say. What happened? On Wednesday [27 April] the ORF team had gone to Gorazde: "We had official permission of the Bosnian Serbs to go to the checkpoint. From there Ukrainian UN soldiers took us to the town. We were there for three hours. Not a single shot was fired, and the people told us that the Serbs had withdrawn. Then we went back again." In Pale, 50 km away, the ORF team cut its report in a REUTER news agency studio: "We had just finished, and one minute before we were to transmit the report to Vienna, the room was stormed by armed men. They ordered me to hand over the tape immediately." Courageously, the ORF correspondent tried to resist: "More and more men pushed into the room and verbally abused us. The men from the television station were most aggressive." Finally, the Austrians were escorted to their quarters in Jahorina, where their entire equipment was seized: "I guess it was worth about 2 million schillings, including camera and satellite telephone. We were treated like serious criminals." Three hours later everything was over. The next day Veronika Seyr was permitted to return to Belgrade, but she had to leave her equipment: "I cannot work anymore," she says. The ORF has asked Foreign Minister Mock to issue a vehement protest to the authorities in Belgrade.
