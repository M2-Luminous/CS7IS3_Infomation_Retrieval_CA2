At first sight, this move appears unlikely given Boris Yeltsin's particularly confidential relationship with Pavel Grachev, whose 45th birthday the president celebrated with him in person. According to the source, however, the main reason for the expected ouster is the need, which has become overdue, to get rid of a person responsible in large measure for the 4 October bloodbath. In particular, the top brass has long been demanding that from the president. It should be added that yesterday Pavel Grachev was released from a hospital where he was treated for the exacerbation of heart disease. The Russian Federation Defense Ministry's press service, where we turned to for explanation, was concerned by Viktor Chernomyrdin's not mentioning the Defense Ministry chief in his news conference. According to information from our confidential source, the Defense Ministry may for the first time be headed by a civilian, current Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, doctor of sciences, responsible for matters related to state-of-the-art military hardware and weaponry.
