Israeli sources told Qol Yisra'el correspondent Gid'on Kouts that the news indicated that Damascus is ready to negotiate a separate peace treaty with Israel. However, a senior aide to the prime minister denied reports quoting Rabin as saying Syria was ready for a separate deal with Israel. The aide said Syria stated that a peace treaty with Israel would be valid no matter what happened in Israel's relations with other Arab countries. The aide also said that Rabin had received answers from Syria to longstanding questions about a future peace treaty.
