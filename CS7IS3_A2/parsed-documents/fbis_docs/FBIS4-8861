Rose said the liaison officers were pulled out of the Moslem enclave at dawn because their equipment was not usable. He did not elaborate on what he meant by that. Earlier in Zagreb, a French military source reported that the UN had pulled all of its personnel from Gorazde overnight Sunday as the Serbs intensified their shelling of the town where some 60,000 people are trapped. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva said four of its representatives also remain in the enclave.
