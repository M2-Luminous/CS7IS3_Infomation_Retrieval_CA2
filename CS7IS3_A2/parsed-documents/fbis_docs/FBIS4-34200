All the leaders interviewed -- Spanish Head of State Felipe Gonzalez, Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, and Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen -- react to comments by their Cuban counterpart Fidel Castro Ruz. Answering a question regarding Cuba's possible reinstatement into the OAS, Felipe Gonzalez says: "I believe Cuba can and should be reinstated to every institution on the continent. However, it would be a two-way process; not only would there be movement by the institutions toward Cuba but also by Cuba toward the institutions. I believe I have been clear on that." Meanwhile, Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol argues that Castro brings up the blockade issue every time there is a call for political openness in Cuba. Calderon Sol says: "We want democracy and freedom in Cuba, and he has very cleverly resorted, as usual, to a discussion of the blockade that began during the sixties. In other words, the blockade is Mr. Castro's excuse when it comes to the issue of freedom." Reporters also question Colombian President Cesar Gaviria about Fidel Castro's speech. Gaviria says it was quite similar to past speeches. Regarding Castro's remarks concerning democracy, Gaviria says: "Castro defends his understanding, his concept of democracy. The rest of us, obviously, do not share that concept." Meanwhile, the situation in Cuba will be discussed by the presidents today. Upon his arrival at the convention center, Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen is asked whether or not this discussion will hinder the normal development of the summit. He replies: "This summit is not a simple courtesy meeting, but a meeting to discuss hemispheric issues." In response to a question on Castro's assertion that Ibero-America is divided, Duran-Ballen says: "no, on the contrary, it is not."
