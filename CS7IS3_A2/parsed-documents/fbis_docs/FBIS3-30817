[Begin Oleksy recording] I am greatly relieved by the successful and final conclusion of the talks. When it comes to the matters that aroused speculations and various rumors outside the coalition, the talks have put an end to the state of an alleged crisis, or perhaps not even an alleged crisis. They have put an end to the real and existing conflict, which was interpreted by the mass media almost as a breakdown of the coalition, or as the partners parting their ways because of internal difficulties impossible to overcome. My feeling of relief comes from the fact that the will to continue the strategic cooperation was firmly reiterated yesterday not because of the lack of an alternative but because all of the elements that constitute the program credo and take into account Poland's needs, underlining the foundations of the coalition, were reconfirmed.
