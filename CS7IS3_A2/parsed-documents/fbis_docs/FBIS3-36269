The following matters were considered: the economic conditions in which the agro-industrial complex will be functioning in 1994, meaures to maintain and develop small businesses, state mamagement of labor protection, progress in the implementation of decisions on overcoming the aftermath of the Ossetian-Ingush armed conflict, and also the government work schedule for the first and second quarters. At that point IZVESTIYA is forced to conclude its account of the government session -- the paper has no further details. The same goes for correspondents of other papers. Henceforth, on instructions from the head of the government apparatus, only the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA representative will be allowed to attend Cabinet sessions. The apparatus' denying journalists access to government news is big news in itself. As ITAR-TASS reported, for the first time in two and one-half years even news agency and television correspondents were barred from a Cabinet session. But we must be more precise: It is not the journalists, whom the government apparatus head probably does not respect, who have been deprived of information. No, it is society that is being starved of government information, its interest in the government having been whetted by the reshuffle and the perturbing statements by the premier. Actually, that is probably the reason why the door was hastily and brusquely closed to Russian and foreign correspondents. Presumably, the kind of thing that another venerator of press freedom -- Ruslan Khasbulatov -- described as "attacks" and "subversive activity," advising the press "not to harbor any illusions about being a fourth power," will no longer seep through the narrow crack left for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, the official government organ. Were the questions submitted for government examination on 3 February secret? No, the press service spokesman who relieved journalists of their professional duties that day, did not refer to any secrecy. Which makes it all the more interesting. Even more interesting than before, when, whether approving of or cursing the government, citizens at least knew or could guess what to expect of it. Even more interesting, because at the moment few people have any idea what "nonmonetarist methods" of combatting inflation mean or how to reconcile the statement that handing out "preferential credits right, left, and center" is to stop, with the intention to issue them "selectively." We will find out in the end, probably very soon. Closed doors, behind which government policy will apparently be conducted henceforth, are the most unreliable method of guarding against public and, as is the custom everywhere, critical attention to the work of the Cabinet of Ministers. This is confirmed by the absurd way the Council of Ministers has isolated itself from the press, a method borrowed from the practice of the unforgettable Politburo.
