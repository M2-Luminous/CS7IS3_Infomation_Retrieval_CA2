FBIS4-41661 "drsov123_c_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-123 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 Federal Assembly Federation Council Discussion of Crime Edict Reported Federation Council Discussion of Crime Edict Reported LD2406133094 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1215 GMT 24 Jun 94 LD2406133094 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Friday morning the Federation Council of the Russian parliament failed to accept in principle a draft resolution on President Yeltsin's decree "On Emergency Moves to Protect the Population Against Banditry and Organized Crime as a Whole". The committee on constitutional law-making and courtroom and legal issues won the heaviest support in a straw vote on four alternative drafts. When, however, it was put to roll-call vote, the committee's draft garnered less than one half of the overall ballot. The returns highlighted the differences voiced in the discussion of the anti-crime decree. Yuri Chernichenko, who represents Moscow in the Federation Council, said the underworld used the national constitution as an umbrella and called on the fellow-legislators to defend the man-in-the-street who lived in constant fear for his life and property by supporting the anti-crime decree. In the meantime, fellow-legislator Valeriy Rastorguyev of Tver felt the decree deprived the citizens of their constitutional rights and its enforcement translated into the introduction of a state of emergency. He called for the creation of expert emergency commissions instead of instructions which "empowered every other law and order officer to fight crime". The Federation Council may be expected to resume discussion of the anti-crime legislation, if it has time for it, on Friday.
