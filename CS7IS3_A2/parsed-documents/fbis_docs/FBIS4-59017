In an address to the Editors Committee, Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir said: A soldier can disobey an order only if it is patently illegal. He said the issue of withdrawal from settlements was in dispute among jurists and, therefore, soldiers were duty-bound to obey such an order since it was not indisputably illegal.
