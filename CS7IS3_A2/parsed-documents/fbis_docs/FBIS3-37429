He told Interfax that even if the complete sovereignty the official Grozny talks about is true, "we must share in the operation of the federal authorities. In my view, this would not harm our sovereignty." Avturkhanov emphasized, however, that elections would not be held in the district if they were not held throughout the rest of Chechnya. "I have no intention to separate myself from my people," he declared. He said that Chechnya did not have proper sovereignty. "The law of the jungle prevails under which only the strongest survive. People do not need this kind of sovereignty," he said. In his words, Dudayev is supported only by those in the middle class who managed to get rich under his rule. Dzhokhar Dudayev had earlier told Interfax that there would be no elections to the Federal Assembly on March 13.
