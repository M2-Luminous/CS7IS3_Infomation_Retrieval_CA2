"Unfortunately, and I say it clearly, the Jordan media play a part in not getting this relations back (with Gulf states)," Dr. al-Majali told reporters in response to a question about Arab-Arab relations. "Everytime we almost get it back, a couple of articles go in some of the media and it becomes strained again," Dr. al-Majali said. In response to another question about whether the government will work to upgrade and facilitate the institutions of democracy such as Parliament, Dr. al-Majali said that the media was also a reason behind the tension between his Cabinet and Parliament in an obvious reference to the gruelling confidence session in December. "The tension was drawn by the media," the prime minister said, adding that an article appeared which caused tension that had not existed until its publication. The prime minister was most probably referring to comments ahead of the confidence session that described the newly elected deputies as "docile." Asked why his government had a "tug of war over freedom of expression" with the Jordanian media in general, Dr. al-Majali said that this was not true and that he did not think there was tension between the two. But he added that "sometimes" the media "takes a little thing and they don't study it properly and then blow it" out of all proportions. The prime minister explained that while the Kingdom's relations with Gulf states, and especially Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, were improving, they continued to face setbacks because of critical opinion pieces or reports in the press. He said his government had received communiques from Gulf states protesting the criticism in the Jordanian media and are unconvinced that the government is not behind the reports. "A couple of articles come up, the second day we get into trouble over them--the second day, it does not even go to the third," the premier added. "They think that we have control over the media, that we tell you what to write and what not to write. And you know this is not true," the premier said. "We hope that the media would take this concern into account, do they want this relation to be back, then they could help it return rather than to stir things against it." He said that while the Kingdom was gratified by the success of its goodwill overtures with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar he hoped that the same will happen with Saudi Arabia. "We hope our relations with Saudi Arabia would improve," Dr. al-Majali said, adding that contacts between the two countries "are good now but have not reached the level we want." "We are trying to ask the media to please stop adding oil to the fire," Dr. al-Majali said, adding that "nothing is going to change if we keep criticising them. But the situation will change if we meet them and talk to them." Dr. al-Majali also criticised the United States and other Western countries for failing to facilitate reconciliation between Jordan and the Gulf Arab states. "Western countries, including the united States, have not been doing enough to mend Jordan's relations with other Arabs," Dr. al-Majali said. "We know that Egypt is trying its best," he said. "But the West is not, and I do not know whether that is because of a bad feeling about what has taken place during the Gulf war."
