Here there was an exchange of opinions among experts, politicians, scientists, and entrepreneurs from four neighbor-countries -- Poland, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. They discussed a "hot" topic: how to establish regional economic collaboration. "A very necessary exchange of ideas is taking place at our forum, and impulses are being generated which will help businesspeople to arrive at real contracts," Yuriy Kashlev, Russian ambassador to Poland, told ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's correspondent. It is hard not to agree that there is a great need for ideas and powerful impulses at the present transitional stage. As S. Ciosek noted, Poland and its eastern neighbors at present have very little chance of competing with giant international capital. In his opinion, the central-eastern and eastern countries should pool their efforts and create major economic structures. Something else is also important. "The governments must adopt a clear stance," S. Ciosek said. "We all have similar conditions for the creation of mechanisms to facilitate an advantageous exchange of goods and services. But the mechanisms do not yet exist. Unfortunately, bureaucrats in both countries -- Poland and Russia -- are too accustomed to mere talk, to slogans and assurances, to consensus that is merely verbal." The state should also help to create the necessary international accounting centers and think about guarantees for businessmen, the creation of insurance companies -- everything that, in the West, makes it possible to avoid risk in trade. There is a lot of talk about this too, but everything stays the same. "I think the Russians do not really know what they could buy from us," S. Ciosek lamented. "They think of Poland in terms of apples and potatoes. So they go to other countries to look for technology..." Of course, it is no bad thing that the Poles have learned to sell us potatoes and apples. But Poland has already been invited to participate in joint conversion projects with Russia in the aviation industry, transportation, and other sectors, projects which will have their application in the 21st century. Poland, for its part, could offer the Russians some of its own technologies for joint development. And here is the opinion of Polish Marshal Jozef Oleksy, who agrees: "In central-eastern Europe and Russia," he said, "in the course of changing the former systems, people have been strongly attracted to a model of development based on unilateral cooperation and integration in a Western direction. The time has now come to reflect on this phenomenon. Whichever way you look at it, it must be admitted that no system of aid from the West -- which is selfish and does not always have a full picture of the extent of real changes in the East, and furthermore has its own recession and economic difficulties -- can resolve problems relating to changes in the economic structures and the economic development of Russia, Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus. This means that, while maintaining close links with the world economic system, it is necessary at the same time to seek a basis for change in our own potential and in the development of economic collaboration within the region." It is first and foremost a question of government regulation, government guarantees and insurance for firms, and the formulation of customs and taxation agreements. Only then will private and state firms active in the international market be able to operate efficiently.... Yevgeniy Rogovskiy, Russia's trade representative in Poland, noted that support from the governments for the entrepreneurial activity which we would like to initiate must take the form, first and foremost, of the creation of permanent information systems which report to one another not on trivia, but on major areas of internal demand. He gave an illustration. It is well known in Russia that Poland has decided radically to modify its petroleum-refining industry. It is very much hoped that it will bear in mind the enormous potential available in Russia and other countries. Concrete interests could emerge in other sectors too -- electronics, chemicals. Zbigniew Czezadlo, who works for the well-known Polish brewery "Zywiec" and brought the product to the "Mining Lands Fair," noted that at the moment business with the Eastern neighbors is proceeding with difficulty. If you manage to sell anything, it is exclusively on a barter basis. Last time, beer was exchanged for Russian salt. He was very surprised to learn that Russian enterprises have the right to pay for goods in hard currency and to transfer that currency to the foreign producers' accounts. This may be an isolated case. But it shows how little businessmen operating on different sides of the border still know about their neighbors' economic potential, not to mention their laws. Polish entrepreneurs now want to bring together all the structures scattered across the country which are concerned with the East, and to create a Polish business center in Moscow. Its staffers, working on commercial terms, would take the place of uninterested state officials. There are a great many other ideas, such as the plan to develop the Eastern Institute, which is already preparing a program for a grants foundation to help students and scientists from the former USSR.
