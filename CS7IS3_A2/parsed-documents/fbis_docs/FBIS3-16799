Sobchak did so just 90 minutes before voting was to end, when it became clear that the elections were a failure. According to the city electoral commission, only 21.532000060100f the electors came to the polling stations (elections will be considered valid if 252000060100f the electors take part in voting). The electoral commission believes that a second round of elections must be held. As each seat in the City Assembly is contested by about 15 candidates, it is unlikely that any of them will accrue the required 5010006040lus 1 vote. Sobchak has made an amendment in the provision on elections according to which a candidate shall be considered elected during the first round if he receives a majority of the votes irrespective of the number of voters.
