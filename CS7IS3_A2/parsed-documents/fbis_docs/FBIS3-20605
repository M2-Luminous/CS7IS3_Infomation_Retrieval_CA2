On 17 March, EASTERN EXPRESS reports on page 26 that a new study by realtor Jones Lang Wootton (JLW) points to further rent rises and rising capital values in all areas of the Hong Kong real estate market. The report states that with chronic shortages of Grade-A office space, especially in Central district, and an equally serious supply crunch in terms of high-end accommodation to house incoming executives, office and residential rents are set to surpass Tokyo. The JLW study says commercial and office rents rose 40 percent in 1993 and rose another 10 percent in the first two months of 1994. Residential rents also surged, with rents rising by between 30 and 70 percent depending on the quality and location of the accommodation. JLW credits mainland-backed investors with a 23.2-percent share of the HK$57.5 billion of identifiable real estate transactions in 1993. The role of PRC-funded firms in stoking the Hong Kong real estate market has attracted the scrutiny of Chen Yuan, vice president of the People's Bank of China and son of elder leader Chen Yun. A report by the Beijing-based press agency ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE at 1442 GMT on 17 March cites Chen Yuan declaring his opposition to speculative activities in the market by PRC-funded organizations. Highlighting concerns that badly needed capital is being diverted from China to earn quick profits in Hong Kong, Chen Yuan stated that China faced a shortage of foreign exchange and construction capital, and he had a "disapproving attitude" towards PRC-funded entities speculating in the Hong Kong real estate market. However, Chen Yuan said that it was normal for PRC-funded enterprises in Hong Kong to buy office buildings and residences for their staff, adding that the Bank of China ran its banking business in Hong Kong independently, determining its scale of mortgage lending according to the market situation. Chen Yuan also noted that the People's Bank of China was not paying any special attention to the issue. Meanwhile, Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, has also commented on the role of PRC-funded companies in the real estate market. Speaking to a group of Hong Kong delegates to the National People's Congress, ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in Chinese at 1400 GMT on 17 March reported Lu Ping saying that China-funded enterprises should refrain from actions detrimental to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Expanding on this, Lu said that these firms should not engage in real estate trading activities and that, as they were using state funds, they had an unfair advantage over other market players. OTHER ISSUES: Golden Resources Sets Up Rice Processing Venture in Vietnam Golden Resources Development has taken a 55 percent stake in a $10 million joint venture in Vietnam to process and trade rice. Hong Kong's biggest rice distributor has signed a 50-year joint venture agreement with the four major rice producing provinces in Vietnam: Long An, Dong Thap, Tien Giang, and An Giang, which together account for 40 percent of the country's production. Vietnam's trade representative in Hong Kong, Huynh Minh Hue, said the venture was the largest of its kind so far. Golden Resources' share of the investment would be used to build a processing plant and to provide working capital. The managing director of Golden Resources, David Lam, said the company hoped to raise the quality of Vietnamese rice, so achieving higher prices on the world market.
