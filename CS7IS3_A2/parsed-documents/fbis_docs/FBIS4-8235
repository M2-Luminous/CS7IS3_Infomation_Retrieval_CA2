This is a disgraceful act and extraordinary grave of Greece towards Albania, its sovereignty and integrity, so Greek Government has full responsibility for its consequences. I demand from the government to take all the necessary measures to prevent such acts and to respond properly to this act and policy. I appeal to Albanian opinion, governments of the whole world, their institutions, and the international public opinion to condemn this massacre. I point out that Greece and its policy of blockades and bands aims at the encouragement of Serb's aggression in the north of Balkans and the destabilization of the southern part of the region in favour of Greek expansionist goals. The Albanian will for good and friendly relationships, Greece was responded systematically with a series of criminal acts that aim to destabilize the country, but I stress that going back to the policy of bands during the beginning of the century, and fostering terrorism, Greek Government holds the responsibility of converting its country into a source of dangerous conflicts of which they are responsible. At the same time I express mine and government determination insisting that the Albanian policy should serve to preserve peace and stability in the southern Balkans, as we have done up to now.
