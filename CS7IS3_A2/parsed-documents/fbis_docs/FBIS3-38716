Saglar said Turkey is trying to draw the attention of the whole world to the savagery of Bosnia-Herzegovina. (Enest Durakovic), the culture, education, and sports minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina [name and title as heard], has arrived in Ankara on an official visit. In a statement he issued while receiving the guest minister at the airport, Saglar said the countries championing human rights and democracy have been displaying indifference in such a way as to tolerate massacre and have not been taking the necessary measures. Saglar further noted that tomorrow the two countries will sign their first cultural protocol as well as another protocol on Turkey restoring the historic Mostar bridge and other edifices. The guest minister, in turn, asked the whole world to take seriously the necessary measures to stop Serbian aggression and cruelty. Explaining that in Bosnia-Herzegovina not only are the people being eradicated but also a cultural heritage was being wiped out, the Bosnian minister stressed that they are determined to defend their existence and that Turkey is greatly assisting them toward this goal.
