He said: "We are not bloodthirsty people, to say that in this current war our aim is to demand the head of 'Ali Salim al-Bid. It is our heads that the others want because we insist on preserving the unity of the country." [Al-Bunyan] But you insist on occupying Aden. Do you find the way to Aden easy? [Al-Ahmar] Who is insisting, and who fabricated and ignited the war? And do you think the way to Sanaa is easy? [Al-Bunyan] But how far will you take the war? [Al-Ahmar] Until we destroy the mutiny, prevent secession, preserve unity, and frustrate those who are banking on secession. [Al-Bunyan] 'Ali Salim al-Bid says that he was the one who worked for and accomplished unity. [Al-Ahmar] No, he evaded Ceausescu's fate and sought unity to save himself. So we said to him: Welcome.... After submitting his demands to us, which he thought would achieve secession for him, he fabricated and triggered the war to achieve his objective. [Al-Bunyan] What is his objective? [Al-Ahmar] His objective behind the war is secession because he failed to fulfill the old YSP ambition of ruling all Yemen their way. Now they want to go back to ruling the southern and eastern governorates which 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih left under their control throughout the transitional period. 'Ali Salim al-Bid tried to separate the southern governorates [from the north] in order to revive the secession, ignite the current war, and impose his terms which we had accepted for the sake of unity. He had insisted on certain demands. When the Pledge and Accord Document was achieved, he again brought up his secessionist terms. When he failed he fabricated the war and resorted to war because he thought that the Arab states and the Arab League would intervene to stop the war and then he would be able to impose secession. [Al-Bunyan] Would you accept Arab mediation? [Al-Ahmar] We had disagreements before the unity. Why did the Arab states not try to send forces then, when we were two states? Now we are one state and no force has any right to intefere in the affairs of one state. This is an internal Yemeni affair. [Al-Bunyan] What are your conditions for stopping the war or for the revival of the dialogue with the YSP? [Al-Ahmar] Our condition is that there should be no bargaining as far as preservation of unity, constitutional legitimacy, and democracy are concerned, and, above all, the mutiny must end. [Al-Bunyan] But 'Ali Salim al-Bid rejects 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's decisions dismissing him, al-'Attas, and some ministers. [Al-Ahmar] He rejects them because he is a mutineer like John Garang in southern Sudan. We indeed regard him as a rebel against constitutional legitimacy. We had elected him as Presidential Council member but he cannot act legitimately as such and become a member before taking the oath which he and his mutineering clique refused to do although the election results were supported by the whole world. [Al-Bunyan] Are 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's decisions legitimate and constitutional? [Al-Ahmar] Of course they are legitimate because he is the head of state and supreme commander of the Armed Forces. [Al-Bunyan] And is the head of 'Ali Salim al-Bid now the target of this war? [Al-Ahmar] No, we are not bloodthirsty like them. It seems to me that it is they who want our heads because we insist on preserving unity. [Al-Bunyan] There are conflicting reports about the position of the northern forces near Aden. What is the military situation now? [Al-Ahmar] That is a matter for the military.
