Their industrial output value now accounts for over one-tenth of the country's total, and their imports and exports account for one-third. Foreign investment absorbed by these enterprises accounts for nine-tenths of the country's use of foreign capital. Large and efficient enterprises with a high technology content and with the ability to earn more foreign exchange have emerged one after another. The vigorous development of foreign-funded enterprises has played an increasingly important role in China's economic construction, demonstrating the outstanding achievements of reform and opening up. After leaving Beijing on 28 April, the team charged with covering "China's noted foreign-funded enterprises" went to all localities and wrote a number of articles reflecting the growth, successful experience, and outstanding contributions of the foreign-funded enterprises. Commencing today, we will publish these articles one after another to provide our readers with a window to understand contemporary China's reform, opening up, and modernization program. [end editor's note] Since reform and opening up, China has achieved marked successes in the use of foreign capital. Foreign-funded enterprises have become an important force in China's national economic development, and a number of noted, efficient, and properly managed ones have particularly attracted attention at home and abroad. As China's reform and opening up has entered a new stage of development, foreign-funded enterprises, which are marked symbols of opening up, have also greeted a new high tide. Under such a momentum, how should we maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy growth of the foreign-funded enterprises? We held an interview with Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation and asked her to express her views. "I am optimistic about the development of foreign-funded enterprises." Minister Wu Yi gave a spirited account of the status quo of foreign-funded enterprises: "Vigorously making effective use of foreign capital constitutes an important element of China's open policy and economic work. Absorbing direct foreign investment is one of the main forms of making use of foreign capital. By March this year, the country approved a total of 186,000 foreign-invested projects, with agreed-upon capital of $241.5 and an actual investment of $67.2 billion. Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's tour of southern China in early 1992, the enthusiasm of foreign businessmen for investing in China ran high, and both the number of projects and the amount of capital doubled. In 1993, the country approved 83,000 foreign-funded projects, involving contracted capital of $111.4 billion and an actual use of $27.5 billion, an increase of 71.1 percent, 91.72 percent, and 149.95 percent respectively over 1992, or equivalent to the total sum of the 14 years since reform and opening up. According to figures provided by a foreign authoritative accounting office, the United States, China, and Britain have become the major countries for international commercial investment in 1993. China's position, which was sixth in 1992, rose to second in 1993, second only to the United States. The foreign capital absorbed by China in 1993 accounted for one-tenth of the world's overseas capital of $152 billion. In the first three months of this year, China again approved 12,000 foreign-invested projects, with an agreed upon investment of $19.6 billion, or a real foreign investment of $5.4 billion." The reporter asked, "What are the new characteristics of direct foreign investment absorbed by China over the past two years or so?" "Over the past two years, the number of countries and regions investing in China has been continuously increasing, rising from a little more than 80 in 1991 to 133 by the end of 1993. The ten largest investors include: Hong Kong and Macao, Taiwan, the United States, Japan, Singapore, Britain, Thailand, Canada, Germany, and Australia. "The scope of investment has been expanded. The average amount of contracted foreign capital in each project was $1.33 million in 1993, an increase of 12.9 percent over the $1.178 million in 1992. The average figure in Guangdong, Fujian, Shanghai, and Beijing approached or exceeded $2 million. By the end of 1993, the number of projects involving an investment of over $10 million approved by China totaled more than 1,800. "Apart from the expansion in the areas and field of investment, the means of investment also diversified. Although foreign investment in China primarily focuses on the coastal areas, the interior is also speeding up its pace of attracting foreign investment. In 1993, approximately 80 percent of the foreign-funded projects and the amount was focused on the coastal areas; however, the proportion of foreign-funded projects and capital attracted by the interior rose from 7 to 8 percent in 1992 to 20 percent in 1993. Foreign businessmen made marked progress in their investment in the three major industries. The fields of banking, insurance, real estate, retail sales, consultation, accountant office, and information services were also opened gradually to foreign investors. New headway was made in the means of foreign investment. The establishment of more than 30 Sino-foreign shareholding enterprises was approved, and more than 20 special renminbi shares (B shares) were listed on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges. In recent years, we also selectively approved a number of investment companies." "Moreover, a number of transnational companies have been active in their investment in China, which further optimized the investment setup. By the end of 1993, more than 80 transnational industrial corporations from Europe, the United States, Japan, and the developed countries and regions in the Asia- Pacific region made investments in China. Some of the transnational corporations and big companies with solid financial foundations also ran a number of transportation, energy, infrastructure, raw material, and other large projects which were badly needed for national economic development. The large scale and amount involved in these high-level projects further rationalized and optimized the investment setup." "Could you tell us the status and role of foreign investors in China's economic development?" "With the expansion in the scope and field of investment made by foreign businessmen, foreign investment is playing an increasingly important role in China's economic development." "Foreign investment has accelerated the pace of China's economic development and has increased employment opportunities and state revenue. The proportion of China's annual actual use of foreign investment to total investment in fixed assets, which was 2.5 percent in the 1980's, 8 percent in 1992, and 13 percent in 1993, constituted one of the essential sources of capital for China's economic construction. Foreign-funded enterprises which have gone into operation total over 80,000, of which the output value of industrial enterprises accounted for 7.5 percent of the country's total in 1992, 11 percent in 1993, and higher in Guangdong and Fujian. Taxes collected from foreign-funded enterprises increased for successive years, jumping from 10.7 billion yuan in 1992 to 20.6 billion yuan in 1993, nearly doubling the figure. The number of people employed by foreign-funded enterprises which have gone into operation total approximately 10 million. "Foreign investment promoted China's industrial progress. The available foreign capital is primarily used in importing advanced technology and equipment, which filled the gaps in some domestic technology, upgraded large number of products, narrowed the gap between China and advanced international levels, and brought about an upgrading of similar domestic products. Meanwhile, the transfer of parts and technology of many trades further boosted the growth of the relevant domestic industries and improved the production and technological level." "Foreign-funded enterprises have become a vital force in China's foreign trade. The volume of imports and exports of foreign-funded enterprises in 1993 totaled $67.1 billion, accounting for 34.4 percent of the volume of the country's imports and exports, of which their exports amounted to $25.2 billion, accounting for 27.5 percent of the country's total. China's foreign trade grew comprehensively in the first quarter of this year, with the volume of imports and exports reaching $39.5 billion, of which the volume of imports and exports of foreign-funded enterprises amounted to $14.66 billion, accounting for 37.1 percent of the country's total as compared with the 30 percent rise of the previous year. The development of foreign-funded enterprises improved the structure of China's export commodities and enormously boosted China's foreign trade." "The means of organizations and operation of foreign-funded enterprises, their market mechanisms, and the scientific enterprise management system have offered a demonstration and reference to state enterprises to change their operational mechanism and establish a modern enterprise system." After a pause, Minister Wu said: "Facts have proven that the development of foreign-funded enterprises is healthy on the whole, and their achievements are remarkable. This should be fully affirmed and appraised. But there are also problems. We should follow international standards to promote and ensure the healthy growth of foreign-funded enterprises. Viewed from the foreign-funded enterprises which have gone into operation, most of them have obtained better or considerable economic results and have attained their due interests in investing in China." Minister Wu said enthusiastically: "Through 15 years of development, a large number of well-known foreign-funded enterprises have emerged. They have filled the gaps in domestic technology, scientific operational mechanism, enterprise management, social and economic efficiency, product quality and grade, capital and technology content, and foreign exchange earning through exports. All foreign-funded enterprises and domestic enterprises should learn from their experiences. Therefore, I am in favor of the long series on `Noted Foreign-Funded Enterprises in China' that is jointly being written by RENMIN RIBAO OVERSEAS EDITION and CHINA FOREIGN CAPITAL." "What will be the main guide for foreign capital in the years ahead?" "We will continue to follow the state's industrial policies; will vigorously guide foreign capital toward infrastructure and basic industries, toward the technical transformation of enterprises, and toward capital and technology intensive industries; and will gradually lift the restrictions on the service trades. We encourage foreign businessmen to invest in the following fields: Comprehensive agricultural development projects -- the energy, transportation, and essential raw materials industries that China badly needs; advanced technological projects; and projects that earn more foreign exchange through exports." "In short, China has a variety of industries and offers an extensive scope for investment and great potential for development, which provides foreign investors with favorable conditions. We will unswervingly implement the open policy, further strengthen international and regional economic and technological cooperation based on equality and mutual benefit, and make contributions to economic prosperity and development."
