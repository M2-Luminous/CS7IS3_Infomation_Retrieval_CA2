Gulfcoast is the owner and operator of the ARTUBAR integrated tug/barge combination JANIS GUZZLE/MARIE FLOOD. The M/V JANIS GUZZLE was constructed in 1979 pursuant to a CDS agreement, Contract MA/MSB&hyph;373, dated September 23, 1976. The barge MARIE FLOOD (Official Number 545015) was constructed in 1972 in Orange, Texas, as a coastwise qualified vessel. Gulfcoast placed the JANIS GUZZLE/MARIE FLOOD into service in 1990. Both vessels have Certificates of Documentation issued by the Coast Guard with coastwise endorsements. In support of its request, Gulfcoast advises that it provides coastwise transportation for its affiliate company, Tampa Electric Company, under a long term contract for the movement of coal from the New Orleans, Louisiana area to Tampa, Florida. (The coal is utilized by Tampa Electric Company in its power generation facilities.) In addition, Gulfcoast's transportation service for its affiliate company is provided throughout the year, utilizing several coastwise qualified tugs, barges and tug/barge units owned by Gulfcoast. Any person, firm, or corporation having any interest in the application for section 506 consent and desiring to submit comments concerning Gulfcoast's request must by 5 p.m. on May 18, 1994, file written comments in triplicate, to the Secretary, Maritime Administration, room 7300, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.
