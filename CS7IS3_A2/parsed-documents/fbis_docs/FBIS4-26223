The area cultivated for rape seeds this year is about 84.2 million mu of land in the country, 7.7 million mu more than that of last year. The actual harvesting area is estimated to be around 80 million mu, 5 million mu more than that of last year. Its gross output is predicted to have a remarkable increase this summer. The production of summer grain crop this year met some difficulties. First, owing to the restructuring of crop planting, this summer's grain-crops-growing area dropped. Second, because of the adjustment of exchange rate of renminbi and price rise, prices for the main agricultural production materials increased greatly. Third, the weather in early days in such crops' growing period was not so good with the accumulated temperature in this period being 200 to 300 degrees centigrade less than that in past years. Thanks to the strengthening of field management and good weather in later days, a good harvest of such crops including wheat is guaranteed.
