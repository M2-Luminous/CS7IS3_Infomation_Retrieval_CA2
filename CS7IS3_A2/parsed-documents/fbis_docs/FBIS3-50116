Reporting on the situation in Maglaj, Hajrudin Sermic says that "over 800 shells have so far today landed on the civilian targets and the defensive positions. Civilian casualties have been reported. The fighters of the 201st Maglaj Brigade are heroically defending the free territory. Heavy losses have been inflicted on the united aggressor [the Serbs and the HVO], but they do not seem to have had enough as their futile attacks are still under way now." Mirudin Aldobasic reports from the operational zone of the 7th South Operative Group that "since this morning the [Serb] enemy on the Doboj front has been shelling Matuzici, Mravici, Alibegovci, and (Maslinovac). (Omanjska), (Sivsa), (Paradaglije), and Kalosevic on the Tesanj front have also come under enemy artillery fire." The report says that "since this morning the Mt. Ozren Chetniks from their well-known positions have been shelling Lijesnica, (Mekolj), (Omezina), and (?Polje Plane)." In his report from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that "it is relatively quiet here today, but there has been some sporadic small arms fire along the front line with the paraformations of the so-called Kladusa autonomy." He cites the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps Command as saying that "it has rejected outright the proposal by the other side on establishing demarcation lines and some kind of buffer zones. That is unacceptable for two reasons, the 5th Corps statement says. First, this is an integral part of the territory of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and second, no lines or buffer zones can divide our people." The studio announcer says that Sarajevo was "relatively quiet this morning."
