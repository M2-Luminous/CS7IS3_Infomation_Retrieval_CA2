People are trying to learn details of the reforms from all aspects which will influence almost everyone's interests and daily life. Some of the reforms are already in full operation, such as the overhaul of the taxation system and unification of the two-tiered exchange rates. Other reforms are still in the blueprint stage, or just in the process of being carried out, like the overall wages increase for government employees. The influence of the reforms can be felt in street chats and in marketplaces all over the city. In the Dongdan Vegetable Market in east Beijing, Wang Lin, a 30- year-old man working in a government institute, said that his monthly wage has gone up by one-third after his work unit carried out a payment reform in January. "I can spend more now," he said. "But I am concerned that if all government employees receive wage rises, prices will go up and bite into the raised incomes." Though many people have the same concern as Wang, Beijing City government's surveys show that the purchasing power of the citizens is on a steady increase, while the city's retail market has been booming since January 1. The city government is planning to raise by 30 percent the pensions of retired workers, who will benefit the least from the wages reform. Yun Fengqi, a car driver in his 50s, said that his standard of life is better than a decade ago. "We have many more choices on the shelves in stores now than in the late 1970s," he said. He cited the example of his own family, who were able to afford a color TV set now costing several thousand yuan, but had to hesitate when they spent several hundred yuan to buy a nine-inch black-and- white TV set in 1979. "We cannot be like some rich people who buy extremely expensive things, but we live a rather comfortable life," Yun said. According to a survey by the Beijing Psychological Research Institute, over 90 percent of citizens believe that prices rise fast. But in the meantime, they support the economic reform because it means better opportunities to make more money. The widely held belief is that people have to rely on themselves to earn a higher income. Entrepreneurs from all sectors are keenly interested in the reforms of exchange rates and taxation. Li Wuquan, general manager of the state-run Beijing Machinery Import and Export Corporation, said that the unification of exchange rates is good for Chinese enterprises to enter international markets. He said that the adoption of a single exchange rate facilitates his company's operations by accelerating circulation of funds. "In the past, we had to wait one or two months before we could sell foreign exchange at the swap market for renminbi currency needed to purchase export goods. But now we can get the money back immediately from bank," he said. But Li said that since China abandoned the government-set exchange rate and adopted a higher market rate of around 8.7 yuan for one dollar, machinery companies can no longer buy foreign exchange from the state bank at the former rate of 5.7 yuan. It has put the cost up and cut the edge of sophisticated products over other products in exports, he said. China has aimed the reforms to benefit the majority of the people. But of course, not everyone benefits simultaneously from the present reforms. Sun Jian, owner of a private photocopy workshop in Zhongguancun, in northwest Beijing, complained that his profits suffered as a new system of receipts hampered his business with large state-run institutes. A manager of a publicly-owned technological joint venture said that the tax reforms have put all enterprises on the same footing for competition -- more opportunities, more risk and more challenge. He pointed out that the rise in wages for employees in government institutes had narrowed the salary advantages offered by non-government-run enterprises, intensifying the competition for skills and talents between enterprises. But the manager said that he is fully confident of the future, because the reforms conform with the principle of equal competition. Chen Dehua, professor of economics at Beijing University, described this year's reforms as "drastic". The most prominent point of the reforms is that they get rid of the egalitarianism still remaining in people's minds. But the preparation work for the reforms is inadequate, enabling some people to take the chance to raise prices, he said.
