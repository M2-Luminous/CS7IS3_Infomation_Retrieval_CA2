Cuban and South African Foreign Ministers Roberto Robaina and Alfred Nzo formalized a protocol that establishes a new stage in relations between Pretoria and Havana today. The two governments had no diplomatic relations to date because of our government and people's rejection of the now-dismantled racist system of apartheid. Less than 48 hours after becoming president, Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress [ANC], raised the relations of friendship and solidarity that have existed for years between Cuba and the formerly proscribed ANC to the government level. During his visit to Pretoria, Castro said there have been moments of strong confrontations in past bilateral relations between Cuba and South Africa. Castro recalled Cuba's internationalist position against the policy of apartheid against the majority black populations of South Africa, Namibia, and Angola -- a policy now overcome -- adding that there is now a new South Africa, where there is peace, respect, and affection toward Cuba. Today, Fidel Castro, heading the Cuban delegation, will conclude his first official and friendly visit to South Africa, a visit that began on 9 May to attend the inauguration of Nelson Mandela, the first black president of a country that has left behind more than three centuries of racial discrimination now. At the signing of the new document regarding diplomatic relations, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina was accompanied by Angel Dalmau, Cuban ambassador to Namibia; Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of Science, Technology, and Environment; and (Marcos Rodriguez), who will represent our country in Pretoria temporarily.
