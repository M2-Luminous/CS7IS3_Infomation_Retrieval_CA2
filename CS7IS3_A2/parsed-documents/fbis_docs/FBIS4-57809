The idea is precisely to unify the proposals, our proposals, proposals to be presented by each nation. The idea is to present in a unified manner diverse issues, including environmental issues, on which a proposal has already been drawn up by all of the Central American presidents. I had the honor of presenting to President Clinton the proposal for a sustained alliance, an Alliance for Sustained Development. This is a pilot program for Central America to strengthen our democracies based on absolute liberty, based on a true democracy, and based on respect for human rights, such as the right to a clean environment. There is also the drug trafficking issue, and drug-related activities, which generally includes several other issues. There is also the free trade issue, which has taken the form of NAFTA. We will attempt to unify standards in an attempt to present a single point of view at the upcoming meeting on this. [Reporter] What [words indistinct] NAFTA in Guatemala? [De Leon] We have been studying this. We have presented a proposal to the United States. Every president has already appointed and designated two representatives each, and these representatives are already working on this. We hope this process will develop little by little until a hemispheric free trade agreement is achieved. This was the proposal the presidents made to President Clinton in November. Of course, to achieve this we must overcome several problems. Our [words indistinct] our goal is to achieve integration, although we understand that integration into this free trade agreement will be a slow process. [Reporter] This is a historic moment for the democracies of Central America. The Guatemalan Government has entered into negotiations with the Guatemalan guerrillas. What are the chances these negotiations will ultimately put an end to this conflict, which is the last armed conflict to prevail in the region? [De Leon] Tomorrow will be exactly one year since former President Serrano Elias attempted to interrupt the institutional and constitutional order. This is one of the main reasons why I assumed the presidency of the Republic. Now, one year later, we can highlight two fundamental changes that have taken place. In institutional matters one year later, we can say with satisfaction that Guatemala has guarded and strengthened its institutionality. Today, more than ever, any possibility of interrupting institutional order has been removed. Now, more than ever, there is no talk of a coup d'etat in Guatemala, and the principles of institutionality have been strengthened and preserved and, in turn, so has the democratic process. Meanwhile, when I assumed the Presidency nearly one year ago, we encountered a dialogue that had broken down; the entire process was totally bogged down. Now we are nearing peace [words indistinct] to sign peace. Today -- and this is the reason I was delayed -- we were engaged in direct communication with the Peace Commission that is discussing the displaced communities issue. We are on the verge of resolving this point, while we are [words indistinct] the aspect we have already agreed upon on a timetable that will conclude with a cease-fire in September. In certain regions, there could be cease-fires before this time. This would conclude with the signing of a peace pact that puts an end to an armed conflict -- the last one, as you just noted -- which has been going on for more than 33 years. [Reporter] What was the U.S. reaction to the proposal you presented in the name of the Central American presidents? [De Leon] At that time, it was very well-received. I believe this is the time to test the world power that is our neighbor and which, to some extent, is committed to these issues not only because of a commitment to the nations of Central America, but also because of its commitments to its own population. For example, environmental issues as well as drug-related activities, adversely affect not only the Central American population, but they also affect the U.S. population and the world population. Therefore, this proposal was very well-received, and we hope that today we can wrap up this point and take it to the upcoming summit with... [Reporter, interrupting] Mr. President will this meeting serve to somehow establish a bilateral relationship with Honduras? [De Leon] We have embarked on an excellent relationship with President Reina, and I believe that this is a good opportunity to discuss bilateral issues, even through this may be in a very quick manner. We will be meeting on 31 May in San Salvador, but there are issues we can discuss, such as the supply of electricity. We could offer Honduras a certain amount of megawatts, which would enable us, when the network is created, to supply a certain amount of electricity. Right now, this is a difficult issue for Honduras. We undoubtedly could discuss this and other issues, particularly in light of the excellent relationship all of the Central American nations currently have, and all presidents have, including the new presidents. [Reporter] What about the travel advisory issued to U.S. citizens in the wake of the high level of violence and attacks against U.S. citizens? Has this situation improved? Why is this situation occurring? [De Leon] As Guatemalan President and as a representative of the Guatemalan people and its government, I believe this was a very drastic decision; it was much too extreme on the part of the world power, the United States. In the United States itself, incidents such as those that have occurred in my country are also taking place against citizens from other nations. There are murders, violence, and others incidents. Nevertheless, although I respect it, I do not agree with this drastic decision. It is unjustified because, although in Guatemala we are currently experiencing a climate of violence like many other parts of the world, conditions do not exist to justify the travel warning [preceding two words in English]. Nevertheless, we are making an all-out effort to convince the United States that conditions do not prevail to continue with this warning in the hope of returning tourism to the nation. [Reporter] But what is the reason for this situation? [De Leon] It has been brought about by violent situations that have taken place in all countries of the world. There have been two or three cases. There were charges of trafficking in children, and these were untrue. Nevertheless, two or three U.S. citizens have been accused, as well as two or three other foreigners. Nevertheless, conditions do not prevail to justify the travel warning [preceding two words in English].
