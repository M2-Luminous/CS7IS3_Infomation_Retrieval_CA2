The line our population is defending is that of finding solutions within socialism, within the social justice and equality that the work of the Revolution guarantees. Administrations at the level of centers, enterprises, branches, and ministries made a noteworthy contribution to the parliament in the workplace assemblies. In a majority of cases, they provided serious information and elements that contributed to the quality of the analyses made. For its part, the workers movement is obliged to think about how to get this method, this work style, to take permanent root within its union organizations. The main thing is that ideological influence, organizational work, or a thrust toward defense or cultural development cannot even be conceived if the unions do not participate in solving the economy's real problems. There is no room for pessimism. What we are doing, including these Parliament in the Workplace assemblies, is our own victory alternative. An editorial carried in today's, 28 March, edition of the weekly TRABAJADORES says the initial step has been taken.
