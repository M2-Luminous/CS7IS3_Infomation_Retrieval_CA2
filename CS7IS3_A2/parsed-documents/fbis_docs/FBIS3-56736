The president had accepted the resignation of Yegor Gaydar who told Interfax that he more or less knew who would be serve in the government. In his view, Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays, a member of Russia's Choice, should not resign while Vice Premier and Finance Minister Boris Fedorov should. Officials in Fedorov's secretariat told Interfax Tuesday that he had rejected the prime minister's offer to stay as finance minister in the reorganized government but had not resigned either of his positions. When he met Chernomyrdin Monday, Fedorov demanded special powers in pursuing his financial and economic policy "in line with what he was promised when he was appointed vice premier in 1992." Fedorov told Interfax that he could stay "as just the finance minister" if there was just one first premier, Oleg Soskovets, but not if there are four or five vice premiers. He confirmed that he had also demanded that Aleksandr Zaveryukha should not be a vice premier and Viktor Gerashchenko, governor of the Central Bank of Russia. Fedorov's aides told Interfax that he sent a letter to Yeltsin Tuesday morning outlining his view of the situation and conditions on which he would agree to stay in the government. Meanwhile, an informed source in the government told Interfax that Chernomyrdin had decided not to have Fedorov in the government "on his conditions." The same source says that this opinion is shared by the president.
