What is your comment? [Al-Sahhaf] As you know, Iraq has sent the Security Council a letter signed by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz. The letter factually explains Iraq's implementation of the measures required of it in accordance with Resolution 687. The letter asks the Security Council to implement Paragraph 22 because the Security Council is responsible for its implementation. The Security Council is committed to implementing this paragraph after Iraq implements what is required of it. Paragraph 22 calls for lifting the economic blockade of Iraq. However, if there are pressures on the Security Council and Iraq implements its commitments but the Security Council does not implement its commitments, it is the right of Iraq and the Iraqi people to take measures that keep them alive and ensure their future. [Hijazi] Regarding the stand on Kuwait, what is meant by this stand on Kuwait? Is it the border or the issue of the prisoners? [Al-Sahhaf] During contacts between Iraq and a number of governments that are members of the Security Council, the representatives of these governments raised the subject of Kuwait with the Iraqi delegations. Iraq's answer was and still is based on the paragraphs of the UN Security Council resolution. In other words, this subject is not connected with the economic blockade. Paragraph 22 says that if Iraq implements certain paragraphs dealing with weapons of mass destruction, the Security Council will implement Paragraph 22 and lift the embargo on Iraqi exports. The subject of Kuwait has no connection with this paragraph. If the Security Council member states want to talk about this subject, Iraq believes that movement toward implementation of Paragraph 22 should not stop. If Paragraph 22 is implemented and the economic blockade of Iraq is lifted, then a positive atmosphere will be created that will help talks to take place on this subject. Iraq has expressed its readiness to begin discussions with the Security Council on this subject. [Hijazi] The Arab League secretary general has sent two envoys to the Iraqi Government on the subject of Kuwaiti prisoners. Recently, it was reported that if Kuwaiti authorities release the defendants in the attempt to assassinate former U.S. President Bush, then Iraq will reconsider the subject of prisoners, in the sense that Iraq has some prisoners. [Al-Sahhaf] First of all, this issue is completely groundless. It is a fabrication. The secretary general sent three envoys: 'Abdallah Adam, Rashid Idris, and Mayhub al-Bayhubi. The three envoys came to Baghdad in the past two years only as part of an attempt or an initiative by Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al- Majid to help resolve this problem, which he describes as hurting the general atmosphere. We reiterated to all three envoys--as we explained to the Security Council and the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC--that there are no prisoners or detainees in Iraq at all. This issue concerns missing people. We are ready to cooperate with all parties to probe and investigate to discover the fate of these missing people. Iraq received the files on 625 missing people. We have formed special committees that are searching for and gathering information on these missing people. We are ready to share any information we gather on any individual whose name is mentioned and who has a file, with the ICRC and the Arab League secretary. And, as I said in the news conference, we are prepared to cooperate with the Gulf states on this subject.
