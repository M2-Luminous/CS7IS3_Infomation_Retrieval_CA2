Ren Jianxin discussed bribery and embezzlement cases involving Li Xiaoshi, former vice chairman of the State Science and Technology Commission, and Shen Taifu, former president of Beijing's Great Wall Scientific and Technological Industrial Corporation of Machinery and Electronic Products, which had aroused widespread concern in all segments of society. He said: Li Xiaoshi abused his power to help Shen Taifu illegally collect money in return for more than 52,000 yuan in bribes and 20,000 yuan in embezzled funds from the latter and his colleagues. On 4 March this year, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court sentenced him to 20 years in prison on several charges during first-instance trials. On the same day, the same court, during first-instance trials, sentenced Shen Taifu to death on several charges, including those of raising funds illegally, such as embezzling 1 million yuan in public funds in collaboration with his wife and misappropriating 2 million yuan in public funds by himself, as well as those of offering 250,000 yuan in bribes. Following appeals by Li Xiaoshi and Shen Taifu, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court is currently conducting second-instance trials. Speaking of a cigarette-smuggling case in Shandong's Rushan City, Ren Jianxin said: Liu Qishan, former director of the Rushan City Commerce Bureau in Shandong Province, and his associates smuggled cigarettes worth a massive sum of money in collusion with smugglers outside the national boundaries in exceptionally serious circumstances, thereby causing an adverse effect in society. On 15 February this year, the Weihai City Intermediate People's Court in Shandong Province sentenced Liu Qishan; Fan Zhanwu, former political commissar of the Weihai City Border Defense Sub-Bureau; and Liu Ning, deputy director of the sub-bureau's business section, to death on several charges, including smuggling and bribery, during first-instance trials. The same court also sentenced Wang Jianzhi, former secretary of the Rushan city party committee, to death on several charges, including bribery and perversion of the law for personal gain, with two years' probation. The defendants have appealed to the Shandong Provincial Higher People's Court, which is conducting second-instance trials. In his report, Zhang Siqing related how procuratorial organs investigated and dealt with major and important cases, saying: Fujian Province procuratorial organs solved a massive bribery case involving the Power Industry Ministry's Minjiang Engineering Bureau. The bureau director, four other bureau-level cadres, and 10 division-level cadres abused their project-contracting positions to demand and accept more than 3 million yuan in bribes. Last September, procuratorial organs in Tieling City, Liaoning Province, solved a massive case of embezzlement, bribery, misappropriation, and tax evasion involving grain departments in Changtu County. Gui Bingquan, director of the county grain bureau, his deputy Yang Maoyuan, and other people abused their power to demand and accept bribes and to jointly engage in graft while selling substandard equipment to the county grain depot. Procuratorial organs booked 43 people for investigation, decided to arrest 25 people, and recovered and impounded 32 million yuan in ill-gotten money. Zhang Siqing also related how procuratorial organs investigated and dealt with judicial personnel whose actions constituted crimes, saying: Guo Zhengmin, director of the Guizhou Provincial Public Security Department, abused his power to illegally authorize other people to process exit permits, taking more than 100,000 yuan in bribes in the process. Chen Zhiwen, procurator general of the Changping County Procuratorate in Beijing City, misused his power to take more than 20,000 yuan in bribes. Li Kaifu, member of the judicial committee and president of a Hubei Provincial Higher Court criminal tribunal, promised to win a reprieve for a death-row inmate in return for 10,000 yuan in bribes from the inmate's relatives. Zhang Siqing said: Procuratorial organs investigated and sternly dealt with crimes committed by such judicial personnel while enforcing the law, thus safeguarding the dignity and fairness of state laws.
