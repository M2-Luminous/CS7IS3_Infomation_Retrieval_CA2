He told an Interfax interviewer in Moscow on Thursday that "it is possible to pardon those who have pleaded guilty to a crime only after the court's verdict." Politically, Sobchak believes, "this is a challenge and the desire to make the president, government, and all democrats accept what was done as an accomplished fact." "It's not merely a political challenge but a desire to prepare a new show down of strength," he remarked. "The farce that has been continuing at the trial of the State of Emergency Committee Members and the attempt to let those who have the blood of many people on their hands and who openly called for an armed rebellion, get away with it, all this is sad." In Sobchak's words, the Duma "has so far been demonstrating total impotence on the issues it ought to address according to the Constitution." Although the country faces lots of problems, although the taxation legislation, penal code, and other laws need to be amended, deputies in the lower house of parliament have never tried to debate a single bill. "How much has been said and written about corruption, while such a crime is unknown in Russia's penal code -- Sobchak said. And since corruption is taken for granted, there is no one to persecute for it. That's what the Duma should deal with." In Sobchak's words, he has not been surprised by the position of the Liberal Democrats and Communists during the political amnesty debates in parliament. "But the stand of many others, Sergey Shakhray (the leader of the faction from the Russian Unity and Concord Party) included, is staggering, he declared. People calling themselves democrats stab democracy in the back."
