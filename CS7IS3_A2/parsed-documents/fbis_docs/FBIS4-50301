The team is expected to monitor the refueling of a 5-megawatt experimental nuclear reactor and inspect a nuclear laboratory suspected of producing nuclear weapons at Yongbyon near Pyongyang. Team leader Olli Heinonen disclosed little to journalists about his mission as he prepared to leave Beijing's capital airport. "You know our rules are such that we have to evaluate the results, and we take samples and we analyze them and after that we tell what we think. So there will be no comment whatsoever," he said. Heinonen said the inspections will last about a week. The (North) KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA) said Saturday the fuel rod replacement has begun and the seals on the reactor's fuel rods have been broken. Such moves would be in violation of agreements between the IAEA and North Korea, an IAEA official in Vienna said, and could signal the recall of the inspectors. Removal of the seals would make it impossible to determine whether plutonium has been diverted to North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program, experts said. The inspection team has been sent "to see for ourselves," Heinonen said. The IAEA and the United States have been involved in 15 months of drawn-out negotiations with North Korea to verify the extent of its nuclear program and to confirm whether or not the Stalinist state has developed a nuclear weapon. An IAEA inspection group also led by Heinonen were refused entry into the Yongbyon Laboratory during an inspection tour last March, which led to further calls for UN sanctions against the North.
