"With the passage of 1997 we know China is worried about how some of its senior officials use of their official positions," Tony Scott, the director of corruption prevention at the Independent Commission Against Corruption, said. "They might say, `We can go and do the same thing in Hong Kong'. That could be a worry and one which I have heard expressed by people on the mainland." Scott was confident that any top-level corruption would be unlikely to spread. "If they do behave in that way (abusing power) then that could happen," he said. "Hopefully the Special Administrative Region and our regulatory controls will ensure it doesn't happen. They are quite good at finding out when people are doing things which are wrong, unethical, criminal or outside the rules, and putting it right. "It is an area which I think is potentially more worrying than the growth of ordinary corruption in Hong Kong. "At this point I would say it is a slightly larger threat than Hong Kong people turning to corruption." Scott said corruption complaints in the territory jumped from 1,542 to 1,940 in the first three months of 1994, compared with the same period last year. He was sure the amount of graft would not change significantly after the handover of sovereignty. Scott claimed China was serious about tackling corruption, citing recent wideranging laws with heavy penalties for state officials.
