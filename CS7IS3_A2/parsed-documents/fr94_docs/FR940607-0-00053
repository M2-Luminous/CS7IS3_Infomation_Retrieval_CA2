FR940607-0-00053 FR940607-0-00016 National Environmental Policy Act RSPA has analyzed this action for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ) and has determined that this action would not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. An Environmental Assessment and a Finding of No Significant Impact are in the docket. List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 195 Anhydrous ammonia, Carbon dioxide, Petroleum, Pipeline safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. In consideration of the foregoing, RSPA amends part 195 of title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: PART 195_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 195 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 App. U.S.C. 2001 et seq.; and 49 CFR 1.53. Subpart E_[Amended] 2. The title of subpart E is revised to read as follows: ``Subpart E_Pressure Testing''. 3. Section 195.300 is revised to read as follows: §195.300 Scope. This subpart prescribes minimum requirements for the pressure testing of steel pipelines. However, this subpart does not apply to the movement of pipe under §195.424. 4. Section 195.302 is revised to read as follows: §195.302 General requirements. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section and in §195.304(b), no operator may operate a pipeline unless it has been pressure tested under this subpart without leakage. In addition, no operator may return to service a segment of pipeline that has been replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed until it has been pressure tested under this subpart without leakage. (b) Except for pipelines converted under §195.5, the following pipelines may be operated without pressure testing under this subpart: (1) Any hazardous liquid pipeline whose maximum operating pressure is established under §195.406(a)(5) that is_ (i) An interstate pipeline constructed before January 8, 1971; (ii) An interstate offshore gathering line constructed before August 1, 1977; or (iii) An intrastate pipeline constructed before October 21, 1985. (2) Any carbon dioxide pipeline constructed before July 12, 1991, that_ (i) Has its maximum operating pressure established under §195.406(a)(5); or (ii) Is located in a rural area as part of a production field distribution system. (c) Except for onshore pipelines that transport HVL, the following compliance deadlines apply to pipelines under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)(i) of this section that have not been pressure tested under this subpart: (1) Before December 7, 1995, for each pipeline each operator shall_ (i) Plan and schedule testing according to this paragraph; or (ii) Establish the pipeline's maximum operating pressure under §195.406(a)(5). (2) For pipelines scheduled for testing, each operator shall_ (i) Before December 7, 1998, pressure test_ (A) Each pipeline identified by name, symbol, or otherwise that existing records show contains more than 50 percent by mileage of electric resistance welded pipe manufactured before 1970; and (B) At least 50 percent of the mileage of all other pipelines; and
