Told of reports that the tax plan decided early Thursday was being sent back to the drawing board because of political opposition, Kan Kato, head of the advisory panel to the prime minister, told reporters the plan's 6 trillion yen in income and resident's tax cuts must remain linked to the welfare tax. At a regular press conference, Kato praised Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's decision to adopt the plan, which links the tax cuts, retroactive to January 1, with changing the 3 percent consumption tax to a 7 percent welfare tax in 1997. He said he and others on the panel thought that "political collateral" -- promises that the tax cuts would be paid for later -- was not enough and that the funding must be made clear along with the tax cut. The tax cuts require "panel collateral," he said. Hosokawa has vowed in the past to respect recommendations of the Tax Commission.
