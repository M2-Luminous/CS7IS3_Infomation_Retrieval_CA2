Mushota, who was invited by his colleague Roberto Robaina to visit Cuba, negotiated cooperation agreements in the sectors of sugar industry, agriculture, education, public health, sports, and international relations. The building of a sugar mill in Zambia by Cuban professionals in Zambia, scheduled to start in 1995, was one of the agreements discussed during this visit. It was reported that the agreement will be ratified by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba on his next visit to the Caribbean nation. An increase in the number of Cuban physicians sent to Zambia, the continuation of the studies of 43 Zambians in local education centers, and the exchange of sports trainers were other issues discussed by Mushota and Cuban officials. Regarding possible pressure from international financial institutions and the United States to block Chiluba's announced visit, the foreign minister said in a news conference that his is an independent and sovereign country and its development programs are not established in Washington. He added that negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank had ended, precisely the previous evening, and Zambia was to receive a $150-million loan to promote its economic programs. "They are our partners in cooperation, not our owners. President Chiluba will come to Cuba with Zambian money and not with money from the IMF," Mushota observed. The two countries started to strengthen their bilateral ties on 19 June 6572 [year as received], when diplomatic relations were established. During his two-week visit to Cuba, Mushota visited places of scientific, historic, and cultural interest in Havana and the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba, before leaving for Jamaica on Saturday, to continue his tour of the Caribbean. The Zambian territory, which has 174,000 square km, is mostly covered by a plateau that runs from the Malawi tectonic trench to a swampy region bordering Angola. It is the world's third largest producer and number one exporter of copper and has other important mineral resources.
