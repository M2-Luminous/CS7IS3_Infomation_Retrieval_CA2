The investigation is part of a co-operative research program between Anhui Medical University and the Medical College of Harvard University in the U.S. The research into chronic and non-infectious diseases, which started in May this year and will continue for 20 years, aims at clarifying the role of occupation- and environment-related factors that cause chronic diseases. Since the 1970s the death rate from infectious diseases has been effectively curbed worldwide because of the introduction of effective vaccines and antibiotics. However, not much research has been done on the relationship between the environment and occupations, and chronic diseases such as tumors and heart disease, which are now major causes of death. The two institutes chose the Yingjiang district of Anqing city, Yijin town in Jiyang County and Haikou town in Huaining County, all in Anhui, as the focus of their field work. A four-month investigation of 52,000 of the total 60,000 population in the three areas has already been concluded, covering 2,378 items, including chronic respiratory ailments, the influence of pesticides on health, female fertility and medical services in the countryside. An investigation of the urban population in the same areas will soon be carried out. These surveys will be repeated at five-year intervals, and the information will be fed into computers.
