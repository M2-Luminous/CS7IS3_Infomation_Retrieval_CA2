MOF claims that the report compares time needed for import procedures in Japan and the United States by different standards. It argues that "in terms of customs procedures, there is practically no disparity [in time needed] between Japan and the United States." According to a survey conducted by the MOF in 1993, the average time needed for sea cargo to pass customs (obtain import permit) after the shipment arrives was 4.8 days, and for air cargo, 1.9 days. The USTR report claims that in the United States, "the average time needed to get import permit is around one minute," urging Japan to shorten time needed for import procedures. However, MOF contends that the fact is, "there is a gap in the idea of processing time." In Japan, import declarations are filed and customs procedures started only after passing inspections required by laws not under MOF jurisdiction, such as food inspection or animal and plant quarantine (so-called non-customs procedures). In the United States, such non-customs procedures are taken after going through customs based on advance import declarations. That is, the difference between Japan and the United States is that non-customs procedures are taken before and after customs procedures, respectively. Therefore, what the United States claims to take only "one minute" refers only to customs procedures not including the non- customs requirements. If the latter category is included, "the entire process can easily take more than two weeks," (according to a major Japanese trading firm). On the other hand, the United States questions the total time needed for both non-customs and customs procedures for imports in Japan. MOF takes the position that "this is an argument neglecting the disparity in definition."
