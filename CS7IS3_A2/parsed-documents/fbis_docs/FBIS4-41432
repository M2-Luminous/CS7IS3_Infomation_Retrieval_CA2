The order follows President Akayev's trip to the Jalalabad region in the south of the country in the middle of the week, the Presidential Press Service has told IF. In the course of the trip Akayev met with workers of the "Narymgidroenergostroi" joint stock company. Hydro power plant construction workers have not been paid wages for many months and the situation is critical. The joint stock company is faced with the risk of a strike. President Akayev visited a semi-conductor factory in Tash-Kumyr, where he met with city leaders and factory managers to discuss the possibility of subsidizing the expansion of this factory, one of the biggest producers of mono-crystals in the CIS. The question of closing down unprofitable pits was discussed at President Akayev's meetings with Tash-Kumyr coal workers. Experts blame the country's grave financial and economic position on inadequate taxation. Akayev asked the government to draft new tax legislation by September 1. Presidential adviser on social and economic affairs, Talai Koichumanov has told IF that the adoption of a better system of taxation at the forthcoming session of parliament would be crucial to forming the budget for 1995 on fundamentally new principles. Koichumanov said the budget was the main tool of social-economic policies. He said that currently the treasury was receiving a mere half of the minimum necessary to keep the economy going and most of the budget revenue was spent on the social safety net for the population. The presidential adviser said that the economic and financial position of Kyrgyzstan grave as it is, there has to be a comprehensive, stable and flexible tax legislation promptly responding to market changes. He hopes this would encourage private enterprise and increase budget revenues. About the situation in individual branches of the economy the presidential adviser said that Kyrgyzstan's industries needed fundamental reconstruction. Some unprofitable enterprises will simply be closed down. A full-scale agrarian reform, which, experts hope, will improve the situation in agriculture, can be launched no earlier than the autumn of 1994. Koichumanov warns that structural reforms in the economy and urgent measures to increase production contained in the three-year-plan may end in failure, unless Kyrgyzstan receives favorable credits from the IMF, the World Bank and donor-countries. The Kyrgyz presidential adviser fears that in the near future his country may find itself in a position similar to that of many African countries having poorly developed industries, huge foreign debts and quick population growth in rural regions. The sole difference would be that Kyrgyzstan has a far higher education level. T. Koichumanov strongly criticized the Cabinet for letting debts snowball. In 1993-1994 most credits were spend on the social sphere and on purchases of grain and fuel, and not on developing production. However, the presidential adviser believes that Kyrgyzstan has certain chances of coping with the crisis. He sees a way out in attracting foreign credits and investments into the production sphere in carrying out realistic projects. He believes that only the maximum preferences for private investors, in particular, the biggest multi-national corporations, would attract foreign capital into Kyrgyzstan. Presidential adviser Koichumanov believes that Kyrgyzstan should follow in the footsteps of Southeast Asian countries, which are expected to make a new economic leap in 2000 and the vacant niche in the world commodity production market of may be taken by Central Asian countries, including Kyrgyzstan.
