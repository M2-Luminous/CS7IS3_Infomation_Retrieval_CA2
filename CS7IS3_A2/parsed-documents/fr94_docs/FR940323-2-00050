Take notice that on March 14, 1994, AIM Pipeline Company 1 (AIM) filed pursuant to §284.123(b)(2) of the Commission's regulations, a petition for rate approval requesting that the Commission approve as fair and equitable a rate of $36.92 per MMBtu for transportation services performed under section 311(a)(2) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). 1 Effective November 1, 1994, AIM acquired all of the assets of Mississippi Fuel Company. AIM states that it is an intrastate pipeline within the meaning of section 2(16) of the NGPA and it owns and operates an intrastate pipeline system in the State of Mississippi. Pipeline proposes an effective date of March 14, 1994. Pursuant to §284.123(b)(2)(ii), if the Commission does not act within 150 days of the filing date, the rate will be deemed to be fair and equitable and not in excess of an amount which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for similar transportation service. The Commission may, prior to the expiration of the 150-day period, extend the time for action or institute a proceeding to afford parties an opportunity for written comments and for the oral presentation of views, data, and arguments. Any person desiring to participate in this rate proceeding must file a motion to intervene in accordance with §§385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures. All motions must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission on or before April 1, 1994. The petition for rate approval is on file with the Commission and is available for public inspection.
