He noted that, although the peace commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas and Bishop Samuel Ruiz, mediator in the talks, have both said agreements, pacts, and understandings have been reached through negotiations, this is not true. "The problem the (Indian Revolutionary Clandestine) Committee [CCRI] sees is that the government is saying agreements or pacts have already been reached, that an agreement was reached as a result of the dialogue in San Cristobal de las Casas, and that the only thing pending is its ratification, which is false," said subcommander Marcos, who headed the EZLN delegation at the negotiations. "The committee simply appointed delegates to participate in a dialogue, not to negotiate. We attended the dialogue, presented the demands from the members of our organization, and received a reply. Based on that reply, the committee must decide the next step. During an interview granted at an EZLN camp in the jungle, Subcommander Marcos said this confusion has delayed consultations with the Indian grass roots organizations. He added that creating false expectations about peace would not be fair. "It would seem that the only thing pending for a peace agreement is a signature, which is not the case. Peace is further away than one could imagine," he added. He said the CCRI members will study the EZLN proposals and the peace commissioner's replies in the next few days. Then, they will evaluate both and will begin consultations in order to reach a consensus. Subcommander Marcos said the committee will also evaluate the delegates' conduct, and if anyone acted improperly he will be punished. "That is the most serious problem right now. There have been no agreements or negotiations," he said. The government has presented it in this way with the obvious intention of forcing us up against the wall and accepting it." When the dialogue meeting ended at the San Cristobal Cathedral, both Bishop Ruiz and Camacho Solis announced that 32 agreements had been reached, which only had to be ratified in order to sign a peace agreement. "This means that if the (EZLN) committees say they disagree with the reply or part of it, it will seem as though we are intractable, which could be their purpose," he stressed. Asked why, contrary to the peace commissioner and the mediator, he looked upset the day advancements on the dialogue were announced. "We were upset by the way in which the situation was being presented, as if peace only depended on a signature, and that it was just a matter of having a few meetings," Marcos noted. "We were upset because throughout the dialogue we stressed the fact that we had no power of decision or negotiation, and this could create problems for us with our leaders. The problem was that we did not want to create false expectations in the civilian society. [no closing quotation marks as published] "People could get the impression that an agreement had been reached, that the path toward peace was completely open, which could cause people to lower their guards or give up. We believe there are unfavorable conditions preventing a solution to the conflict. I am talking about other factors." He warned that one of the factors that could extend the conflict is the aggressiveness of cattlemen and landowners. "Another factor is the way the government has handled the talks, giving the impression that everything has been settled," he added. "I am upset by the federal government's attitude, which gives the appearance of charity. I am disgusted with government leaders who are not complying with their duties of satisfying demands or organizing things correctly instead of conducting actions that seem charitable," he said. Asked why he did not clarify the situation when a report was presented to the domestic and international journalists at the Cathedral, when the mediator also implied that the next step would be the signing of the peace agreement, he replied: "The signals you give to the peace process is very important. Therefore, if we insisted too much on that point, we could be portraying a warmonger attitude, and some people would say: They really do not want peace; they want war. "We are letting the process continue according to our logic and our time. We did, however, make it clear to the mediator and the peace commissioner that no agreements had been signed."
