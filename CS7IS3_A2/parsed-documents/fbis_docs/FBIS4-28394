The source said the Office of His Majesty's Principal Private Secretary has approved the Government's proposal for the reinstatement of Mr. Manun who was sacked after the now-defunct National Peace-keeping Council seized power from the Chatchai Chunhawan government in the February 23, 1991 coup . Mr. Manun, then staff officer attached to Gen. Chatchai, who was also defence minister, was dismissed on June 12 of the same year for desertion after the former Young Turk leader disappeared. "I feel delighted hearing the news and deeply appreciate the Government's push for the reinstatement," said Mr. Manun, adding that he was happy to finally get justice. He said he has not yet been officially informed by the Government of the reinstatement. However, a number of his colleagues including Deputy Defence Minister Maj-Gen Sombat Rotphothong and ex-Phalang Tham Party leader Maj-Gen Chamlong Simuang had already congratulated him. Mr. Manun, 57, said he would continue to serve in the military until his retirement in 1996.
