We hope to establish closer cooperation with this state. An important element of the Turkish visit was also the confirmation of what had been said by President Demirel in Warsaw, that Turkey will continue to support our integration with the European security structures. This was emphasized on many occasions. Here we have a true ally."

"We have to do everything to ensure that Poland is integrated into the Euro-Atlantic system," the president underscored.
