The FIP's 1990 base-year stationary source VOC emission estimates rely on the 1990 inventory described in South Coast AQMD's 15 percent Rate-of-Progress Plan that was submitted to EPA in November 1993. The FIP's 1990 base-year stationary source NO X inventory is based on estimates described in SCAQMD's 1991 Air Quality Management Plan (1991 AQMP). 104 EPA is also using the 1991 AQMP for projecting VOC and NO X emissions from stationary sources to the South Coast target attainment year of 2010. While CARB's inventory estimates are used for many specific source categories in the 1991 AQMP, EPA relies on the overall SCAQMD rather than the CARB inventory in order to maximize consistency between the SIP and FIP. The SCAQMD is in the process of updating its revised 2010 inventory for inclusion in the 1994 AQMP, which is due for submittal to EPA in November 1994. Upon release of the revised 2010 inventory estimates, EPA will incorporate applicable changes in its 2010 FIP inventory projections. 104 1991 Air Quality Management Plan, South Coast Air Basin, July 1991. The following table represents a summary of the major categories and emissions in the 2010 stationary source inventory which are described further in the technical support document. Credit for adopted SIP and proposed FIP measures have not been included in this table.
