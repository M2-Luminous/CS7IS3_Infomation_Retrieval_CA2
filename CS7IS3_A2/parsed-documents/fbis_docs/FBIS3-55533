The Russia's Choice bloc believes that it is not only "fruitless" but also "unacceptable and dangerous for the public conscience" to negotiate with them under the present situation. "One of this grouping is a left-wing radical one made up of representatives of the ideology of the Soviet, namely communist period of the Russian history," said Burbulis. The question concerns the parliamentary factions of Russia's communist party and agrarian party, he explained. The second right-wing radical grouping is represented by the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia which "openly propagates national fascist ideas," believes Burbulis. "All constructive proposals set forth by Russia's Choice confronts self-mercenary interests of there two radical groupings," he said. In Burbulis' opinion, continuation of negotiations with these two extremely radical forces could lead to the oblivion of those strategic goals for the sake of which the Russia's Choice bloc has been formed and of those positions which its candidates have defended in the course of the pre-election campaign. The deputies elected from the bloc Russia's Choice, Burbulis continued, strive "to ensure stability in the country without deviating from the principal course aimed at deep democratic transformations in Russia." Burbulis believes that the participation of Russia's Choice in the negotiations probably has been a demonstration of its "political shortsightedness." In the course of the negotiations, Burbulis said, "appetites of extremist radical factions have grown into the claims to head key parliamentary committees, including the committee on international affairs, defense, security, legislature, and financial-economic committees." While commenting the intention of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia's Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to head the international affairs committee, Burbulis declared that "it should not take place under any situation." "This will be an appeal to other countries to defend and to move away from Russia again though the latter has demonstrated that it is ready for a comprehensive and useful integration into the world community," said Burbulis. When asked whether the faction Russia's Choice does not fear to appear in the minority, Burbulis answered: "It is more dangerous for us to loose our positions in the society and confidence of our electors." According to Burbulis, position of Russia's Choice is well known to the participants of the negotiations."
