FBIS4-35538 "drnes106bb_94001" FBIS-NES-94-106 Daily Report 31 May 1994 Inter-Arab Affairs Syria, Jordan, Lebanon Moving Toward `Economic Bloc' Syria, Jordan, Lebanon Moving Toward `Economic Bloc' PM0106160094 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Arabic 31 May 94 p5 PM0106160094 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Arabic BFN [Reports by Salih Qallab in Amman and AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT bureau in Cairo: "Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese Consultations To Counter Israel's `Middle East Market' Proposal"] [Excerpt] Highly placed diplomatic sources have revealed that Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon have reached an advanced stage in consultations -- with the participation of King Husayn of Jordan and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad -- aimed at crystallizing a strong economic bloc in the region capable of standing fast in the face of Israel in the future after the creation of the so-called "Middle East market." According to the same sources, the Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese consultations and meetings in this connection have made great progress and the technical experts from the three countries have completed the major part of the draft concepts and required studies and all that remains is the political decision which awaits the right circumstances in the region and at Arab and international levels. It seems that the United States and Russia are aware of these moves and that the issue was discussed by Presidents Clinton and al-Asad during their latest meeting in Geneva some months ago. The issue was also discussed with Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese officials by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Viktor Kosovalyuk, head of the Middle East and North Africa Section at the Russian Foreign Ministry, on their successive visits to the region. Some circles believe that this development, which had not previously been disclosed or publicized, might have something to do with the Syrian position passed to U.S. and Russian officials, that if Syria is to participate in the peace process in the region, it must play a regional part in the Middle East. The question being asked is whether the PLO and the National Authority in Gaza and Jericho, and later in the West Bank, would be given any part in that process. Some say that the Palestinian part would come at a later stage when the situation stabilizes and becomes clearer, but others claim that Syria has imposed a veto against the PLO on the grounds that the latter accepted a separate solution and concluded agreements considered by Syria to be in the interest of Israel's future economic designs. The same sources say that the Iraqis were perhaps informed by Jordan or Syria indirectly about the formation of such a bloc. The sources add, however, that Iraq, in its current situation, can only listen to such ideas but even in the long run it would have priorities other than such a bloc, especially rebuilding what was destroyed by the war and years of boycott. The Egyptians most probably know about the aforementioned economic bloc but they do not favor such a step or talking about at this sensitive stage, particularly as that might affect the current peace process. Some circles believe that Syria, in agreement with Jordan and Lebanon, perhaps deliberately brandished the bloc card to put pressure on Israel and the United States for more concessions on the question of withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights.
