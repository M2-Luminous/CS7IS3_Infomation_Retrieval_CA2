In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM published today, al-'Attas said: We are now limiting our efforts on reaching a cease-fire and agreeing on a formula for future conditions in the country. If Sanaa insists, however, on maintaining the crisis, the future will be bleak. Al-'Attas praised Egypt's historic support for Yemeni interests since the 1970's up until the breakout of the recent ferocious civil war that Egypt, under the leadership of President Mubarak, is trying to stop. Al-'Attas affirmed that if the northerners continue the war and escalate hostitilies, many countries may hasten to recognize the Democratic Republic of Yemen. Al-'Attas accused Iraq of intervening to help Sanaa in the current fighting. He said the war has undermined the union and made the division of Yemen a fact. He remarked that Yemen cannot be stable if it continues to comprise two warring states and for this reason a formula must be found that would preserve each state's independence while still maintaining some relationship between them.
