But those two examples -- the tip of a deeply submerged iceberg -- are not representative of all the events and their diversity. To set up their own communications, the military could not rely upon the technical, political and economic opportunities that made possible the extraordinary media coverage of recent operations. The military telecommunications system of the year 2010 will not entail the mere transfer of civilian solutions in gestation at France Telecom or in the research laboratories of the major French, European, U.S., or Japanese industries. Civilian telecommunications currently are already displaying typical features of a basically market-oriented development. Areas having heavy population density or generating large volumes of traffic are and increasingly will be emphasized. Investments, too, will be concentrated on the most "profitable" communications services. In contrast, the military has to be able to communicate from everywhere to anywhere and with anyone . They will have to be guaranteed a full-spectrum leading-edge service no matter how heterogeneous the resources rendered operative. Defined in this way, their requirements are too varied to be met fully and directly by off-the-shelf purchasing of such products or civilian systems. Civilian investments, however, are not comparable to those authorized by the armed forces. For this reason, if the military telecommunications system, a meta-system harmoniously and effectively incorporating the "fixed" segment and the "tactical" segments, relies on the humongous technological effort that the telecommunications industry has made, it will incorporate developments appropriate for meeting specific requirements. Future Trap Technological progress will lead to an unprecedented development of data exchanges. An easy way to conjure up tomorrow's telecommunications is based on France Telecom's Eurodisney attraction entitled It's a Small World . In a scaled-down world, the latter displays a host of individuals who spend virtually all their time on the telephone or watching cartoons. Will technology enable everyone at any time to have all the data that one could wish to receive at the risk of no longer being able to choose among the data that will be submitted to that individual? Will the military itself not be overwhelmed by the load of available data and, mesmerized by the data, become incapable of making decisions and taking action? Will the world of telecommunications be the golden age that humanity dreams of or will it be a nightmare? Reduced Distances and Technological Innovation In the near future all transmittable signals will be in digital form. The transfer rates necessary for the different services will be highly varied, going from a few bits per second to tens of megabits per second. The transfer rates needed for different source codings will be heavily dependent on the desired quality. Music coding will be done for transfer rates varying in a ratio of 10. For speech, the ratio will approach 100. For images it will exceed 1,000, including videophone and the high-quality television necessary for productive societies. The transfer rate for data transmissions, in turn, will be limited only by computer memory access times. The rapid escalation of communications capacity will lead to a considerable subjective reduction of distances. A distant correspondent will be as easy to reach as the neighbor down the hall. Optical fiber is now being used in transatlantic cables. The TAT 9 cable that was put into service in 1991 between Europe and the U.S., makes it possible to transmit 560Mbits/s. In 1995, TAT 12 will make it possible to transmit 5 Gbits/s, that is, 60,000 telephone communications. In the laboratory, the National Center for Telecommunications Studies [CNET] is experimenting with a 20 Gbits/s 108 km link. For sure, before the year 2,000, 100 Gbits/s will be realized with multi-color systems, that is, employing several optical wave lengths. Satellites will mainly be used for the broadcasting of images. For data transmission or telephone channels, the increasing congestion of the geostationary orbit and the saturation of the spectrum will increasingly lead to reserving the use of digital telecommunications satellites for covering the oceans and desert areas. Possible development of clusters of low-orbit satellites is not likely to check this trend. It will be difficult to transfer this development into the military sector, nor is it certain that there is a real need to do so. The innovative technologies that will directly interest the military and impact its transmission system will be those being investigated for radio broadcasting and digital radio telephony for mobile units. In effect, the features of the modulation that is used make it possible to counter radio channel distortions. Digital Audio Broadcasting [DAB], undergoing experimentation, will surely be the first application of that technology for digital radio broadcasting. It will therefore be possible on a single transmitter to multiplex six different stereophonic programs and to transmit 1.3 Mbits/s in a 1.5 MHz channel. What is more, all transmitters broadcasting the same group of stations will use the same frequency. That will noticeably reduce the congestion of the spectrum and even do away with the concept of frequency plan. The same principles will soon be applied to television. It will be possible to transmit 5-20 Mbits/s in a current TV channel to fixed or mobile receivers. There too, multiplexing of several programs on a single transmitter will be possible. Even if protection against electronic warfare might restrict the effectiveness of the subsets of a military telecommunications system using such solutions, the interest that such techniques could afford for broadcasting data to forces deployed in theaters of operation can be imagined. Concurrently, mobile radio telephony will continue to develop. Systems like Itineris, based on the GSM [Global System for Mobile Communication] standard, will be supplemented by new systems occupying other frequency bands. Wireless telephones like Bi-Bop will be increasingly used. Wireless local-network and private switches will emerge. Ultimately, short-range links with mobile units will develop around various applications: navigation and traffic control, as with Prometheus, automatic toll collecting, or even detection of stolen vehicles. To be sure, military systems will resort to the same techniques without necessarily realizing the same effectiveness since they will have to be shielded against the occurrence of electronic countermeasures and incorporate data security. Frequency Spectrum Management Frequencies are a very rare commodity. Civilian pressure on the military is already strong and could even intensify since the new market shares that use of frequencies currently allocated to the military represent for civilian operators are quite sizable. Besides the scarcity of military bandwidths, being side-by-side with a very large number of civilian systems and involuntary disturbance phenomena will require the introduction of a very strict management of frequency usage, transmitting powers and a very precise definition of radio equipment features. Forwarding of Data Conceivably, use of rapid packet switching technology or Asynchronous Transfer Mode [ATM], adopted in the combined forces Socrate system, will become widespread. All the data to be transmitted will be submitted in a single fixed-length format that is especially well suited for real-time switching. With the upsurge in data transmissions among computers, the required transfer rates will be increasingly large and sporadic. The very broad heterogeneity of the channels making up the military transmitting system -- optical fibers, satellite links, Hertzian link-ups -- will be even further intensified by the presence of degraded modes during electronic warfare. The switching system capable of optimizing the use of all such transmitting resources will be extremely complex. An increasing amount of transmission channel capacity will be dedicated to management data exchanges. In effect, it will require transmission of all the data needed for operating the services proposed for users and system supervision. In military systems that are simultaneously adaptable, reconfigurable in real time shielded against intrusions, the development of switches will be especially difficult. In fact, the switching system will be a major shared computerized application. Already in Rita, the option made was to make the software more complex in order to facilitate deployment of the system and its operation. This trend will be continued with ease of operation for the user always being the underlying parameter to be emphasized. Civilian Sector Services Standardization of transmission channels combined with increasing software programming is going to lead to a diversification of services. Initially, source coding will be increasingly suited to each application: wide-band sound, video-conferencing image coding, color facsimile coding, etc. A number of those signals could be combined in a transmission channel to create a multimedia service. Subscriber mobility, a service originally offered by the lone tactical system Rita, will become a reality in civilian systems and all military systems. An apparently complete freedom of movement for subscribers will result from the development of Hertzian link-ups. At present, systems having a shorter range like Bi-Bop are surfacing. Micro-cellular system design with a 200 m or less close-in range is emerging. Its short range is offset by the universal availability of terminals for connecting to an optical fiber based wire system. Since users are unaware of the constant changing of their connecting terminal they therefore have a feeling of absolute freedom in their movement and the impression of an unlimited range for their portable telephone. To conjure up the impact that the telecommunications development could have on our lifestyle, let us imagine a Parisian on vacation somewhere in the heartland of France in the year 2,010. His car's on-board computer takes him unswervingly to the sight, described in his travel guide, that he decided to go admire. On the way back to his hotel he decides to take a route through the woods. Covering hardly 100 meters, an alarm points out to him that he is no longer on a listed roadway. A few meters further on, his radio telephone informs him that, without a satellite terminal, he has lost all "civilized" contact and will not be able to be rescued in the event of an accident. What will the effectively developed services be? Will they help improve the quality of life? Those are the real stakes in this impressive technological development. What will the behavior and reactions of the military personnel be, who, in civilian life will be "conditioned" by such an environment? The outlook in this sector continues to be quite difficult! Specifically Military Services In the military systems, the impressive transmission capabilities made possible by the technology will facilitate broadcasting to the lowest command levels, even to the troops, intelligence in the form of texts, sounds, or images. Command systems likewise will be able to receive all the data they will need. In exchange, such systems will have to merge increasing amounts of data. An increasing de-localization of functions will be noticed as well as the emergence of shared weapons systems whose elements, specialized by function, will cooperate for the extent of a mission. Already, during operation Desert Storm, computing the necessary elements for aiming the Patriot missiles was done in the U.S. on the basis of data collected by the various available sensors. Is it to be feared that all decisions will be made by a staff, far removed from ground truth? Be that as it may, telecommunications flexibility will facilitate the development of designs for the employment of forces. But it should never be forgotten that electronic warfare will bare any blind alley or indiscretion made in the design stage and that there is no allowance for error. If the geographic spread of conflicts requires increased interoperability with civilian systems, it will also be necessary to be able to dispense with local infrastructures that have been destroyed or that are in the hands of non-controlled elements. Standardization in the Civilian World In upcoming years, the intense creativity of telecommunications, on the digital signal processing level, equipment or systems and systems and services will engender two opposed movements. First, the proliferation of concepts will lead to the development of mutually incompatible technologies. It will be hard to choose among them. Second, the complexity of the systems will require the new products to adhere to precise standards enabling their introduction into the systems. That holds for equipment as well as services even if the so-called "smart system" structure will ease their introduction by making it possible to export the necessary software in the servers. In the civilian world, the "deregulatory" movement launched in imitation of the U.S., could lead to a diversification of technical options among competing operators. Absent a firm policy aimed at requiring systems interoperability, the result could be a lowering of the quality of service in the eyes of the customers. If the operators are dynamic enough, the emergence of de facto standards will be noticed, as in computers, and, with the interplay of alliances, the establishment of very large transnational groups on the international level. Otherwise, initial commercial failure will delay development. In London, for example, cut-throat competition among four operators caused an initial attempt at introducing a BI-BOP type service to flop while it enjoyed absolute success in Paris. In turn, development of the pan-European GSM radio telephone demonstrates that voluntary awareness by all the economic players of the interoperability problems can lead to a major industrial and commercial success while allowing operators to multiply. Therefore, standardization is an extremely major stake in the future of civilian telecommunications. In military systems the interplay is unquestionably even more complex. To hold down development costs, it has to be able to derive maximum benefit from the investments made in the civilian world while allowing for military specifications: security, confidentiality, shielding against electronic warfare. That is possible only if the military, considered as a minority operator, participates in one form or another in the elaboration of civilian standards. Too frequently, a haphazard selection at the commencement of the standardization process makes it easy or impossible later to adapt the products to military requirements. The basic options, therefore, should be made with an awareness of the case. Unlike what happens in other sectors, in telecommunications, the definition of standards precedes the development of the prototypes. Systems or services conjured up the engineers are specified and then standardized before springing into existence. Except in rare sectors not involving interoperability, innovation no longer can arise from an individual initiative but from a consensus that is all the more difficult to realize because the interests of the different parties are frequently at odds. The ability to persuade, therefore, is becoming an essential quality in engineers, an indispensable supplement to their technical expertise. Telecommunications already have greatly impacted our lifestyle. In the past, the telephone radically altered the relationships among individuals. Presently, the fax is transforming our work style by eliminating the mail carrier's delivery routes and abolishing delays in the transmission of documents. In the future, when the videophone becomes less expensive, it too will alter social behaviors. In the civilian world, development will occur because of a compromise between the disorder stemming from the development of new designs and engineering consistency that is the only thing able to allow different correspondents wishing to communicate to make themselves understood. Development will no longer be limited by engineering possibilities, but rather by the slowness of the standardization process, the investment burden to be amortized or even the difficulty in realizing a threshold of profitability for a new service. Military systems should supply quality services comparable in all respects to those offered by their civilian counterparts. Even more than in the past, those in charge of developing military systems will not tolerate anything less than total availability for the transmissions they will require. Only military systems are designed to completely dispense with the support of local infrastructures. Equipment manufacture in small series and durable in a very hostile environment cannot be compared to unshielded civilian systems. On the other hand, they should be interoperable with them in order to be able to afford the military optimum effectiveness under all circumstances. Military telecommunications have to remain operational in a major conflict. They will benefit from the development of civilian telecommunications but there will be no correspondence between the services offered by civilian telecommunications and the requirements of the military. Therefore, the systems cannot be identical. In this article terminals have been dealt with only through the intermediary of the services. By the year 2,010, what will the user interface look like? In a period of office communications what will the operational modes be that will be deemed ergonomic by the next generation? A further unresolved issue: besides civilian systems, with what others will it have to be interoperable?
