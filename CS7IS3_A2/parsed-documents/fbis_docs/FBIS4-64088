Arms Producers Start Making Laws"] [Excerpts] Russian small-arms exporters, seriously concerned at the threats of a number of European states to take measures in connection with the imminent 100-percent hike in July in customs duties on arms imports to Russia, are looking for a compromise. Oleg Kuzmenko, executive director of the Union of Russian Armorers, advised at the news conference that took place in Izhevsk yesterday that draft decrees are being prepared jointly with the State Committee on the Defense Industry and the government of Udmurtia, suggesting that these duties be brought into line with those of the rest of the world, and at the same time the price of licenses for trade in weapons be increased. [passage omitted] Since the former legal norms regulating the purchasing, keeping, trade in and manufacture of sporting and hunting arms have been abolished, and new ones have not been put in place yet, the next draft law proposed by the armorers relates precisely to these matters. In particular, it sets the price of a license for trade in weapons at 400 minimal salaries, that of a buyer's license at 0.5 percent of the minimum salary, that of a license for keeping a weapon at 0.04 percent, and that of the license for the production of weapons at 0.1 percent of the minimum salary. That puts some constraints on traders in imported weapons on the home market. Mr. Kuzmenko is confident that following the conference in Izhevsk chaired by Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister of the Russian Government, who supported the armorers' proposals, they could be adopted by the Russian Government as early as this month. KOMMERSANT-DAILY observers point out that the position of Russian armorers has been significantly determined by their success in March at the international fire-arms show at Nuremberg where some of the articles fetched preliminary orders for twice the quantities than the producers could supply. In this connection the alluring prospect of stepping up their arms export made the armorers speak against the introduction of high customs duties.
