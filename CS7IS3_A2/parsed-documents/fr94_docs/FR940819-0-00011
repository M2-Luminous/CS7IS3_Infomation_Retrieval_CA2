ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: A special local regulation is being adopted for the We Love Erie Days Fireworks display. This event will be held on Lake Erie, Erie Harbor, Erie, PA on August 21, 1994. Due to the large number of spectator vessels and the falling ash and debris from the fireworks display, this regulation is needed to provide for the safety of life, limb, and property on navigable waters during the event. This regulation will restrict general navigation on Lake Erie, Erie Harbor, Erie, PA. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective from 9 p.m. (EDST) until 11 p.m. (EDST) on August 21, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth Coast Guard District, until July 15, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish a proposed rule in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are Scott J. Smith, Lieutenant Junior Grade, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Officer, Aids to Navigation & Waterways Management Branch and Karen E. Lloyd, Lieutenant, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Attorney, Ninth Coast Guard District Legal Office.

This regulation will restrict general navigation on Lake Erie, Erie Harbor, in a 300 foot circular zone, surrounding the Erie Sand and Gravel Pier. This event will have an unusually large concentration of spectator vessels and falling ash and debris, which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. This regulation is necessary to ensure the protection of life, limb, and property on navigable waters during this event. Any vessels desiring to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander (Officer in Charge, U.S. Coast Guard Station Erie, PA).
