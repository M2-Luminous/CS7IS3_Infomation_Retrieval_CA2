In San Pedro Prison about 40 percent of the minor prisoners there have been accused of consumption of or trafficking in drugs. About 26 percent of the prison population in Bolivia were charged with narcotics trafficking and sent to prison under the provisions of Law 1008, according to data from the National Institute of Statistics [INE]. The data points out that in Bolivia a total of 4,197 prisoners were listed as being held up to the end of July 1993, of whom 3,653 were men and 544 were women. The data show that the incidence of the crime of narcotics trafficking is higher among women than among men. Women According to a research study conducted by the INE and the Ministry of the Interior, about 40 percent of the prison population has been accused of committing narcotics trafficking crimes, while the proportion of male prisoners so charged is lower: about 23 percent of male prisoners are being held for this reason. Nevertheless, the information indicates that men are far ahead in committing this kind of crime. Out of seven foreign nationals held in Bolivian prisons, one is a woman. Small Fish Jerjes Justiniano, a member of the Chamber of Deputies and of the Committee on Human Rights, an organization attempting to amend Law 1008, has said: "Law 1008 has succeeded in sending to prison many persons accused of narcotics trafficking. In reality, these people are `small fish' or, as has been seen in the case of minor prisoners, are drug consumers. They need treatment instead of being sent to prison." The Committee on Human Rights has evidence of arrests on the basis of Law 1008 in which legal procedures were not fully complied with and of prisoners who, during their detention in jail on charges of being narcotics traffickers, were tortured. Minors Held for Narcotics Trafficking The problem of narcotics trafficking among minor prisoners held in La Paz affects a substantial percentage of them, although this is not the most important cause of imprisonment, according to information obtained at San Pedro Prison. Out of a total of 128 minors under detention at that prison, about 40 percent are there for narcotics trafficking crimes. Law 1008, criticized by some members of the National Congress for its harshness, has particularly affected minors held in prison who have no access to legal defense or any possibility of release on bail, because they have been accused of "narcotics trafficking." In many cases the charge that they are "narcotics traffickers" has been made because of the company which they kept. However, as we showed in a report published last week, the most serious problem facing these young people in prison is that they live with an adult group of criminals, under crowded conditions, learning some of their vices and exposed to sexual abuse, violence, and labor exploitation, according to Adalid Viscarra, director of the care of youth in San Pedro Prison.
