Khatsukov, head of the Kabardino-Balkaria Republic Radio and Television Broadcasting Center: "A Message to the Republic's Radio Listeners"] [Text] The economic difficulties currently being experienced by every enterprise, both in Russia and in our republic, unfortunately extend to radio and television as well. Thus due to a lack of funds to pay for electricity, the numerous taxes levied by Russia and the republic and the technical upkeep of television and radio broadcasting equipment or to pay salaries to our employees, as of 1 April 1994 two radio broadcasting stations in the medium-frequency band which carry the programming of Mayak, Radio Rossiya and local Kabardino-Balkaria Radio programming will go off the air. It is not by choice that we are shutting down these two energy-intensive radio transmitters, but rather for the purpose of maintaining broadcasts of television programs within the territory of our republic and maintaining broadcasts of the aforementioned radio programming in the ultra-shortwave band, since during the first quarter of 1994 the Republic Radio and Television Broadcasting Center received only about 10 percent of the requisite funding via television and radio companies from the Russian budget, which is its sole source of funding. Nor is the Russian Government currently promising to resolve the matter of funding for the radio broadcasting companies that carry television and radio broadcasts throughout all of Russia, including our republic. In consideration of the fact that many radio listeners do not own receivers capable of receiving the ultra-shortwave band, temporarily, until such time as the current economic difficulties stabilize, broadcasting of Kabardino-Balkaria Radio programming will continue in the medium-frequency band, with one station operating at a lower power level. Therefore reception of the programming in question will be possible in the city of Nalchik and in nearby towns if an external antenna is used. For high-quality reception of central and local radio broadcasts listeners must have a radio receiver that operates in the ultra-shortwave band. These are available in stores. We will be emphasizing this band as we develop our radio broadcasting efforts. Toward that end, despite economic difficulties the staff members of the republic radio and television broadcasting center are themselves presently installing a new four-channel Dozhd-4 radio transmitter that will operate in the ultra-shortwave band. This transmitted will be located in Nalchik and will replace a Dozhd-2 transmitter. When this four-channel transmitter goes on air on 1 July 1994, full central programming will be available over three channels: Channel One, Mayak and Radio Rossiya. The fourth channel will be reserved for our own republic programming. This will be the first time since its establishment that Kabardino-Balkaria Radio will have its own independent channel. At the present time the creative staff of Kabardino-Balkaria Television and Radio Broadcasting are looking for ways to increase their own air time.
