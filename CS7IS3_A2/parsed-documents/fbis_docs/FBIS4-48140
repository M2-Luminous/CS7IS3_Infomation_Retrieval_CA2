He asked him if he would be in favor of sending foreign troops to Rwanda: [Begin Kagame recording, in English with superimposed French translation] We are not bothered about their number; what concerns us is their role. We have no problem whatsoever with troops being sent here under the aegis of the United Nations or any other entity if the intention is to provide humanitarian assistance. On the other hand, we don't agree with what some call an intervention force. Given the fact that the genocide has already taken place with complete impunity, we don't understand what the role of an intervention force would be. An intervention force would be inappropriate in the current circumstances. Such a force would in fact protect those who are responsible for the genocide. [end recording]
