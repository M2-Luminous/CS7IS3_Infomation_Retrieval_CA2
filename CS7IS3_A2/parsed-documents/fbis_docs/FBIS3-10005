Authorities confirmed that right now 141,000 persons are self-employed. Granma, the official newspaper, has said "this is not a new situation." The newspaper affirms that it has been necessary to assign certain tasks to private individuals in every age. According to GRANMA, under normal economic conditions, this type of work does not have to be associated with the acquisition of wealth or negative things, like deviating resources or involvement with the black market as occurs now. A new law approved in September 1993 authorized independent work and expanded the number of jobs Cubans can perform independently under the supervision of the state and after paying a fee to almost 150. According to a government source consulted by DPA, Cuban authorities are working on a document which will regulate violations of the Independent Work Law. It will upgrade official controls and in this way violations or alterations of the law will be avoided. Since the law was approved, many vendors of artisan products and food have emerged, especially around businesses with services that are paid for in dollars. The most amazing services, such as bicycle parking lots, are being offered. Restaurants, coffee shops, and discotheques, whose services are invariably paid for in dollars, have also opened. A clandestine restaurant of the type popularly known as "Paladares", which had been functioning in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado for months was closed recently by the police. They raided the site and detained the owner for a few hours. This is reportedly the first public case of a clandestine restaurant being closed by authorities after a state radio station warned that these establishments would be closed as of January.
