Speaking at a news conference devoted to the results of his visit to the United States in New york City on Monday, Kravchuk said that "when ukraine gets rid of the last nuclear missile, its economy will be freed from the heavy burden and the republic will be able to step up the process of reform." "We realise that the West links nuclear weapons with assistance to reform programmes. But I would like to say that the process of freeing oneself from nuclear weapons is not directly connected with the process of reform. When discussing this question, we proceed from the possibility of providing us with security guarantees. If the economic situation continues to worsen, it will be harder for us to carry out the processes which we have pledged to carry out. This is true not only of nuclear weapons, but also of the country's debt," Kravchuk said. "It should be understood that in conditions of economic chaos it is extremely hard to fulfil one's obligations. Ukraine is not trying to play a `nuclear card.' We are speaking about absolutely logical facts which should be taken into consideration. The first trainload of nuclear warheads has already arrived in Russia. Ukraine is adherent to the three-party accords signed in Moscow. But it must be helped in carrying out the process of nuclear disarmament, not hampered," the Ukrainian leader said.
