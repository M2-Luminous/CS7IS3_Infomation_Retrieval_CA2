High-speed trains serving the south and west of the country were hit, with one train in three running between Paris, Lyon and Marseille, and one train in two working Atlantic routes. But the high-speed service linking Paris with Lille in the north was not affected. Regular mainline services were also severely hit in the western, south-western and south-eastern regions, but operated normally in the north and east. Suburban Paris services were cut by a third or a half. Railway workers are protesting plans by the state-owned SNCF rail company to cut 5,900 jobs in 1994, after doing away with 6,000 jobs in the previous year. The strikers, who began their action Tuesday night, go back to work on Thursday morning.
