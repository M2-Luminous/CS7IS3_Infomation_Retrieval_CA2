Mr. Wei pointed out that some factors would have an effect on export growth in foreign trade this year. First, the shortage of capital places foreign trade enterprises in a difficult position while they will also find it rather difficult in obtaining loans from banks. Capital for the purchasing of export commodities is inadequate. Second, domestic prices are going upwards leading to a rise in prices for export commodities, a phenomenon also affecting overseas businessmen's confidence in China's commodities. Third, the world economy is seeing a slump and the overseas market is not brisk. Following the release of rights to foreign trade to a lower level since last year, according to Mr. Wei, relevant work has been done in the wake of necessary adjustments during the past year. Banks have also tried their best to lend support to such trade. China is ready to set up import and export banks which will be advantageous to the foreign trade target set for this year. The most difficult period in the course of the restructuring of the foreign trade system is something of the past, Mr. Wei said. The new problem, according to Mr. Wei, mainly lies in the exploitation of a diversified market in a bid to let foreign trade enterprises develop into large groups as well as preventing the drainage of talented personnel from this sector.
