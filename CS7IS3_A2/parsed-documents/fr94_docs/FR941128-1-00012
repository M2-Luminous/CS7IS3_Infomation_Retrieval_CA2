FR941128-1-00012 FR941128-1-00001 §130.500 Funding. [Reserved] §130.510 Transfer of funds. (a) All SBDC Cooperative Agreements will be funded through the SBA internal ``Letter of Credit Replacement System'' (LORS), formerly administered under the Department of Treasury's Letter of Credit (LOC) system. The Standard Forms 1193A and 1194 will be used to establish and modify letters of credit. (b) SBDCs shall utilize the Standard Form 5805 in order to draw down funds. It is critical that recipients ``draw down'' only those funds required to meet their estimated or actual expenses. The frequency of drawdowns and the amount of the cash-on-hand balance are monitored by examining the Standard Form 272 (Federal Cash Transactions Report), submitted quarterly by the recipient. Repeated drawdowns in excess of immediate cash needs may result in the cancellation of the LOC. In the event any interest results from the deposit of any drawdowns in an interest-bearing account, SBDCs, other than state government sponsored SBDCs, must report and return such interest annually to the SBA. §130.600 Cooperative Agreement. [Reserved] §130.610 General Terms. (a) Upon approval of the initial or renewal application, the recipient organization and the SBA shall enter into a Cooperative Agreement. The Cooperative Agreement shall set forth the programmatic and fiscal responsibilities of the recipient organization and the SBA, and describe the scope of the project to be funded as well as the budget of the program year covered by the Cooperative Agreement. (b) Principles for determining applicable administrative requirements are contained in the following OMB Circulars and are applicable to the Cooperative Agreement: A&hyph;110 (for programs administered by educational institutions and nonprofit organizations) and A&hyph;102 (for programs administered by State and local governments). §130.620 Revisions and amendments to Cooperative Agreement. (a) Requested revisions . A revision to the Cooperative Agreement may be requested in writing by the recipient organization at any time during the Agreement period. These revisions will normally relate to changes in the scope, work or funding during the specified budget year. Any request for revision must be submitted on an SF&hyph;424 ``Application for Federal Assistance,'' signed by the recipient organization's ``authorized representative,'' and include a revised budget and budget narrative, if applicable. Any revision to the Cooperative Agreement must be mutually agreed upon by the recipient organization and the responsible SBA district office and be approved by the AA/SBDCs. All procedures for revisions must conform to the requirements of the applicable OMB Circular ( See §130.620 (b) and (c)). (b) Revisions which require amendment to Cooperative Agreement . The Cooperative Agreement under the section entitled ``Prior Approval'' shall list the proposed actions which require Project Officer concurrence, approval of the AA/SBDCs and amendment of the Cooperative Agreement. No application for an amendment submitted after the Cooperative Agreement has been issued shall be effective until it is approved and incorporated into the Cooperative Agreement. Revisions which require amendments shall include: (1) Any change in project scope or objectives; (2) The addition or deletion of any subgrants or contracts; (3) The addition of any new budget line items; (4) Budget revisions and fund reallocations which exceed the limitations established by applicable administrative regulations or OMB Circulars, either individually or in the aggregate with other such revisions or allocations; (5) Any proposed sole-source or one-bid contracts exceeding the limits established by applicable regulations or OMB Circulars; and (6) The carryover from one Budget period to the next Budget period of unobligated, unexpended SBA funds allocable under the Cooperative Agreement to nonrecurring, nonservable bona fide needs of the SBDC network as provided in the applicable OMB Circular and the Annual Program announcement. (c) Revisions which do not require amendments to Cooperative Agreement _(1) Budget revisions. Revision may be requested by the recipient organization at any time and requires approval of the SBA Project Officer in the SBA district office and the AA/SBDCs as prescribed by OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment J, or 13 CFR 143.30. (2) Reallocation of funds. Reallocation of fund shall be conducted in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment J, or 13 CFR 143.30.

(a) Any recipient organization that wishes to resolve a Dispute concerning one or more elements of its Cooperative Agreement must submit a written statement describing the subject of the Dispute, together with any relevant documents or other evidence bearing on such Dispute, to the Grants Management Specialist, with a copy of such statement and accompanying evidence being sent to the Project Officer. The Grants Management Specialist shall respond in writing to the recipient organization concerning such Dispute within 30 calendar days of receipt of the descriptive statement. (b) The procedures thereafter shall be as follows: (1) If the recipient organization receives an unfavorable decision regarding the Dispute from the Grants Management Specialist, the recipient organization will have 30 calendar days during which to file an appeal with the AA/SBDCs. The AA/SBDCs shall respond in writing to the recipient organization concerning such Dispute within 15 calendar days of receipt of the appeal. (2) If the recipient organization receives an unfavorable decision regarding the appeal from the AA/SBDCs, the recipient organization may make a final appeal to the SBA Grants and Cooperative Agreements Appeals Committee (the ``Committee''). The appeal must be received by the Chairman of the Committee within 30 calendar days of the date of issuance of the AA/SBDCs' written decision. All appeals shall be sent to the following address: SBA Grants and Cooperative Agreements Appeals Committee, 409 3rd Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20416. Copies of the appeal shall also be sent to the Grants Management Specialist and the Project Officer. (3) There shall not be any prescribed form for submission of an appeal. Formal briefs and other technical forms of pleading shall not be required. However, all appeals must be in writing and should be concise and logically arranged. Appeals are required to contain at least the following: (i) Name and address of the recipient organization; (ii) Identify of the SBA office/program and the Cooperative Agreement/Grant; (iii) A statement of the grounds for appeal, with reasons why the appeal should be sustained; (iv) A request for the specific relief desired on appeal; and (v) A statement as to whether or not a hearing is requested, and if requested, the reasons why a hearing would materially assist in resolving the Dispute. Requests for hearing will not usually be granted unless significant material facts are substantially in dispute. (4) The AA/SBDCs or the Committee shall have the right to request from the SBDC or the district office additional information or documentation not previously furnished to the Grants Management Specialist.
