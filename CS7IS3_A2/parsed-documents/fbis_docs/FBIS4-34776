An Information Ministry communique released today indicates that media representatives will have to obtain special authorization to move outside Port-au-Prince. With this decision, the "de facto" government led by Judge Emile Jonassaint is attempting to limit the movement of journalists in Haiti. On 17 June, the Information Ministry disclosed a decree in which it bans the presence of unauthorized people at military installations, on the coasts, along the border with the Dominican Republic, and other "strategic areas." The "de facto" government also urged the owners of hotels nationwide to inform the police within a 24-hour period of the identity of foreigners staying at their facilities in order to maintain a record of new arrivals to the country in light of a possible foreign invasion. The Haitian People Armed Revolutionary Front -- known as the Front for Haiti's Advance and Progress until 21 June -- suspended the general strike called for tomorrow. The strike was called to protest U.S. policy toward Haiti.
