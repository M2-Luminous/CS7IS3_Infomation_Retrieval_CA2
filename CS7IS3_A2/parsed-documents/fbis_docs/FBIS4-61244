As everybody knows, there has never been such a council in the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. Opening the session, [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Mechyslaw Ivanavich Hryb noted that the Supreme Soviet has not paid enough attention to economic issues, saying that this has been a sort of negligence. [Begin Hryb recording] The three years of reforms have not brought about the desired results. I would rather the contrary: The Belarusian economy is currently in a deep crisis. Although the strategy of conducting market reforms in Belarus depends, to a certain degree, not only on internal, but also external factors, responsibility falls on the government as well as the Supreme Soviet. Time has shown that the Legislative Branch can do nothing but deal with this extremely important problem. Legislative acts concerning the economy, which have been adopted by the Supreme Soviet, require the most amount of independent study. Also needed are broad consultations on these problems. We should reexamine the course of socioeconomic reforms and the social situation in Belarus. It is vital to find a way out of the current situation. Examining and resolving current problems should become the main goal of our Economic Council. It is essential for the Supreme Soviet to know the opinions of highly qualified specialists on prospects for the development of our economy. We understand that it is virtually impossible to alleviate the predicament without concentrating on our intellectual potential. Therefore, it has been decided to establish the Economic Council. We have managed...[Hryb pauses] We should also create a more operative body which would examine the issues of economic development, present to the legislative, and possibly executive authorities, specific proposals on ways of resolving economic issues, predicting results of various phenomena, etc. Such a structure, however, is more adequate for the presidential office. Nevertheless, I believe that we cannot, and we do not need to do this until the first president deals with this issue. We must not waste our time. We have already wasted a lot of it. Our first request to you is to present your opinion on existing legislation of the Republic of Belarus, which concerns economic issues. [end recording] The Economic Council comprises scientists, economists, and managers of industrial enterprises, joint ventures, and joint stock companies, as well as firms and banks. Thus, the council has united professionals who are supposed to work out a concept for overcoming the economic crisis in Belarus. [passage omitted]
