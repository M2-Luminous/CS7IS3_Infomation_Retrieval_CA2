President de Klerk said at Postmasburg in the northern Cape that room has been created for Gen. Viljoen's strategic volkstaat [homeland] option. According to the state president, Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg was engaging in petty party politics by rejecting the latest constitutional proposals. President de Klerk had earlier said that he was prepared to testify before the Independent Electoral Commission on intimidation after another one of his meetings at Postdene, just outside Postmasburg, was disrupted. He said several cases of intimidation with the relevant evidence have already been presented by the National Party to the commission, and it has been said that such evidence was too vague. President de Klerk said that today he had been an eyewitness of intimidation in which people had apparently been provided with official ANC [African National Congress] flags, banners, and placards. The state president has canceled this evening's planned visit to (Agaleshuwe) just outside Kimberly. He said the move is aimed at his supporters' safety in the township as two vehicles have already been reported burned.
