In the midst of growing tension in coca producing areas, legislators have again questioned official antinarcotics policies that emphasize repression as the main tool to fight trafficking. This is being blamed for the tension in Chapare. "The results speak for themselves. The volumes of drugs introduced into the United States have increased and consumption has expanded during the years these policies have been in effect. This reality has forced Bill Clinton's administration to conclude that the drug problem in their country is a problem of education and health," Ferrufino said. The legislator recognized that surplus coca plantations are linked to poverty and unemployment. The peasants have seen in that crop their only possibility for survival at a time of growing unemployment. "If the United Nations understood and accepted the U.S. installation of radars to control the entry of drugs in its territory, why would the United States not accept that Bolivia wants to seek its own solution to the problem instead of continuing to implement a failure?" Ferrufino said. [passage omitted]
