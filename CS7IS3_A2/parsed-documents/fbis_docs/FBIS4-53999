But it was only two items for which relevant government offices decided to "take action" for deregulation. This was disclosed in a report compiled by a working group of the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters [ARPH] (headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata) for the government, which is currently engaged in the task of compiling a package of deregulation measures before the end of June. The group gathered opinions of ministries and agencies concerned on the private sector's deregulation package and included them in the report. At a meeting with Prime Minister Hata on 13 May, Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations] Vice Chairman Isao Nakauchi (chairman of supermarket giant Daiei) strongly demanded promotion of deregulation. He is an influential member of the ARPH's "import promotion, improvement of market access, and distribution" working group. It seems that behind his strong demand lies the apathy of government offices to deregulation. His demand also suggests bureaucrats' strong resistance to deregulation. The report compiled by the working group summarizes opinions of relevant ministries and agencies on the private sector's package of proposals for deregulation of 71 items. In the report, these items are classified into three groups -- one for which "actions will be taken in line with proposals," one for which "taking action will be considered," and the other for which "no action will be taken because the proposals are based on misunderstandings." Of the 71 items, only two fall into the first group. They are "shortening the term for granting a license for food businesses" and "easing regulations on foreign capital inflow into the first-class telecommunications business." Twenty-nine items, including "simplifying procedures for obtaining a license for dealing in antiques," fall into the second group; 25 items, including "allowing the establishment of holding companies" and "introducing a self-service system in service stations," are in the third group. Another 15 items are considered a group for which "actions have already been taken." At a meeting on 12 May, working group experts, including Nakauchi, severely criticized response of the government offices to the proposals. On 18 May, Nakauchi submitted a letter to government offices complaining against their reluctance to deregulation. In the letter, he said: "Although deregulation is urged by the people and other countries, government offices' attitude of trying to protect their authority remains unchanged. This is very regrettable."
