This alarming situation calls for active steps on the part of Russia. The statement says Russia believes it necessary for the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution with a view to ensure security in that region of the world. The idea of international protection for civilians merits the most serious consideration; this protection could be carried out by independent observers on the West bank of the river Jordan and in the Gaza strip. A new international impetus is needed for the cause of reconciliation between the Arabs and the Israelis to proceed further. Russia proposes that a second plenary meeting of the Madrid conference on the Middle East at the foreign minister level should be arranged. Moscow also favors the continuation of bilateral talks at any venue convenient for those taking part. This was a statement from the foreign ministry of the Russian Federation.
