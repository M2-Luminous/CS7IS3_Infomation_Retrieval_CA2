The talks are part of the peace and reconciliation negotiation process taking place at the Cathedral of San Cristobal de las Casas, which is now being called the Cathedral of Peace. Yesterday, Subcommander Marcos, who heads a group of 19 EZLN delegates, said his group will present to Peace Commissioner Camacho Solis its list of demands. Today, Subcommander Marcos affirmed that the dialogue for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas is on the right track. [Begin Subcommander Marcos recording] We want to tell the people of Mexico, as well as tell the peoples and governments of the world -- and we want to tell you, representatives of the national and international media -- that the dialogue is on the right track. We have found people are listening to us, and we have seen a real determination toward achieving a solution. Here, I want to address the concern that has been expressed over our masked faces and our weapons. We do not understand the concern with our faces, because before 1 January [the start of the EZLN rebellion in Chiapas] our faces did not exist for you. The faces of Ramona, Felipe, David, Eduardo, and Ana Maria did not exist for this country on 1 January. Nevertheless, if you want to know whose faces are behind the ski masks, it is very easy -- simply pick up a mirror and look into it. We want to tell you -- and we want to tell those who have told the truth, not those who have followed the path of lies -- that if the killing has indeed stopped, it is thanks to you and the people behind you. We ask, as brothers, that you continue to tell the truth, and, if possible, we ask those of you who have been telling lies to please stop lying. We want you to support this ongoing dialogue. We want you to report plainly what we are saying. What we are saying is the truth. It is not good to seek two interpretations when only one exists. This could bring about more problems in the future. As I explained to you before, we are not carrying weapons out of mistrust for the government but, rather, for fear of those forces whose interests have been affected by our movement. We think that on this second day, after our main demands have been listed -- yes, they have been pondered by the peace commissioner -- we are moving toward seeking avenues that might allow us to reach specific accords. Also, the committee asked me to clearly state the following: It is ready to seek another alternative, if this is possible, and to seek your advice and support in this search for peace -- a peace with dignity -- for which we are hoping.
