Nobuo Ishihara, deputy chief cabinet secretary, told a press conference that working-level officials may hold an emergency meeting on the collapsed trade talks Tuesday [15 February] to prepare for a similar meeting among Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and key cabinet members possibly later in the week. The framework trade talks, aimed at redressing the bilateral trade imbalance, broke down last weekend over a U.S. proposal that "objective criteria" like numerical targets be set to gauge Japan's efforts to open its market to foreign goods and services. Government sources said Hosokawa appears unwilling to hastily restart the framework talks. Rather, they said, the premier wants to fashion a sort of new action program to present to the U.S. in a bid to break the ice on the bilateral negotiations. At a meeting earlier in the day of government and ruling coalition parties, Hosokawa vowed that Japan would make voluntary efforts to bring down its trade surplus with the U.S. before the summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major economic powers in Naples in July. The sources said the forthcoming government meeting on the collapsed framework talks will study such measures as further deregulations to help correct the wide gap between domestic and overseas prices and boost imports, and more voluntary efforts by the private sector to open the market. Asked what Japan will do about bilateral trade with the U.S., Trade Minister Hiroshi Kumagai also said earlier in the day that the government will consider "whatever macro and microeconomic steps Japan should take."
