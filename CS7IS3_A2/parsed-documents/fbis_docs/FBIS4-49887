Tests will be conducted at a reprocessing plant if the DPRK government gives a positive reply or does not raise any objection to the move before the weekend, IAEA Spokesman David Kyd said. IAEA Director General Hans Blix said in a message sent to DPRK Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam on Tuesday that it was crucial for international experts to inspect spent uranium fuel rods at the nuclear reactor when the plant is refueled. Blix also requested the DPRK to send a team of experts to Vienna to discuss measures and a timetable for inspections of the reactor. Last week, an IAEA spokesman said last week that the agency will not send inspectors to the DPRK until the government gives the green light to an overall inspection of its nuclear facilities.
