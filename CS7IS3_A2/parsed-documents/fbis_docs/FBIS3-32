Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-15Mar94-Russia Duma Leadership Brokers Compromise To Amnesty Yeltsin Foes S U M M A R Y Although the vote by the State Duma to amnesty prisoners implicated in the August 1991 coup and the October 1993 Supreme Soviet uprising marks the Duma's most confrontational move against President Boris Yeltsin to date, it was passed as part of a compromise package that somewhat mitigated its anti- presidential thrust. Centrists and moderate reformers supported the amnesty after hardliners gave up a legislative commission that was to have investigated last autumn's constitutional crisis and agreed to accept an additional document defining the amnesty as part of a movement toward national reconciliation. The amnesty vote appears to have weakened Yeltsin politically and has deepened the divisions among reformers, further undermining their ability to fight the anti-Yeltsin opposition in the legislature. END SUMMARY Hardliners in the Duma scored a political victory over Yeltsin when, with the help of centrists and moderate reformers, the Duma adopted on 23 February a package of decrees amnestying prisoners charged in the 1991 coup attempt and the 1993 uprising, including Yeltsin's archenemies Ruslan Khasbulatov and Aleksandr Rutskoy. The Duma had debated but failed to approve a political amnesty several times previously, but proponents scored a breakthrough on 22 February when the Duma's Council put together a "large" compromise package that included decrees on a criminal and political amnesty, a memorandum calling for national accord, and a decree that apparently abolishes a Duma commission established on 9 February to investigate the events of 21 September to 4 October (see box 1) (Radio Rossii, 9 February; Segodnya, 23 February). Legislative hardliners had intended to use the commission to attack Yeltsin by publicly questioning the constitutionality of his edict dissolving the Supreme Soviet. During the Council's session, hardliners reportedly agreed to "act as if the vote on setting up the commission never took place," a choice that reportedly caused considerable anguish among more extreme Yeltsin opponents, who did not want to give up the commission (Segodnya, 23 February; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 26 February). How the Factions Voted The compromise amnesty package passed 252 to 67 (with 28 abstentions)--just 29 votes above the required majority--with the bulk of support coming from hard-line deputies. According to an account by a Communist Party (CPRF) deputy published in Sovetskaya Rossiya (26 February), the CPRF, Agrarian Party, Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), and the hard-line nationalist "Russian Way" group led by Sergey Baburin provided 147 votes for the compromise amnesty package. Some hardliners, however, including nine CPRF deputies and one each from the Agrarian Party and Russian Way, were so intent on retaining the Duma's investigative commission into the September-October crisis that they voted against the final compromise. After a decree abolishing the investigative commission was added to the "large" package, enough centrists and moderate reformers joined in supporting the amnesty compromise to put it over the top. Apparently at the urging of Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES) leader Sergey Shakhray, PRES and the Women of Russia faction, joined by at least some members of the centrist New Regional Policy group, made their support for the amnesty package contingent on the inclusion of a "Memorandum of Accord," essentially a political declaration calling for round table talks on economic and political issues and recommending amnesty as a step toward "national reconciliation" (Interfax, 23 February). Even with the inclusion of the Memorandum of Accord, however, this "small" amnesty package did not have enough support to pass. Only two PRES deputies voted for the "small" package. When the decree abolishing the commission was added to the "large" compromise package, it gained the votes of 16 more PRES deputies (of 24 present to vote). Similarly, 35 deputies from the New Regional Policy group voted for the "small" package, but an additional 12 members voted for the final compromise that abolished the commission. Other centrist deputies voting for the final compromise included all 22 members from Women of Russia and all 14 deputies from the Nikolay Travkin's Democratic Party of Russia faction who were present to vote (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 26 February). The compromise package appears to have deepened divisions among reformers, pitting the pro-Yeltsin Russia's Choice faction against PRES and splitting the moderate reformist Yabloko bloc led by reform economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy. Russia's Choice held together in its opposition to the political amnesty, with only one of its members--Ivan Starikov of Novosibirsk--willing to vote for the final compromise (Moskovskiy Komsomolets, 2 March). However, only 57 of its 75 members were present to vote. Most of the Yavlinskiy bloc--16 of the 22 who were present at the vote- -either abstained or voted against both amnesty packages, but the other six took a strong anti-Yeltsin stand, voting only for the "small" package and against the final compromise (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 26 February). Their position appears related to the stance voiced by some members of the bloc following the October rebellion. (See Note 1) (Note 1) During the election campaign, Vladimir Lukin, a coleader of the Yabloko bloc, advocated a full investigation into the events of 21 September-4 October, though lie acknowledged that extremists in the Supreme Soviet had "started this carnage" and had "brought about dozens of human casualties" (Literaturnaya Gazeta, No. 47, 24 November 1993). Shortly after the election another bloc member, Valeriy Borshchev (of the Christian Democratic Union), expressed the bloc's intention to promote the establishment of a parliamentary commission to conduct the investigation (Segodnya, 23 December 1993). Lukin's support for the commission evidently caused him, as well as other Yabloko deputies Viktor Sheynis and Nikolay Petrakov, to abstain from the vote for the final compromise package (Moskovskiy Komsomolets, 2 March). Background to the Amnesty Issue Since convening, the Duma has debated two kinds of amnesty proposals, one a criminal amnesty aimed at minor offenders and the other a political amnesty for the 1991 coup plotters and participants in the 1993 Supreme Soviet uprising. During the first week of the Duma's session, hard-line deputies made their first move toward securing a political amnesty for their political allies, but their failure to coordinate with the LDPR, which was pressing its own political amnesty proposal, caused the move to fail (ITAR-TASS, 17 January; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 January). Yeltsin revived the amnesty issue when he submitted a proposal for a criminal amnesty "in connection with the adoption of" the constitution (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 January), continuing a Soviet-era tradition of declaring amnesties to mark major holidays and significant political milestones. In retrospect, this move was doubly unfortunate for Yeltsin. His proposal failed to attract support from reformers and gave hardliners another opportunity to raise the issue of a political amnesty. -- On 17 January, Vasiliy Lipitskiy, a close associate of Rutskoy, proposed putting the political amnesty issue on the Duma's agenda, but the motion fell 18 votes short of a majority, reportedly because the LDPR did not back him (ITAR-TASS, 17 January; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 January; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 27 January). At the time, the LDPR was advocating an amnesty that would have freed anyone sentenced on "political or economic charges" after April 1985 and also would have released from jail Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and other participants in the October uprising but placed them under house arrest (Interfax, 31 December 1993; ITAR-TASS, 4 January). -- Yeltsin's proposal, submitted shortly after he signed it on 21 January, quickly ran into trouble. The CPRF and Agrarian Party were unwilling to consider it because it did not amnesty their political allies, and the LDPR stood by its version. Even Russia's Choice--the faction most likely to support the president--was unwilling to back the bill, apparently in an effort to erase public perceptions that it is soft on crime. Faction leader Yegor Gaydar stated that Russia's Choice could not support Yeltsin's initiative because "we are very doubtful about the provisions . . . which reduce punishments for serious criminal offenses" and pointedly drew attention to the "existing criminal situation in the country" (ITAR-TASS, 21 January, 7 February). In a further indication of trouble for Yeltsin, his proposal was assigned to the Committee for Legislation, Judicial, and Legal Reform, headed by Vladimir Isakov--a staunch Yeltsin foe from the Agrarian Party (ITAR-TASS, 24 January). -- The amnesty issue was scheduled to come up for debate in the Duma's 4 February plenary session, but the Duma's Council postponed the debate, probably in recognition that none of the competing proposals would win a majority (Interfax, Segodnya, 3 February). According to the Duma's First Deputy Chairman Mikhail Mityukov (Russia's Choice), the Council postponed debate because "certain factions" wanted to "play the amnesty card for political purposes" (Izvestiya, 5 February). By that time, Isakov's committee had drafted its own decree to amnesty the participants in the 1991 coup attempt and the October uprising (Segodnya, 4 February). -- By mid-February, elements of the final compromise began to emerge as the Duma agreed to examine both Yeltsin's criminal amnesty proposal and an apparently revised LDPR political amnesty proposal. The Duma took no direct action on Yeltsin's criminal amnesty proposal during its 16 February debate, possibly because the debate made it clear that it lacked majority support (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Kommersant-Daily, 17 February). The Duma then decided to consider separately two draft decrees--Yeltsin's on a criminal amnesty and an LDPR proposal on an economic and political amnesty (Interfax, ITAR-TASS, 16 February). More ominously for Yeltsin, the PRES and Women of Russia factions offered conditional backing for the political amnesty, reportedly insisting on "circulating" a "clarification document" --evidently a reference to the Memorandum of Accord that the Duma later adopted in the final compromise package--making it clear that the factions supported the amnesty as a step toward "national reconciliation" and not simply for the sake of freeing Rutskoy and Khasbulatov (Segodnya, 16 February). On 17 February the LDPR's political amnesty proposal fell 23 votes short of adoption and was sent back to committee for "improvement," this time going to the security committee, headed by Yeltsin foe Viktor Ilyukhin (CPRF), as well as to Isakov's legislation committee (Interfax, ITAR-TASS, 17 February). Disarray in the Yeltsin Camp The varied responses from Yeltsin's advisers to the Duma's passage of the amnesty suggest that the event caught them unprepared, even though the approval of the compromise package by the Duma's Council on 22 February should have given them some warning of its improved prospects. (See Note 2) National Security Adviser Yuriy Baturin opted for a confrontational stance, arguing that the amnesty was unconstitutional because it was in fact a pardon, which is a presidential prerogative (ITAR- TASS, 24 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 February). By contrast, Aleksandr M. Yakovlev, Yeltsin's official representative to the legislature, responded in sanguine fashion, contending that the amnesty was "completely in keeping with the constitution from a judicial point of view" (Russian TV, 24 February). Georgiy Satarov, a Yeltsin adviser on legislative relations, did not weigh in until two days after the vote, when he indicated that Yeltsin was preparing a "calm and businesslike letter" asking the Duma to reconsider its stance (Interfax, Moscow radio, Ostankino TV, 25 February). (Note 2) Much of the disarray in the Yeltsin camp may be attributed to the absence of presidential Administration Leader Sergey Filatov, who was apparently in Switzerland at the time (ITAR-TASS, 27 February). Yakovlev, Satarov, and Baturin are all relatively new to the Yeltsin team, and their inexperience may have contributed to their uncoordinated response (For more on Yeltsin's advisers, see the Trends of 9 March 1994, pages 4-12). Yeltsin himself responded too late to postpone or block implementation of the political amnesty. On 26 February he sent a letter to Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, drawing upon Baturin's line of argument and reportedly asserting that the deputies had confused the constitutional principles of amnesty and pardon. The letter urged the Duma to "improve" the decree to bring it in line with the constitution. Yeltsin also proposed that the Duma adopt a "system of criteria" defining the responsibility of state institutions and politicians "for decisions [that] hamper our joint policy towards national reconciliation, civil peace, and accord"--evidently an attempt to impress upon the Duma its accountability for the actions of individuals released under the amnesty (ITAR-TASS, 26 February). Satarov reportedly delivered Yeltsin's letter to Rybkin on the afternoon of 26 February, when Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and other prisoners arrested after the October uprising were already walking out of Lefortovo prison (see box 2) (ITAR-TASS, 26 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Izvestiya, 1 March). After the futile letter to Rybkin, Yeltsin appeared to waver between taking a confrontational approach and trying to defuse political tensions. At first he was confrontational, with S,,atarov announcing on 28 February that Yeltsin was preparing certain actions aimed at defending the democratic state and society" (Russian TV, 28 February). Satarov's comments and others by Baturin and presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov fueled speculation that Yeltsin would address the country that night in a special televised appeal (ITAR-TASS, 28 February). Nezavisimaya Gazeta's Ivan Rodin reported (2 March) that Yeltsin was to have announced on television an edict that, while not containing "any specific tough measures," nonetheless brandished a "menacing" tone. Rodin also suggested, however, that threatening a tough presidential response may have been a deliberate tactic to bring pressure on Rybkin before a meeting held the same day between Yeltsin's advisers--including the newly returned Head of Administration Sergey Filatov--and Rybkin. Rybkin and Filatov reportedly discussed ways to improve "interaction" between the two branches, paving the way for Yeltsin to meet with Rybkin the following day (ITAR-TASS, 28 February). After his meeting with Rybkin, Yeltsin appears to have adopted a position of accepting the amnesty and placing the burden of responsibility for it--and for the actions of the released prisoners--squarely on the Duma. At their 1 March meeting, Rybkin reportedly promised Yeltsin that the Duma would "ensure a more balanced approach" when adopting decrees likely to have "serious political and moral consequences" (ITAR-TASS, 1 March). Yeltsin apparently also extracted a pledge from Rybkin that he would urge the Duma "probably in the near future" to adopt a memorandum on the "responsibility of state institutions and politicians for preserving civic calm in Russia" (Moscow radio, 1 March). In return, Yeltsin assured Rybkin that he had opted against "immediate tough measures," but he warned that he would not tolerate misbehavior by his amnestied foes, saying: "Should the slightest attempt be made at destabilizing the situation in the country, [the amnestied prisoners] will be arrested straight after" (ITAR-TASS, 1 March). As a result of the initial confused reaction by his advisers and the conflicting signals about his course of action, Yeltsin appears to have lost political stature in the aftermath of the amnesty vote. His acceptance of the amnesty conflicts with his repeated assertions--most recently stated at the 4 March Government meeting--that the Duma's amnesty is unconstitutional (Moscow radio, 4 March). In an effort to counter press accounts of executive disarray (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Izvestiya, 1 March) as well as criticism of his handling of the amnesty by Russia's Choice members (Izvestiya, 3 March), Yeltsin apparently saw the need to verbally assert his presidential authority after meeting with Rybkin: "I . . . am in full control of the social and political situation" (ITAR-TASS, 1 March). Implications The Duma's successful passage of a political amnesty suggests that Yeltsin and his team of advisers have learned little since the confrontation with the old Supreme Soviet about how to manage relations with the legislative branch, much less to effectively advance a presidential agenda. By contrast, the Duma has again demonstrated its ability to compromise effectively on issues it considers important, with the Duma Council apparently playing a key role. By postponing debate when it recognized that the Duma lacked consensus on the issue and brokering the final key compromise, the Duma's leadership demonstrated a knack for managing the legislative process. Rybkin personally appears to have emerged from the amnesty vote with enhanced political stature. His meetings with Filatov and Yeltsin and pledges to improve legislative-executive coordination suggest the makings of an effective political player, at least for as long as his Communist-Agrarian colleagues are willing to back such conciliatory politics and allow Rybkin to deliver on his pledges. Box 1 The "Large" Compromise Package Resorting to the kind of package compromise that has worked for the Duma in the past,* deputies voted on a total of five documents, all of which came into effect after their publication in Rossiyskaya Gazeta on 26 February. The decree overturning the Duma's investigative commission into the October crisis was not included in an earlier "small" package that failed to pass: -- "On Declaring an Amnesty in Connection With the Adoption of the Russian Federation Constitution." This decree, based largely on the draft amnesty bill that Yeltsin submitted to parliament (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 January), amnesties criminals convicted of minor offenses as well as certain groups of offenders, such as women and invalids. According to Minister of Internal Affairs Viktor Yerin, the criminal amnesty affects "less than 10 percent" of convicted criminals, and another MVD general put the number at about 20,000 (Argumenty i Fakty No. 6, February; Pravda, 26 February). -- Decree outlining the procedures for implementing the above decree. -- "On Declaring a Political and Economic Amnesty." This document--the one opposed most bitterly by Yeltsin supporters- -specifically terminates legal proceedings against the 1991 coup plotters and hardliners arrested after the violent 1 May demonstrations in Moscow and the October 1993 Supreme Soviet uprising and stipulates that their release from prison take place "immediately." In an apparent effort to gain the support of some reformers and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), it also amnesties criminals sentenced for various Soviet-era economic crimes. -- "On the Adoption of the Memorandum of Accord." This decree formally approves the "Memorandum of Accord" put forward by PRES, the Women of Russia, and the New Regional Policy factions calling upon the legislative and executive branches to consider "jointly" problems presented by "political, economic, and social reforms in society" and urging authorities to wage their "political struggle within a legal framework." The memorandum also suggested that a political amnesty could serve as an "integral part" of the process toward "national accord." Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin has repeatedly called this memorandum the most important document of the package (Pravda, 1 March; Komsomolskaya Pravda, 2 March). "On Overturning a Decree of the State Duma." This decree reportedly over turns the 9 February decision of the Duma to set up a commission to investigate the events of 21 September-4 October, although its wording is somewhat ambiguous. It annuls a 16 February decree on the "composition" of the commission, leaving open the possibility that the commission has not formally been disbanded. *See the Trends of 9 February 1994, pages 15-25. End Box 1 Box 2 Prosecutor Protests Yeltsin Pressure on Amnesty Judging by comments made after the prisoners' release, both the Yeltsin team and Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin were counting on Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik to block or delay implementation of the amnesty. Kazannik's office reportedly made an "inquiry" to the Duma about certain provisions in the amnesty, and Rybkin indicated in his meeting with Satarov on 26 February that the Duma's legislation and security committees were responding to the inquiry and that no prisoners would be released until the questions were cleared up (ITAR-TASS, 26 February). At a meeting of parliamentary officials on 28 February, Rybkin charged that the prosecutor's office acted on the amnesty with undue haste" and without waiting for a response to its questions (Interfax, Radio Rossii, 28 February). He later appeared to change his story somewhat--possibly in an attempt to deflect blame from the security and legislation committees--when he contended that the committees had "clarified every point" of Kazannik's inquiry by 26 February (Pravda, 1 March). Yeltsin reportedly tried to pressure Kazannik to delay implementing the amnesty, but Kazannik, while declaring his distaste for the amnesty, said that he had no legal authority to block it and resigned rather than submit to Yeltsin's pressure. Kazannik had implicitly warned Yeltsin that he would not bow to political pressures over the amnesty issue when he stated that his office does not give "political assessments" to various laws but only ensures their "lawfulness and strict fulfillment" (ITAR- TASS, 24 February). In his resignation statement, Kazannik charged that Yeltsin had appealed to him to "suspend" the amnesty process, and though he indicated that he personally agreed with the "civic attitude" of Yeltsin's appeal, he made clear his professional and political independence: "The prosecutor in Russia does not have the authority to suspend an amnesty act [or] to appeal to the State Duma for a resolution to be reconsidered" (ITAR-TASS, 26 February). Despite his refusal to delay implementing the amnesty, Kazannik appears to harbor no sympathy for the amnestied prisoners, asserting in his resignation statement that he considered the Duma's vote for political amnesty a "black page in the history of Russian parliamentarianism" (ITAR-TASS, 26 February). * Kazannik has now changed his mind about resigning and has indicated that he will ask the Federation Council, which has the constitutional authority to confirm the appointment and dismissal of the prosecutor general, not to accept his 26 February resignation (Russian TV, Izvestiya, 12 March). Yeltsin, however, appears intent on securing Kazannik's resignation. On 14 March he issued a decree affirming his acceptance of Kazannik's resignation and arguing that because Kazannik was appointed by presidential decree before the new constitution was adopted, his release from office does not require the Federation Council's approval (ITAR-TASS, 14 March).
