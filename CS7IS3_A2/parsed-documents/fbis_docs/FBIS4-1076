Mr. Botha told a news briefing that it was vital that the PWV, as the economic hub of South Africa, had an effective government. Conrad Burke reports. [Begin recording] [Burke] The PWV. The National Party says there are over 4.5 million voters here, almost 1.5 million in Soweto alone, and according to the NP's PWV team, the party has a good chance here even as part of a coalition. [Botha] There are other parties with more or less the same basic principles, the same policies and objectives. And I would have at this stage, that after the elections we would be able to form a coalition, partnership, a grouping together -- I don't want to give it a name. But it would be improper of me to mention it at this stage because at this moment we are opponents. [Burke] Yesterday's breakthrough with the Inkatha Freedom Party was described by Mr. Botha as the most day in South African history. It was also good news for the PWV election campaign. [Botha] Yes, the decision and agreement means that we've now had a totally new ball game, particularly in this province -- but certainly for Natal-kwaZulu, yes; but also for our province. I think that this will assist us to have more calm and an orderly election here which we really need. [end recording]
