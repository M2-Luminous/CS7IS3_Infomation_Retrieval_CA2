FR940906-0-00029 FR940906-0-00017 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AB94 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of Endangered Status for the Kootenai River Population of the White Sturgeon AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), for the Kootenai River population of the white sturgeon ( Acipenser transmontanus ). The Kootenai River population of the white sturgeon is restricted to approximately 270 river kilometers (km) (168 miles (mi)) of the Kootenai River, in Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia, Canada, primarily upstream from Cora Linn Dam at the outflow from Kootenay Lake, British Columbia. With the exception of 1974, sturgeon recruitment has been declining since the mid-1960's, and there has been an almost complete lack of recruitment of juveniles into the population since 1974, soon after Libby Dam in Montana began operation. The population also faces threats from reduced biological productivity, and possibly poor water quality and the effects of contaminants. This rule implements the protection and conservation provisions afforded by the Act for the Kootenai River population of the white sturgeon. DATES: October 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services Field Office, 4696 Overland Road, Room 576, Boise, Idaho 83705.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background White sturgeon ( Acipenser transmontanus ) are in the Family Acipenseridae, which consists of 4 genera and 24 species of sturgeon. Eight species of sturgeon occur in North America, with white sturgeon one of five species in the genus Acipenser . White sturgeon historically occurred on the Pacific Coast from the Aleutian Islands to central California. The species reproduces in at least three large river systems: the Sacramento-San Joaquin River in California, Columbia River basin in the Pacific Northwest, and the Fraser River system in British Columbia, Canada. The closely related green sturgeon ( Acipenser medirostris ) also occurs in the Pacific Coast region but is restricted in distribution to river estuaries. White sturgeon were first described by Richardson in 1863 from a single specimen collected in the Columbia River near Fort Vancouver, Washington (Scott and Crossman 1973). All sturgeon are distinguished from other fish in that they have a cartilaginous skeleton with a persistent notochord, and a protractile, tube-like mouth and sensory barbels ventrally on the snout. The white sturgeon is distinguished from other Acipenser by the specific arrangement and number of scutes (bony plates) along its body (Scott and Crossman 1973). The largest authentic record of a white sturgeon is a 630 kilogram (kg) (1,387 pounds (lbs)) specimen taken from the Fraser River in British Columbia in 1897 (Scott and Crossman 1973). Individuals in landlocked populations tend to be smaller. For example, white sturgeon over 90 kg (200 lbs) have not been reported from the Kootenai River system (Apperson 1992, Graham 1981, Partridge 1983). White sturgeon are generally long-lived, with females living from 34 to 70 years (Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) 1992). The oldest of 342 sturgeon captured in the Kootenai River during 1977 to 1982 was estimated to be 44 years old (Partridge 1983). For white sturgeon in general, the size or age of first maturity in the wild is quite variable (PSMFC 1992). Females normally require a longer period to mature than males, with females for most sturgeon species spawning between 15 to 25 years of age (Doroshov 1993). Only a portion of adult white sturgeon are reproductive or spawn each year, with the spawning frequency for females estimated at 2 to 11 years. Spawning occurs when the physical environment permits vitellogenesis (egg development) and cues ovulation. White sturgeon are broadcast spawners, releasing their eggs and sperm in fast water. In the lower Columbia River below McNary Dam, landlocked populations of white sturgeon normally spawn during the period of peak flows from April through July (Parsley et al. 1989). Spawning at peak flows with high water velocities disperses and prevents clumping of the adhesive eggs. Following fertilization, eggs adhere to the river substrate and hatch after a relatively brief incubation period of 8 to 15 days, depending on water temperature (Brannon et al. 1985). Recently hatched yolk-sac larvae swim or drift in the current for a period of several hours and settle into interstitial spaces in the substrate. Larval white sturgeon require 20 to 30 days to metamorphose into juveniles with a full complement of fin rays and scutes.
