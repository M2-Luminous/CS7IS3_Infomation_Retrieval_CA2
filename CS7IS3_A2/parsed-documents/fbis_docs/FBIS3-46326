Qian made clear at the banquet that the maintenance of Sino- French friendly relations of cooperation is not only in the basic interest of the two peoples, but also beneficial to world peace, stability and economic development. Qian said that 30 years ago, Chairman Mao Zedong and Charles de Gaulle made the historic decision for the establishment of Sino- French diplomatic relations with the foresight and sagacity of great statesmanship, despite all obstacles. While reviewing the development of Sino-French relations today, he added, we feel stronger that the decision made by leaders of both countries at that time was right and fitting with historical trends. Qian noted that the agreement reached between the two governments not long ago has turned a new page on Sino-French relations. Qian pointed out that China and France, sharing the same or similar views on many important international issues, should strengthen consultations and coordination. He said that China attaches great importance as always to relations with France, holding that Sino-French relations should have an eye not only on the present, but also on the next century. He added that the long maintenance of stable Sino-French friendly relations of cooperation is a factor for world peace and balance. Qian noted that China and France share strong economic complementarity, which embodies a vast potential for bilateral economic and trade cooperation, in hopes that more French enterprises and corporations come to China to invest and conduct business. He said that Chinese leaders are hoping for French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to visit China, voicing that the visit, an important event in bilateral relations, will further accelerate and promote an overall restoration and development of Sino-French relations. Peyrefitte and his party arrived here this morning to participate in commemorative activities for the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations and to make preparations for Balladur's visit to China. At the banquet, Peyrefitte said that shadows over bilateral relations in the past few years have been cleared now, so both France and China are ready to hold grand memorial activities to mark the anniversary. He continued that during the past 30 years, the world, China and France have all experienced changes, but China and France are not the same as other countries for France is the sole oldest country in the Western world and China is the sole oldest country in Asia, and both countries have their experiences and influence, which cannot be measured by population and gross national product. He said that since 1978 when China started its drive toward modernization, reform and opening up, its efforts have resulted in a surprising and sustained economic growth, which has won China many friends. He pointed out that, as old friends, France and China have become frank friends again after removing misunderstandings today. Peyrefitte at last quoted a Chinese saying, with a wish for Sino- French friendship to "last forever". French Senator and Admiral Philippe de Gaulle also made a speech at the banquet, saying that the decision made by his father, former President Charles de Gaulle, in 1964 to establish diplomatic relations with China was a symbol of an independent foreign policy followed by a sovereign France. The concept of national independence is the one most remarkable common point shared by the two peoples, he added. He continued that, compared with 1964, today's China, a big country in politics and culture and an economic giant accelerating its construction as set out by Mr. Deng Xiaoping, occupies a more prominent position in history and cultivation. He voiced that both countries have more reasons than in 1964 to maintain and develop friendly relations set up in the past. Present at the banquet were Power Industry Minister Shi Dazhen, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Wu Jichuan and French Ambassador to China Francois Plaisant. Before the banquet, Qian met with Peyrefitte and his party, praising Peyrefitte for his efforts in pushing forward the development of Sino-French relations and enhancing understanding and friendship between the two peoples during the past 30 years. He noted that Sino-French relations have played a constructive, stable and balancing role in the world during the past 30 years, whose importance has exceeded bilateral relations and should be exercised even more in the current new world situation. Qian pointed out that history will prove the rightness of the decision on normalization of Sino-French relations made by Prime Minister Balladur. He welcomed French enterprises to take part in equal competition on the Chinese market, saying that China is witnessing a high economic growth rate. Peyrefitte said that Balladur has pushed bilateral relations back onto a normal track, hoping his visit to China would be fruitful. This afternoon, Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei held talks with Peyrefitte.
