Qian made the remark at a news conference here today. "Sino-British talks on the arrangement of Hong Kong 1994/95 elections have broken down," he said. "But this does not mean work of the Joint Liason Group will suspend." Negotiations on the new Hong Kong airport are continuing, too, he said. "In my view," Qian said, "both sides should make efforts to ensure Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Despite a breakdown of Sino-British talks on the political structure arrangement of Hong Kong, China still cares about Hong Kong's economy and the livelihood of its people." China will try its best to cooperate with the British side, he said. "Whether or not cooperation can proceed smoothly depends on both the attitude and action of the British side," he said.
