The president defended the joint Cyprus-Greece defence policy, welcomed possible European Union (EU) mediation effort on Cyprus, and strongly argued for Cyprus' entry into the EU. Asked by British Labour MP Tom Cox about his expectations from the U.S., the president said he would like to see the U.S. "consider the Cyprus issue as one of invasion and occupation and exert their influence on Turkey to remove its troops from Cyprus" and encourage the Turkish side to accept his demilitarisation proposal. Replying to a question by Portuguese communist MP Urbano Rodrigues on the joint defence dogma and its effect on a Cyprus settlement, Kliridhis stressed he had no intention of attacking but intended to defend the country. He said the presence of Turkish troops created "anxieties among Greek Cypriots" and noted he would fail in his duty as president if he did not address these anxieties. Asked by Polish Social Democrat MP Jerzy Jaskiernia to outline his position on Sunday's NATO bombing of Serbian positions, Kliridhis remarked that the credibility of the U.N. would have suffered a severe blow if they had taken no action, following a U.N. request to NATO for air-cover. "Whether this would contribute to a solution, I have my doubts", he added. Setting out his views on the problem of F.Y.R.O.M. (Skopje), the president advocated the elimination of references to greater Macedonia in the Skopje Constitution, followed up by talks. He noted he learned in the U.K. during his education there that Macedonia is Greek "and I am too old to go back to school to learn differently," he said. Conservative MP Sir Keith Speed sought an explanation on the definition of political equality and President Kliridhis noted "we accept the notion of political equality but this does not mean numerical equality." Referring to Cyprus' European aspirations, the president said in a reply to Social Democrat (Dutch) MP, Ole Espersen he believed Cyprus accession to EU would alleviate fears of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. "The knowledge that we will enter the EU would be a great contribution towards pacifying anxieties of both communities Greek Cypriot fears of another Turkish advance and Turkish Cypriot fears of being reduced to second class citizens." Asked by a Spanish MP whether the EU should send a mediator, the president said "we would be delighted to have a EU mediator" but noted such a move could not occur while the U.N. Security Council authorised the U.N. secretary-general to "use his good offices mission to find a solution," explaining at the same time that Cyprus does not authorise the U.N. secretary general. Asked by a Greek MP about what the Council of Europe should do to end the problem of Cyprus, Kliridhis advocated a two-fold role. The Council can play a role in various directions, first the direction of the demilitarisation of Cyprus and secondly to put an end to the illegal practice of colonising the occupied areas, the president said. Replying to another question on the issues of the 1,619 missing and the refugees in Cyprus, Kliridhis said the humanitarian issue of the missing "affects adversely the CBM's" and argued for its resolution. Asked by Polish MP Jansz Szymanski about Cyprus official reaction to the idea of PFP (Partnership for Peace), the president favoured the Republic's participation in bodies promoting peace and called for such a partnership to cover former East Bloc states. Reiterating this idea, at the press conference later Tuesday afternoon, Kliridhis said "we are willing to participate in any European force created for the maintenance of peace and stability." He expressed the belief that Europe must have a defensive force to maintain peace, adherence to human rights and the rule of law in Europe and elsewhere, noting also Cypriot membership of the Western European Union would be on the cards when Cyprus eventually joins the EU. Asked to estimate when Cyprus would become a EU member, Kliridhis believed access of new members would not occur until after 1996 when certain problems within the EU are ironed out.
