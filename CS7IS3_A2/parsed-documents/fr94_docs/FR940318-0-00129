FR940318-0-00129 FR940318-0-00023 A. Substitutes Reviewed under SNAP Only 1. Applicability Sections IV. and V. describe the conditions dictating review under the SNAP program only and the general reporting requirements under section 612. If any of these conditions are met and the substitutes are not exempt as described in section IV.B.3., Exemptions from Reporting, a SNAP notice must be submitted. 2. Pre-Notice Communication Prior to submitting the SNAP notice, each submitter is encouraged to contact EPA's SNAP Coordinator to discuss the notification process. Among other things, the SNAP Coordinator will: (1) Assist the potential submitter in determining whether a SNAP notice is needed; (2) answer questions regarding how to complete a submission; (3) provide all necessary forms and the guidance manual; (4) serve as the initial point of contact when the notice is submitted; and (5) oversee the assignment of a SNAP program tracking number to the notice once it is received by the Agency. A copy of the SNAP Information Notice and Guidance Manual may be obtained from the SNAP Coordinator at the address listed at the beginning of this final rule. Specific data requested are described in section V. 3. Processing of Completed SNAP Submission a. 90-Day review process. As required under section 612(e), a manufacturer of a substitute for a class I chemical must provide the Agency with notification at least 90 days prior to introducing into interstate commerce any new or existing chemicals for significant new uses as class I alternatives. The same requirements apply to manufacturers of substitutes for class II substances, although in this case the Agency is drawing on general authorities contained in sections 114 and 301 of the CAA in order to fulfill the purpose of section 612(c). EPA intends to review these substitutes within a 90-day period to ensure prompt response for manufacturers initiating production of substitutes. EPA's 90-day review period for SNAP submissions begins once EPA receives a submission, as described in section V.B. above. If a submission does not include adequate data, EPA may return the submission to request specific additional information. Section 114 and, in the case of petitions, section 612(d) authorizes EPA to require manufacturers to support their SNAP submissions with data adequate to facilitate EPA's review. b. Initial receipt of the SNAP submission. (1) Initial review of submission. EPA will conclude a completeness review of each submission within fifteen days of receipt of the submission. Within the 15-day period, EPA will inform the submitter of any additional information needed. If EPA makes no such request, then after the 15-day period is concluded, the 90-day review period will automatically commence. If EPA does request any additional data, the 90-day period shall not commence until the additional data are received and themselves reviewed for completeness. During the 15-day completeness review, the SNAP Coordinator will first review the SNAP Information Notice to ensure that basic information necessary to process the submission is present (i.e., name of company, identification of substitute, etc.). A more detailed review of supporting technical data will then ensue, as well as an examination of substantiation provided for any claim for confidentiality of information. Should additional information be required, EPA will contact the submitter within 15 days of receipt of the original submission. During the 90-day review period, EPA may ask for additional information from submitters as necessary, although manufacturers of a new substitute may introduce the substitute into interstate commerce 90 days after EPA receives a submission for the product if the Agency has not already rendered an unacceptability determination. In the case of a substitute which already exists in the marketplace prior to the issuance of this final rule, manufacturers must submit a completed SNAP Information Notice as soon as possible, and not later than 90 days after the effective date of this rule. During EPA's review, use of an existing substitute may continue, and need not cease unless and until EPA adds the substitute to the list of unacceptable substitutes as a result of notice-and-comment rulemaking. (2) Letter of receipt. The SNAP Coordinator will send a letter of confirmation to the submitter once the Agency has received the SNAP Information Notice and reviewed it for completeness. This letter will include the date of advance notification to the Agency, the starting date of EPA's 90-day review period, and the SNAP program tracking number assigned to the submission. c. Determination of data adequacy. As part of the review for a SNAP submission, the Agency will complete a preliminary determination of the adequacy of data supporting the application. The Agency will issue this determination within 15 days after receipt of the application. At any time during the review period, if information is not adequate to allow the Agency to reach a SNAP determination, EPA will contact the submitter and request the missing data. EPA believes it appropriate and authorized under section 114 to require the submitter to provide all data needed to complete the review of the SNAP notice. Depending on the type of information needed and the time necessary to compile and submit the requested data to the Agency, EPA may suspend or extend the review period. This will not affect the ability of a manufacturer to begin marketing a new substitute 90 days after advance notification to the Agency, or in the case of a pre-existing substitute, to continue marketing. In a few cases, the Agency and the submitter may disagree on a schedule for furnishing additional data EPA deems necessary to determine the acceptability of the substitute. If in these cases EPA has reason to believe that such a substitute may be unacceptable, the Agency may exercise the option of proposing to list the substitute as unacceptable based on existing data until the necessary data are provided, due to the uncertainty of the risks associated with use of the substitute.
