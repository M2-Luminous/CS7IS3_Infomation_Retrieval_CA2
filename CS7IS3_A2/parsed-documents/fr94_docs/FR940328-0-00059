FR940328-0-00059 FR940328-0-00013 Some commenters suggested that the focus-study research results were misused. Specifically, they state that FSIS is mandating a nationwide labeling plan based on the input of 86 individuals. They also cited a statement in the final report on the focus-study research that cautioned that the findings of focus-study research should not be generalized to a larger population in any statistical sense. FSIS does not believe that its use of the focus-study research findings was inappropriate. Consumers have an important role in assuring meat and poultry are safe to eat. Safe handling labels are a part of the Agency's consumer education campaign. The focus-study research was used to obtain consumer feedback on three label formats proposed by FSIS. The process used was consistent with generally recognized focus group methodology. Focus-study research provides a richness of detail not possible in more structured quantitative research. Focus groups are highly effective for developing understanding and insight into consumer behavior and thinking. The Agency was responsive to focus-study research suggestions as well as public comments in formulating the previous final regulation on safe handling instructions. As previously cited, participants in the focus-study research expressed a preference for safe handling instructions to be on the package label and felt other labeling, such as pamphlets or in-store signs, should only be used to supplement package labels, but not replace the package labels. Implementation Date Representatives from many official establishments and their associations, retail stores and their associations, as well as officials of State meat and poultry inspection programs strongly recommended that the effective date of the rule be extended. The most frequently mentioned date was July 6, 1994, to coincide with the effective date for nutrition labeling. Many noted that a 30 day implementation time was not feasible. Retailers state that it will take a minimum of 60 days to either receive and install new equipment or receive new labels, taking into account the lag time from publication of a final rule to receiving the new regulation, and ordering and delivery of equipment or labels. Federally inspected establishments and trade associations commenting on the 30-day implementation timeframe offered varied estimates of the time required to make label changes. These ranged from 4 weeks to 4 months. In addition, several commenters stated that pressure-sensitive stickers pose feasibility problems, including inability of the stickers to remain on the product through processing, lack of adequate space on the current label to place the sticker without obscuring other mandatory features, and extremely high labor costs due to the need to add a labor intensive manual process step where businesses currently use high speed equipment that cannot be easily or economically retrofitted to apply the stickers. The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture states that ``FSIS should consider delaying the implementation to July 6, 1994, to provide an opportunity to educate not only the public, but also those who must enforce the requirement and encourage the public to follow the guidelines. It is essential that FSIS provide a lead time to furnish state officials with accurate and reliable information before the regulation is implemented.'' One retail store also stated that 30 days did not provide the time necessary to properly train employees. Regarding FSIS's suggestion that companies revise their nutrition labeling timetable to coincide with safe handling, one official establishment wrote, ``it is not practical to simply `revise our timetable for nutrition labeling' as FSIS has stated. There is a great deal of analysis, planning, and designing that goes into each nutrition panel. It is simply not a case of printing information that is already dictated as is the case for the handling instructions.'' Additionally, one commenter questioned whether the incremental cost of complying with the label requirement versus the pamphleting option during the April 15 and July 6 period for noncomminuted products could be justified by any demonstrable benefit. However, one consumer group requested that implementation of these requirements not be delayed for any reason, because of the risks of foodborne illness associated with raw meat and poultry. FSIS has been persuaded by the comments that in some cases it might be impractical to achieve compliance with a 30-day implementation requirement for comminuted products and an April 15 requirement for other products. However, the Agency does not agree that businesses will require 4 months to comply. A commenter that calculated 4 months as a minimum included time for sketch approval by FSIS in its calculation. That step is not required for these generically approved labels. They also included a period of time to exhaust preexisting label inventories. This is not a factor that impacts on the feasibility of obtaining complying labels. Additionally, they did not consider such alternatives to complete label redesign as pressure-sensitive labels. The latter approach could obviate both time concerns and concerns over utilization of existing label inventories. Finally, many firms demonstrated the ability to make the required label changes within the 2 months following the publication of the interim rule on August 16, 1993. Their performance certainly belies the notion that 4 months is a minimum required to achieve compliance.
