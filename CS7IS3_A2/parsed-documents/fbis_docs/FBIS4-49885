At the international symposium on China's foreign trade and economic strategy that opened today, Wu Yi analyzed a number of important factors in China's foreign trade and economic cooperation in the 1990's: First, the tendency to form regional economic groups is developing rapidly on the international stage, and this will inevitably create a tendency to replace a certain amount of trade outside a region with trade within the region. This is the so- called "trade shift effect." At the same time, trade protectionism will prevail in many fields of international trade. Some countries will even try to politicize economic relations, pursue unilateralism, and more frequently exert unilateral pressure on their trade partners. This will directly threaten the operation of the multilateral trade system and will also be greatly unfavorable to the development of China's foreign trade and foreign economic cooperation. Second, China, being a developing country, is still facing a low level of production and technology at home and uneven levels of economic development have persisted between various localities and economic sectors, so the country will continue to have a rather low rank in the international economic and trade system. Third, in the process of transforming the domestic economic and trade structure, frictions between the new system and the old will be unavoidable, so it is necessary to properly coordinate reform and development. Wu Yi asserted: In the 1990's, China's foreign trade and economic cooperation must be based on importing and exporting goods, with cooperation and exchanges in the fields of commodities, funds, technologies, and services being developed in a well-coordinated and interconnected way. The foreign trade, production, scientific research, and banking institutions should all participate in pursuing the "large economic and trade strategy," thus substantially enhancing foreign trade and foreign economic cooperation, moving it to a higher level, and giving better play to its strategic role in promoting economic growth, making structural readjustments, making technological progress, and enhancing economic efficiency. She said: It is necessary to create a multi-directional and multi-channeled opening pattern in all fields of domestic and foreign economic activities by furthering the depth and breadth of foreign trade and foreign economic cooperation. It is necessary to hasten the process of integrating the activities of foreign trade, using foreign capital, making foreign investment, and other foreign economic and technical cooperation and to ensure the coordinated development of the commodity, technology, and service trades. It is also necessary to strive to properly integrate multilateral economic cooperation and trade, regional economic cooperation and trade, and bilateral economic cooperation and trade, thus building up our country's overall strength in international competition. She said that, in the 1990's, foreign trade and economic cooperation should take the course of intensive development [ji yue hua fa zhan 7162 4766 0553 4099 1455] and should strive to transform the main body of exports from light industrial and textile goods into mechanical and electrical appliances, heavy chemical products, high and new technology products and from rough processed products with low added value to intensive processed products with high added value. It is necessary to build up a reasonable foreign market structure which is composed primarily of the Asia-Pacific market and supported by the market of the neighboring countries and areas, with other markets evenly spread in developed and developing countries, thus guaranteeing the balanced and well-coordinated development of China's foreign trade and foreign economic relations. Wu Yi also revealed that China's first "Foreign Trade Law" had been submitted to the seventh meeting of the Eighth National People's Congress Standing Committee for deliberation, and the other laws and regulations related to the "Foreign Trade Law" were also being drafted. In about three years, China will basically set up a rather perfect legal system for foreign trade and foreign economic activities.
