Macaspac] [Text] The European Parliament has withdrawn its support to exiled Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) Chairman Jose Maria Sison, an official of the European Union told President Ramos yesterday. The official, Ben Visser, first vice chairman of the parliamentary delegation visiting the country, said Sison, who is based in Utrecht, the Netherlands, "no longer enjoys substantial support in Western Europe." "Sison and his followers are now considered an isolated group where before he had received sympathy and support from some quarters," he said. Visser, who belongs to the Party of European Socialists in the Netherlands, explained that the change in attitude towards Sison was on account of his continued adherence to the Maoist ideology which now belongs to the past and has almost no future. On the other hand, Gunther Rinshe, chairman of the delegation, said that President Ramos' approach to the peace process "is really impressive." "It makes such a good impression that you are almost considered as a model for all of us in our part of the world," Rinshe, a member of the European People's Party of Germany, said. The president said that the Philippines is now enjoying a period of relative peace which is people-based. The peace process, the chief executive explained, was arrived at through a very thorough consultative process at the local level. The president, however, admitted having difficulties negotiating with the Communist Party of the Philippines and the National Democratic Front (NDF) which, he said, "may be fragmented right now." "But just the same, in spite of these difficulties, we have offered the hand of peace to them so that we can finally come to a just, honorable and lasting peace," the president said. Meanwhile, President Ramos urged the members of the delegation to consider possible cooperation in the field of technology transfer and environmental protection between the Philippines and European countries. During their meeting, the president outlines several policies his administration is undertaking on the social and economic upliftment of the Filipino people. The president said the Philippines is also giving priority to power and energy development and upgrading of the telecommunications and transportation systems. He also cited the growing network of cooperation among the countries in the Asia-Pacific which he said has developed to be a cohesive union of countries. "We are seeing enhanced stability because of economic progress. The countries in our region are really becoming more and more stable," he said.
