An informed source said the seven dressed in military fatigues were shot while travelling in two jeeps. The authorities have not identified the attackers referring to them only as "armed elements". Earlier a source close to the army said the fighting with automatic weapons, grenades, and even rockets, had left "several dead". Eyadema, whose official residence is inside the military camp in Lome, was not there when the attack was launched on Wednesday evening. He and Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh were at Eyadema's private residence less than two kilometers (a mile) from the camp. Five of the assailants were said to have been killed as they were driving to the president's private residence. The other two were shot while trying to flee over the border adjoining the capital, into Ghana. Loyal troops and paramilitary gendarmes appeared late Wednesday to have the situation under control. Shooting and explosions which started at 6:15 pm had (1815 GMT) almost died out at 9:30 pm. In a communique broadcast on television shortly after 2000 hours, the Defence Ministry said the attackers' aim was to "surround the camp and close in on the people inside". It said the country's land borders had been sealed and that a curfew had been imposed until 6:00 AM Thursday. The camp was the target of a similar attack last March which the government blamed on exiled political opponents of the regime. The new attack comes six months after Eyadema was reelected in a vote boycotted by the opposition. It also comes two weeks before Togo's first democratic legislative elections which the opposition claims are being sabotaged in advance through poor preparation. Eighty-one French military observers and another 42 from Burkina Faso have been arriving since the start of the week to monitor the election and to ensure the army stays neutral.
