Suwan Ngamsutthi, the chief of Ayutthaya's public health and environment office, told THE NATION that water from the Chao Phya River in Ayutthaya province was almost unusable. The bio-oxygen demand (BOD) level, which measures oxygen depletion, of the river in Ayutthaya was currently three. If the BOD reached level four the water became unusable. He said the main source of pollution was waste water draining from communities. All factories were required to have a waste treatment systems, and officials from the Department of Industry checked to ensure that industrial waste did not drain into rivers or canals. Communities were much more difficult to control, Suwan said. He said residents had complained that the NMB [expansion unknown] company was draining its waste water into the Chao Phya River. However, checks showed that the company's discharge was within safety limits. His office had suggested that NMB recycle its treated waste water through washrooms before discharging it, and the company had complied. There were 11 water testing laboratories in Ayutthaya and BOD levels in the province were tested every three months. In previous years the BOD levels in Ayutthaya had never been higher than two. This year the pollution level during the crisis months -- February, March and April -- had peaked at five. At this time the river was fit only for transportation. Suwan said his office had to carefully manage the water quality of the Chao Phya, because from Ayutthaya it flowed to Bangkok and would worsen the problems in the capital if it was already badly polluted. For this reason, the Ayutthaya province had launched a public relations campaign urging people to understand the problem of water quality. Pathum Thani Governor Sirat Harirak also blamed the poor condition of the Chao Phya river on urban drainage. Srirat said it was not practical for each house to install a treatment system, because of the cost and size of a plant. Instead, communities should install large treatment plants to handle urban and village waste. Pathum Thani province had this year begun building community water treatment systems in Kukot and Prachathipat municipality and Klong Luang. Once the provincial government building plans were completed, the problem of water quality in his province would be resolved. Thepphanom Muangmaen, a specialist in environment at Mahidon University told THE NATION that water treatment would certainly improve water quality, but officials must also be honest in evaluating the plants' efficiency. Wichan Wongwiwat, the director of the public health engineering division and the Public Work Department's office of water treatment, said the condition of water in southern section of the Chao Phya was very poor, especially in the dry season. He warned that the pollution could extend up the river to the northern section unless something was done about it. Wicham said even sea water was showing signs of pollution. Bacterial and heavy metal pollution along the eastern coast, the upper south eastern coast and the western coast of Phuket was higher than normal. Wichan said the Public Works Department had been studying the problem of waste water disposal in big cities, such as Chiang Mai, since 1981. The department was building water supply, drainage and treatment systems and garbage disposal systems in 41 areas. These projects would be extended to 40 more areas next year. Dr. Nattha Hingsanarumon, a lecturer of the Thammasat University's Faculty of Science and Technology, said water treatment systems would effectively lower pollution from urban sources, but they must be built in a suitable site. Water treatment plants should also be built in agricultural areas.
