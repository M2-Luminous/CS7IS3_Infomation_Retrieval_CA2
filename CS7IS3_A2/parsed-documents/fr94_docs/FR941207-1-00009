ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The USEPA proposes to approve the State of Wisconsin's revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Rhinelander, Wisconsin sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) nonattainment area. This State revision request, dated October 21, 1994 was submitted to satisfy the requirements of section 110 and part D of the Clean Air Act and regulates certain sources of SO 2 in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , USEPA is approving the State's request as a direct final rule without prior proposal, because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated and the direct final rule will become effective. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received by January 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Carlton T. Nash, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), USEPA Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604&hyph;3590.
