PDT Deputy Vivaldo Barbosa said the two parties are concerned about the polarization of the candidacies of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva from the PT [Workers Party] and Fernando Henrique Cardoso from the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. Barbosa said the PDT and the PMDB want to present a new alternative through a center-left candidate. One month ago, Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola, from the PDT, promised PMDB President Luiz Henrique that he will not oppose the creation of a progressive broad front. Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho said that after consulting the grassroots, the general wish is to support the candidacy of Orestes Quercia as the presidential candidate. Fleury revealed that he will campaign for Quercia in all states. The official announcement will be made on 24 March at the Sao Paulo Government House during a ceremony in which Quercia and other Sao Paulo State mayors will be present.
