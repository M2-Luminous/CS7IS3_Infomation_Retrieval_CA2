According to Zhu Zupu, deputy secretary-general of the municipal government, deputies to the city's people's congress put forward an average of more than two proposals a day last year. All the proposals, tackling issues ranging from official corruption, city planning to pornography, were adopted. Ten proposals which are beyond the powers of the municipality have been submitted to the State Council, he revealed. Zhu, speaking following the closing of the Eighth Session of the Standing Committee of the 10th Municipal People's Congress Friday [14 January], cited the example of the ban on firecrackers by the city government at the call of more than 40 people's deputies. The city also waged an anti-porn campaign in the publication industry after adopting a proposal from Wang Li and 13 other deputies, Zhu said. The deputies also voiced their demands for a bigger education budget and better living conditions for teachers. The city boosted educational expenditure by over one-fifth over the previous year in 1993. The latest official figures show that teachers received the third-largest increase in income last year, following rises for policemen and enterprise workers. It was a deputy's proposal that spurred the city government to set up Beijing's first international futures trading company. Another proposal resulted in the establishment of two large wholesale book markets. The Municipal People's Congress is a medium-level legislature of the country's people's congress system. The present congress was elected in 1993 and will remain in office for five years. Feedback from the deputies shows that most of them are satisfied with the way their proposals have been handled.
