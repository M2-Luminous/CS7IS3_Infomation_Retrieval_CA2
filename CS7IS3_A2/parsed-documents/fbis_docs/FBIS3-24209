Not because with the advent of spring these problems have disappeared overnight. It is simply that Igor Petrovich, our chief troubleshooter everywhere, forbade me to attend these events from now on. Not for the first time, though. Back in December he was very unhappy over the item "Where Did the Firewood Come From?" in which the author made no secret of reports from Khorol officials that because of coal shortages in rayon villages, people were chopping down the woods. This was a misstep, as the "Cheka" [extraordinary commission] chairman explained to me the next time we met. Instead of mobilizing people to struggle against adversity, the way it used to be during the times of agitation and propaganda and party committee press departments, it turns out that I, in Lebedinets' opinion, had demoralized the workers. It somehow does not occur to Igor Petrovich that only the truth can mobilize people, including the kray leadership, toward liquidation of the fuel crisis. The Khorol leadership has rung enough alarms by then. The most entertaining part at the time was Igor Petrovich's accusation that both I personally and UTRO ROSSII are doing everything possible to make things worse... for President Yeltsin. I have to confess that sometimes I disagree with the actions of Boris Nikolayevich--who during his visit to Vladivostok gave his blessing to the publication of our newspaper--which should be a normal thing in a law-based state and a democratic society. But Igor Petrovich himself developed an affinity for Yeltsin only when he ascended to this administrative job. As I recall, he had none of that affinity during his time in the communist faction of the kray soviet, which he headed. Whatever--the result was that he banned me from attending the conferences then, but later relented after M. Savchenko, chairman of the kray administration committee for housing and municipal services, said publicly (this is how you discover people's mettle even in our democratic times) that I do write objectively. On 5 March, however, Mikhail Lvovich sensibly remained silent, having decided that to keep trying to educate and teach Igor Petrovich is like trying to cure a dead man. Here is what happened. Not a single teleconference passes without a reminder of the money owed to the energy sector. All the rayons and cities are in this debt up to their ears. All of them Igor Petrovich treats with benevolence and understanding, however, but as soon as it comes to Vladivostok he literally goes into a fit of rage. This time what prompted his outburst was that I do not get upset and treat Vladivostok like every other place. My especially dangerous fault was that I did not write that one of the causes of our common shivering this winter was the fact that V. Cherepkov allocated money to start the BOLSHOY VLADIVOSTOK newspaper. "Why do you not write about that?" the vice governor said, looking as if he were spoiling for a fistfight. I explained to him that then I would have to write that millions of taxpayer rubles are allocated by the kray administration to KRASNOYE ZNAMYA and NOVOSTI, as well as by local authorities to all rayon and city newspapers. Is this a solution to the heating and power problem? "A demagogue," was the label slapped on me this time. Kray party committee ideologist Antokhin once called me a rebel; another party secretary, Kharchev, suggested that I decide for myself whether I was for the Soviet power or not. It turned out that the way he saw it, I was against it. And now another kray zealot of propaganda customs, without doubting for a moment... There are many people in the kray who have known both Igor Petrovich and myself for many years. Since he got his education as a part-time student, I will remind our mutual acquaintances--as food for thought--of the meaning of one word. DEMAGOGUERY (demogogia in Greek, from demos--people and ago--lead)--deception through intentional distortion of facts, false promises, and flattery; hypocritical pandering to the taste of the less educated part of the masses in order to achieve political goals. I really cannot accept such a characteristic of myself. As to I. Lebedinets, who calls journalists "slimeballs"--I do not know... Watching Igor Petrovich in his capacity as de facto first vice governor, I cannot help recalling his namesake and predecessor Igor Chernyanskiy. He was rakishly rough, but while holding this job he did not stoop to pettiness and vindictiveness. "I want to understand, looking from the position of an elephant (meaning his job of great responsibility--D.G.) why I am being barked at, even if I am not aware of it," he said once. I think it is time for Igor Petrovich to grow to fill this job rather than staying in the old position he is accustomed to. Actually, he is not as insignificant as some may think or imagine. If I am asked some time in the future who Ye. Nazdratenko was, I will say he was Maritime Kray governor during Lebedinets' time.
