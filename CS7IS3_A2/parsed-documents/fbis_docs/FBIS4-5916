We now review the relations between Vietnam and Czech. It will be an official visit by a Czech foreign minister in two years since the country separated into the Federation of Czech and Slovakia and it also is the first visit by a foreign minister from an Eastern European country following the end of the Cold War. The visit will be made in an international situation, which is changing positively. Czech has attached a great importance to its traditional relations with Vietnam and other Asia-Pacific countries. Over many years, and particularly in the past two years, the relations between Vietnam and the Czechslovak Federation in general and Czech in particular, have been constantly consolidated and developed. Exchange of high-level visits has been made. Czech has helped Vietnam in training of thousands of students and apprentices and post-graduate students. Many now hold important positions in leading offices of Vietnam. Vietnam and Czech have had labor cooperation for many years. In the near future, the two countries will continue to sign agreements on labor cooperation under which thousands of Vietnamese guest workers will be dispatched to Czech every year. Czech has also agreed to grant gratuitous aid to Vietnam in training another 200 Vietnamese apprentices and given 12 scholarships to university students to study in Czech. The Czech Government has granted 13 million U.S. dollars in aid to help repatriate Vietnamese guest workers due to changes in Eastern Europe. In 1993, two-way trade turnover between Vietnam and Czech reached 13 million U.S. dollars. During the coming visit to Vietnam, the Czech prime minister will be accompanied by dozens of businessmen to study Vietnam's domestic and foreign policies and economic renovation and to seek the possibility of strengthening and expanding cooperation with Vietnam in the new era.
