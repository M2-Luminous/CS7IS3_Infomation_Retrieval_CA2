"I undertake that, if the ANC [African National Congress] tells us who the guilty people are, an international investigation team will be appointed," he told a cheering crowd of about 500 people at a meeting at the Malibu High School in Blue Downs, a coloured suburb near Cape Town. "I challenge him to say who it was that was supposed to have put that money in their pockets so that we can investigate the matter properly and put the guilty ones in jail. "If he does not accept this challenge, then we will know why. I am not a prophet, but I predict he won't accept this challenge." Mr Kriel was replying to recent allegations by Dr Boesak at a meeting in Moorreesburg that cabinet ministers and national party politicians had "stolen R70 billion of state money" over the last few years. He said the ANC was hell-bent on discrediting the leaders of the NP [National Party]. Referring to a full-page advertisement in Cape newspapers -- placed by COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] and saying the NP ruled through weapon smuggling and assassination gangs -- Mr Kriel said the advert was dishonest. Nothing about the so-called third force in the SAP [South African Police] had yet been proven. "What has happened to fairness and justice in South Africa? If Mr (Nelson) Mandela and Mr (Cyril) Ramaphosa find you guilty before it has been proven in a court of law, is this what is going to happen in the new South Africa? "Why was the advert placed by COSATU? I say it is because COSATU is one of the arms of the octopus that is the ANC. The ANC is too scared to place such an advert under its own name because it knows it will run up against the Independent Electoral Commission which would find they have misused the circumstances." Referring to other allegations by Dr Boesak that coloured children had poor examination results because of poor education facilities provided by the NP, Mr Kriel said the government had built more schools and trained more teachers than any other government before it. "The NP has never told children to boycott their classes or teachers to engage in chalk-downs. We will never sell our children out for political gains. The future of South Africa lies in the hands of our children. "We say the ANC must leave our children alone so that they can learn and become useful citizens of this country so they can break the circle of poverty. They can only do that if they are educated." Chaos threatened on several occasions during question time when a contingent of about 70 ANC supporters were vociferously shouted down by the rest of the audience.
