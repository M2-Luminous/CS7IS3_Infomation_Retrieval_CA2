Implement or enhance a surveillance system to define the magnitude of the firearm-related injury problem in at least one of the following areas: (1) Link vital statistics data with other data (e.g., medical examiner data, police data) to provide a more complete description of firearm-related mortality, or (2) Conduct surveillance of nonfatal firearm-related injuries (e.g., through hospital emergency department data, E-coded hospital discharge data), or (3) Define risk behaviors, utilizing risk behavior surveys (e.g., gun carrying, availability, storage practices). d. Form partnerships with public safety officials (e.g., police) to ensure the completeness of surveillance data. e. Demonstrate the utility of the surveillance system in measuring the effectiveness of specific interventions designed to reduce firearm-related injuries. f. Evaluate the surveillance system in terms of sensitivity, timeliness, representation and predictive value positive. g. Perform related injury demonstration projects. These may be related by nature of the injury or surveillance methodology. 5. For Programs To Prevent Violence Against Women a. Provide a full-time director/coordinator and staff who have authority, responsibility, and expertise to carry out the program. b. Establish an advisory structure to address issues related to violence against women, to ensure community input, and to generate community support. This advisory structure should consist of individuals (internal and external to the State public health agency), agencies, and organizations with experience, expertise and interest in preventing violence against women. If a State Injury Advisory Committee exists, this advisory structure should be constituted as a subcommittee for violence against women issues. c. Develop collaborative relationships with voluntary, community-based public and private organizations and agencies already involved in preventing violence against women. d. Conduct an inventory of existing data sources and prevention programs within the State which address violence against women. e. Assess the State public health agency's organizational capacity and available resources, as well as other public and private resources, to address violence against women. f. Design, pilot test, and implement a surveillance system to track the incidence of violence against women in selected geographic areas within the State, and expand this surveillance system statewide. g. Evaluate the usefulness of the surveillance system for assessing violence against women. h. Identify, implement and evaluate specific interventions to prevent violence against women. Evaluate existing interventions or implement and test new interventions. Examples of existing interventions include, but are not limited to: (1) Public awareness campaigns to change knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs conducive to violence against women. (2) School-based curricula that teach strategies for developing and maintaining nonviolent dating relationships. (3) Home health visitation to reduce partner abuse in targeted families and thereby reduce the likelihood of children witnessing such violence.
