[passage omitted] We have learned that Aleksandr Yakovlev, head of the Federal Television and Radio Broadcasting Service, has called a meeting of representatives on all sides to look for a solution following the ultimatum from communications workers. The meeting adopted a letter to the prime minister, stressing that allocation of money to clear the debts to the communications workers is a political more than an economic necessity. People should have access to news regardless, and the government should fulfill its obligations to the Communications Ministry and to state television and radio companies.
