He expressed full support for the political independence of this former Soviet Republic and for its economic reforms. Di Tella concluded his stay in Turkmenistan with a one-hour meeting with Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov, with whom he discussed political and economic issues. During a news conference, Di Tella said the political issues discussed with Niyazov focused on Argentina's support for the independence of Turkmenistan. Di Tella noted: "We were among the first countries to recognize the independence of Turkmenistan, because we believed it was fair." Niyazov, who received 99.9 percent of the votes in a plebiscite held in January -- a plebiscite that allows him to extend his tenure until the year 2002, and which prevented the holding of new presidential elections that had been scheduled for 1997 -- today presented to his country's parliament his economic reform program for his country, including agricultural reform that involves land privatization. Indicating that the political and economic reform programs announced by Niyazov "seemed good to him," Di Tella said: "Now it is also necessary to support economic reform." The Argentine foreign minister admitted that "every country has to maintain its own rate of reform" and that, however desirable it might be to institute reform immediately, "it must be assumed that transformations need to take place at a rate that societies can accommodate." Di Tella noted that "reaffirmation of the economic reform" is a key point now, as it represents one of the pillars of the future Turkmenistan. He added that along with this transformation, "political reforms" will take place "slowly, but firmly," and this is more important than any spectacular measures. Concerning bilateral issues, the foreign minister pointed out that "we talked in particular about the presence of Argentine companies involved in giant projects" like Bridas, linked to the oil industry field, and Lybra, linked to the production of sugar and other industries. Upon pointing out Bridas' goal of participating in ambitious projects such as the construction of gas pipelines linking this central Asian republic with Turkey, Europe, and Pakistan, and gas prospecting in Turkmenistan, Di Tella said: "I believe that in this case the old proverb that business creates friendship and friendship creates business is correct." The foreign minister also mentioned the industrial projects of the other Argentine company operating in Turkmenistan. Di Tella, who was feted today with a luncheon by Turkmen Deputy Prime Minister Boris Shikhmuradov [title as received], this morning visited the Kaakhka area, where Lybra is constructing a sugar mill and an alcohol distillery that within one year will be able to process 30,000 metric tons of sugar per year. Lybra executives Francisco Gradin, Pablo D'Agnillo, and Francisco Cordella joined Di Tella and his entourage, including high-ranking Foreign Ministry officials, Argentine businessmen, and Juan Carlos Olima, the Argentine ambassador to Russia and to other former Soviet republics, for the visit to the sugar mill, whose construction in the middle of the desert requires a huge logistical deployment. Lybra's investments in Turkmenistan total $230 million. The company, which specializes in the construction of industrial "turnkey" facilities, is involved in nine projects in this central Asian country. Lybra directly or indirectly employs 1,200 people in these nine projects. Di Tella was feted last night by Bridas President Carlos Bolgheroni in a building that is part of a housing project developed in Ashkhabad, the Turkmen capital, for Bridas personnel in Turkmenistan. Thus far, the oil company has invested $168 million in drilling two oil wells in prospecting for gas in Yashlar, about 450 km east of Ashkhabad, and is exploiting 38 oil wells in Keimir on the Caspian Sea. These oil wells currently yield 1,400 metric tons of crude oil per day. Bridas is employing 616 people in Turkmenistan, of whom 236 are Argentines and people from other nationalities, including Europeans, Latin Americans, and U.S. nationals, 316 are Turkmen, and 64 are people from other former USSR republics.
