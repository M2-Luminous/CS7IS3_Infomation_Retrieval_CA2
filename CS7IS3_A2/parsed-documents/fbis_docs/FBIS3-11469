Energy, Telecommunications, and Posts Minister Datuk Sri Samy Vellu said Intelsat has applied to the International Telecommunications Union [ITU] to position its satellite at the 91.5 degree east orbital slot just as Malaysia had done for its Malaysia East Asia Satellite [Measat] 1. He said this when addressing the world telecommunications development conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina today. The nine-day conference is organized by the ITU. The text of his speech was faxed to the national news agency BERNAMA. Datuk Sri Samy Vellu said Malaysia had objected to Intelsat's bid to place its satellite in the same orbital slot to the Radio Communications Bureau as it would cause harmful interference to Measat.
