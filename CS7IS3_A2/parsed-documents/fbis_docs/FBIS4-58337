Even though it is too early to venture anything on the final compromise among the regional countries, there is evidence of conditions being prepared for peace and amity. For many years Egypt and Jordan have moved away from the orbit of rivalry and struggle against the Zionists. Lebanon was forced to oppose Israel, because of its emulation of Syria and the dynamic activities of Hizballah. Beirut will only play the tune of opposition to the Zionists for as long as Syria wants it to, and the duration of its struggle and the military operations of the Islamic Resistance in southern Lebanon will be governed by this same logic. Certain steps are being taken by Beirut and Damascus that indicate that the way is being paved for normalization of conditions in a region which had been uncontrollable and unbridled as regards anti-Zionist activities. From time to time, it is announced at special junctures that Warren Christopher is going to visit the Middle East. At the same time, Jordan has banned Hamas' activities and Yitzhaq Rabin has assigned two military and foreign policy teams to assess ways and means for the withdrawal of the Zionist regime's forces from the Golan Heights. Certain events are taking place in Lebanon which are in keeping with the developments in Lebanon and Syria. Orders have been issued for the arrest and impeachment of 44 Hizballah members who staged an armed march on Jerusalem Day, and the Army has begun disarming Palestinian groups in the south. The Lebanese foreign minister has openly announced that an international plan is being studied under which the Palestinians in Lebanon would be relocated to the affluent Arab countries. Faris Buwayz told the newspaper AL-SHIRA' that the Palestinians in Egypt, Jordan, and Syria would be given permanent residence in these countries, but 20 percent of the Palestinians in Lebanon would return to Palestine, while the remainder would be transferred to the vast and opulent Arab countries. The plan unveiled by the Lebanese foreign minister was, in a way, implemented even in 1982, but in those days there was no possibility of a compromise and 'Arafat and the PLO had not adopted the path of peace and friendship. In that year Israel attacked Lebanon on the pretext of crushing the Palestinian guerrillas and had advanced up to Beirut. The Zionists embarked on a massacre of the Palestinians in the camps of Sabra and Shatila and only withdrew on condition that the Palestinian guerrillas led by PLO be expelled. It was then that 'Arafat and his group of Palestinian guerrillas left Lebanon. The present plan revealed by the Lebanese foreign minister is aimed at distancing the Palestinians from the borders of occupied Palestine. Those Palestinians who reside in Lebanon are mainly opposed to 'Arafat and are guerrillas who infiltrate into the occupied territories. They carry out suicide missions; therefore removing them from the borders of the occupied territories is tantamount to closing southern Lebanon's borders to the revolutionary Palestinians. The reining in of the Hizballah, the expulsion of the Palestinians in southern Lebanon, the ban on Hamas in Jordan, the change in the Israeli stance on withdrawal from the Golan Heights and, ultimately, Christopher's visit to the region and the resumption of the peace talks, are all factors which indicate a gradual change in the peace trend. This will be complete when Damascus gives the green light to the United States and Israel by announcing its acquiescence to the peace process. This will sweep out all opposition; and the opponents to this process will thus be consigned to the blade of the guillotine. [preceding word in English].
