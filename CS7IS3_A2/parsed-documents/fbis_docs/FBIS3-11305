FBIS3-11305 "drlat054cc_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-054 Document Type:Daily Report 16 Mar 1994 NAFTA Study Indicates NAFTA To Increase EU Trade Ties PA1703210194 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0118 GMT 16 Mar 94 PA1703210194 Mexico City NOTIMEX Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Mexico City, 15 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- The European Union (EU) today reported that NAFTA will allow Mexico to move toward economic development that is closer to that of its associates and will increase its ties with the EU. In the document "The European Union and NAFTA," the EU indicates that NAFTA -- which was implemented in January -- "will have effects on its member nations, on the EU, and other nations on political, trade, and investment levels." In the document disclosed to NOTIMEX, the European organization indicates that to the extent that the Treaty moves Mexico closer to the "North American orbit," its relations with the EU could be significantly increased. Although the EU is Mexico's second ranking trading partner -- after the United States -- this nation only represents for the EU 1.4 percent of its total exports. After the rules of the trilateral agreement are implemented and as the tariffs disappear between Mexico, the United States, and Canada, European products are expected to experience a certain displacement by U.S. products in the Mexican market, the EU said. Nevertheless, it ruled out the possibility that the activity generated and reinforced in Mexico by the trade treaty will allow greater trade expansion with the European bloc. According to a study carried out by the EU on the effects of the trade treaty and on EU-Mexico investment, there are possibilities that displacement of Mexican imports from the EU will not be adversely affected. Nevertheless, if these are affected, the main effect will be on the goods that face greater tariff differences with regard to U.S. and Canadian products. The document indicates that this effect can be diminished by the process of gradual removal of tariffs foreseen in the treaty and by the fact that the EU is the sole supplier of a large number of goods on a worldwide scale; therefore it does not face competition from North America.
