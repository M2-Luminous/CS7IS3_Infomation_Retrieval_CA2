[Woerner] The reason is very simple. You are confronted with two historic tasks. One, which is always forgotten, is the main historic objective of building a new comprehensive Euro-Atlantic security structure that will include Russia, not exclude it. That is in the interests of all European nations, especially the nations of Central and East Europe. The second historic task is to anchor those who belong to the West, the new democracies, firmly in the structures of the West. [Brewer] So it's your hope that the Partnerships for Peace can be a prelude to NATO membership and not a substitute for it? [Woerner] That is not my hope, that is my certitude for some of them. Some of them may and will become members -- at least that's my expectation. Others will use the Partnership for Peace just to improve cooperation with us. [Brewer] Have you had a rough time with the British, French, and Americans? I mean after all you were much keener on this idea than they were. [Woerner] I would not call it a rough time, rather a very interesting time. Well this is an alliance of several, important nations. This is a very important question, one of the most important ones with very, very complicated conclusions and consequences, so obviously you need a certain type of discussion to harmonize your views and to come to a consensus. I think we will reach it clearly at the summit; we have prepared it very carefully. [Brewer] If we are to concentrate on being friends with the Russians as well, what is the point of having NATO? [Woerner] NATO is the only remaining real element of global stability today. The transatlantic axis that links the two most important power centers of the West -- North America and West Europe -- is rightly seen not only by our member nations but also by others as the core of any future security structure. If you separate North America from Europe you will create a lot of additional dangers. [Brewer] What are you going to say to the East Europeans after the summit when they say to you: Look, thank you very much, but we are frightened of resurgent Russian nationalism. We have got Mr. Zhirinovskiy saying he is going to invade us in 10 minutes if he can get away with it. We need not all these fine words, we need Article V, we need a cast-iron guarantee that our security lies with Europe. [Woerner] The first thing I would say to them is the closer you move to NATO the more secure you will be. The second is that there is not this alternative between guarantee and vacuum; that's the wrong alternative. The third is if you cooperate closely with NATO, whatever happens in Russia your security is inseparably linked to ours, so if there would be anybody who would think it appropriate to attack or invade those countries, he would still have to calculate NATO reactions.
