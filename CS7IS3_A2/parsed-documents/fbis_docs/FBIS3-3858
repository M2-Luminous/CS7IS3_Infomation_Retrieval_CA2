We received the reply yesterday afternoon. The full text of Beijing's reply to this newspaper is as follows: (The letter sent by the Urban Council to Beijing has never been made public) Your newspaper raised several questions to us: 1) What promises has the Hong Kong Film Festival breached so that the Film Industry Administration decided to withdraw copies of two movies? 2) Why did the Film Festival have to make these promises? 3) Why does the Chinese side oppose showing the two independently produced movies: "Red Beans" and "The Days"? These movies are only short stories about romantic love, without any political content. 4) "Blue Kite" was shown at the Tokyo Film Festival. At that time, the Film Industry Administration withdrew only its delegation, but the movie was still shown. Why have both the delegation and the movies been withdrawn this time? 5) Will this incident affect future cooperation? Now, our brief answers to these questions are as follows: 1. Last September, the 18th Hong Kong International Film Festival wrote a letter to the Film Industry Administration asking to be allowed to send its personnel to Beijing to select movies. In our reply letter, the Film Industry Administration unequivocally said that "according to the regulations of our country, all Chinese entries in international film festivals (including movies produced in cooperation with the outside) must be screened and authorized by the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television. Only movies authorized can enter international film festivals." "If personnel of your festival come to Beijing to select movies, our administration will give our support and assistance, but the scope of movie selection and movies to be shown in the film festival should be movies provided by us. Movies to which the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television has not given consent for their showing in the International Film Festival are not within the scope of selection." The Hong Kong Film Festival replied on 8 November, saying they consented to the conditions and promised that "they will follow this practice." After that, our administration agreed to receive and help Miss Wong Oi-ling, one of the program planners of the Hong Kong Film Festival, to select movies in Beijing. In our conversation with Miss Wong before the formal movie selection, we once again told her that we hoped the Hong Kong International Film Festival would respect our views when selecting movies and would not select movies without our administration's screening and authorization or programs unfriendly to our country or even willfully vilifying our social system and policies, and that only with mutual respect and equal treatment can both sides continue to cooperate with each other on a long-term basis. Miss Wong Oi-ling gave her consent to our views right away. Meanwhile, we also specially briefed Miss Wong on which movies -- such as "Blue Kite" and "Beijing Bastard" -- were taken out of the country illegally to enter the Tokyo Film Festival and other film festivals, as well as on our position and attitude, hoping that similar problems would not arise again in the Hong Kong International Film Festival. In this connection, Miss Wong also indicated her understanding of and respect for us. The two movies -- "The Days" and "Red Beans" -- have not been screened by our administration and have been taken out of the country without going through exit formalities in accordance with our relevant customs regulations. The fact that these two movies were invited to enter the film festival very obviously has breached the original promises made by the Hong Kong Film Festival and Miss Wong. Our requests are fair and reasonable and we do not have any alternative. 2. We have discussed this point in the section above. We consider the selection of movies to enter a film festival a matter of mutual support and respect, rather than an imposition of one party on the other. Moreover, we ought to uphold the relevant regulations on the administration of our film industry. Since these situations have emerged in the Tokyo Film Festival and other film festivals, we do not want them to recur in the Hong Kong Film Festival. Hence, it is reasonable to ask our cooperators to make promises. This is common sense. If you have different views, you also can give voice to them. However, since an agreement (be it oral or written) has been reached, both parties should observe and fulfill it. 3. We have never said that these two movies had any political problems. The key lies in the fact that movie producers have violated our relevant existing regulations. It is natural for us to handle these cases in accordance with relevant regulations. 4. Regarding the fact that the international film festival is going to show movies illegally produced without our administration's screening, our attitude toward and principle of handling this matter is consistent. As the Hong Kong Film Festival has breached its promises, we can no longer cooperate with them. Hence, we have decided not to enter the current Hong Kong Film Festival. Since three Chinese movies were shown in the Tokyo Film Festival when negotiations were going on, it was insignificant to withdraw the movies. 5. You should raise this question with the person in charge of the Hong Kong Film Festival. Over so many years in the past, we have always taken a positively supportive and sincerely cooperative attitude toward the Hong Kong International Film Festival and never have done anything that violated any regulations laid down by the film festival. However, unhappy events have occured for three years in a row (N.B.), which cannot but cast a shadow and bring about a certain impact on our future cooperation. How great the impact will be must depend on the way the Hong Kong Film Festival handles this incident. N.B. Apart from withdrawing movies this year, the unhappy events for three years in a row refer to an American independent producer's documentary called "Compassion in Exile," which was about the life of the Dalai Lama of Tibet. In the documentary, scenes were shown of Tibetans being beaten by People's Liberation Army soldiers, scenes which were shot secretly by Western journalists. At that time, the Chinese side lodged a protest with the Hong Kong Film Festival and asked for the banning of this documentary, but the film festival took no heed. This incident was widely covered by foreign news agencies. This year, two independently produced movies have been selected by the Hong Kong Film Festival. Although the Chinese side has not lodged an official protest with the film festival, it may be considered one of the unhappy events mentioned in the letter.
