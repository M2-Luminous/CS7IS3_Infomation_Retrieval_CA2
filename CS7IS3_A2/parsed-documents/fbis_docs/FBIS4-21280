That report noted that within the next few hours the National Security Council will discuss the Honduran Armed Forces' plan to break the Military Assistance Treaty with the United States -- a treaty that dates back to 1954. Reporter Roberto Reyes has more details on this. Reyes: Dr. Jorge Arturo Reina specifically noted that the legislative and executive branches today intend to review the Military Assistance Treaty between the United States and Honduras. Here is what he said when asked about this topic: [begin recording] Unidentified reporter, in progress: ...on what is a review of the Military Assistance Treaty with the United States? Reina: No, the meeting we attended did not deal with that issue. At this time, we are coming from a meeting the president held with the deputies from Francisco Morazan Department, but we did not touch on this topic. Reporter: Will there be a National Security Council meeting to review this topic? Reina: I think the president has proposed the advisability of a National Security Council meeting, but not only for that purpose, but also to address the problem of violence in an effort to get an overall view of this problem and a joint decision from all sectors of society [words indistinct]. Reporter: When will this meeting be held? Reina: I do not know. That will be announced by the president. Reporter: Do you agree with the [words indistinct] of the Armed Forces about the U.S.-Honduran military agreement? Second unidentified reporter: Will [words indistinct] to citizens of the country? Reina: Well, I have seen how the world has changed. A few years ago, we proposed the advisability of (reviewing) treaties. At that time, that was a taboo subject. Now it is prudent for Honduras to review any and all treaties to determine whether they are providing benefits and whether they are consistent with the nation's sovereignty. Nevertheless, I do not think we should portray this as a serious problem, because conditions exist for reviewing every international relationship, and, if the countries agree, they can discuss such topics. Reporter: What about the situation that arose today in Congress because of the questioning of the ENEE [National Enterprise for Electric Power] manager? What is goal of Congress in this? Reina: I think that in all of these cases -- in both the invitation Congress extended to the ENEE, as well as to Cohdefor [Honduran Corporation for Forest Development] -- there is no other goal but to have them explain to the Honduran people how difficult it is to resolve the country's extremely serious problems. Reporter: Now that you are in government, can you guarantee to the Honduran people that you are going to review the treaties and do what you always said you would do -- things you said you would do even before you were a university leader and [words indistinct]? Reina: Well, we continue to maintain the same unwavering position. That has never changed. World conditions have changed, however. In terms of the U.S. Palmerola base, to which I assume you are referring, it has been proposed that it be turned into a base for combating drug trafficking instead of a military base in the old sense of the word -- the kind of base that has traditionally existed in Latin American countries. Reporter: Congress has had a commission discussing this. At least Mr. Rafael Pineda Ponce spoke about this in a report we aired. Reina: That is correct. We think treaties must be reviewed in terms of today's climate and based on the [words indistinct] most advisable for Honduras' national interests. In this sense, I think that there will be unity among the Honduran people and that, in the end, the best thing will be done. Reporter: [words indistinct] the North Americans? Reina: I think that recently the North Americans have been maintaining a symbolic troop presence. However, I also think there is something more important. The presence of U.S. forces during the Cold War had a significance that was very different from what it now has that the Cold War no longer exists. In addition, the idea that has been proposed to turn Palmerola into a base from which to wage a war against international drug trafficking, which is a transnational crime, completely changes the nature of the symbolic U.S. presence and would give Honduras greater control of the installations, which would be used precisely to fight drug trafficking. Reporter: But these are foreign troops in the country, regardless of their objective. Reina: The presence of a large number would make no sense. Any assistance needed to operate equipment and needed to train Hondurans to operate equipment would be highly beneficial for Honduras and the region. Reporter: In short, would Congress be supporting the review of that military treaty with the United States? Reina: Well, the discussion of that topic has not been concluded. It has to be discussed more carefully, but you can be sure that the executive branch and the Congress are defending Honduras' national interests above anything else. Reporter: What is the (position) of the executive branch in this case? What has the president told you in this regard? Reina: About what? Reporter: About [words indistinct]. Reina: We have not discussed this topic. We have only commented on how conditions have changed and on how it is now possible to discuss any topic without this being seen as an unfriendly act against another country. Reporter: [words indistinct] Reina: He will be the one [words indistinct]. [end recording] Reyes: This is what Congress Vice President Jorge Arturo Reina has said. He confirmed that the National Security Council will be meeting specifically to discuss this topic and that the executive and the legislative branches are willing to review the issue of U.S. military assistance to Honduras.
