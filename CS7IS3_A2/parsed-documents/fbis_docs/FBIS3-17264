The sides examined a question of extreme important both for the Baltic Fleet command and for the Kaliningrad Oblast administration: the construction by the Lithuanian "Selma" association of housing for the units which are being withdrawn from the Baltic states. As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already described, after the Lithuanian special services had arrested "Selma" President Vladas Laurinavicius, to whom the Russian Federation defense minister was to have presented, during a trip to Kaliningrad, the Russian Government's directive stipulating the terms for extinguishing our debt to the firm, the construction has been threatened with disruption. On the day we arrived in Vilnius the Lithuanian newspapers published a series of articles about the scandal involving the "Selma" president's arrest. RESPUBLIKA, for instance, published a photograph of Laurinavicius with the following caption: "Search among military and their business partners." LIETUVOS RYTAS had "Russian Generals Make Strategic Withdrawals," and so forth. "The Lithuanian side's position is unequivocal," Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius stated repeatedly at the talks. "We shall continue the construction." As for the arrest of "Selma's" general director, Lithuania's general prosecutor, Arturas Paulauskas, gave the following explanation: "When Laurinavicius' apartment was searched TNT was discovered. He was arrested. I saw the TNT, there are little holes in which a charge can be inserted...." Actually this explanation from the general prosecutor made even Jonas Gyachas, deputy minister of national defense, smile.... At the meeting Yuriy Semenovich Matochkin raised a question which is a painful one for the oblast today -- the question of the transit of freight transport across Lithuania. These and other questions will be discussed in Kaliningrad 24 March when a working group headed by Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladislav Domarkas will arrive here. And here is the official assessment of the meeting. Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius: "`Selma' is carrying out a very large program of construction in Kaliningrad. The first contract concluded between the Russian Armed Forces leadership and the Lithuanian Government has already been fulfilled. Now a commercial contract is being fulfilled with the `Selma' association. The arrest of `Selma's' president worried Minister Mr. Grachev and the Kaliningrad Oblast and Baltic Fleet leadership. That is why today's meeting was necessary. We confirmed that the Lithuanian Government will make every effort to ensure that the construction of residential regions in Kaliningrad does not cease." Yuriy Matochkin, head of the Kaliningrad Oblast administration: "The aim of our trip is to convince ourselves that the incident involving the arrest of the `Selma' president should in no way influence working relations between Kaliningrad Oblast and the Lithuanian Republic, that the construction of the residential region in which the inhabitants of the oblast and the Lithuanians working on the construction site are both interested should not stop. I note with satisfaction that here we have encountered the understanding of Mr. prime minister." Admiral Vladimir Yegorov, commander of the Baltic Fleet: "`Selma' is constructing for us on credit. The fleet's debts to the association are about 3 billion rubles. For us it is important to retain the pace of construction and increase it in the future. And we are very distressed that this incident involving `Selma' President Vladas Laurinavicius has occurred...."
