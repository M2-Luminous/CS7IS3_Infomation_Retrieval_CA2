Since the beginning of 1993, industry and commerce administrative departments at various levels have stepped up efforts to construct infrastructural hard facilities for markets, actively nurturing and perfecting markets and strengthening market supervision. Last year, the region spent a total of 11.62 million yuan to build, in a systematic and planner manner, 23 markets of various kinds, covering 32,788 square meters of ground space. As of the end of December, there were 99 markets with a total of over 100,000 square meters of ground space in Tibet. They have, to a certain extent, improved the appearance of narrow streets crowded with open-air stalls and peddlers. Last year, transactions from urban and rural trade fairs totaled more than 900 million yuan, representing a 21.6 percent increase over 1992 and accounting for 47.36 percent of the total volume of the region's retailed sales. Lhasa's Chongsaikang Comprehensive Market, the largest market in Tibet, set a record 300 million yuan in transactions. Along with improved infrastructural facilities for markets, the variety and structure of markets have gradually developed from trade fairs and specialized markets to capital goods and comprehensive markets. Street stalls and peddlers now have permanent operational sites and facilities; and markets, which used to be run by individual traders, are now owned by the state, collective, private, and individual sectors of the economy. An open and comprehensive new system of market networks with local characteristics has taken shape. Last year, the industry and commerce administrative departments also actively introduced an enterprise registration system in a bid to help state enterprises change their operating mechanisms and promote their healthy development. The establishment of a legal independent registration system was a major breakthrough achieved by the administration for industry and commerce. As of the end of December, 3,485 state and collective enterprises had completed registration with a total of 3,944,020 yuan [figure as published] in registered capital. Of these, 855 enterprises with 829,540 yuan [figure as published] in registered capital completed registration in 1993, up 31.3 percent and 26.6 percent, respectively, over 1992. The number of foreign-funded enterprises increased from six in 1992 to 27, with a total registered capital of $24.75 million; and 129 foreign firms were approved to set up offices in Tibet, an increase of 370 percent over 1992. Last year, Tibet accepted 20 applications for trademark registration and approved the registration of five trademarks. So far, there are nine registered trademarks in Tibet. More than 260,000 advertisements were published, and their total business volume exceeded 1 million yuan for the first time, reaching 1.13 million yuan. Last year the individual sector of the economy expanded steadily while private-owned enterprises multiplied. As of the end of December, there were 41,830 industrial and commercial units run by individuals; and the number was basically the same as the preceding year. They employed 65,579 people and had a total of 174.46 million yuan in registered capital, up 73.9 percent and 71.64 percent, respectively, over 1992. There were 60 registered privately-owned enterprises and their registered capital was 13.31 million yuan, representing a 330 percent and 230 percent increase, respectively, over 1992 and showing a strong momentum of continued fast growth. Revenues from industrial and commercial units run by individuals in Tibet last year are expected to reach 26 million yuan.
