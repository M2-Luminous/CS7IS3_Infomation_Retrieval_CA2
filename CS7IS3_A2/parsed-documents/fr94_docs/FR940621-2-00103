FR940621-2-00103 FR940621-2-00065 Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Advanced NMR Systems, Inc., Common Stock, $0.01 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;7694 June 14, 1994. Advanced NMR Systems, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''). The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following: According to the Exchange, the Board of Directors of the Company (the ``Board''), pursuant to lawfully delegated authority, unanimously approved resolutions on January 14, 1994 to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the PSE and the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'') (a separate application for delisting was filed with the Commission by the BSE on February 7, 1994). The decision of the Board was based upon the belief that the listing of the Common Stock on the PSE was no longer beneficial to the Company, as the Company and its stockholders can achieve increased market visibility through registration on the NASDAQ National Market System (``NMS''). At the end of 1993, the Company met the NMS eligibility standards, and a listing thereon was approved by NASDAQ by letter dated February 2, 1993, a copy of which is attached to the application as Exhibit 1. The Board believes that the Company will achieve greater investor access through national trading of its shares, and will maintain access through the NMS to many of the same West Coast-based investor markets that it currently has as a result of its association with the PSE. It is primarily due to this potential redundancy that the Company seeks to delist its shares on the PSE. Any interested person may, on or before July 6, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
