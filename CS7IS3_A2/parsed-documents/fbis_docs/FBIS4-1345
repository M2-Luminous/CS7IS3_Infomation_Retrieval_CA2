IEC electoral administration training head Kumi Naidoo told a news briefing most delays had happened in the Pretoria Witwatersrand Vereeniging region where ballot papers and other election materials were scheduled to be delivered last. IEC monitors had reported 246 incidents of disruption at voting stations countrywide by late morning Tuesday. About 175 cases related to difficulties in distributing election material, reporters were told. Mr Naidoo said problems had been resolved "at this stage" and, if not, he expected them to be resolved within a short time. Voting at Robben Island -- prison "home" to many of the candidates standing in this week's election -- was delayed when the ferry broke down. But the IEC and correctional services officials were grateful for the general smooth running of voting at prisons around the country, Mr Naidoo added. Problems at Ulundi -- power base of Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi -- and other parts of KwaZulu/Natal had also been sorted out, Mr Naidoo told the lunch hour news briefing. Mr Naidoo confirmed two trucks ferrying ballot papers to polling stations in Thokoza and Katlehong on the East Rand had been attacked and burned on Tuesday. The IEC was making arrangements to stock up the stations with ballot papers for Wednesday. He could not confirm the hijacking of another truck with ballot papers in Pretoria. Referring to the failure of monitors to show up at voting stations, Mr Naidoo said this had happened mostly in KwaZulu/Natal. Planning of voting stations in this region had been undertaken at the last moment and this explained the delays. Voting had started in Ulundi, he added. It was up to election officials at voting stations to decide if they would keep the polling stations open after 7PM, the scheduled closing time. Presiding officers would consider security at each station. Many voters -- not eligible to vote on Tuesday because they were not infirm, disabled or members of the security forces -- had arrived and this had contributed to the delays. "Problems must be seen in the context of these elections. The IEC's major concern is to allow every eligible voter to cast a ballot," Mr Naidoo said. He appealed for voter patience.
