Gennadiy Ivanov, the chief of the Directorate for Military Construction and Reforms, told our correspondent Marian Chernukha how this program is being assessed at the Russian Defense Ministry: [Begin Ivanov recording] As our president recognized that there is a need to join this agreement, we, the military, would like to confirm that we are ready to do so, but Russia has its own approaches. It does not mean that we should join the Partnership for Peace on conditions set to us by NATO. We have our own approaches and ideas. They do not run contrary to this cooperation, but deepen it. We have difficulties. In principle, this idea should be taken into account. We are already bringing it into effect. This was confirmed by our Foreign Ministry -- the military were never against it -- but its forms and methods should be in the interests of both European and Russian security. We do not oppose joint exercises. We are not against joint symposiums and conferences. We do not oppose the bodies that will be affiliated to NATO and who could work out decisions jointly. We have already submitted a plan -- it is in NATO now -- and we are waiting for a response and results. [end recording]
