Executed in the city of Moscow on 15 April 1994 in one authentic copy in Russian. The authentic copy shall be stored in the Archives of the Government of the Belarusian Republic, which shall send a notarized copy of it to states signing this Agreement. The Agreement was signed by: The Republic of Azerbaijan, the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Georgia, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, the Republic of Uzbekistan and Ukraine. FROM THE EDITOR: A protocol decision signed by Chairman of the Council of the Heads of Governments of the CIS and Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation Viktor Chernomyrdin discusses the need "for drafting proposals on the procedure for using the above-named documents, and for submitting them for examination to the next meeting of the Council of the Heads of Governments of the CIS." It should be added to this that time is of essence, since after all, this has to do with elderly and, as a rule, ailing people. We will hope that there will be no problems in the procedure of using the documents, while on the other hand, the Agreement itself also provides wide room for initiative, and for loving assistance to our veterans, no matter where in the former Union they may find themselves today.
