PANPRA in its monthly bulletin calls on democratic forces to create an historic, centrist, pluralist bloc and a legitimate constitutional transitional government of broad concord to fight political violence. The socialist organization points out that all of the conservative forces have mobilized into a paramilitary organization with declared political ambitions, FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti]. Enjoying great impunity, this organization has imposed a nationwide campaign of intimidation, backed by blind, monstrous, indiscriminate violence. PANPRA adds that the poorest supporters of the president-in-exile often must choose between enrolling in FRAPH or being unbearably harassed. PANPRA further criticizes the attitude of the international community, which is showing its true colors by playing the humanitarian samaritan while reinforcing the embargo. It can be assured that if President Aristide ever returns, all that will be left for him to govern will be zombis, piles of garbage, and a desert country.
