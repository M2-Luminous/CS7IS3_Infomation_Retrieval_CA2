The area was declared a closed military zone and settlers were requested to leave. Eleven settlers who refused were taken into custody. A spokesman for the This Is Our Land condemned the actions of the Kfar Tapuah settlers and said his group's aim was to settle on state land, not to take over private Arab homes. The committee of Jordan Valley settlements is planning to establish a special patrol unit to be known as the Jordan Valley Watch. It will carry out regular patrols in the Jordan Valley, including the territorial corridors due under the proposed autonomy accord to link Jericho to nearby Muslim and Christian holy sites and to the northern Dead Sea area. The spokesman for the committee told Qol Yisra'el that the patrols have a deterrent purpose and are aimed also to demonstrate an Israeli presence on the Jordan Valley roads.
