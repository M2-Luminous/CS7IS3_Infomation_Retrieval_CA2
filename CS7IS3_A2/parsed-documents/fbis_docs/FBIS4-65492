In total, 38 "Mirage 5's" and roughly 20 F-16's are stored there in ultramodern hangars. In fact, Weelde is the largest air base in Belgium, and it is there that combat aircraft await potential buyers. "These aircraft have somehow plunged into lethargy," Lieutenant General Guido Vanhecke, the Air Force commander, said, addressing journalists from the Aviation Press Club (APC). The so-called Delcroix Plan for restructuring the Armed Forces has obliged the Air Force to downgrade its latest "Mirage" hunter-bombers, 20 of which are currently being modernized, and to withdraw from service some 35 of its F-16's. While awaiting a potential buyer, preferably another state, these machines have been gathered in Weelde, at one of NATO's spare aerodromes. [passage omitted]
