A detailed document by the Permanent International Relations Commission of the National Assembly of the People's Government handed to this reporter explains key aspects of this aggressiveness, which endangers our national peace and security. The document states, among other things, Cuba is living today under a partial military blockade despite statements by high-ranking U.S. political leaders who have ruled out the possibility of a military intervention on the island. In this regard, it notes the decision to recondition the Air Force Base in Homestead, Florida, which was destroyed by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and which was scheduled to be shut down in early 1993. The reconditioning of this installation adds to the increase in the number of planes and activity at the Key West Air and Naval Station, located only 90 miles from the Cuban coasts, and to the deployment of some 60 warships off Cuba's eastern coast under the pretense of the Haitian crisis. U.S. warplanes flew a little more than 64,000 missions over the Florida strait during the last three years. During the first half of 1993 more than 5,600 missions were flown, some only 60 km away from Cuban territory. The Cuban parliament has reported U.S. military forces are constantly conducting surveillance operations of all kinds all over Cuba. It is a growing trend as can be seen during the first 10 months of 1993, when 88 flights of this kind had already taken place versus the 45 flights that took place in 1991. Likewise, the maintenance of Guantanamo Naval Base is part of the political pressure against Cuba. More than 220 violations and provocations against Cuban guards occurred between 1990 and 1993 from that enclave. In addition during the first half of 1993 alone a total of 168 ships of different types visited the base, where six military exercises of various characteristics were conducted. To this dangerous military buildup we may add during this same period the intentions of terrorists groups based in the United States to attack Cuba. The leaders of some of these groups have been arrested, but no judicial ruling regarding these groups has been issued. Other Aggressions Less visible but still persistent tensions regarding Cuba may be found on the airwaves. Cuba is bombarded by 15 radio stations with more than 200 hours a day of anti-Cuban programming aimed "at spreading fear and uncertainty, fanaticism and insanity, and promoting unscrupulous and unethical behaviors." U.S. federal agencies allocated in the last few years more than $150 million for the promotion of these broadcasts, many of which violate international conventions, misrepresent the truth, and conduct other actions aimed at promoting everything from subversion and disillusion to desertions every day. This field, called "migratory aggression," has been turned into a "subversive political component" by U.S. presidents to encourage the departure of illegal aliens, to create internal difficulties in Cuba, and to "encourage an international campaign that can distort and hurt Cuba's image abroad." If Cubans constitute only .25 percent of the legal immigrants who arrived in U.S. territory during the last fiscal year and 2.04 percent of the illegal refugees, why is Cuban immigration such a disproportionate issue with such enormous propaganda? The use of this issue as a weapon to attempt to discredit Cuba has been a constant element in the past three decades. Even though Cuban authorities have allowed the freedom to emigrate in the past few years, the obstacles, the whimsical selective nature of the permits given, and the clear discriminatory policy toward what Washington accepts as eligible all preclude the normalization of the migratory movement. Meanwhile, the outlook for the area is critical, and in this regard the document mentions the existence of hundreds of thousands of illegal Mexican aliens who are virtually suffering conditions of slavery in the United States, not to mention the thousands who are captured and deported as they attempt to enter clandestinely into the country. In view of this outlook, the Cuban legislators believe their country has done everything possible to find a sensible and civilized solution to the confrontation with the U.S. Government, which is not limited to the economic, trade, and financial blockade against the island for the past three decades. That is why they believe the solution to the conflict does not lie in permanently asking Cuba to make changes to its social organization, rather, to "promote external conditions so the aspirations to improve the social model freely chosen by the Cuban people can effectively take place." To achieve this the Cuban legislators say "the United States is the one that needs to be pressured by demanding a change to its obsolete and irrational policy toward Cuba."
