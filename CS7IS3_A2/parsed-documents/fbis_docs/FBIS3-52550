He said they also discussed the situation in many areas and bilateral relations. Musa was speaking at a joint news conference held with the Italian foreign minister following their talks today. Musa noted first that President Husni Mubarak received the Italian foreign minister this morning. The Italian foreign minister said he had the honor of meeting President Mubarak and left with the impression that the president is determined to achieve peace in the area. He noted that the Egyptian-Italian talks covered developments in the area, the peace process, and the situation in the Gulf region. He paid tribute to the effort to achieve Middle East peace and expressed Italy's hope that the efforts will achieve their goals, especially in this vital region. He said he hopes a Palestinian solution will be achieved despite the obstacles. He said they discussed Somalia and noted that he will discuss this problem and achieving security and stability there when he meets U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Brussels on Monday. He explained that Italy realizes the importance of solving the Somali problem before the UN forces withdraw next March to prevent anarchy. Andreatta added that Italy, which currently chairs the European Conference on Security and Cooperation, submitted a plan to increase cooperation with the Arab states. It included granting observer's status to Egypt, Morocco, and Algeria. The Italian foreign minister said he asked Foreign Minister Musa, in his talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who is scheduled to visit Cairo on 16 January, to include the issue of increasing European cooperation with Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco. He added that he and Musa also discussed bilateral relations. He said that despite the economic difficulties facing Italy, it will continue to provide assistance for development projects in Egypt. On Bosnia, the Italian foreign minister said that despite the European Union's efforts, no agreement has been reached among the three parties to solve the problem. This has prompted the European countries to consider withdrawing their forces from Bosnia in an attempt to pressure the three parties to accept a peaceful solution to the problem. The Italian foreign minister explained Italy's views on the GATT Agreement. He emphasized that it will free international trade and will not work at the expense of the developing countries. It will open markets to the products of the developing world, especially as tariffs will be reduced by 50 percent. Commenting on this issue, Foreign Minister Musa said that while international cooperation in international trade must be established, the talks in the Uruguay round took place mainly among the developed countries to serve their own interests and against the interests of the developing countries in some fields, particularly agricultural and food products. He said the situation demands considering the interests of the developing countries and assisting them in a specific period to reform their economies and increase their production to enable them to compete. Musa concluded the news conference, saying that in such circumstances, the agreement works in favor of the rich countries. He called for cooperation between the developing and developed countries to achieve the interests of both parties.
