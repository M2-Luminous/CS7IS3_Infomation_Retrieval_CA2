He also demanded a withdrawal from the Navy Base at Guantanamo, Cuba, from the Panama Canal, and other Latin American countries in his speech before the Fourth Ibero-American Summit meeting here. The Cuban leader referred to the so-called hemispheric event scheduled by the U.S. Government in Miami in December, and he said it would provide an opportunity to demand an end to the "criminal and unfair blockade against Cuba." After referring to the summit agenda, he said that if those topics are discussed, "Cuba wishes them success," but he noted that everything could boil down to "an attempt to establish a course in the hemisphere to isolate Cuba; to take control of markets in Latin America and the Caribbean; and to check Europe, Japan, and the rest of the world." In that case, he added, one would have to paraphrase Jose Marti, a Cuban national hero, when a similar event was held in Washington 105 years ago: "The time has come for Spanish America to declare its second independence."
