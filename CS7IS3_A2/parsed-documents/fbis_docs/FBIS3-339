A large quantity of arms and ammunition disappeared last night. The armory guard is said to have left his guard post to have something to eat between 2100 and 2130. When he returned he found the armory door ajar. Seven rocket launchers, [name indistinct] automatic pistols, assault rifles, magazines, and 300 cartridges had already disappeared. The camp officials were alerted and an initial search led to the discovery of some cartridges but most of the arms and ammunition are still missing. This theft, which is not the first at the Ouidah Camp, is happening at a time when security problems have increased and tension has risen slightly after the CFA franc devaluation.
