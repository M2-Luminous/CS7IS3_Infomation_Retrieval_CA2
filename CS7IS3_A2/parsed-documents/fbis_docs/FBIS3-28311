Then, how can the Japanese manufacturing industry, which strayed into a "black forest," find its way out? Technological Innovations Reach Interim Stage It is apparent that the Japanese manufacturing industry will be on the verge of a crisis if the current downtrend continues. However, discussions that needlessly incite crises are not helpful. It is essential, especially at this time, to reexamine the "map" of our macro and micro measures, find the way out of the black forest into which Japanese industries blundered and identify the direction leading to a reliable course. When Schumpeter analyzed the Great Depression of the 1930's, he studied the capabilities of the then main industries, such as automobiles, steel, chemicals, etc., and concluded that these industries were not in a particularly deplorable state and, to explain why such a serious depression resulted despite that, he turned his attention to the overall stage setting of industrial operations. Though today's Japanese industries have their respective problems, they are not as dilapidated as the U.S. industries were over 10 years ago and they have not lost competitive power like the current high-tech industries of Europe. However, it is certain that they are lost in the forest and, to escape, they must examine what kind of forest it is and where they are situated topographically. To do that, first, the so-called map of long-range changes in technological innovations, which are the bases of industrial developments, will be reviewed and the terrain of our present position will be described. The cyclical theory that long-term variations in technological innovations are simply repetitious occurrences is difficult to accept per se, but the conclusion of our evaluations of corroborative researches made from various viewpoints is that the possibility is extremely strong that technological innovations will face a turning point around 1995. In other words, as widely reported, the present is an interim stage of technological innovations, when the wave of old technologies has peaked and the wave of new technologies has not arrived yet. This viewpoint that it is an interim stage is a factor adding to confusion in the industrial sector. Reengineering To explain our points briefly, the simple sketch shown in Figure 1 [not reproduced] was drawn. This sketch was drawn with the present Japanese situation in mind--when a single technological innovation appears and reaches the matured stage, the technological system becomes complicated and multiple interactions are required for the innovation, and when the cumulative interactions exceed the critical point, discontinuous changes begin to appear. We call this type of jump "systemic innovation." As for concrete examples, the "new synthetic textile," discussed later is a good sample. However, simultaneously, the next wave of technological innovations begins to overlap and the theoretical development of a new paradigm is already apparent. To put it concretely, the first wave dealt with electronics-related technological innovations and the next wave deals with molecular biology and nuclear engineering. The crucial point is that there are interactions between the performances of the former system and the theoretical deployment of the latter system. For example, in the case of the "new synthetic textile," progress is already being made toward another new fabric through the influence of molecular biology. An equally important point is that the two waves are overlapping the transitional stage toward an information/communication-based infrastructure in the economic world. With these waves overlapping, the viewpoint that Japanese industries are at an interim stage of technological innovations is valid one. The assessment of the interim stage will influence decisions and it is important to acknowledge that this is the border of twofold opportunities in the sense mentioned earlier. To say that opportunities are twofold might sound optimistic but the significance lies in the following two points: 1. The simple wait-and-see attitude or interim viewpoint that technological innovations are exhausted, so to speak, and the next wave must be awaited is not interpreting the present situation correctly and will not lead the way out of the present labyrinth. Even if the application of superconductivity, biotechnology, nuclear engineering, etc. must be awaited for full-scale technological innovations, the foundation of their development will be the present electronics technology. That such a future can be clearly foreseen is providing enterprises the perseverance to continue current technological developments. 2. Changes and innovations are the focal points of current problems, but it is not possible to start afresh and redesign. In assessing the problem, it is important to be prepared for full-scale systemic reforms but, as long as the economic system and organization are severely restricted by technologies, the correct interpretation of the technological and economic paradigm of present-day Japan is the best and basic course for systemic reforms and organizational changes. At present, the concept of corporate "reengineering" is in vogue in the United States and is attracting attention in Japan too, but the point that is stressed, "return to the starting point and redesign business operations," should not be misunderstood. To return to the starting point does not mean to start afresh with a clean slate. It means to determine again, on a map, the course that was pursued intently up until now, clearly identify one's position, and plot a new course for business operations. As evident from the foregoing discussion, Japanese reengineering is actually only superposing and it should be undertaken as a "process" linked to market changes. There is a difference between that process and the method of readjusting while maintaining the status quo, and clarification of that subtle difference is the important point for consideration at this time. Future Production of Goods Let us proceed now to concrete discussions. First, with reference to the aforementioned return to the "starting point," where should that point be placed? In the case of Japan, that is the "production of goods" which closely followed technological innovations. Despite the software age and the substantial advancement of service industries, that point remains the same. The starting point, which enabled Japanese industry to develop to this stage, was the universally unprecedented elimination of segregation between blue- and white-collar workers and the concentration of knowledge, know-how, skills, and intellect on production of goods. However, the direction to go from this starting point is not sheer production of goods. It should be information-based production, production processes with high information and intelligence content, and not just single-item production, but systematized production. Needless to say, Japanese production will not be profitable unless it develops to that stage if the present yen appreciation continues. To state it so there would be no misunderstanding, in an age when software and designing have become vital, it does not mean that Japanese industry can be rebuilt by ignoring them. It does mean that if reconstruction is considered with the past development route, and with the technologies and financial resources accumulated during that process as the starting point, to put it succinctly, the direction toward "information- and knowledge-intensive production" will be found. The concrete task of Japanese-style reengineering is to consider the organizational aspects of how to combine software designing with manufacturing capability and how to raise the software ratio while increasing the interactions between them. Japanese industries will be divided into three main categories and the basic points of each will be discussed below. Classified from an overall standpoint, Japanese industries can be divided into three groups--"intellectual industry," "industrial resources industry," and "consumer system industry"--and with respect to each, industrial characteristics vary and the method and organization for rebuilding also differ. Intellectual Industry In this industry where companies are striving for leadership in the global competition, the considerable lead taken by the United States is one of the main causes of anxiety about the future of Japanese enterprises. In the architectural competetion to organize and integrate basic software and microprocessor units, U.S. corporations, such as Intel and Microsoft, are the dominant leaders and Japanese companies are not even in the race at the moment. That is why the outlook does not look as bright as it did during the period after the past oil crises when Japan restructured its industries by taking the initiative to introduce electronics technology. It is true that architectural standardization of equipment related and geared to computers is important and future competition will greatly affect the profits of enterprises involved, but that is not the sole purpose of the competition. The ultimate objective is to provide a combination of hardware, software, and services that will satisfy corporate and individual users. In the software competition, too, basic software (operating system) is certainly important, but not exclusively. Recently, Japanese computer manufacturers are trying to adopt the strategy of "solution business," intended to present to users solutions to problems of the overall system, and though it might be an option they had to select because they were lagging in the architectural race, it can be said to be viable as a strategic goal. Unless concrete images of information-based organizational innovations can be visualized beyond the architectural race, the demand for computers will not be revived by this competition. This argument is especially valid from our standpoint that the present time is the turning point for the basic infrastructure. Infrastructural conversion is not accomplished by a sudden switch to an entirely new order but is advanced by taking actions to complement the existing infrastructure and in the case of building a new information and communication infrastructure, too, truly diverse tasks covering the entire spectrum of hardware, software, and services are essential. To accomplish that, it is important to learn what needs exist in society as well as what information-processing and work capability the end users in the respective work sites should possess so there are many economic opportunities in the "solution business," which points out options. In the semiconductor industry, Japan is ahead in DRAM [dynamic, random-access memory] development, but lags in MPU [microprocessor unit] logic. Both are needed, of course, in personal computers and work stations and, when integrated into a system, electric power consumption must be kept to a minimum. Therefore, even if the United States is leading in MPU's, there is the third alernative of low power consumption where Japan can display its strength. This third course is not very profitable, but reduction of computer power consumption, which is already becoming a big problem, is compatible with the basic move toward an information-oriented, earth-conscious environment. Particularly in the case of Japan, because the information technology is notably lagging in the public sector for various reasons, fortunately or unfortunately, tasks to be performed have piled up and the current recession presents an excellent opportunity to tackle them governmentally. The problem is that what is essential is not hardware but software, so the urgent policy measure in the allocation of public investments is to increase the software ratio. In essence, the problem is not the lack of financial resources, but their distribution, and the task can be accomplished if the present regime changes the financial allocations as they have promised publicly. Working toward the policy goal of creating an age of "everywhere computing," when computers can be used by anyone, anywhere and anytime, and computers become a natural part of daily living, will provide the Japanese intellectual industry with a clear direction to follow. Industrial Resources Industry By the industrial resources industry, we refer to the overall industry concerned with intermediate resources, such as machinery parts, machine tools, robots, etc., that support the manufacturing industry. These industries are fully capable of carrying out our "systemic innovations," by thoroughly dismantling the product manufacturing processes and upgrading each, and then, reintegrating them. Also, these products are indispensable to the industrial sophistication of Asian nations and the construction of new plants by the former socialist countries and on a near-term basis, a strong effective demand is awaiting in countries which can be supplied through industrial channels and cooperative network. Despite that, these industries are suffering from the recession simply because of the cyclical effect resulting from the lack of effective demand within Japan. Particularly in the case of the machine tool industry, which depends heavily on the level of plant and equipment investment, the decline in private equipment outlay is exerting a serious effect. In the United States, during the recession of 1980's, machine tool capacity was curtailed because that problem could not be overcome and that caused the deterioration of the U.S. manufacturing industry. If the starting point of Japan's international competitive power is thought to be "production" capability, in the aforementioned sense, effective demand must be created through macro measures to prevent the cutback of that capability, and repetition of the U.S. mistake must be avoided. There is no reason why effective demand measures of that moderate extent cannot be enacted. Another facet that must be dealt with policy-wise is how to maintain the vital segment of the small enterprise network which supports the base of the machinery industry. The small factories in the downtown districts of Tokyo and Osaka are not simple groupings of small enterprises. As I have said before, this small enterprise network constitutes a delicate and important base of Japan's manufacturing capability through its capacity for speedy trial manufacturing and production of special order parts requiring unique skills, and its flexible operational setup for specialization and cooperation. It is a technical grouping that is rare in the world. The loss of this capability would be a fatal blow to Japanese production capacity. However, at present, this group is clearly facing a crisis. But at the same time, surprisingly handsome factories, which do not even look like factories, have begun to appear recently. Therefore, especially during this business slump, the new factory law, etc., should be aggressively pushed and governmental efforts should be made to revive and maintain this important segment of the technical group as part of the urban development endeavor. By advancing deregulation, the urban plans which were set back at the final stage can be revived and domestic demand can certainly be created. Consumer System Industry By the conumer system industry, we refer to the group of industries that have a direct bearing on our lives, i.e., food, clothing, and shelter. The policy task facing Japan at present is how to systematize them and make them efficient and convenient to use, and in so doing, simultaneously expand domestic demand while eliminating foreign and internal price differentials. As concrete measures, here too, policies which deal with information services and earth environment must be promoted aggressively. First, the outlook for "clothing" is rather bright. The reason is that the technological innovation of producing new synthetic textiles, which might be called a typical example of "systemic innovation," has already appeared and is expanding the market. As for the new synthetic fabric, "the high sensitivity, which natural textiles do not possess, was attained by applying a combination of delicate spinning and skillful processing techniques to existing textiles." Universally speaking, its creation through the concerted action of a medium-sized Japanese textile manufacturer and a small textile processing enterprise in the Hokuriku District makes it an event to record. Even at this interim stage of technological innovations, an innovation of this type is possible by devising a new system and as a result, an old industry, called the textile industry, has been revived. This type of innovation produces a ripple effect of a desirable pattern. In fact, with Toray Industries, which represents the new synthetic textile industry, as the leader and with the support of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, numerous companies are cooperating to establish a so-called "fashion town" on the shores of Tokyo Bay. Information technologies are being used widely there and a worldwide exchange center in this field is being created. It is said that if fashion is included, the new synthetic textiles have reached a market scale surpassing automobiles. Needed now are systemic technological innovations that create demand, and policies to support them, including establishment of "centers" for worldwide mutual exchanges. Even in the field of "food," similar systematic innovations are about to take place. Innovations in the distribution sector are actually beginning to occur and the Japanese industrial system has begun to change in the field closest to our daily lives. The use of information technology by 7-11 stores has become too well-known and everyone takes it for granted, but the results are impressive. The important factors are that such advanced information know-how has spread to other distribution enterprises and other forms of businesses, and that such technologies and know-how can also be applied to recycling of commercial products and waste materials. The removal of regulations will probably further promote such activities. Speed in the spread and transfer of technologies and continued upgrading during that phase have been the superior aspects of the Japanese industrial system, but that mechanism has been obstructed by protective regulations in the distribution field. This is an excellent field in which to apply the fundamentals of information technology--openness and downsizing--and by their application in many industries that lag in efficiency and by their spread throughout the country, the consumer system industry can develop substantially toward an information-based, earth environment-conscious system. As for "shelter," the activities of Tostem Co., which is systematizing housing construction through use of certain building materials, and Secom Co., which is introducing technology in daily livelihood mainly through residential security services, can be called information-based creative innovations aimed at developing a full-fledged consumer system industry. Even among research institutes under the jurisdiction of the Construction Ministry, there are estimates that housing construction costs are nearly 20 percent higher than in Europe and the United States, and some builders claim costs are 50 percent higher. Together with the promotion of construction materials import, it should be possible to lower costs by about 20 percent. Fortunately, land prices have already fallen nearly 20 percent so Japanese housing costs should drop considerably and demand can be expected to increase. This type of price decline, or elimination of foreign and domestic price differences, tends to be regarded as having a deflationary effect which will worsen the recession but, according to estimates of the "International Price Structure Research Institute," of which I am the director, if Japanese prices fall to the U.S. level through elimination of foreign-domestic price differences, real consumer expenditures will increase by 20 percent per capita through the price elasticity effect of demand. If the planning begins for the information-based infrastructure, which we propose, the livelihood system industries affecting "shelter" will begin to operate in earnest and will probably change our living pattern. If that cannot be accomplished, Japan will not be able to stave off international criticism. Start "Reflective" Actions Based on this analysis, Japanese industries have not lost the capability to rebuild nor are they incapable of determining the future course. To take Schumpeter's example referenced at the beginning, the results of our industrial capacity analysis, undertaken to clarify the causes of recession, should not at all lead us to despair. If that is so, the blame for the causes of recession would tend to be placed on the failure of government policies, but such recriminations are not productive. It is important to analyze and understand the real reasons for the failure and not only the government but companies and consumers, too, as well as the market, had failed in greater or lesser degrees. As stated at the beginning, the essential attitude is to reexamine the map in the black forest into which one strayed, confirm the present location of each, and start "reflective" actions. Reflective in this sense does not carry a moral significance and means reflective actions, as used in self-organizational evaluations, to create new activities to cope with new information. If the foregoing arguments are analyzed and a reliable course is plotted from the general map of Japanese industries, that would point to the aggressive development of a consumer system industry centered on information and earth environment. It is essential for companies and consumers, as well as the government, to react in response to the determined course and the self-organized combined and cumulative efforts will create the strength to override this severe recession. The organizational principle of the New Deal, which triggered the recovery from the Great Depression of the 1930's, was to "involve" various organizations in its operations. That was made possible by the attraction of the New Deal "banner" and the grassroots movements of the people who responded. In the present context, that would be self-organizational actions directed toward information utilization and earth environment preservation. Open standards and downsizing are affecting the computer industry significantly at present, but they are not limited to the computer sector. Openness means that information will be displayed publicly, and downsizing is, literally, reducing to a smaller scale. This is the age of an open world where information is publicly disclosed and small-scale equipment and activities link into a network to perform big jobs. If systemic reforms and organizational changes are tackled after an earnest study of the true nature of information technologies, the result will not be decontrol and clever organizational reform just for appearance sake. What we need now are mutual interactions between economics and politics to change the system and organization themselves reactively as a "process" to such market movements, and our determination to seek continuation of that action.
