During the meeting, the two sides discussed prospects of Arab cooperation and detente as well as efforts to clear the atmosphere and bolster inter-Arab relations. President Ben Bella praised continued Jordanian efforts to protect the holy places in holy Jerusalem and to maintain the Arabism of Jerusalem against the Israeli siege imposed on it and Israel's continued efforts to Judaize it. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, could you give us an idea about your meeting with his highness the crown prince this morning? [Ben Bella] I must say that I am not a visitor. I consider myself from this country. The crown prince is my brother. Frankly, it is a wedding day for me when I visit you. I came to take part in the celebrations of the third Hashemite-sponsored renovation of the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. I came to see my brothers and ask about them. We are really proud of you all. [Correspondent] Mr. President, how do you view talk in Algeria about prospects of dialogue between the Algerian Government and the Islamic Salvation Front? [Ben Bella] It is a serious dialogue and I believe it will bear fruit soon, God willing. The situation in Algeria is difficult but not in the way it is being exaggerated outside. I mean the situation is not easy, but the process of reaching an agreement and achieving national reconciliation is going on. Many elements, including the new president, are seeking to achieve national reconciliation. [Correspondent] The final question, Mr. President. Throughout your years of struggle, you always called for better inter-Arab relations for a better Arab future. How do you view inter-Arab relations now and efforts to clear the Arab atmosphere? [Ben Bella] I am satisfied with this. The issue of unity is a given. We must unite. The world is uniting. Europe is uniting. America even united with Mexico. How can we not unite? We must unite. God willing, we will achieve unity even though this will take time and even though there are obstacles. However, we must unite. To be or not to be. We will unite, God willing. [Correspondent] God willing, sir. [Ben Bella] Our conscience is united. Regardless of what governments may think, our conscience is united. We must unite, God willing. [Correspondent] God willing. Thank you Mr. President. [end recording]
