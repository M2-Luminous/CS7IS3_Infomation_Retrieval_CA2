[De Klerk] It should definitely increase the chances of having a free and fair election. Maybe that is putting it too negatively. It will ensure that a free and fair election can be held because there will be a high level of manpower in the security forces. It will, with the additional powers that they have, make it easier for them to maintain law and order and to safeguard the interest also of the voters. The regulations have been drawn, specifically so as to ensure that this state of emergency will be compatible with an election, and therefore the right of parties to hold meetings is an inherent right. They will be asked, however, to give notice so that proper protection can be arranged. Marches will still be allowed, although permission will have to be obtained. But free political activity has been written into the regulations (?just) subject to reasonable procedures. Those regulations have also been cleared with the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] so that the parties participating are basically happy with the arrangements made to ensure free political activity. On election day itself, it should definitely be to the advantage of an incident-free, or as incident free as possible. [Venter] What that means, Mr. President, is that you envisaged the state of emergency lasting up until and including the days of the elections.? [De Klerk] I really do -- if a wonder happens and everything calms down to such an extent that we can lift it sooner, we will look at that. In terms of the law, a state of emergency is imposed automatically for a year, but there is authority to lift it sooner. We would want to lift it as soon as circumstances permit. [Venter] Well, then many people say that an election under state of emergency are mutually exclusive, that you can't really have a free and fair election under a state of emergency? [De Klerk] Well, we've had quite a few in the past in South Africa. Although circumstances are now different... [Venter, interrupting] ... people the negative impression in fact? [De Klerk] Yes, but as I say, to the satisfaction also of the parties represented in the subcouncil, and of the representatives of the management committee of the TEC, special provision has been made to ensure compatibility between a free and fair election with free political activity on the one hand, and on the other hand simultaneously, the additional powers to the security forces to ensure that the public order is properly maintained, and that the public is effectively protected, because those are the main grounds for the decision. [Venter] Have you acquired to your satisfaction the agreement, if not in fact the full agreement, of all the parties in the TEC to the implementation of the state of emergency? [De Klerk] I don't think that all the parties will agree, but sufficient agreement in terms of the rules and procedures of the TEC has been obtained. They have said yes to the regulations. I didn't need their approval for the declaration. That was my decision, and my decision alone. And I would like to emphasize because I see some people are making political propaganda and say that we have declared this because of collusion between the government and the ANC, because the ANC actually wanted it, it is simply not true. I started mentioning the fact that we will, as a government, look into this option more than a week ago during a visit to Natal. In reply to your question, we've constantly monitored the situation. I've been briefed yesterday by our intelligence and security forces. I've been briefed this morning, and the decision to do so was taken at 09:30 by me. And I thereafter phoned Mr. Mandela, and thereafter phoned Chief Minister Buthelezi because I wanted them to be fully advised. [Venter] Now, mentioning Chief Minister Buthelezi, of course you have substantive agreement, (?which) is sufficient to allow you to carry on with the state of emergency and its implementation from within the TEC. But now, of course, Mr. Buthelezi and his Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] are not part of the TEC. Now can you tell us something about his reaction when you told him about it, and what do you expect? [De Klerk] I don't want to say what he said to me. He has made a statement since then, and from that also it is clear that he is critical of the decision, that he feels that his people on the ground will react negatively toward it. I hope that he will give a positive lead because this is not directed at the kwaZulu government. It is not directed at the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. This decision does not have a political motive. This decision is based on the necessity to stabilize kwaZulu-Natal, to bring the deaths to an end, to ensure that the climate is created where free and fair elections can take place, and to prevent further deaths and to protect people and their property. [Venter] Of the troops that will be deployed, are you intending that troops of the National Peace-Keeping Force should be deployed? [De Klerk] That is not being considered at the moment. All the planning is that it will be SADF [South African Defense Force] troops, and the deployment will take place in an incremental basis during the next week. It is also as a result of a general call-up which was made some time ago with the view to have a sufficiently high level of manpower for the whole of South Africa in the weeks running up to the elections, the election days itself, and the few days after the election. So it will be SADF. [Venter] So if you deploy troops, Mr. President, are you prepared to see them used in order to reach the objective that's set, mainly the holding of a free election? [De Klerk] Yes, obviously. That is not the main objective. It will flow from that. The main objective is to ensure that there will be public order, and to protect the public. But yes, it will flow from that, and yes we will use them, but they will act within the law and subject to the regulations. A state of emergency means that you give some additional powers that are not ordinarily available in terms of the ordinary laws of the day with regard to detention, with regards to the control of movement of people, with regard to searching, etc., etc. That will be clear from the regulations when they are shortly published. [Venter] But now talking about the ordinary law, the ordinary law for example contains provisions against the carrying of dangerous weapons in public, and many people will say that you have not adequately seen to the implementation of those laws up until now. [De Klerk] The regulations once again will contain provisions with regard to the public display of all dangerous weapons. It will also be sensitive inasmuch as one can under these circumstances toward recognizing traditions and cultures. What has been seen in the past in that regard is often a situation with too little policemen or security force people available, and with a large crowd of 10 or 20 thousand people, it is simply impossible to implement the law under such circumstances. I have seen public rallies, even also of the ANC, with traditional weapons visible, but mostly one saw that at IFP gatherings. And there were circumstances where it was actually practically impossible to implement the law because of too low a number of security force people. Once again implementation will become easier with a higher level of manpower. [Venter] Is that in fact the intention to implement the prohibition of the carrying of dangerous weapons? [De Klerk] It will be part of the regulation subject to certain exceptions. [Venter] Let's talk a little more about the reaction by Mr. Buthelezi. Now, it has been said that in the implementation of the state of emergency, the troops and the added security forces that will be sent in will work in conjunction with the kwaZulu Police. Now Mr. Buthelezi is the minister of police in kwaZulu, and he has spoken against the implementation. Doesn't that immediately create a difficulty in having two security forces? [De Klerk] Hopefully not. I don't regard that as a political issue. The security forces, the commanders on the ground will interact with the kwaZulu Police in kwaZulu Police areas. Chief Minister Buthelezi is also basically against the election. But as head of government, he committed himself to full cooperation, to ensure -- and also making available facilities and everything -- to ensure that an election can take place, and to ensure that those who want to vote will be able to vote. I therefore don't think that it is necessarily a problem. If, of course, there is a lack of cooperation, then that will create a situation which will have to be managed, and you can be assured it will then be managed. [Venter] Could you give us some idea of what could be involved if that cooperation isn't forthcoming, and I ask that question because it is a distinct likelihood at this stage, given what Mr. Buthelezi... [De Klerk, interrupting] I think it is speculative. He did not say that we would not have the cooperation of the kwaZulu. I think it is speculative at this stage. The legal position of the armed forces operating under the state of emergency is that they will have the powers that they have throughout kwaZulu-Natal, and that is their task. They will use those powers with discretion to ensure that the goals of the declaration -- namely, to maintain public order and to ensure the safety of the public -- will be served. [Venter] Do you expect, when you have your meeting next week with Mr. Buthelezi, King Goodwill Zwelithini, Mr. Mandela and yourself -- when you walk into that meeting, it's going to be a very much tenser and more difficult meeting than it would otherwise have been without the state of emergency. [De Klerk] It might be, but I think the meeting becomes even more important. But may I just emphasize: I didn't declare the state of emergency out of the blue. The declaration of the state of emergency is actually a judicial finding--that there is a state of emergency on the ground and that is then recognized and certified. You don't create a state of emergency by declaring it. You certify that there is a state of emergency, and that is the case. And the focus of the debate shouldn't be on the declaration of a state of emergency. The focus of the debate should be why was it necessary for me to sign such a declaration. But why? Because of the breakdown of law and order, because of the failure to really effectively contain it, because of the many deaths, because of the threats and the war cries. And what my intelligence is telling me, what is from more than one side in the pipeline. That is what must be addressed in the debate; not the formality of having declared it. I'm sending troops into kwaZulu-Natal because it is my duty, because that is the primary duty of a government, and kwaZulu is part of the Republic of South Africa. It is not an invasion, as Chief Minister Buthelezi has said. It is part of the Republic of South Africa, and my duty in that regard as head of the government extends over the whole of South Africa. [Venter] Just briefly, Mr. President, as we close off. The last state of emergency in South Africa drew a very negative international reaction. Now have you had an opportunity to canvas what the likely international response to this is going to be? [De Klerk] No, but I have reason to believe -- I didn't canvas it, I didn't ask anybody's permission. I didn't first clear it before I took the decision. But I have reason to believe from discussions with an ambassador here and a delegation form overseas there that it will be welcomed, that the distinction between this state of emergency and previous ones will be understood. In the past under a state of emergency, we acted against parties because they were parties. We acted against the ANC because it was the ANC, and because it was a banned organization. This time we are acting to defend the right of all parties to operate freely. This time we are acting to ensure that people who want to interfere with the rights of all South Africans through violence and through creation of unrest, interfere against their basic human rights, to act against them. It is a totally different situation, and I have no hesitation to say that I will have the moral support of the international community. [Venter] Mr. President, thank you very much. [De Klerk] Thank you.
