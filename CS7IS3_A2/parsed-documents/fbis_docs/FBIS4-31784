The report on human rights in former Yugoslavia accuses Bosnian Serbs of deliberately directing artillery fire on hospitals, performing mass executions, expelling civilians, destroying houses and killing livestock during the month-long attack on eastern Bosnia. It also quotes eyewitnesses of rapes by Serbian soldiers. Mazowiecki wrote in his report that there were also cases of Muslim violation of the Serbs' rights but on a much smaller scale. He appealed for a more significant presence of U.N. peace-keeping forces in the Gorazde area which would "reduce the risk of further Serbian assaults."
