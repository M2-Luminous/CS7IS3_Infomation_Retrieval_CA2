At the end of this decade, when the labor market in the old and new laender will have grown together, Jagoda still expects about 3.4 million unemployed. This winter the 4 million threshold will probably be "touched or even crossed"; an initial recovery can only be expected in spring. Unemployment will be a decisive topic in the forthcoming election campaign. The Christian Democrat stresses that he wants neither to downplay nor to dramatize the situation. One can rely on his loyalty even in the event of a change in government, stresses Jagoda, whose term of office lasts until 2001. He thinks the frequent comparisons with the economic situation in the 1920's are dangerous: "Bonn is not Weimar." One must view the unemployment figures in relation to the potential of the working people, which was far smaller at that time -- then the "marked difference" becomes clear. In addition, it is "inappropriate" to add the 2.1 million people who were spared the loss of the jobs through labor market policy measures last year to the unemployed. This great easing of the burden on the labor market is, rather, an indication of the Federal Employment Office's successful work. In addition, Jagoda stresses that his office filled almost 3 million jobs in the difficult year of 1993. However, one does not want to rest on these laurels. This month special "mediation teams" will be established and largely released from any other tasks. Vacant jobs can then be filled even more quickly than in the past, hopes Jagoda. This year the Federal Employment Office must, however, make do with even scarcer financial means. "It is difficult to cut away something when the dress is already tight," says Jagoda, referring to the 3.9 billion German marks [DM] in cutbacks of the 1994 draft budget. With a view to the Federal Government's constrained financial situation, which paid about DM24.5 billion to the Federal Employment Office last year, Jagoda also shows understanding for the savings measures: "The Federal Employment Office, too, is affected by the constraints of the moment," he defends himself against occasional criticism that his office does not utilize all promised means. From industry Jagoda demanded "the iron will to stay competitive on the world market." This can be achieved only through "new products and top quality." The current restructuring of companies is the correct path toward more competitiveness and employment. It is also necessary, however, to orient oneself more vigorously toward the rising national economies and improve the coordination of European research. Jagoda also hopes that flexible work time models and more intensive use of part-time work will provide strong stimuli to employment. By doubling the German ratio of part-time work to the Dutch value of about 34 percent, the FRG could have about 2 million less unemployed, estimates Jagoda. Decoupling individual work time from machine time, too, is necessary to clearly raise productivity. "We must become much more creative," he admonished. Jagoda sees other possibilities to raise employment in environmental protection and by using people who are obliged to have social insurance in private households as well as in nursing care; in outpatient care alone about 150,000 employees are needed. Jagoda also wants to raise efficiency in his own office. Simplifying official procedures and improving the use of information technology play as important a role as decentralization. At the moment, a study is being conducted on which jobs -- beyond the already existing budgets for advance training, retraining, and job creation measures -- could be taken over by the local labor exchange offices on their own responsibility.
