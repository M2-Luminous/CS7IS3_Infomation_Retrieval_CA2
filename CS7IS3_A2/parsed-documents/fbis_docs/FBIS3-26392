While inspecting the Haicang project investment zone in Xiamen, the vice premier pointed out: Under the vigorous support of relevant State Council departments since 1990, especially since 1992, and through the efforts of the Fujian provincial and Xiamen city party and government leaders and the masses of people, the investment zone has made great progress in infrastructure construction. Equipped with essential roads, water and electricity supplies, and communications, the investment zone is now ready for all-around development. Great progress has also been made in leveling the requisitioned land inside the zone and constructing amenities outside it as well as other supporting facilities related to the zone. All of this has laid a sound foundation for the investment zone's future development and construction, as well as for Xiamen's further development. After listening to briefings by officials of the Fujian provincial party committee and government, and the Fuzhou and Xiamen city party committees and governments, Zhu Rongji fully affirmed their achievements in recent years. He said: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and led by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, Fujian -- the coastal pioneering province in opening to the outside world -- has undergone tremendous changes and scored remarkable achievements in reform and economic development. Accompanied by Jia Qinglin, provincial party secretary and governor, Zhu Rongji inspected the Taijiang farmers' market in Fuzhou, the largest farmers' market in the province. With great interest, he threaded his way through the crowd, frequently stopping at vegetable, fish, and rice stalls to inquire of their owners about supplies, purchase prices, sales, marketing prices, and income. After listening to the consumer response to market supplies, the vice premier expressed satisfaction with the market's large stocks and the stable prices of goods. He said: Fujian Province has attached great importance to and done a solid job in promoting agriculture and the vegetable basket project. Prices have slipped back as a result of plentiful supplies of nonstaple food, especially vegetables, to the satisfaction of consumers. Social stability has helped create a relaxed environment for reform and economic development this year. While in Fujian, the vice premier held separate discussions on taxation reform with officials of industrial and business enterprises and tax offices in Fuzhou and Xiamen cities, and listened to their opinions attentively. The officials generally expressed understanding and support for the State Council's taxation reform program, and offered suggestions for solving problems in the course of implementation. After hearing a report by the Furi Company, Zhu Rongji praised it for not raising the marketing price of its products -- television sets -- despite a hike in the prices of imported raw materials, parts, and components caused by the increased tax base figure. He pointed out: As a result of the recent taxation reform, about 28 percent of state-owned businesses will shoulder a slightly heavier tax burden. It is hoped that to absorb the increased prices of raw materials, these businesses will further improve management, cut back on expenses, and lower production costs, rather than raise product prices which will trigger price rises of other commodities. What they do should be a credit, not a smear, to reform. In response to the Fujian Bulb Plant's report about some monopolizing businesses taking the opportunity of taxation reform to increase product prices while adding a 17 percent value-added tax based on the increased price, the vice premier immediately instructed the relevant department to conduct an investigation and duly handle any violation. He urged all State Council departments concerned to earnestly review progress in the taxation reform program since it was initiated a month ago; pay close attention to studying suggestions and problems in general brought up at the discussions; and take action to improve and perfect the program in order to ensure the smooth progress of taxation reform. During his inspection tour of the Haicang project investment zone, Zhu Rongji also called on cadres and workers who were still working industriously at the various construction sites prior to Spring Festival, to extend regards and New Year greetings to those remaining at their posts. A responsible person of the Haicang administrative committee gave Zhu Rongji a report, saying: Construction of some parts of the Haicang project has begun. Construction of the main body of the Xianglu Terylene Fiber Project, which is capable of manufacturing 180,000 metric tons of polyester products a year, has been largely completed, and installation of equipment will begin soon. At the same time, preparation work for the construction of other downstream projects, such as the PVC Tubing Plant, will also start soon. After listening to the report, Zhu Rongji said happily: The development and construction of the Haicang project investment zone have entered a new phase. This project will certainly push forward the development of Xiamen's economy. Zhu Rongji put forward some important suggestions for the next- step development and construction of the Haicang project. He called for accelerating the construction of such infrastructure facilities as the Gaoyu Power Plant and the coal handling wharf, and for improving the investment environment. He also called for stepping up construction of the Xianglu Terylene Fiber Plant, which is under construction, and for making good preparations for installing the plant's equipment to complete the project and put it into operation according to schedule. At the same time, he also called for efforts to make preparations for construction of other projects related to the Haicang project to bring about a new situation regarding its development and construction. Accompanying Zhu Rongji on the inspection tour were He Chunlin, Chen Jinhua, Wang Zongyu, Gu Xiulian, Yu Zhen, Dai Xianglong, Li Yanling, Li Yizhong, Pan Liansheng, and Zhang Xianghai, all responsible persons of the relevant departments under the State Council.
