He is dynamic, sociable, plain spoken, and immediately grasps the essence of a problem. It is possible to say about him that he is "everywhere." He is a member of the Standing Commission of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on Economic Reform, secretary of the Parliamentary Commission of Ukraine on Privatization Issues, and counselor acting as prime minister for social affairs. This exceptional forty-year-old man graduated from a construction technical school, served in the army, studied with distinction at the Economic University, then did post-graduate work and defended a candidate's dissertation on the problem of the interaction of center and region with rational utilization of manpower. Working at the Labor Institute, he taught at the polytechnic institute, served as chief economist of the Machine-Building Plant and a deputy chairman of a commercial bank. In 1990 he was elected chairman of the Zhitomir City Council. After two years of work there he resigned because of, in his opinion, the artificiality of the institution of the "representative of the president." He has always regarded collaboration with the government as his duty. Zvyagylskyy took note of him and asked for assistance. Melnychuk is one of the authors of the anticrisis program of the government. Two basic methods exist for the reform of the economy of Ukraine: one is linked with the recent past, when the government lacked a clear goal and a concrete and effective program; the second method is based on the elaboration of a well thought-out strategy and the existence of a team prepared to carry it out. That which is called in Russia as the first method, or "Ukrainization of the economy," found its full embodiment in the activity of Kuchma's government because of the total absence of a comprehensive approach to the resolution of fundamental economic problems. As an outcome macroeconomic results followed: in the social sphere--prices became twice as high as wages; in the financial sphere--emission increased by a factor of 17, while the Ukrainian karbovanets - U.S. dollar exchange rate dropped by a factor of 36. Why did that occur? Probably because problems of currency regulation were being resolved incorrectly. As a result the difference between the two currencies is the volume of the capital exported abroad. In addition to that the former government of Leonid Kuchma, which had vast powers, with one of its decrees prohibited the export of products outside of Ukraine that are cultivated by peasants on their personal plots. This brought considerable losses to border farms which always sold their products to the neighbors. By the way, anti-Ukrainian moods of the Crimeans constitute their response to such thoughtless economic measures. After all, huge excise taxes were also established on the export of wine and champaign. At present the second method is making its presence felt with great difficulty. Everything necessary exists in Ukraine in order to fulfill the strategic program worked out by a group of specialists and adopted for use. With regard to the per capita output of agricultural products Ukraine is in the top ten in the world. Its production potential is great. There are two reasons, however, hindering its development. The former is connected with the old production structure because of which Ukraine is putting out the most energy, material, and petroleum-intensive products. Thus it turns out that the more it produces the more it owes. If the structure is not radically redesigned we will be unable to achieve anything of substance. What is the solution? Development of profitable branches and profitable production in all branches, particularly the agro-industrial complex, machine-building, light industry, merchandizing, and material-technical supply. It is likewise necessary to overcome one of the big misconceptions to the effect that Ukraine requires a vast amount of fuel and that it does not have any. With regard to the known fuel reserves we are in a first-place position in Europe. Today Ukraine is already satisfying two-thirds of its own petroleum needs, while one third is supplied by Russia and Turkmenia. But we are utilizing it in a highly irrational manner. As a result we consume as much petroleum as Japan, while our gross national product is more than ten times lower. We do not need such expenditures. We must eliminate the crisis of nonpayment. All enterprises and farms are deeply in debt to each other. What is to be done? The matter must be resolved without an emission through a lowering of prices and an increase in funds that have to remain with the enterprises and the value-added tax should also be eliminated. The next problem is associated with currency regulation and regulation of the Ukrainian karbovanets exchange rate. The government managed to lower inflation by controlling that process. In 1993 the average monthly inflation rate amounted to 50 percent, and in January 1994 it was 19 percent, whereas in February it was down to 12 percent. The Interbank Currency Market artificially raised the exchange rate of the karbovanets by a factor of two to three. At present the government itself is setting it with consideration of the balance of payments and other factors. A similar policy is being implemented today in Austria, Sweden, and Poland. It has been used by the U.S.A., France, and Japan in times of crisis. The government of Ukraine should continue further development of the privatization it started. Today 25 percent of industrial production is accounted for by the non-governmental sector which is functioning in a highly effective manner. Integration with other CIS countries is a major problem. It is quite clear the strong can integrate but the weak will "be for hire." In order to restore links with them at a new level Ukraine will have to resolve the entire complex of tasks which I mentioned. But, as it is said, the road will be successfully negotiated by the one who forges ahead.
