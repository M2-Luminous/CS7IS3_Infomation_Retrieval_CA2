[Yi Yong-tok] I have grasped the entire organizational structure of the NUB and the work each department of the NUB is charged with. I am still studying the specific details of the policies and strategies related to the inter-Korean dialogue. [Kim] Several days ago you mentioned the North Korean human rights issue, touching off some controversy. [Yi] That confirmed for me, the fact that not enough of a national consensus about reunification strategy exists. Some newspapers supported my view in their editorials and columns which led me to think that this was the general opinion, others criticized my view. [Kim] You have been a career educator throughout your life. How does your background reflect upon your appointment as NUB minister? [Yi] Indeed education is my area of specialization. I have regarded education in schools as my minor and education in society as my major. With that in mind, I founded the Korean Educational Development Institute and served as its first director for 10 years. In the early 1960's I met Mr. So Yong-hun and was involved in Red Cross work. Then I became involved in educational broadcasting. These experiences led to my taking up of positions like the chair of the Broadcasting Deliberation Committee and the first director of the Broadcasting Development Institute. I think that this, in addition to my time as the South's delegate to the North-South Red Cross talks prior to my appointment may have been taken into consideration in my selection. [Kim] How long were you in direct contact with the North while serving as senior delegate to the Red Cross talks? [Yi] That was from 1984 when the two sides had contacts over the relief goods for the flood victims until December 1985 when the 10th round of full-dress North-South Red Cross talks were held. [Kim] What lessons did you learn from that experience? [Yi] At that time, our primary objective was to hold talks. We accepted the flood relief goods only because that would enable us to hold talks. The talks were held, but failed to result in the improvement of inter-Korean relations. North Korea should be held responsible for this. On our part, we tried hard not to cause a break up in talks in order to avoid being blamed for the break up of talks. Meeting with the North delegates then, however, we were led to doubt the usefulness of meetings. I think it is now time for the North and the South to hold practical and substantial talks in order to achieve real reconciliation and to head for reunification. This is why I have stated that the days of avoiding words that might displease the North Korean side have now passed. [Kim] What reunification policy will you promote? [Yi] I will emphasize two aspects. The first aspect is forming an image of a reunified state which we must attain. To achieve this South and North Korea must work to show change simultaneously. Reunification through absorption means that one side will perish. What is important is that the two sides must show change and develop according to the current situation. Reunification must not be achieved with the result of the demise of one side. The legal system and mode of living must also change in preparing for reunification. Even though the South and North are of completely different systems, with a common goal, we can become close. I believe that if this is carried out, reunification can be achieved and both sides can also survive. Second is the resolution of the issue of separated families. South and North Korea are calling for reunification. Therefore, I believe that allowing families who have been separated for some 40 years without knowing if their families were alive or dead, is the most concrete and earnest way for reconciliation. If a plan for reconciliation is mapped out based on these two aspects, I believe that there will be no problem in the second and third stage of the government's three-stage reunification method. [Kim] Many people are worried about the relationship between the NUB and the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP]. [Yi] I believe there is no problem between the NUB and the NSP. We cannot say that one is doing a good job and the other is doing a bad job because both organizations are working hard to achieve reunification. Since the NUB has primary control of the work to achieve reunification, I believe that the NSP must cooperate well with the NUB. NSP Director Kim Tok has already telephoned me on several occasions and expressed that the NSP will cooperate fully. [Kim] Dissidents of the reunification movement are turning their attention to what you are saying and doing. How will you maintain your relations with them? [Yi] Dissidents are people with diverse opinions. If they recognize the direction the government is pursuing to realize a reunified state, I believe that dialogue will be able to solve everything. On the other hand, I believe that it will be difficult to hold talks with people who reject the government's reunification effort and who try to overthrow our system. If the dissidents agree with the direction of the government's effort for reunification, I believe that the difference in views, no matter how wide, can be breached.
