But juridical VUZes [higher educational institutions] do not teach one to judge "by conscience," since this is a direct path to arbitrary action. But it is precisely this path which Russian law enforcement is forced to take when investigating nature protection offenses. There are several reasons for this. In the former USSR, essentially there is not a single nature protection law. In 1986 the unlucky managers of the Chernobyl AES were tried not because an enormous amount of territory was contaminated and removed from economic use as a result of the accident at the installation entrusted to them. The directors of the power plant and the main engineer were convicted of negligence in performing official duties. With such a definition of their actions, they could count on amnesty, and that in fact occurred several years later. Only in late 1991 was a strictly ecological Law "On Protecting the Natural Environment" adopted for the first time in Russia, which by now was free. This law devotes a great deal of space to altogether new provisions on ecological monitoring, the ecological expert study, and an economic mechanism for protecting the environment. The law moved environment protection from the departmental level to the level of a global, national, and state-wide problem with priority status. But the direct effect of the law was complicated by the vagueness and lack of specificity of some of its language, which gave room for departmental enactments and interpretations. Many of the law's provisions even now need refinement. The structure of power and government and regional policy have changed and the very approach to defining ecological safety and ecological damage has changed. Obviously, certain provisions of the law, especially the parts dealing with the rights of the subjects of the Federation, the economic mechanism, and accountability, should be expanded. Articles on the ecological expert study are virtually infeasible in practice because the question of whether experts who prepare the finding are officials and on some level bear responsibility for the expert study's results has not been decided. The articles devoted to the right of citizens to a good environment are also poorly worded, and as a result judges cannot apply these articles in practice. Disputes on the amount of damages caused by military actions and interterritorial disputes may become unique. The law should designate a rigid Russian position regarding foreign violators of the law's articles. The question arises of what is worse, a bad law or the complete lack of one. We have already written that for many years the USSR was the only state in the world which used atomic energy extensively for both peaceful and military purposes without legal foundations for doing so. That is precisely how the lack of even one law regulating the use of atomic energy in the country can be described. (It is precisely for that reason that the legislative organs of the former USSR must bear a share of the blame for the Chernobyl disaster.) No matter how paradoxical it may seem, the situation with the lack of atomic legislation has in fact not changed today. True, in 1993 the Supreme Soviet adopted three "atomic" laws in the first reading: "On the Use of Atomic Energy," "On State Policy on the Handling of Radioactive Waste," and "On the Status of Territories Contaminated as a Result of Radiation Disasters." The October events in Moscow and the breakup of the Supreme Soviet prevented the final adoption of these laws. And the new Federal Assembly, it seems, is not yet interested in atomic legislation. So, legal support of protection of the natural environment is clearly unsatisfactory in Russia. What should the law enforcement organs do in this situation and how should law-abiding citizens behave? The simplest thing is to ignore the issue, alluding to the need to resolve more important problems first. Indeed, we must not forget about the worsening economy, growing crime, and many other misfortunes which have befallen poor Russia. That is all true, but we must not resolve the problems listed one at a time. They are closely related to one another and they can be resolved only as a set. But, on the other hand, we should not step up work on economic problems on the basis of the old technology. For following the unfortunate tradition, departments may formulate laws "to suit themselves," restricting themselves to empty declarations and not taking the interests of all citizens into account. For these reasons the State Duma must not transfer the power of legislative initiative in resolving ecological problems to executive organs. But until the paternal lawmakers give us adequate ecology law, nature protection organs and individual citizens are permitted to live and act according to their consciences. If it works out...
