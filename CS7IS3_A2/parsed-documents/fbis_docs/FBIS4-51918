The Czech paper NASE PRAVDA No. 14 said U.S. propaganda media spread the rumor that North Korea was "developing" nuclear weapons, "threatening" South Korea, but it is contrary to fact. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused by the United States as it introduced many nuclear weapons into South Korea, the paper said, contending that if the nuclear issue is to be solved, the United States must withdraw nuclear weapons from South Korea. The Iranian paper KAYHAN APRIL 5 said the U.S. acts of shipping into South Korea Patriot missiles and sophisticated military hardware and moving there its nuclear carriers and various kinds of warships show that it is weak, and they signify a victory of North Korea. It is the consistent position of North Korea to answer strength with strength, dialogue with dialogue, the paper said, and added: The United States cannot stifle North Korea. The Swedish magazine RIKTPUNKT No. 6 said although the United States is claiming "observance" of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, pretending to be a "defender" of world conscience, it has virtually deployed nuclear weapons in many parts of the world and is constantly developing dangerous new weapons.
