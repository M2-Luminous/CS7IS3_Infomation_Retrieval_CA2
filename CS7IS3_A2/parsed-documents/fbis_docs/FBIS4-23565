The meeting is the first of a series of four meetings with Frontline leaders scheduled for Thursday morning. Mr Mandela said after the meeting that he had exchanged views with Mr Nujoma on several issues including proposed Frontline action on the crisis in Lesotho. Mr Nujoma said he and Mr Mandela had discussed "bilateral issues". "We have much in common particularly in terms of trade. Over 70 percent of Namibia's trade is with South Africa so we are good neighbours... We wanted to promote that." He said he and Mr Mandela also discussed the situations in Angola, Mozambique and Rwanda. "These are issues of great concern to all of us. We want peace and stability because one cannot have development where there is no peace." Mr Mandela also posed briefly for photographs with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe with whom he has just begun a meeting. He is also due to meet President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania and Joachim Chissano of Mozambique. All five heads of state will be attending a southern African economic summit in Cape Town on Thursday afternoon.
