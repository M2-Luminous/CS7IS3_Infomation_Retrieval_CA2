FR940511-1-00123 FR940511-1-00016 * * * * * (f) The claimant/owner may authorize the BLM to charge payment of service charges, rental fees, maintenance fees, and location fees to his or her credit card under §3833.1&hyph;3(a) by transmitting a facsimile authorization bearing the signature of the claimant/owner to the authorized officer, or the authorized officer may accept such authorization by telephone if the identity of the claimant/owner is established to the satisfaction of the authorized officer. (g) The claimant/owner may also maintain a declining deposit account with the State Office of the BLM where the mining claims and sites are recorded for the payment of service charges, rental fees, maintenance fees, and location fees. The authorized officer may deduct the necessary service charges and fees from such account only at the direction of the claimant/owner. 27. Section 3833.1&hyph;5 is revised to read as follows: §3833.1&hyph;5 Rental fees and maintenance fees. Except as provided in §§3833.0&hyph;3(f), 3833.1&hyph;6, and 3833.1&hyph;8, each claimant shall pay a nonrefundable rental or maintenance fee of $100.00 for each mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site to the proper BLM office for each specified assessment year for which the claimant desires to hold the mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site. The assessment years covered by the Acts of October 5, 1992, and August 10, 1993, begin at 12 o'clock noon on September 1, 1992, and end at 12 o'clock noon on September 1, 1999. The $100 rental or maintenance fee requirement does not apply to oil shale placer claims. Oil shale placer claim holders shall pay an annual $550 fee for each oil shale claim as described in section 2511 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (30 U.S.C. 242). Payment of the rental fee for 1993 and/or 1994 shall satisfy any maintenance fee requirements that might otherwise apply for these years. The rental fee requirements for mining claims expire on September 30, 1994. (a)(1) The initial $100.00 nonrefundable rental or maintenance fee for the assessment year in which the mining claim or site was located shall be paid for each mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site at the time of recording the mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site pursuant to section 314(b) of FLPMA and §3833.1&hyph;2. In addition, the location fee required in §3833.1&hyph;4(b) shall be paid at the time of recordation for all claims and sites located on or after August 11, 1993, and before September 30, 1998. (2) The initial rental or maintenance fee described in paragraph (1) is not subject to the waiver provisions contained in §§3833.1&hyph;6 and 3833.1&hyph;7. (b) Under the Act of August 10, 1993, a nonrefundable maintenance fee of $100.00 for each mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site shall be paid annually on or before August 31 for the subsequent assessment year beginning at 12 o'clock noon on September 1 of that year. At the time of payment, the claimant/owner shall submit a list of claim names and BLM serial numbers assigned to each mining claim or site for which the maintenance fee is being paid. (c) There will be no proration of rental or maintenance fees for partial years of holding of mining claims, mill sites, or tunnel sites. (d) A small miner may, under the exemption provisions of §§3833.1&hyph;6 and 3833.1&hyph;7, perform assessment work and file the affidavit of labor pursuant to §3833.2 in lieu of paying the rental or maintenance fee. (e) The owner of an oil shale placer claim shall pay the required $550 annual rental fee to the proper BLM State Office on or before each December 31. (f) The payment of the required rental or maintenance fee for a mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site satisfies the requirement to file an affidavit of assessment work or a notice of intention to hold pursuant to §3833.2. (g) If an exempted mining claim or site is transferred in total to a party not entitled to an exemption, the exemption is forfeited for the mining claim or site transferred. The rental or maintenance fee for the exempted assessment year shall be paid for the mining claim or site transferred at the time of filing the transfer of interest under §3833.3. If the proper fees are not submitted at the time of such filing, the authorized officer shall note the fees as being paid as of the date of the filing, provided that the claimant submits the proper fees within 30 days of receipt of a deficiency notice from the authorized officer. Failure to submit the proper fees will cause the claims or sites to be forfeited by the claimant/owner. (h) The Secretary will adjust the location and maintenance fees every five years, based upon the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor. The Secretary may adjust the location and maintenance fees sooner, if he deems it reasonable, based upon changes in the CPI. (1) Public notice of any adjustment of maintenance or location fees will be provided by July 1 of any year an adjustment is made. (2) Any such adjustment of maintenance or location fees will apply to the first assessment year following the July 1 by which the notice was given. The new fee is due on August 31 of the same year in which the notice was given.
