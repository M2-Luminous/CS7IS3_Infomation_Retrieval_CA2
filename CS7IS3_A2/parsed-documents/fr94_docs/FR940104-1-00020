FR940104-1-00020 FR940104-1-00004 To conform the Order No. 497 regulations with the requirements for EBBs, the new regulations would require pipelines to post affiliate information on their EBBs in conformity with the requirements of §284.8(b)(4) and their tariffs and to provide access to the affiliate information using the same procedures and protocols as used for accessing their EBBs. 24 Pipelines, therefore, must ensure that their EBBs for affiliate information are user-friendly and incorporate the same features as apply to the other aspects of the pipelines' EBBs. 25 They also must permit users to obtain the affiliate information by using the same phone number and log-on procedures they would use to access and obtain information about available capacity from the pipelines' EBBs. 26 24 Pipelines with waivers of the EBB requirements under Order No. 636 would have to file for a waiver of the posting and downloading requirements for the affiliate information and propose an alternate method for making the information available. 25 See Order No. 636, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles at 30,415. For example, the requirements to provide information through downloadable files, to provide on-line help, search functions, and menus, and to provide for backing-up, archiving, and retrieval of this material would be the same as those for the capacity availability information posted pursuant to §284.8(b)(4). 26 For example, the Commission envisions that, in most cases, the Order No. 497 information would be a separate menu item that users could choose when they log-on to the pipeline's EBB. The Commission previously had required pipelines to file their affiliate transportation logs with the Commission on magnetic tape or computer disks according to specified data formats. 27 The Commission similarly required the pipelines to maintain nonaffiliate information in electronic form and to provide this information to the Commission upon request or to the public under the Commission's discovery procedures. 28 Since pipelines are now required to comply with the Part 284 EBB requirements for posting of the affiliate information, they must make this information available through downloadable files. The regulations have been revised to reflect this requirement. 27 18 CFR 250.16(e). 28 18 CFR 250.16(c); 18 CFR 385.401&hyph;11. The Commission is also proposing to modify the requirements for providing both affiliate and nonaffiliate information to the Commission upon request. Under the proposal, pipelines would only have to maintain the information and be prepared to make it available electronically within a reasonable time upon request, according to specifications and formats promulgated by the Commission. Under the proposal, pipelines would not have to maintain the nonaffiliate information in one computer file. They could maintain the information in different files so long as they could extract the information and provide it, upon request, in electronic form. The Commission proposes to revise Form No. 592 to set forth the specifications and formats to be used for downloading and for providing the information to the Commission upon request. 29 29 The proposed specifications and format are attached as Appendix A. Current §250.16(d)(4)(ii) provides that filing the discounted rate report for affiliate transactions within 15 days of the close of the billing period satisfies a pipeline's obligation to file discount reports under §284.7(d)(5)(iv). Since pipelines are no longer required routinely to file transportation logs with the Commission, they must now fully comply with §284.7(d)(5)(iv) for affiliate transactions. IV. Sunset Date The Commission is not proposing to include a sunset provision in this rule. The proposed revisions reduce the compliance burden significantly, and a firm sunset date, such as one year from issuance, would not necessarily provide sufficient time for the Commission fully to evaluate the effect of Order No. 636 on the pipelines' incentive to favor affiliates. The Commission always can reevaluate the rule when sufficient information is available. For example, after evaluation of the impact of the capacity release mechanism, the Commission may find that the availability of released capacity has so reduced the significance of interruptible discounts from the pipeline that the regulations are no longer needed. But, the Commission cannot predict when it would have sufficient data to make such a determination. The Commission notes that even without a sunset provision, it must review these regulations within three years because the Paperwork Reduction Act does not permit OMB to approve an information collection requirement for a period in excess of three years. 30 30 44 U.S.C. 3507(d). V. Environmental Analysis The Commission is required to prepare an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement for any action that may have a significant adverse effect on the human environment. 31 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from these requirements as not having a significant effect on the human environment. 32 The action taken here falls within categorical exclusions provided in the Commission's regulations. 33 Therefore, an environmental assessment is unnecessary and has not been prepared in this rulemaking. 31 Order No. 486, Regulations Implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, 52 FR 47897 (Dec. 17, 1987), FERC Stats. & Regs.
