"The sanctions will be automatically revoked and that we have no information on the thinking of the United States government," ISRO chief added. The sanctions will be expiring next month. Even after the US clamped sanctions on ISRO and Glavkosmos, the Russian rocket manufacturing company for signing the cryogenic engine deal, India was able to launch two satellites -- Insat-2A and Insat-2B and two more in the same series -- Insat-2C and 2D are on schedule. "We were able to procure components from other sources," Mr Kasturirangan said. Though the sanctions are still in force, ISRO and Glavkosmos renegotiated the cryogenic engine deal last month, whereby the Russian company would be shipping seven engines at no fresh cost to ISRO. Apparently, the Russian government got the deal cleared by the US State Department. The countdown for the fourth development test flight of Augmented satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV-D4) has begun and is expected to tae off during the early hours on May 4,1994.
