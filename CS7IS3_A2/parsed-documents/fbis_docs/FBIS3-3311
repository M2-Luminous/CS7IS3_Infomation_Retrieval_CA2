At the four-day 16th meeting of GATT's working party on China ending today in Geneva, most representatives hoped for an early conclusion of the deliberation on the issue. The Chinese delegation, led by Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Gu Yongjiang, gave the meeting detailed reports on China's reforms in its economic and trade systems. The delegation also exchanged views with other representatives in informal bilateral consultations outside the sessions of the working party's meeting. It is reported that the European Union has outlined a draft protocol on China's reentry into GATT, welcomed by the Chinese delegation as a "positive move," which marked the start of substantive talks despite some differences between the two sides. Gu said at the end of the meeting that eight years had passed since China first asked in 1986 for the resumption of its GATT contracting status, an unprecedented length of time in the record of application for GATT membership. Still ready to continue its efforts, he said, China will submit to the GATT secretariat in the near future systematic reports on its management of import and export, foreign exchange, price and tariff and non-tariff measures to show a full and clear picture of China's economic and trade structures. The meeting did not decide when the working party will meet again.
