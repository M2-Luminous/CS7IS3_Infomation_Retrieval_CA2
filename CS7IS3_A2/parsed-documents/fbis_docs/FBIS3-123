An SADF statement quoted Mr Mandela as telling the council on February 23 that the country's socio-economic backlog and the inability of any government to fulfil expectations meant it was probable that a measure of instability would persist for a number of years. Mr Mandela expressed his appreciation of the valuable work performed by the SADF in the interests of peace, the statement said. He pronounced his satisfaction with the growing credibility and acceptability of the SADF in black townships, it added. The statement quoted Mr Mandela as saying the ANC shared the vision of an apolitical, professional and effective defence force acceptable to and representative of the people of South Africa. The national defence force should not be loyal to any political party, including the ANC, but to the state and the people of South Africa. Mr Mandela said the ANC was sensitive to the position of the commandos and would not like anything done that might alienate them, according to the SADF statement.
