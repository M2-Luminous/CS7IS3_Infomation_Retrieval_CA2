Hajime Funada, a senior Shinseito member and former Economic Planning Agency chief, said the party would push for Hata as the next premier, but added, "there is the question on how we should go about this with the current coalition framework. It is a delicate matter in finding a balance." He also said there may be some regrouping in the ruling coalition, apparently referring to rumors that former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, a member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, may join the cabinet. Funada was speaking to reporters at a press conference after an emergency meeting of executive members of Shinseito. At the gathering, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito who is considered to be the coalition's top strategist, said, "we have to be as quick as possible in electing a new prime minister to succeed our goals...so as not to frustrate the reform process." Hosokawa announced earlier in the day that he would step down and an emergency cabinet meeting later accepted his decision to resign.
