FBIS3-51908 "drlat018_m_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-018 Document Type:Daily Report 27 Jan 1994 Brazil * IBGE Releases November Unemployment Data 94SM0183D Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 30 Dec 93 p 8 94SM0183D Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL Language: Portuguese Article Type:CSO [Article by Vera Saavedra Durao: "Number of Unemployed in Country Drops"] [Text] Rio de Janeiro--The rate of open unemployment in the country's six metropolitan areas (Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Recife, and Porto Alegre) in November was 4.57 percent, down from 4.89 percent in October and 5.82 percent in November 1992, it was reported yesterday by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Of the six metropolitan areas surveyed by the institute, Recife was the only one showing an increase: unemployment there was 8.28 percent in November, compared to 7.93 percent in October, and 8.77 percent in November 1992. Unemployment dropped in the other areas: to 5.30 percent in Salvador (5.42 percent in October), 3.40 percent in Belo Horizonte (3.84 percent in October), 3.56 percent in Rio de Janeiro (3.90 percent in October), 5.08 percent in Sao Paulo (5.45 percent in October), and 2.82 percent in Porto Alegre (3.56 percent in October). That almost general trend toward a lower rate of open unemployment in the six metropolitan areas was accompanied by a rise in the average rate of activity in those regions--to 61.09 percent, compared to 60.29 percent in October--meaning that more jobs were available. All sectors of economic activity experienced less unemployment in November, examples being the processing industry (5.97 percent compared to 6.11 percent), construction (5.25 percent compared to 5.86 percent), commerce (4.61 percent compared to 5.10 percent), and services (3.51 percent compared to 3.64 percent). The IBGE also announced an increase in the employed population in the six metropolitan areas (15,474,639, compared to 15,428,279 in October), meaning that 46,360 people entered the labor market. Despite that, the number of employees with work cards fell by 2 percent in the labor market, while the number of "cardless" workers grew by 5 percent, thus confirming the growth of the informal labor market. Average Real Incomes The average real income of employed individuals last October was up 14 percent over October 1992. The outstanding increases were in commerce (average real wages up 22 percent), the processing industry (16 percent), and services (14 percent). Self-employed workers experienced the largest increase in real income in October 1993: up 27 percent over the same month in 1992.
