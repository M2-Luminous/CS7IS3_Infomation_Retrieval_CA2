As a result of this incorrect orientation internal sources were not used to stimulate economic and investment activities, Russian First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets said at the constituent meeting of a consultative council on foreign investments under the Russian government today. He said the total volume of foreign investment in Russia remained very small and did not conform with the capacities and needs of the country. "According to expert evaluations, only about 0.1 percent of foreign investments in the world is being placed into Russia," Soskovets said. The Russian government realizes that during the next five years the economic reforms in Russia will make Russian small and medium enterprises the main source of new jobs, Soskovets said. However, Soskovets said there was quite a number of negative tendencies in the development of small business. Today there are only about 700 enterprises performing in the sphere of small business and there should be at least 2.5 million or 3.5 million of them. Soskovets said that small business in Russia was not receiving enough support on the part of Western capital. He added that only the $300 million-credit given to Russia by the European Bank was the most significant one allotted by the West to Russian small and medium business. Soskovets said he hoped that the problems concerning the attraction of Western capital to Russia would be settled by the consultative council on foreign investments headed by Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin.
