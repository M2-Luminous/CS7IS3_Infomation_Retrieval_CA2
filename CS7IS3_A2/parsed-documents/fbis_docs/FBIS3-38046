This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Information and Press Department of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry. "The position of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry in this question is pretty clear," he stressed. According to the Russian diplomat, the Foreign Ministry had been informed about the story regarding the arrest of a CIA member and his wife through official channels in Washington and Moscow. This whole story raises a great many serious questions that must be carefully and closely studied and analyzed. Clearly, it is the professionals--representatives of the special services of both states--who will play the leading role in this, Karasin noted. Speaking about the political aspects of the incident, the Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that here "it is important to avoid overdramatization and extreme political emotions". The Russian side intends to clear up this incident quickly and effectively, Karasin noted in conclusion.
