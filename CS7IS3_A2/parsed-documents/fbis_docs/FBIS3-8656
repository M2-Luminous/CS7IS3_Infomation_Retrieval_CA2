During the meeting, which was attended by Asparukh Panov, deputy chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] on foreign policy issues, the guests imparted information related to the crude violation of the rights of the Bulgarian minority in the spheres of religion, education, use of their native tongue, and preserving cultural and historical heritage. Alarm was expressed over the attempts to ban the Democratic Union of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia, officially forcing the Bulgarians to adopt Serbian names and disseminating the thesis of the existence of a Serbian-Shop [Bulgarian Sofia region peasant] nation. The possibilities of rendering practical help on the part of the SDS in the sphere of training pupils, students, and graduate students were discussed. The SDS committed itself to defending the rights of the Bulgarians in Yugoslavia in accordance with the international documents. The Democratic Union of the Bulgarian in Yugoslavia invited an official SDS delegation to visit the regions of Bosilegrad and Tsaribrod in the near future.
