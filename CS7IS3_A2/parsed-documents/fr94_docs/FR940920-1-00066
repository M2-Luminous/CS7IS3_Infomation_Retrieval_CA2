FR940920-1-00066 FR940920-1-00008 40 CFR Part 60 [AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;5068&hyph;6] Emission Guidelines: Municipal Waste Combustors AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed guidelines and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: The EPA is proposing new subpart Cb ``emission guidelines'' to be used by States in developing State regulations to control emissions from existing municipal waste combustors (MWC's). Today's proposed guidelines would apply to MWC's for which construction, modification, or reconstruction began on or before September 20, 1994. Today's proposal would implement sections 111 and 129 of the Clean Air Act (Act). The proposed guidelines would apply to existing MWC units at facilities with capacities to combust greater than 35 megagrams per day (Mg/day; a megagram is a metric ton, and one megagram is equal to 2,204 pounds or about 1.1 short tons) of municipal solid waste (MSW) and would require sources to achieve emission levels reflecting the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of air pollutants that the Administrator determines is achievable, taking into consideration the costs, non-air-quality health and environmental impacts, and energy impacts. The proposed guidelines would establish emission limits for MWC acid gases (sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and hydrogen chloride (HCl)), MWC metals (particulate matter (PM), opacity, cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg)), MWC organics (dioxins/furans), nitrogen oxides (NO X ), and MWC fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions. The proposed guidelines would also establish requirements for MWC operating practices (carbon monoxide (CO), load, and flue gas temperature), and operator training and certification. DATES: Comments. Comments must be received on or before November 21, 1994. Public Hearing. A public hearing will be held about 15 days following proposal. See SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION for additional information regarding the public hearing. ADDRESSES: Comments. Comments on the proposal should be submitted (in duplicate, if possible) to: Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center (Mail Code 6102), ATTN: Docket No. A&hyph;90&hyph;45, Room M1500, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Information On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed emission guidelines for existing MWC's in subpart Ca of 40 CFR part 60. The subpart Ca emission guidelines were promulgated on February 11, 1991 and were developed under authority of section 111 of the Act of 1977. The Act of 1990 requires the EPA to review and revise, as necessary, the subpart Ca guidelines. The EPA has reviewed the subpart Ca emission guidelines and has concluded that they are not adequate to comply with the requirements of section 129 of the Act of 1990. In a separate notice in today's Federal Register , the EPA is proposing to withdraw the subpart Ca emission guidelines that were promulgated on February 11, 1991. Today's proposed subpart Cb guidelines would fully comply with the requirements of section 129 of the Act of 1990. The Federal Register notices for the proposed emission guidelines, withdrawal of the subpart Ca emission guidelines, and a proposed EPA test method that is associated with the proposed guidelines, and the economic impacts analysis associated with the proposed emission guidelines are listed below and are available on the EPA's Technology Transfer Network (TTN) electronic bulletin board. Also listed below and available on the EPA's TTN is a FACT SHEET, which succinctly summarizes the proposal and is suggested reading for persons requiring a limited overview of the proposal. The TTN contains 18 electronic bulletin boards, and the items listed below are included in the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) bulletin board and the Emissions Measurement Technical Information Center (EMTIC) bulletin board. The FACT SHEET can also be obtained by calling Ms. Cassie Posey at (919) 541&hyph;0069.
