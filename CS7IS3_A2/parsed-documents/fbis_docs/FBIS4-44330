The news conference at which Gonzalez analyzed the Corfu Council virtually centered on the issue of the candidate to succeed Delors as Commission president. Gonzalez acknowledged that the summit's outcome produced an outcome that was "bittersweet with evident light and shade." The Spanish head of government explained his efforts to try to reach a consensus among the Twelve. During the dinner on Friday [24 June] evening, Gonzalez said that he believed that there was an agreement for nobody to veto anybody, "which seemed to me a very good thing. We delegations accepted the presidency's proposal that we vote according to preference. There were 11 ballot papers with the order of the three candidates and one on which there were just two candidates, and none of them was Brittan." Yesterday morning, Gonzalez met with Lubbers, "and I asked him to withdraw," as Brittan also did, but Major maintained his veto, but not the Netherlands, which said that it was prepared to accept a consensus of the Twelve on Dehaene. Gonzalez described the current situation as "unpleasant," and said that he found the alternative of seeking new candidates, as Major proposed, "very complicated." The Spanish prime minister would not enter into assessments as to whether the British prime minister's stance was due to reasons of domestic politics in the United Kingdom -- not reasons of a European nature, but he did make it clear that "yesterday evening I understood that the possibility of a veto was ruled out, and this morning (yesterday), Britain has imposed one." Gonzalez said that he could not see the reasons why Major was prepared to accept Lubbers but not Dehaene, since they are both Christian Democrats and there are no qualitative differences between their ideas of what Europe should be like. He even pointed out in this connection that Lubbers was the architect of the Maastricht treaty, so much criticized by London in some of its chapters. Rule of Consensus Asked whether there was not a certain weariness in the European Council because it is Britain that periodically blocks important decisions in the European building process, Gonzalez said: "If there is no consensus, there may be greater or lesser irritation among the countries, but we must all accept the rules. The rules require consensus, but the countries that do not accept this should make an effort at rapprochement, which I admit is not obligatory." Gonzalez did not rule out the deadlock's continuing, and conjectured that either a solution will be reached in 20 days at the special summit that the German presidency will foreseeably call, or there will be no choice but to seek alternative candidates. With respect to the criticisms leveled against Paris and Bonn of lack of openness in proposing Dehaene as a candidate, Gonzalez recalled that he was the prime minister who supported a candidate and maintained his support for Lubbers to the end. "It could be said that we supported a candidate who did not win, but it must also be emphasized that we have maintained our independence of judgment, and that that possible lack of openness did not influence our vote," he said. Asked for an assessment of Berlusconi, Gonzalez was very cautious. "I already knew him, and perhaps because of that he has felt closer to me. As you know, it is complicated to enter into the ways meetings like this work," he concluded. Felipe Reiterates That He Will Not Be Candidate for Commission Presidency Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez recalled during the news conference that he has been repeating over the past two years that he would not be a candidate for the EC presidency when Jacques Delors leaves the post. With the crisis over this European politician's succession open in the European Union right now, some observers believe that Gonzalez could be a candidate accepted by all the Union's member countries. "In a situation of some economic and political difficulty such as our country is experiencing, I reaffirm even more my decision to fulfill my obligations as prime minister and not to be a candidate," Gonzalez flatly asserted. He then added that "what has worried me most about the deadlock situation from the personal viewpoint is that it could reopen in an alternative direction and reach me. I hope that this will be understood, especially by those who must understand it -- the Spanish public." The Spanish prime minister concluded his thoughts on this issue by stating that "some people tell me that the European Commission presidency would be a brilliant solution for the next five years, but I believe that my prime duty is to try to resolve our country's problems and contribute to European building from that position -- not from another."
