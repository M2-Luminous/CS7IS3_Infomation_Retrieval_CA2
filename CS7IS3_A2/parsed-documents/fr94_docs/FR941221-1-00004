The compliance time for accomplishing the proposed modification has been broken out into separate groupings. Airplanes that are younger than 15 years must be modified within 56 months after the effective date of the AD, and airplanes that are 15 years and older must be modified within 32 months after the effective date of the AD. The FAA's intent is to require modification of older airplanes at an earlier date, since they are more likely to be subject to fatigue cracking and corrosion. The FAA recognizes that the modifications described in the service bulletins listed in paragraph I.D., ``Compliance,'' on page 17 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A21 59, dated November 3, 1994, upgrades the structural integrity of the strut. These modifications include replacement of the upper link, lower spar fitting, diagonal brace, and mounting nut for the forward engine. Additionally, these modifications entail rework of the midspar fitting lugs and fitting attachments; and include the installation of third generation fuse pins at the strut midspar, diagonal brace, and wing-to-strut attachments of the upper link. The FAA finds that the proposed compliance time (for installation of the proposed modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure) for airplanes on which these other modifications previously have been accomplished may be extended without compromising the safety of the fleet. Therefore, the FAA has further divided the proposed compliance times for airplanes that are 15 years or older to segregate the requirements of those airplanes that have and have not been modified previously. For example, for airplanes on which the modifications described in the service bulletins referenced by paragraph I.D., ``Compliance,'' on page 17 of the Boeing alert service bulletin, have been accomplished, modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure would be required within 56 months; while, for airplanes on which the modifications referenced by paragraph I.D. have not been accomplished, modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure would be required within 32 months. Further, the FAA acknowledges the work that has been accomplished previously by creating separate groupings for those airplanes on which certain, but not all, of the modifications have been accomplished. Therefore, if the modification described in Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2118, dated July 25, 1986 (which is one of the service bulletins referenced by paragraph I.D., ``Compliance,'' on page 17 of the Boeing alert service bulletin), has not been accomplished, but all other modifications referenced by paragraph I.D. have been accomplished, the FAA's intent is to allow operators of these airplanes to continue to perform the inspections of the fastener holes that currently are required by AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;13 R1, amendment 39&hyph;5546 (52 FR 3421, February 4, 1987). However, those inspections must be performed at a reduced interval of 1,000 landings, until such time that the proposed modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure is accomplished. For these airplanes, modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure would be required within 56 months after the effective date of this AD.
