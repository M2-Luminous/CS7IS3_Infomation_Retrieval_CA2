In statements to MENA, the sources said the Israeli side wants a limited number -- no more than seven individuals -- of the vanguards of the Palestinian police force to enter these areas for a site inspection. Then, a small force can enter some time between April and mid-May. The main body of the force could enter at the beginning of July. The sources warned against the dangers that could crop up because of the delay in the entry of the basic police force into Gaza and Jericho. The Palestinian sources clarified that the Palestinian military leadership, which has met for three days running in Cairo, set out a specific working paper, which it dispatched to President Yasir 'Arafat. 'Arafat asked Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian negotiating team, to adhere to this working paper during his negotiations with the Israeli side. These sources specified the demands of the Palestinian military command in the following points: 1. Compliance with a specific timetable endorsed by the Israeli side and linking the entry into Gaza and Jericho of the vanguards of the Palestinian police force and the remaining members of the force. 2. Agreement on the magnitude and arming of the force. A timetable is to be set out for the entry of the Palestinian force's equipment. 3. A strong entry by the Palestinian police force into Gaza and Jericho, so that the Palestinians in these territories, who have long suffered occupation and frustration, can feel pride and dignity. The same sources added that the Palestinian side stressed to the political leadership the need to set out a timetable for the entry of the police force, providing entry is complete before the end of April. The sources noted that the Israeli side is now discussing delaying the entry of the force from 15 May, which marks the anniversary of the establishment of the State of Israel, to 1 July. This could create a security vacuum that might result in serious moral and military consequences, the sources noted. The sources added that the Israelis want the Palestinian police force to enter Gaza and Jericho in closed vehicles or buses and in a way that resembles the entry of prisoners or infiltrators, not as security forces returning to their land with pride and dignity, something that will affect the mission of these forces and their future dealings with the Palestinian people, who have suffered much from Israel's occupation and its repressive measures. The Palestinian sources added that the Israelis also want the equipment and weapons of the Palestinian police to enter in sealed boxes, thus denying them the opportunity to test them. The sources demanded that the 200 vehicles the United States decided to give to the Palestinian police be handed over in Egypt or al-'Arish, not in Israel, so that they might be examined, painted in distinguishing Palestinian colors, and marked with the security emblem of the Palestinian police. The same sources stressed that the magnitude of the Palestinian force has not been fully determined, adding that this topic will be discussed during the current round. The sources named the military commanders who must enter Gaza and Jericho as follows: Nasr Yusuf, commander in chief of the Palestinian forces; Haj Isma'il, official in charge of security in the Palestinian command; Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Mahaydah, who is the chief of staff; Mamduh Nawfal, from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine; and Muhammad Qudsiyah, commander of the Badr Forces in Jordan. The following are the names of the Palestinian commanders who must enter Gaza [as received]: Sa'ib al-'Ajiz, commander of the Palestinian Forces in Sudan; Khalid Sultan, commander of the Palestinian forces in Libya; Muhammad Fawj, alias Abu-Humayd, commander of the Palestinian forces in Yemen; and Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Hayy 'Abd-al-Wahid, commander of the 'Ayn Jalut Forces in Egypt.
