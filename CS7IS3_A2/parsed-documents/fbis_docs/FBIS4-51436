In his speech he put forward that to meet the demand of establishing the systems of socialist market economy, we should further enhance studies in the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; in the theories of socialist market economy; and in basic knowledge and the knowledge of modern science and technology. We should also upgrade the consciousness of implementing the party's basic line and improve the capability of participating in and having the socialist market economy well in hand. From 24 to 25 May, the central study group under the provincial party committee concentrated its efforts on studying the viewpoint of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts and the viewpoint in which the essence of socialism is to emancipate and develop productive forces. At the same time, the group, by bearing the province's reality in its mind, discussed the issues of shifting the business mechanism of enterprises; establishing modern enterprise systems; and accelerating the economic development; in line with the ideology of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to deepening the reform and broadening the opening up. The central study group also heard the special-topic report given by Hong Hu, vice minister of restructuring economy, with regard to establishing modern enterprise systems. In his speech, Jiang Chunyun said: The works of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and particularly the Third Volume of Deng Xiaoping's Selected Works represent the great and important development of Marxism and the scientific system of theories. In his works, Comrade Deng Xiaoping gives scientific, clear, accurate, and meticulous expositions to the issues of what is of socialism and how to build socialism from theories to practice. These expositions have dealt with a series of important problems faced by the party in leading the cause of building socialism. Currently, there are many issues that are worth being studied by us. Of these issues, a prominent one is to implement the resolution adopted at the 14th CPC Congress with regard to establishing the systems of socialist market economy and turning the traditional planned economy into a market one. Successful transformation of the economy will enable full exposure of the superiority of socialism, reinforcement of national strength, and enrichment of the people's wealth.
