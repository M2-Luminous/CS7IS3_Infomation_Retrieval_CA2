Speaking to a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan (ACCJ), Mondale said there is "virtually nothing" which can significantly reduce Japan's current account surplus in the Japanese package unveiled the previous day. "There is not a stimulation at all" for the Japanese economy in the program, he said. Japan announced Tuesday a new package of measures to further open its markets to foreign products in a bid to bring down its towering trade surplus with the rest of the world, the United States in particular. The package offers, however, no fresh proposals on macroeconomic measures, although it promises to come up with concrete plans for comprehensive tax reform by the end of June. The program is a "very generalized statement of steps that will be taken down the road," Mondale said. He was also dissatisfied with plans for further deregulation featured in the package, calling them "very vague" and "very difficult to analyze." His remarks reinforced criticism expressed overnight by U.S. Officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who said the package has failed to meet U.S. concerns. Mondale said the package cannot justify the resumption of the Japan-U.S. "Framework" trade talks aimed at slimming the bilateral trade surplus. The Japanese package is designed to show Tokyo's commitment to reducing its surplus and help break the impasse in the framework negotiations, which broke down in February. He indicated the possibility that Washington may resort to trade sanctions unless Japan works to bring down its surplus. "We very much hope (sanctions) won't be necessary. But we've also said we cannot live with the status quo." The U.S. ambassador said much should be done, particularly in the auto and auto components, one of the key areas covered by the framework trade negotiations. "Basically, we have a closed market here," he said, citing heavy import taxes and tight inspection requirements as examples of the obstacles hampering sales of U.S. cars in Japan. If progress cannot be made in this central area, he said, it is very hard to see how overall progress can be made in the framework talks. Mondale also said the U.S. does not intend to specifically instruct Japan about what it should do to boost domestic demand because giving specifics is "perhaps improper." "We do not come to Japan to say, `here is the American tax program you are putting into place,"' he said.
