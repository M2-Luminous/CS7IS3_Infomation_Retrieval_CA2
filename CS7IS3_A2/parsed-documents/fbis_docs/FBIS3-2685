At the meeting presided over by Wang Bingqian, an executive chairman of the session Presidium, Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, delivered a report on the implementation of the 1993 plan for national economic and social development and a similar draft plant for 1994. Liu Zhongli, minister of finance, made a report on the implementation of the 1993 state budget and a draft state budget for 1994. Chen Jinhua said in 1993 China's social production continued to increase rapidly, with its gross domestic product (GDP) reaching 3,138 billion yuan, up 13.4 percent over the previous year. Investment in fixed assets nationwide reached 1,182.9 billion yuan, up 50.6 percent over the previous year, or 22 percent with inflation taken into account. Chen listed major macro-control targets for the 1994 national economic and social development plan, which, he said, has taken into consideration both requirements for a sustained, rapid and healthy economic development and the necessity to create a relaxed environment for implementing various major reforms to be carried out this year. Liu Zhongli told more than 2,800 deputies that total state revenues in 1993 came to 511.482 billion yuan, up 23.2 percent over the previous year, while total state expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion yuan, up 21.2 percent over the 1992 figure. This resulted in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan, which was not in excess of the budgeted figure. While revenues and expenditures in local finances increased considerably in 1993, those in central finances failed to reach budgeted figures. Moreover, although revenues in local finances increased substantially, turnover tax revenues in central finances were much less than the budgeted figure, thereby aggravating the difficulties of central finances, Liu said. Therefore, he added, this year's state budget has again been drafted according to the principle of tightening control over expenditures, with a view to maintaining a basic balance between total supply and total demand and alleviating inflationary pressures. Under the circumstances, the guiding ideology for drafting the 1994 state budget has been to continue to strengthen and improve macro controls, work hard to open up new revenue sources, improve the economic performance of enterprises and make revenue increases commensurate with economic development, the minister noted.
