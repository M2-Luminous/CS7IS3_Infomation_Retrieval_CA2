The reality becomes even starker when statistics reveal that out of every 10,000 in Tamil Nadu, 11 persons have leprosy and in some tribal pockets in Kerala the incidence is so high that 30 out of every 1,000 suffer from this disease which still raises instant revulsion on anybody's face a manifestation of the stereotyped perception about the disease. At present, achieving a leprosy-free condition is only a distant possibility and the plausible target before the leprologists in the country is to bring the incidence down to one in 10,000 by the turn of the century. Even this demands untiring and committed endeavour on the part of leprologists and depends on various other factors including treatment regimen and diagnostic facilities, public awareness, authentic information on the subject, etc. A plethora of information on various aspects of leprosy was deliberated upon at the 18th biennial conference of the Indian Association of Leprologists held recently at Madras. Significant Findings About 300 delegates from all over the country and a few from abroad participated in the conference. Several scientific papers and findings of various projects on diverse aspects of the disease were presented of which some findings were very significant and encouraging, Dr. Simon, Organising secretary of the conference said. According to one study conducted by Dr. C. Appanraj, district leprosy officer, Tuticorin, even infants were found to have been infected by leprosy, defying popular belief that the incubation period of the causative bacterium was very long and intra-uterine infection was not possible. The infection was found even in a two and a half month old baby. This study warrants that all children with suspicious lesions should be evaluated, irrespective of their age. Another study on the effect of Multi Drug Therapy (MDT) on Women, by Dr. K. Bhaskar Subuddhi of the Gandhi Memorial Leprosy Foundation, Wardha, Maharashtra, revealed that the eradication of leprosy would be earlier among women than men. The study showed that the incidence rate, prevalence rate, relapse rate and child incidence rate were always less among females. A paper presented by a group of doctors of B.S. Medical College, Bankura, West Bengal, showed that 5 percent of the 2,000 patients selected for study were found to be blind either in one eye or both the eyes. The study reiterated the fact that although the regimen of MDT had reduced ocular leprosy, many instances of blindness were still found among leprosy patients. About 40 percent of them were blind in both the eyes and 68 percent of them curable. A paper on the new, four week regimen of treatment by Dr. Amar Kant Jha Amar of the Patna Medical College Hospital indicated that the method was very effective, well tolerated and needed wider trials. Various papers covering the entire gamut of leprosy were also presented and evaluated at the conference. Fresh Cases Dr. M.D. Gupte of the ICMR, president of the Indian Leprologists Association told THE HINDU that still substantial number of fresh cases of leprosy were being reported. The findings of the experiment of vaccines, MW and ICRC, currently being conducted in Tamil Nadu, will be available by 1998 and if the results were positive it would go a long way in the eradication of the disease. It is the first study of its kind in the world. The incidence of single lesion leprosy was widespread, but 60-70 percent of it healed without treatment, he said. The experiments on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PRC) and Molecular Biology were in the preliminary stages and the results would be useful for the detection of leprosy. The participation of the younger generation at the conference was encouraging, he said. And a piece of advice by Dr. Simon: "Please don't turn the health visitor away. Anybody can contract the disease, whether rich or poor, it is completely curable and early detection is very important for treatment."
