It has become an impediment to the development of market relations and stands in the way of expanding all areas of business. What is being done to overcome the legal "inadequacy"--this is the subject of the discussion between Russian Federation Minister of Justice Yuriy Kalmykov and DELOVOY MIR political observer Miroslav Buzhkevich. [Buzhkevich] The position of our entrepreneurs is unenviable. In addition to objective difficulties related to the decline of production and the disturbance of economic ties, at each step they encounter all kinds of legal restrictions that hamper their initiative. Is it true, Yuriy Khamzatovich, that the legal base for entrepreneurship in our country is that weak? [Kalmykov] The first steps to its creation were taken a couple of years ago. The Union parliament adopted a most important Law on Property and also the Fundamentals of Civil Legislation. After these came analogous Russian legal acts: On Property, On the Enterprise and Entrepreneurial Activity, On Banks and Banking Activity, etc. So it would be wrong to say that we do not have a base for development of the market. It is another matter that this base is painfully inadequate and still weak. Not only do we not have enough concrete legal acts, but we are lacking the main thing--an integrated system of interconnected and mutually conditioned laws based on common principles of market relations. We are wrong to hurry to create special normative acts, say, concerning the coal industry or grain without relying on specific initial positions. Throughout the rest of the world they have begun with basic codified acts such as the Civil Code, the Trade Turnover Code, etc. The practice of issuing particular government decrees is being reflected in the regulation of the entire market space. There are still frequent cases of the appearance of legal acts that contradict those that already exist. For example, a draft of Fundamentals of Land Legislation was prepared in which all the questions--conclusion of purchase and sale transactions, leasing, inheritance policy etc.--were resolved differently from the way they are in the Civil Code. And regulation should be standard for all objects of market circulation. If, for example, securities are inherited according to one set of rules and buildings and motor vehicles according to another, if each special law introduces its own norms--there will be no market. [Buzhkevich] You mentioned the Civil Code. It is considered to be the main market law and is even called the business bible. Why? [Kalmykov] I would call the Civil Code the constitution of market relations. It is head and shoulders above any special federal law and has great legal force. If particular provisions of the latter contradict it, preference is always given to the norms established by the Civil Code. The first, so-called general, part of it contains descriptions pertaining to participants in market turnover. Both citizens and legal entities. And also the Russian state, components of the Federation, and municipal structures. They used to be participants not in civil relations but in subordinate, administrative ones. Additionally, this same part of the Code contains a practically complete description of all subjects of civil relations: economic partnerships, companies, associations, concerns, etc. Conditions are determined for their creation, organization, and liquidation. It also discusses what commercial organizations and institutions are. The draft recognizes: Civil law applies to all commodity-monetary relations. Including everything related to the land and other kinds of immovable property. At the same time the draft does not envision regulation of market relations. And it recognizes the need for direct indication in the law of cases where price regulation, mandatory conclusion of agreements, etc. are allowed. Such a system is typical of developed market relations. It is extremely important that the new Civil Code be in effect in a society with a socially oriented market economy. And it envisions guarantees and means of protecting the interests of the weak party in legal relations, which most frequently is the citizen. [Buzhkevich] I would like to hear the extent to which the new Code takes into account and protects the rights of entrepreneurs? This interests our readers. [Kalmykov] The entire content of the Code, its letter and spirit, are aimed at providing for free development of civilized market relations. But before speaking about protecting the rights of businesspeople I would mention their responsibilities. When engaging in entrepreneurial activity they must act in good conscience, reasonably, fairly, observing the requirements of the law, moral principles of society, and the rules of business ethics. The draft of the Code, naturally, contains many innovations which simply could not have existed previously. I would say the primary one is granting commercial organizations (with the exception of state and municipal enterprises) general legal capacity, which makes it possible for them to participate in all kinds of business without changing their charter documents. Further, companies and partnerships, including full partnerships, are becoming the main participants in the entrepreneurial practice. All property owners are given guarantees of their rights to possession, use, and disposition of their property. At the same time an exhaustive list of cases in which forced confiscation of property from its owner, which is allowed only by a court decision, will be created. Liability for violation of commitments related to business is also interpreted in a new way. Previously the entrepreneur or firm paid for failure to observe a contract or agreement only when this occurred because of their own fault. According to the draft Code, the only person relieved of liability is the one who can prove that his failure to meet his commitments was caused by an insurmountable force, that is, a natural disaster or something similar. Freedom of contract has been established, whereby its conditions are determined by the parties themselves. In order for this principle not to lead to unlimited arbitrariness on the part of the entrepreneurs, especially those who hold a monopolistic position in the market, and also in the interests of the consumers, the concept "public contract" is introduced. It applies to commercial organizations engaging in retail trade, passenger traffic on public transportation, electricity supply for housing, and medical, hotel, municipal, and consumer services. They do not have the right to refuse these services to citizens or establish any advantages or privileges for anyone. The second, special part of the Civil Code has to do with specific kinds of market turnover: contracts for delivery, purchase-sales, leasing, shipment, insurance, the procedure for capital construction, etc. Related to it are relations involving intellectual property (inventions, copyrights, etc.) and also problems of bequeathment and inheritance. [Buzhkevich] When can we expect the completion of the work on the Civil Code and its ratification? [Kalmykov] I think that the special part of the new Code will be ready by May or June. And the first, general part was completed long ago by scholars of the Research Center of Private Law and other scholarly institutions as well as specialists of our ministry. The government has approved this part and it would be possible to examine it, but the draft has not yet been turned over to the State Duma. Here I would like to make a digression. The idea was that all draft laws related to economic problems were to be prepared in the government and, as legislative initiative, sent to the parliament. The whole problem is that the Cabinet of Ministers has no mechanism for this. The prepared draft laws drown in the waves of bureaucratic red tape. For example, the first deputy prime minister orders that the prepared draft of a legal act be turned over to parliament, but the bureaucrats begin to discuss whether or not it is expedient and timely to do this. Days and weeks pass, and during this time other structures turn in similar drafts of their own and thus cross the road to the government. The same thing happens in the apparatus of the presidential administration. It is apparently no accident that B. Yeltsin recently said in a public statement that the bureaucratic apparatus is holding everything in its deadly embrace. The fate of the draft of the general part of the Civil Code can serve as a clear example of this. As I have already said, the government has approved it and it was turned in to the State-Legal Administration (GPU) under the president. And they are able to hold documents for a good long time. More than two months have passed but the draft is still not being studied or evaluated. I cannot understand what motivates its leaders to create such red tape. Perhaps they never find the time to gain an understanding of the draft. Sometimes a "seditious" idea occurs: How can it be that such a serious action, which will have an extremely significant impact on the country's future, was prepared without their participation. But there is no special point in trying to find the causes of red tape. It is more important to get the draft of the Civil Code turned over for discussion in the State Duma. The GPU has long been competing with the Ministry of Justice (that began back under Minister N. Fedorov) and it cannot understand that this kind of "competition" only harms the cause. [Buzhkevich] You said that the new Code or, rather, its general part could be approved by the middle of the summer. Where do you get your optimism? In the Duma there will probably be people who oppose the draft. [Kalmykov] Yes, the debates will be heated. One of the stumbling blocks is the problem of buying and selling land. I think that certain factions of agrarians and communists are trying to block the point about complete freedom to conclude such agreements. The Duma includes representatives of the so-called economic law, which existed in Soviet times as a part of jurisprudence which was actually against commodity-monetary relations. They have advised in favor of the dominance of administrative regulation of such relations. Today supporters of economic law have been forced to hedge their bets and are no longer opposing a transition to the market. But they think that the movement toward it should be different from what it is now. They assert that instead of a civil code it is more important to adopt a trade code. But we think that it is necessary to enact the Civil Code and see how it "works." It is quite possible that it will be able to encompass all problems of commercial credit as a whole. Then there will be no need for a trade code. But we cannot rule out the possibility of adopting a trade code after the civil code. [Buzhkevich] But still one cannot consider the Civil Code to be the only and all-encompassing legal act, which removes all legal and organizational barriers from the path to entrepreneurship and market relations. Concrete, as you say, special laws are also needed. [Kalmykov] And quite a few of them. To begin with I will mention the law on the joint-stock company. In principle its draft is ready. But the developer, the State Committee for Administration of State Property, having received our remarks, will not finish "digesting" it. There is an extreme need for a law on the state enterprise. Regardless of how widely the market economy may spread, a certain and considerable part of the fixed capital of the national economy, including factories, plants, etc., will remain in state hands. And all of these must be controlled and their fate must be decided: Should they be reconstructed or closed down? And this can be done by using a special law. There is an especially great need for an act on registration of legal entities, that is, companies, partnerships, concerns, etc. This area is now nothing but anarchy and confusion. Registration is handled, and far from professionally, by the mayor's offices and other municipal structures. And dishonest bureaucrats are blatantly getting rich at the expense of entrepreneurs and even certain private organizations. If you do not give bribes you risk not being registered until several months after you submit the document, or else you might be refused altogether. The law on registration will put an end to this confusion and arbitrariness. It will introduce a standard policy for this operation for all legal entities. A Russian State Register of them will be created. All this will increase the protection of the interests of civilian participants and thus market relations as well, and it will open up to them the possibility of verifying the real state of affairs of their partners and it will also make it difficult to commit abuses when reorganizing or liquidating entrepreneurial structures. The Ministry of Justice will take charge of state registration of legal entities. Perhaps we will create a special service. Finally, there is the problem of transportation relations. Today they are a Tabula rasa--a clean slate. All transportation regulations and codes have "long beards": They are antediluvian, the rules they set do not correspond to the present day or market relations. Look at what is being done on the railroads. Deadlines for delivering freight are not being met, freight is frequently lost, and sometimes it is stolen. There is nothing you can say about the position of the passengers either. None of the transportation workers--neither the railroads nor the airlines nor the motor vehicle services nor the river transportation services is responsible to them in any way at all. We have not come a step closer to international standards here. All this is completely out of keeping with the rules of market turnover. The regulations for rail and automotive transportation and the aviation code must be created from scratch. And they must correspond fully to the Civil Code. And transportation workers and those who defend them in the state structures must understand that the stricter the demands for service to the clients, the more the railroad workers and airline personnel themselves stand to gain because life will force them to work honestly and in an organized way, and they will finally be rid of the constant insulting, although fair, criticism against them. [Buzhkevich] You mentioned those who protect the interests of transportation workers in state structures. This kind of protection is frequently called lobbying. How do you feel about this phenomenon, which until quite recently was considered to be purely capitalistic and is now spreading to our country? [Kalmykov] There is lobbying and then there is lobbying. In countries with developed market relations lobbying has long been an important institution of political and economic life. They have a multitude of forms which undertake to help joint-stock companies, commercial firms, and political parties to conduct their transactions, projects, and programs. In a number of countries experts of these firms are credited with the parliament, the government, and the presidential administration. It is not easy to obtain this accreditation. It is necessary to be not only a specialist with a degree in the area in which the firm is engaged but also to be well versed in public and private law. Any concealed lobbying is punishable by law or becomes an occasion for scandalous disclosures that cost the careers of political figures and commercial and financial bigwigs. And I am for this kind of completely civilized lobbying. But now, during the period of transition to the market, the proper conditions for this kind of activity do not exist. And what we now call lobbying has nothing in common with it and causes harm to society and the economy. Because it is based on corporate or personal connections and frequently on corruption and bribes. And most often it leads to the transfer of materials and funds to those regions and those branches of the national economy which you cannot call the most needy, the ones in a catastrophic situation. When the state budget for this year was being formed I observed how the chairman of the government did everything he could to hold up under the pressure from involved individuals and groups who were trying to pull apart the cost side of the budget in the name of branch, corporate, and other interests. And they basically managed to do this. [Buzhkevich] But it still stood up under the demands of the agrarians.... [Kalmykov] Not entirely. There are such things as unpaid debts. Under conditions of a normal economy and a rule-of-law state, they are ruled out because there is a reliable mechanism in place for compulsory collection of money from debtors. Everything is different here. The economy is in a transition period and it is far from being a normal, market economy. And the state has to pay for this. For instance, they say that we must not take on debts and subsidize certain branches. They say we must stick to our guns for otherwise we will not be able to cope with inflation. From a formal economic standpoint this might be true. But there is the real situation, the actual pit in which we are all sitting. And we have to get out of it. And we have no time for formalities because then we will not achieve anything. Of course, we can say to the director of an enterprise: If your debtor will not pay, take him to court. But if he does not have a shirt on his back, you will not be able to get any money from him. Perhaps it is better (half of our enterprises cannot declare bankruptcy) to help him, to give him a little support through the state. Then you might look and see that the enterprise is on its feet. We have already said that we are in a transition period. That being the case, the state must exert a regulating influence on the situation. That is what President Franklin Roosevelt did 60 years ago when the United States was establishing a market. I think that our prime minister was right to support the petition to allot funds to agriculture, part of which were a state debt. How can we leave the peasantry without funds, materials, and fuel right before planting. From here it is not far to disaster--the country could be left without food and other agricultural products. It is another matter when they demand additional credit, and at preferential rates. Here again is a manifestation of subjective lobbying. Various viewpoints and opinions, mainly regarding concrete problems, exist in any government. People frequently say that it is a single team and must think the same, they must be playing the same song. But that is pure utopia. In government structures there are people who think in different ways, and this is probably a normal phenomenon. It is important for the government to be unified in the main thing, the overall line of behavior.
