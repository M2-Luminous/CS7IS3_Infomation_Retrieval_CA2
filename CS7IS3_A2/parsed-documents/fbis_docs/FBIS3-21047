The Tiger will evolve into "an 80-percent standard helicopter, to which different equipment will be added as needed," said Eurocopter president Jean-Francois Bigay. Industrialization of the helicopter is slated for early 1995, following the recent signature of a government agreement between France and Germany. Initial designs called for two versions: an antitank helicopter dubbed Tiger, and a battlefield version christened Gerfaut. France plans to buy 140 Tigers and 75 Gerfauts, which the army has just renamed Tiger. Budget difficulties and a new strategic context have prompted Germany to cut back its need for Tigers (which it calls UHUs) to 75 for the 1993-2003 period. Germany will order a versatile antitank/battlefield version, said Mr. Bigay. In terms of exports, Eurocopter is counting on a British order of 91 Tigers, on which London plans to announce its decision in May of 1995. In addition, the joint venture firm has just begun studying another versatile, cheaper Tiger version, which it plans to export beginning in 1998, notably (it hopes) to the Netherlands.
