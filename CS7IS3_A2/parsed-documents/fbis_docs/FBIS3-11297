We helped them to prepare the first groups, the first organizations, through ecclesiastic movements and social pastoral activities, which helped them to organize, to become aware, and to become capable of reasoning in such a way as to identify and defend their rights." He denied the report circulating in political circles that the Church contributed financially to the campesino march. "Neither the CEP nor any diocese did this formally. I do not know who disseminated this rumor. Some lay organizations of some parishes or the campesino movements themselves may have made contributions out of solidarity, which I believe is totally normal. In addition, campesinos are sufficiently mature to manage on their own," the bishop said. He termed as "interesting" the solidarity that the campesinos received from other sectors. He added: "To a certain degree, some solidarity was expressed by opportunists. After the campesinos made the effort to gather in the interior and get to Asuncion, they encountered here in the capital some political and other groups that offered their solidarity. The power groups had the possibility, and even the obligation, to seek some kind of solution to this economic and social situation, which is not new." He indicated that seeking a solution does not depend only on the president. "Congress and the judicial branch are also responsible. We need an improved judicial system and more guarantees in this sector. The drafting of budgets should also be improved. In addition to the lack of appropriate payment for products, there also a deficit in providing fundamental requirements: Education, roads, schools, health, and communications. All of these need resources from the budgets. The institutions that deal with budgets say they do not have the resources. A responsibility is to be found there." "To support the campesinos also means relying on an appropriate legislation to collect resources from the people who have more, and other legislation to recover ill-gotten gains and put them at the service of the common welfare. This could have been done by the power groups, who could have begun this task immediately so that the solidarity with the campesinos could have been expressed with concrete facts to help them," he concluded.
