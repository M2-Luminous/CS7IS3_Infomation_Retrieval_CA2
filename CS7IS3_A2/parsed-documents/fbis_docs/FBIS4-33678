The Cuban Foreign Ministry has explained the reasons for tightening security measures around some embassies in Havana following the forceful entry by 121 Cubans into the Belgian ambassador's residence, from where they are demanding to be permitted to leave the country. The Foreign Ministry has also reported that two Canadian citizens were arrested because of their participation in an illegal departure attempt that resulted in the death of two people. Saturday [4 June], a group of Cubans seized a sand barge in the port of Mariel. This action resulted in an incident in which a National Border Guard boat pursued the vessel until it reached international waters. At the end of May, a Cuban couple died after being swindled by a person who convinced them that he could guide them through the mine fields around Guantanamo Naval Base, where they were attempting to go in a bid to reach the United States. Both within and outside of Cuba, there are those who encourage illegal departures of people who do not believe they can travel to the United States legally. In 1993, only some 1,600 Cubans received visas to travel to the United States directly, despite a bilateral agreement that permits the granting of 20,000 visas annually. More than 60 percent of the visa requests from people under the age of 40 are rejected each year by the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. Coincidentally, most of the people who cross the Straits of Florida in fragile boats are young people between the ages of 20 and 30. It should not be overlooked that some Cubans are attracted to the United States because of the possibility of improving their economic situation. They try to get there by any means, leaving behind undeniable limitations in Cuba. As a result of the Readjustments Act, any Cuban, regardless of his reasons for or mode of arriving in the United States, can receive refugee status in that country. All these people have to do is reach U.S. territory and stay there for one year. As long as the United States grants these privileges and prevents those Cubans who adhere to legitimate procedures from traveling to the United States for economic reasons or to visit their relatives, drastic actions that almost always end tragically will be possible.
