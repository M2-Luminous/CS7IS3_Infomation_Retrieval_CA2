On Tuesday, President Alfredo Cristiani asserted that the differences among the various FMLN groups only confirm his prediction on the night of 24 April, when ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] celebrated its presidential victory. President Cristiani believes the differences that have appeared among the FMLN deputies because of the election of Ana Guadalupe Martinez and German Cienfuegos as Legislative Assembly vice president and secretary, respectively, simply confirm the divisions that have always existed in this political party, as was pointed out by his government and ARENA a long time ago. [Begin Cristiani recording] The FMLN is an association of five groups with ideological differences, which -- and let us put it this way -- got together to fight a war. Now that we no longer have a war and now that politics prevail, those differences have come out in the open. [end recording] According to the president, the differences among the former guerrillas will increase in future debates at the Legislative Assembly, because there are different ideological positions within the FMLN. Referring to the peace accords, Cristiani reiterated that the assignment of 5,700 PNC [National Civilian Police] policemen will conclude before October. He confirmed, however, the National Police's demobilization will take a bit longer. [Begin Cristiani recording] A great deal depends, of course, on the Public Security Academy's graduations. We cannot go faster than the academy that graduates the policemen. We believe, however, that the transition period will have to be extended at least six months. [end recording] Cristiani admitted that there has been no agreement with the FMLN to extend the National Police's demobilization. According to the president, this is because the front has refused to look for alternatives with the government and Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] so that Calderon Sol's administration will not encounter public security problems. If no agreements are reached this month, the president-elect will be the one to decide whether or not the total demobilization of the National Police will be extended.
