When a natural disaster strikes, they can get a premium from disaster insurance. In the nine counties and cities around Hangzhou, the provincial capital, a cooperative disaster-relieving insurance now covers more than 70 percent of the farm households. To work out a social security system in rural China is a new issue which the country is exploring in the process of developing a market economy. Such insurance also helps put an end to the traditional practice of farmers having more children in order to guarantee a secure old age, one of the causes of China's huge population.
