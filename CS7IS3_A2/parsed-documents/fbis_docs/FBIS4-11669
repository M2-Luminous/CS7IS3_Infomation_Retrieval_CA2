How can such acts of violence be prevented? [Al-Tibi] Only by implementing the peace agreement. Even though things will not become completely peaceful then, the acts of violence will at least be reduced. [Albrecht] Yesterday, it seemed that the peace negotiations would be continued now. Is this still true? [Al-Tibi] The PLO Executive Committee is currently discussing how things are going to continue after the latest crime. [Albrecht] You call it a crime. [Al-Tibi] Yes, it is a crime. It is just a continuation of the Hebron massacre. First, Baruch Goldstein shot 30 people. Then, during the following eight days, the Israeli military shot 30 Palestinians. And now another six Palestinians were killed. It will be very difficult to continue the peace talks this week. [Albrecht] What is your demand to the Israelis? [Al-Tibi] They should stop killing us. They should make sure that the atmosphere changes and they finally see us as human beings. [Albrecht] Do you trust Rabin, who is defense minister and prime minister at the same time? [Al-Tibi] Defense Minister Rabin is hurting the peace efforts of Prime Minister Rabin. [Albrecht] How, do you think, did this most recent shooting of Palestinians come about? [Al-Tibi] The only reason that can be behind that is that there was an order to stage a massacre. If the Israeli military goes to the refugee camps, it does so only for one specific reason. In addition, these soldiers were not normal military. They were a special unit that went in to shoot people. Who gave the order to go to the refugee camp one day before the continuation of the talks? [Albrecht] A few days ago you were still optimistic about the peace process. You spoke of "historic changes" and of the "mutual recognition of the two peoples." [Al-Tibi] Yes, I was naively optimistic. [Albrecht] Why? [Al-Tibi] Because we were very close to an interim solution after the massacre in Hebron. Nevertheless, I am sure that, in the end, we will implement the peace agreement. [Albrecht] The trust of the Palestinians in their leadership is constantly decreasing. While the leadership wants to continue the peace talks, the people at the grassroots demand not to continue negotiations. [Al-Tibi] Yes, I just had a telephone call from Gaza. I was asked to tell 'Arafat that he should stop the peace talks. However, there is no alternative to the peace process. Of course, our credibility has suffered. The Palestinians still do not see any change or improvement. I am sure that at the moment when the agreement comes into force and when the Palestinians see that the Israeli military withdraws, the support for peace will be there again. I know my people.
