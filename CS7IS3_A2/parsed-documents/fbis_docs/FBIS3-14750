Georgia's authorities explain the standstill of traffic by an accident at the Gardabani power station. Of course, this is a more than objective reason. But, after all, in the Georgian ports of Batumi and Poti cargo intended for Armenia, including food such as flour, oil, sugar, are traditionally unloaded. A meeting between Georgia's Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia, who has arrived in Armenia, and President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Premier Grant Bagratyan, was devoted to the question of the normalization of the operation of the railway and the transit supply of Turkmenian gas across Georgia to Armenia. President Levon Ter-Petrosyan also told representatives of the diplomatic corps accredited in Yerevan of the difficult situation which has arisen in Armenia because of the traffic on the southern section of the Georgian Railway grinding to a halt. Touching on this meeting, Vahan Papazyan, the republic's Foreign Minister, stated at the latest briefing: I don't think that the meeting with the diplomats will produce immediate results, but something will be done, because it is not advantageous to any of the countries whose representatives attended the meeting for there to be an unstable situation in Armenia and Georgia. The Minister also said, and I am now quoting from the "Armenian Republic" newspaper: Georgia, availing itself of its convenient geographic situation, is bringing pressure to bear on Armenia. In turn, other neighbors of ours are pressuring Georgia into bringing pressure to bear on Armenia. But, thanks to the fact that we have a positive balance with Turkmenistan -- and that to date we should be receiving 12 million cubic meters of natural gas per 24 hours -- Armenia agrees to sell half of its gas to Georgia so that it take upon itself the delivery of cargo from the ports of Poti and Batumi to our country. Georgia proved unprepared for this proposal of ours, and Patsatsia has returned to Georgia for consultations. It is difficult to say how long these consultations will last, but one thing is clear: Without a railway link with the outer world Armenia will find it exceedingly difficult to live.
