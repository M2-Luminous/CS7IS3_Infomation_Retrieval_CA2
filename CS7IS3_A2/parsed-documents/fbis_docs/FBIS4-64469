There were no votes against and four abstentions. FDP Chairman Kinkel came out in favor of reexamining the solidarity surcharge after three years with the goal of abolishing it, but he added: "At the moment the FDP is not imposing any conditions for continuing the coalition." The FDP has ideas and goals. However, one cannot divide the skin of the bear before the bear has been shot and say that a coalition is possible only if certain conditions are met. Kinkel told the Executive Committee that over the past two weeks he had gained the impression at the laender party congresses that there was relief everywhere "that the clarification of the coalition statement has strengthened the FDP's ability to act on key issues." For the FDP the prospects for the success of the coalition in October have improved: "Now the CDU/CSU also has to do its part." Kinkel announced that the FDP will campaign on its own, adopting the slogan "marching separately, attacking together." The election program, which was discussed by the Executive Committee on Monday in preparation for the paper to be adopted at the Rostock congress, will "clearly demonstrate the FDP's autonomy" with a list of demands. The FDP's "function argument" has again gained in importance. Kinkel said: "Anyone who wants to prevent a red-green or a grand coalition must vote for the FDP." A red-green coalition in Bonn would lead to a crisis of trust in foreign policy and to a "disaster for jobs." Kinkel warned against a grand coalition of the CDU/CSU with the Social Democratic Party [SPD], calling it "autocratic rule by two." By continuing the current coalition, on the other hand, internal unification can be completed and Germany's role in the world can be made active. Kinkel said that all "speculation" about the FDP's behavior in the presidential election is currently moot. The FDP supports its candidate Hamm-Bruecher. After every ballot the FDP group in the Federal Convention, which is to be held on Whit Monday, will discuss its further course of action: "There will be no anticipatory decisions." However, it is already clear: "The FDP will be a decisive element." North Rhine-Westphalian Land Chairman Moellemann said that the party chairman has the right to make his own proposals. If the proposal says that one should also vote for Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher in the third ballot, no one will contradict him. "However, if the proposal is Herzog, there will be a counterproposal: Then the FDP group must vote on it." Moellemann repeated that his "preference" is SPD candidate Rau. Kinkel reproached the SPD: "Scharping's popularity in the SPD will continue to decline." With the party's "failed tax plans," Scharping made a crucial mistake. The SPD wants to raise property and inheritance tax, raise the standard value of houses and apartments, and burden qualified secretaries and skilled workers with the supplementary tax. Kinkel said: "A vote for the SPD is a costly one." The FDP rejects a general speed limit, advocates computer-controlled traffic guidance systems, and wants to maintain for citizens with the pleasure of driving on the few kilometers of highway that are not yet subject to a speed limit. Mr. Zoepel's withdrawal from Scharping's team reflects rising dissatisfaction with Scharping's "attempt to tiptoe to power without giving offense to anyone." Instead, "Scharping should have the courage to put the SPD's policy openly and honestly up for a vote." In the Executive Committee FDP Bundestag Caucus Chairman Solms denied reports that he doubted that Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger would be nominated as minister again after the Bundestag elections. Kinkel said: "The justice minister is doing good work, which meets with widespread appreciation; I support her without any ifs or buts." Moellemann used a newspaper report about alleged critical statements by Solms about the justice minister as an opportunity to reproach the caucus chairman: "It is unacceptable that ministers or other leading functionaries are simply released for the kill." If Solms had wanted to avoid the impression that he opposes Mrs. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, he should have done that at the appropriate time "as a professional." Moellemann then annoyed Solms with the question: "What would happen if someone asked who the next caucus chairman is supposed to be?" Then there would be general uncertainty. Moellemann said: "We must support all ministers, chairmen, etc." In the Executive Committee Moellemann, Saarland Chairman Cronauer, North Rhine-Westphalia Chairman Rohde, and domestic policy expert Baum abstained from the vote. They did not contradict the "contents" of the coalition statement, but they considered the date of its issuance to be wrong. There was almost unanimous approval in the debate, but some Executive Committee members -- in particular from eastern Germany -- demanded that the coalition statement now be supplemented with "details of contents." The FDP must not just say that it wants to get together with certain partners but also why it considers this appropriate. Kinkel responded that the FDP will answer these questions with its election program. Moellemann criticized the fact that the Executive Committee, which is the responsible body, is dealing with the coalition statement only two weeks after the Presidium made its decision. Because of the letter with which Solms rejected Moellemann's criticism of the coalition statement and accused him of attempting to build a "counterstrategy," and as a response to Kinkel's statements at the land party congress of the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP in Dortmund a week ago, Moellemann complained about "the unprecedented reprimand of a land chairman by the Bundestag group chairman and the party chairman." However, there is no point in continuing the quarrel. Logic dictates that the Bonn coalition should be continued because it has held up until now and it is not expected to fall apart before the elections. However, the "function of the coalition statement" must be clarified with a description of priority goals "in essential fields." Some younger Executive Committee members demanded that the FDP avoid tying itself down by "setting down specific topics," which Moellemann wanted to be understood as prerequisites. The path toward a social-liberal coalition must not be completely blocked, since the other parties reserve for themselves various postelection options. FDP Honorary Chairman Genscher left the Executive Committee Meeting during Kinkel's opening statement and before the debate. The Executive Committee received Moellemann's attacks against Solms and Kinkel without a response. It is said that the party leadership received widespread support in the Executive Committee.
