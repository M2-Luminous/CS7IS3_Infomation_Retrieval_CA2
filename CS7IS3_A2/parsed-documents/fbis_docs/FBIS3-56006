It looks as though something like the opposite has happened with U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Russia. On the eve of the visit Russian and U.S. representatives warned very frankly that no special sensations were to be expected. And this despite the fact that the program for the visit envisaged very important events. They included the signing of the Russian-U.S. declaration containing, informed sources in the Foreign Ministry assert, provisions on the nontargeting of the two states' strategic forces against each other. They also include the sensational meeting with the Ukrainian president's participation. In brief, there were many opportunities for "boosting" the visit. But they decided to refrain from doing this. And it was not a question of the modesty of diplomats and politicians. In my view the point is that U.S.-Russian relations have indeed reached a level when they do not need breakthroughs. That is, they do not need risky political decisions based on the intuition of leaders and the degree of their trust in each other. These relations to all appearances have indeed reached a stage which can be called, as the documents which have been prepared call it, a mature strategic partnership. Some people may say that this is also an attempt to make out what is desired as reality. Our countries' positions are too different now and their clout in the world is too different. That is true, just as it is true that over the past few months and weeks each side has had the opportunity to take a realistic look at its partner and to rid itself of unjustified hopes. Whether they are illusions of the creation of a new world order with the United States' undoubted leadership. Or hopes for a rapid way out of the crisis in Russia as a result of aid from abroad. As a result of this sober assessment the sides concluded that we need each other. And Washington needs Moscow no less than Moscow needs Washington. Take questions of economic cooperation, which have become central in bilateral relations. On this score you can hear diametrically opposed views. It would be wrong to say that the United States is not rendering aid to Russia. Approximately $2 billion a year are being assigned for this purpose -- more than to any other foreign state. Yet after all this aid is simply insignificant if you bear in mind the scale of the reforms undertaken in Russia. It has now finally become clear to everyone that to implement them Moscow needs not credit, still less humanitarian aid. It needs honest partnership, whose aim would be to emerge onto the world market with its own output, already entirely competitive today, be it aluminium or space high technology. The aim of this partnership is to ensure conditions for the broad investment of private business funds in our economy. But for that to happen it is not enough simply to repeal COCOM [the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] or to renounce discriminatory legislation of the cold war times. We must start to remove trade and customs barriers. Russia also expects the United States to influence those international financial institutions which are so far very cool toward the need to support our reforms. But does that mean we expect charity from the United States? Obviously not. I think the Clinton administration realizes that whether Russia remains a democratic, peace-loving state depends on the success of the reforms, and it is that which will determine whether or not global stability will be successfully ensured on our planet or not. After a number of painful defeats in foreign policy the U.S. Administration seems to have agreed that this global stability is possible only on the basis of a new Russian-U.S. partnership. Only by joint efforts is it possible to respond to the threats which have now appeared in the security field. For instance we must ensure a regime of the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Here too we cannot fail to mention the forthcoming meeting in Moscow between the presidents of Russia, the United States, and Ukraine. It is believed that documents will be signed which will finally determine Ukraine's movement toward nuclear-free status. The voices of skeptics are already being heard: It has become the Ukrainian leader's style to review agreements that have already been concluded. But one way or another it remains a fact that the United States and Russia are persistently moving together toward the solution of this complex issue. One more confirmation of the level of this cooperation: The American "partnership for peace" plan. One cannot fail to see that it was born and was adopted primarily with a consideration for Russia's legitimate interests in the field of security. It is entirely possible that Moscow will announce its participation in it. Here Russia sees in partnership for peace not an end in itself but one element of the architecture of European security that is taking shape. Peacemaking still has to become a notable element of cooperation between Russia and the United States. There is not yet complete clarity here in approaches, there are different views of how to implement the settlement of local conflicts particularly in the post-Soviet area. But the fact that the question has already been raised of assigning Russian and U.S. troop formations to carry out emergency peacekeeping operations under the UN mandate says a lot. In general Moscow believes that our strategic partnership is a good basis for discussing problems of the fundamental restructuring of the entire system of international relations. And these are just a few of the problems which are to be discussed during the Russian-U.S. meeting. And in addition there is a very broad agenda: from agreements on human rights to documents on cooperation in eliminating chemical weapons, from problems of banning the production of fissionable materials for military purposes and banning nuclear materials to the coordination of actions in a Near East settlement. It is not simple to earmark the main, key problem and we should scarcely do so. I very much liked the working term "comprehensive" which is used in our day with regard to Clinton's visit. It is not only that during the visit the entire complex of bilateral and global problems is being discussed. It is also that the importance of each of these problems can only be understood in combination with others. And only in this way, by assessing what is happening as a package, can we reach the conclusion that our states really do need close cooperation with each other.
