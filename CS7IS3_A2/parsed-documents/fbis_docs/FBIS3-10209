The new bank was organized by the National Union of Farmers and Cattlemen (UNAG), whose 125,000 members will more easily receive credit, according to UNAG President Daniel Nunez. The article notes that Bancam will give priority to small and medium agricultural and livestock producers. Bancam manager Luis Morales Uriarte stresses that the bank will offer all the services available at any commercial bank: "We are aware that in the beginning we will not respond to all the credit needs of small and medium producers, but within four or five years we hope to have a strong presence in the financial sector." Bancam is receiving financial support from Rabo Bank of the Netherlands, Credit Agricole of France, HIVOS, and Stichting Doen.
