Although given the situation we find ourselves in these past few years, which you might call anything but normal and usual (for example, sarcastically: "interesting," fashionably: "paradoxical," agitatedly: "critical," realistically: "pathetic and deplorable"), any kind of question can arise and even demand an answer. What is left to wonder at when that most absurd of phrases--"logical paradox" (we hold the copyright)--has a right to exist? Nevertheless, the above question did not occur to us. Later, as we talked about various things, Rustavi Mayor Soso Areshidze himself posed it. We sensed that the question was not rhetorical; he had an answer, but not the logical "It's bad." What's good about having enterprises stand idle when resumption of operations could affect not only Rustavi itself but, in a few days, the whole republic? But if that were true, the question would not have been asked. In such cases, the question is usually answered by the one who asked it: "It depends on who you ask," said the mayor. "As far as I am concerned, it is better for an enterprise to stand idle than for its earnings to go to the wrong place and be used for the wrong things. "Oh yes, I know that just about all countries have the mafia problem, but there has to be a limit. Even the mafia has its rules. First of all, it is not banditry, otherwise it would have a different name. But nobody cares about anything, or respects anything or anyone! They've got everything, now they want power. Hey, why not?! "They even act as if they were the people's champion! Once they took over the bakery. Who asked them?" It used to be that if a raykom secretary asked a friend to come work with him, the man's joy--and then his luck--knew no bounds. Now, if the mayor or rayon head asks you to come work with him you have to have a lot of respect for him not to say no. The ordinary working man does not care for politics, it doesn't interest him. He wants a decent life, and if he doesn't have it he sees the city's or rayon's top man as the source of all his woes. Anonymous persons telephone regional leaders at home with brief and specific complaints--"Do your lights work?", "Do you have water?", "You aren't hungry or cold, are you?" These are so much like the old days (although then the complainers probably didn't phone), but the psychology is the same: everyone demands that he--the top man--solve their problems. Regional management is one of the most important problems of Georgia today. As in other aspects of our lives, there is disorder and confusion here as well. "We do have our independence," says the mayor. "No one from above either helps us or bugs us. In short, they don't get involved." A question again, this time from us: "Is that good or bad?" And again the answer: "It depends on who you ask...." A little later, after he tells us that in the old days he couldn't have served as raykom secretary, he wasn't good enough, we pretty much understood the meaning of his answer, in this case "It's not a bad thing. After all, we have to learn to stand on our own feet." And if we recall the beginning of our talk, the idea--containing one indispensable condition--logically continues: "But first, law and order has to be established." That is indisputable, but of course it does not mean that there are not certain other, equally important conditions. We talk about cadre policy. The mayor emphasizes the importance of choosing personnel correctly, in particular leadership cadres. That is as indisputable as the fact that in many spheres, reality imposes quite different demands, and poses questions too: "How long do we have to put up with our appointed leadership?", "Where is the institution of proprietorship?" We do agree, after all, that we don't want to go back. We are no longer trying to rebuild what we destroyed--otherwise, what was the point of destroying it?! Life changes rapidly in terms of reality and paradigm, and every step that is delayed hits us right in the sorest spots. However slowly, privatization is proceeding [the mayor continues]. Relatively small entities--retail and consumer outlets--are winding up in the hands of private owners, but things are more complicated in the case of major enterprises. The process of creating joint-stock companies has been slow getting started. At present, only six joint-stock companies have been registered, while the documentation has been prepared for 10. Small-scale privatization is hampered by the slow pace of differentiating state and municipal property, owing to the unacceptability of the law on municipal property ownership. Practical steps are being taken to privatize retail and transportation outfits which definitely ought to be subject to municipal ownership. There are also complaints about joint stock companies: enterprise officials have a negative attitude toward amounts of shares to be transferred to the labor collectives free of charge or at reduced prices in accordance with the republic's privatization program, namely 4-5 and 10 percent. At a joint meeting of the Mayor's Office and the Collegium of the State Property Management Ministry the opinion was expressed that not less than 20 percent of the shares should be transferred free of charge to the labor collective, and in cases where the state does not keep a package of shares, the collective ought to have the right to purchase up to 51 percent of the shares on preferential terms, which, in our opinion, would be more fair. The collectives are treated badly enough as it is. Here's one example: by the government's decision, consumption quotas were imposed on goods produced last year; according to them, a quota of 75 percent of an enterprise's production output went to the state, 10 percent stayed with the local administration, and only 15 percent went to the enterprise. You can imagine how well that stimulates the plant's operations! Another issue which I have to raise: this year's first-quarter budget. In the case of electricity and gas alone we have to pay a subsidy in the amount of a price differential of 31 and 35 billion coupons. Not counting other costs, we must add to this the funds for health, culture, education, and municipal services, adding up to at least 20 billion coupons. In other words, the first-quarter budget came out to more than 90 billion coupons, at a time when, based on present normatives, revenues total about 30 billion coupons. This absurdity is due to the fact that the republic Cabinet of Ministers decided to reduce enterprise profit taxes, which is a good thing in and of itself, but it shouldn't have been done at the city's expense alone. At least some percentage ought to be retained; the republic takes 90 percent of the value-added tax, and only 10 percent remains here. Even if all this tax were to be kept by the city, which is not only desirable but essential, it wouldn't help things, because it won't pay our costs. There is just one solution: the republic ought to take over the subsidy, otherwise we won't have the means to pay the price differentials. [Question] What are the prospects for developing entrepreneurship in the city? [Answer] We are doing everything we can to foster small businesses. A total of 2,176 small and one-man businesses, additional-liability and limited-liability companies, and cooperatives are registered in Rustavi, of which 953 are now in operation, including 117 in industry, 101 in construction, and 735 in commerce. In 1993, 28 billion coupons of finished goods were produced. Profits totalled 17.2 billion coupons, and 5.7 billion coupons went into the budget. The results would have been better if it were not for the energy crisis, which has not only hurt small businesses and firms but also major industrial giants, and if they cease operations we are in trouble. After all, Rustavi is an industrial city, we have no other reserves. Some progress has been made; a few enterprises have resumed operations. We need more. [Question] Any chance of that? [Answer] There is hope. If we can get the energy, we'll get on our feet. The Azot Production Association needs 80 megawatts of electricity and 50,000 cubic meters of gas per hour to operate properly, and supplies need to be steady. Other enterprises have similar problems. If Azot can't work, almost all of agriculture will fail. These problems are interconnected and condition one another. [Question] We think of the resumption of enterprise operations as a solution, but "who are they going to be working for?" Isn't that problem still on the agenda? [Answer] Things are hopeful there too. The recent republic-wide effort--open, implacable war against the criminal world--gives grounds for optimism. There are many problems. Moreover, as the mayor says, "each problem comes first." Nevertheless, two main problems stand out--the economy, and law and order. Should they be dealt with in parallel or in sequence? On the one hand, there is the criminal, created by society, for whom the appropriate environment must be created--a real chance to make a living through honest labor--before asking him to go straight. On the other hand, until law and order is in place any thought of creating wealth is just an idle dream. "Where shall we begin?", says city Police Chief Rezo Belkania, answering our question with the same question. "From my viewpoint it would be best to start with the economy." [Question] The businessman would probably say that first you need law and order. [Answer] And both of us would be right. All kidding aside, probably we have to act first, to create the necessary conditions for creating wealth, and, in addition, a mechanism for protecting it, or, to put it another way, provide a guarantee that the wealth will go to its proper destination. [Question] Who gives you the most trouble in your activities? [Answer] The armed formal units. There are virtually no armed informal units left in the city. For example, let's say we catch someone in the act. We report them to their superiors and turn them over for appropriate action. But only one action is forthcoming--the criminal is out on the streets the next day. Once we arrested some military police officers in a restaurant for hooliganism, we disarmed them and turned them over to the Military Police authorities. They released them in a half hour and gave their weapons back. And then you know what they did? They went back to the restaurant and resumed their drinking party, after which they caught one of our officers that had taken part in the raid, killed him and threw him into the Kura River. Another incident: Someone stole an automatic weapon and two submachine guns from an armed unit belonging to the Defense Ministry. We caught the thieves, who turned out to be uniformed personnel of the same unit. They were free in a week. Recently, 13 men armed with automatic weapons broke into the auxiliary farm of the Metal Components Plant and stole five cows. The bandits were caught red-handed, and guess who they were? Members of the Rustavi Reconnaissance and Landing Battalion of the Defense Ministry's First Army Corps. [Question] Wow! Almost hard to believe.... Apparently they reconnoitered the target, then they made their assault and carried out the operation. But it fell through. [Answer] They were free in two days, although after the incident that Corps was abolished.... Nevertheless, we can all see that a fresh breeze is blowing, from the top. The process is underway. Nothing can stop us now. The criminals' days are numbered. But would you like to know what kind of equipment they have? We could only dream. They are in radio contact with each other. Weapons and gasoline are no problem to them. We, on the other hand, when two crimes take place at once, have a hard time deciding which one is more urgent to go to. There is no way we can go both places. Everything is a problem for us, even uniforms for the personnel. Still, we are accomplishing some things. But we are still far from being satisfied. We need the public's support, and though it is slow in coming I think we are getting it. And so, we are not retreating. We have to establish order. People have enough trouble without being fearful as well. [end of Belkania quote] The police chief's attitude is commendable. The police are working and will probably win. "Where shall we start?" Rustavi's First Deputy Mayor for Economic Affairs Malkhaz Gvazava has an unequivocal answer to that question: "Start by establishing order. Without that, anything else is empty talk. The economy can get on its feet only under conditions of law and order. A vigorous economy and proper management of it--privatization, the formation of joint-stock companies, and land distribution--these are the things that create the conditions which foster development. Budget-funded organizations will have to start making the changes called for in the plan. These are the conditions that will serve to correct the situation. Our city's great potential gives grounds for real optimism. "To put people to work we need the appropriate mechanism, but we are not giving enough thought to it. In the past few years we have destroyed a great deal, but we have not destroyed what we should have destroyed first--the socialist mentality and way of thinking. We will have to totally reorder our thinking and views, cut new patterns. Consider this simple example: How many educators or, for example, doctors do we need? Not as many as we have. Not everyone is going to be able to work in his specialty, only the best ones will succeed in doing so. The selection has to be objective and tough. I realize that this is a harsh policy, perhaps even cruel, but it is the only way. Our thinking has to be pragmatic. The principle of our best interests has to be paramount. This is the only way to ensure professionalism. There is no other way to build the future society." When Rustavi's mayor says that almost all the city's enterprises are idle, it can only foster a hopeless mood, but when Rustavi's police chief says that he has real grounds for optimism, that makes us hopeful. What we have here, undoubtedly, is a sense of the responsibility which today's harsh realities impose on officials who must break through the blank wall of hopelessness. The mayor's statement that the city is beginning to move, that enterprises are resuming operations, are practical confirmation of this.
