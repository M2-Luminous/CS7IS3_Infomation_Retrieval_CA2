His majesty the leader linked the resumption of Jordan's role in the peace process to ending search operations and harassment by warships in the Red Sea. Jordan's concern about its independence and dignity and about exercising its full sovereignty is not any less than its concern about achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region -- a peace that provides stability and is conducive to growth, progress, and development for all the people in the region. Yesterday, King Husayn reiterated the historic role Jordan has been playing during the past decades in terms of defending the Palestinian Arab people's rights to restoring their territories and to wrenching their right to self-determination. During his meeting with the Palestinian president's envoy, his majesty expressed Jordan's adherence to the Arab right to protect the holy places and to Arab sovereignty over Jerusalem. The Palestinian president's envoy hailed His Majesty King Husayn's role in maintaining the Arabism of Jerusalem and its holy places. He appreciated Jordan's stand toward the Palestinian cause, people, and their fate. This blocks the road of anyone trying to cast doubts on the Arabism of the holy city and the right to sovereignty over it and on Jordan's decisive and clear stand on the religious, historic, geographic, and physical aspects of Jerusalem. One is wrong to think that Jordan will allow a claim of sovereignty over Jerusalem by anyone other than almighty God. The fact that Jordan and its Hashemite leadership have adopted the caring, protection, and maintenance of the holy places throughout all these decades does not leave room for anyone to harbor bad or good intentions. In any case, Jordan will continue to shoulder the Arab and Palestinian concern. Despite the difficulties and challenges it faced, Jordan will continue to be the Hashemite Arab fortress that does not relinquish a single right or give up any of its principled national and pan-Arab stands on the issue of Palestine; on issues of harassment, siege, and inspection; and on various pressures exerted on it. Jordan is a free and independent homeland with its own mission. Its sons have their own ambitions and hopes of keeping their homeland impregnable and their people free and lofty.
