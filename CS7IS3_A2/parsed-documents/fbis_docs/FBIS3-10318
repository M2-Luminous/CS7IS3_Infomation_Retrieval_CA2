The official has said that the allocations were included in the regular budget for this period, as well as in 1993's extraordinary budget. The payments will be made in installments, based on the decision by the appropriate bodies, such as the Direct Tax General Directorate, Finance Ministry, or the arbitration courts established to that effect. Matamoros has said the Qualls family will receive 23 million colones in two installments before the current government ends, based on a decision against the state by the arbitration court. It will be up to the next administration to allocate 92.8 million colones, which must be paid for the expropriation of a farm measuring 1,439 hectares in Sierpe, Osa Caton, Puntarenas. Regarding the Titisa case, the authorities will make two payments of 22 million colones each, according to a ruling by the arbitration court, which will settle the dispute over the 499-hectare farm in Golfito. There will be another allocation to pay Richard Bell for property measuring 7,176 hectares in Potrero Grande, Buenos Aires Canton. The first payment of 45 million colones is to be made in May out of a total of 90 million colones that were included in the national budget for this year. The arbitration court has ordered the government to pay 183 million colones. Matamoros has said the next administration has to settle the dispute over the Santa Elena farm with U.S. citizen Joseph Hamilton. The property is presently being measured to pass that information to the World Bank court later.
