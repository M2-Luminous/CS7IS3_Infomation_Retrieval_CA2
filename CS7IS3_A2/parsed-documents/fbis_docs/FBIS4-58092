Our correspondent Hayim Hecht notes that on the map prepared by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] within the framework of the plan called Majdal Shams First, three Druze villages -- Majdal Shams, Mas'adah, and Buq'ata -- will be transferred to the Syrians, while 'Ayn Qunyah, which is situated on lower terrain, will remain with Israel. The Druze are demanding that the villages not be divided up and that all the lands that belong to them be transferred to Syria. Several Druze families on the Golan Heights have bought land in various locations in the Galilee in order to move there if the Golan is returned to Syria. Other Druze families are looking into that possibility and also the prospect of buying land on the Karmel. Our correspondent notes that Druze leaders are helping the Golan Druze. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0705 GMT on 30 April in a similar, but longer, report on the proposal adds: "Mt. Hermon and the road leading up to it, will of course remain under Israeli control. Israel is offering al-Asad two options, the first of course, preferable to us: Take the Druze villages first, we tell him, without the move being preceded by a pronouncement that we are conceding our sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The Israeli carrot to that option is a readiness to implement it immediately within three months. Al-Asad is a tough customer, therefore it is more reasonable that he will prefer the second option: The word first will be fortified by a Knesset resolution which recognizes Syrian sovereignty over the entire Golan Heights. What will sweeten Rabin's bitter pill is the fact that not a single Israeli settlement will be evacuated, just as in Gaza and Jericho First."]
