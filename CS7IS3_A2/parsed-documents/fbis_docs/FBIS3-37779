The regiment No. 18591 of the Russian Armed Forces takes up 500 hectares of land in the district of Ranki, county of Kuldiga, 5 kilometers from Skrunda where the controversial radar base is located. Such missile-attack early warnings radars first appeared in 1960's in the U.S. and the Soviet Union simultaneously. The radar base in Skrunda is only one of the eight similar military sites erected along the perimeter of the former USSR. Jundzis said that the site in Skrunda could be effectively substituted by radar stations situated in Mukachevo and Murmansk. The equipment of the base in Skrunda is worn-out and obsolete. The American experts who visited the site in 1993 were extremely surprised that the station was still functioning at all. According to Jundzis, to keep this Russian military site in Latvia would mean to preserve the direct Russian military influence and interests in Latvia for at least five-and-a-half years which would result in Latvia still being included in the zone of direct influence of the Russian military doctrine and its armed forces as well. The agreement on Skrunda turns Latvia into a voluntary hostage for the collective security of the CIS countries with unpredictable consequences that makes the Baltic Republic to undertake a number of unsubstantiated obligations towards the Russian militaries and army veterans, Jundzis said. It would be naivete to think that in 1996 Zhirinovsky or any other similarly-minded person would keep to the agreement signed by Yeltsin in 1994. For Latvia, it would be more preferable not to sign the agreement as it might at least induce the international organizations to observe their own resolutions calling for fast and complete withdrawal of the Russian troops from Latvia.
