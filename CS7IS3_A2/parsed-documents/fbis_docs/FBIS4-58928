FBIS4-58928 "drnes090dd_94008" FBIS-NES-94-090 Daily Report 9 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Executive Members Disagree on Forming Authority Executive Members Disagree on Forming Authority PM0905140994 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 9 May 94 p 5 PM0905140994 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [Rashid Khashanah report: "Palestinian Officials' Reservations Delay Announcement of National Authority Formation"] [Text] Tunis -- The [PLO] Executive Committee failed to agree at its third meeting in Tunis yesterday on forming the Palestinian authority because of reservations expressed by many of its members and figures from inside the occupied territories about the way in which President 'Arafat ran the consultations on forming the authority. President 'Arafat departed Tunis for South Africa at noon yesterday after agreeing with Executive Committee members to resume the meeting Wednesday morning -- which means postponing the handover of powers to the Palestinian authority. An Executive Committee member has said that only three members at yesterday's meeting -- which was attended by Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), Faruq Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf), Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, Samir Ghawshah, Jawid al-Ghusayn, Jamal al-Surani, Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, 'Ali Ishaq, and Yasir 'Amr -- announced their agreement to participate in the authority. The three are: 'Amr, al-Ghusayn, and al-Nashashibi. Four members announced their refusal openly. They are: Abu-Mazin, Abu-al-Lutf, Ghawshah, and al-Surani. As for 'Abd-Rabbuh, he asked for some time to consider the issue. During the meeting President 'Arafat phoned Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab, who is in Amman, and People's Party leader Bashir al-Barghuti, asking them to participate in the authority, but they refused. 'Ali Ishaq did not give a specific reply. Maybe because Muhammad 'Abbas (Abu-al-'Abbas), leader of the Palestine Liberation Front, represented by Ishaq, asked to come to Tunis and discuss the issue alone with President 'Arafat. AL-HAYAH has learned that during the meeting yesterday some Executive Committee members raised the need to agree first on rules for the authority so that its role will be clear, especially its link with the Executive Committee as an authority for the Palestinian authority. Al-Nashashibi stressed during the debates the need to define responsibilities for the authority and to draw up rules similar to those whereby the Executive Committee operates. Other speakers criticized what they termed "haste" in the Palestinian police's entry into Gaza and Jericho. They demanded that the leadership method be changed before agreeing on the names. They expressed their fear of a repetition of the "autocratic method," which they said has for some years been adopted by the Executive Committee. Some Executive Committee members objected to what they termed Fatah's monopoly on decisions and appointments to sensitive posts. They said that the appointments were made without consulting the Executive Committee and sometimes without consulting the Fatah Central Committee itself, merely on the grounds that President 'Arafat is the chairman of the Palestinian authority. As for figures inside the occupied territories, AL-HAYAH has learned that a series of contacts have been held with Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, Mahir al-Masri, and Faysal al-Husayni. They all refused to be included in forming the authority. President 'Arafat invited al-Husayni to meet with him in Tunis on Wednesday. While contacts with Ilyas Frayj have produced no results so far, as he asked for time to consider the issue. An Executive Committee member said that the tension accompanying the appointment of the Palestinian authority members is attributable to the fact that the matter no longer has anything to do with the issuing of statements and adoption of positions. "It is a real responsibility as regards the running of Palestinian affairs in the Jericho area and the Gaza Strip, from power, education, and health care to developing the course of the economic and financial cycle." He pointed out that current meetings and consultations at the Executive Committee level coincide with the donors' observations about the method of making economic decisions and managing international aid, and also with the "confusion" which Executive Committee members have noted in the police forces' entry into Gaza and Jericho, and which has led to delaying the selection of the authority members.
