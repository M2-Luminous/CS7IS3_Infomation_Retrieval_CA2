In this connection, Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, made the following statement for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and television: [Begin Izetbegovic recording] I am on the line from Bonn, where talks between us and the Croatian delegation ended an hour ago. I must say that the talks were organized by the German Government and that they took place with the help from German Foreign Minister Mr. Kinkel and Cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg. These talks took place last night and they lasted for several hours until midnight last night, because we arrived late yesterday afternoon, and all day today. They lasted for more than 10 hours with interruptions. Nothing special has been achieved. We did not expect much from these talks anyhow. As far as we are concerned, we drew their attention to three important issues: the situation in central Bosnia, Mostar, and access to the sea. Regarding central Bosnia, we took the line that military disengagement ought to be carried out by the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] withdrawing from Vitez and Busovaca. In return, our army would not enter these towns; they would be entered by a mixed police force. However, the Croatian side unfortunately rejected this proposal. Regarding Mostar, we insisted on a solution that has already been put forward, that Mostar be administered by the European Union for two years after the agreement is signed. In that period, the main job for the European Union would be to return home all Mostar citizens. This period would be under the slogan "Mostar to the Citizens of Mostar"; that is, all citizens of Mostar who have been evicted would return. Their number is huge -- tens of thousands of people have been evicted, several thousand families have been evicted from Mostar. They would return. Now they are scattered; some are in Croatia, some in Bosnia, and a huge majority of them are now in Germany and in Nordic countries. Our aim is that these people should return to Mostar. I would like to stress that we cannot accept any definition which says that Mostar is only a Croat town. We cannot accept it. Mostar is a Muslim town. It is a common town. We will insist on that. Regarding access to the sea, there has been no progress. The Croatian side is toughest here. Now they have come up with a new proposal: to cede for 50 or more years a part of the coast at the Peljesac peninsula. This actually means leasing it for 50 or more years. This refers to a part of the coast on which we could build up a port. We took that proposal into consideration, but of course we did not give any answer. We also initiated another series of current questions, primarily the release of all prisoners. According to our information, we are talking about another several thousand of our people. The Croatian side claims the figure is not as high, but it is not denying that a certain number of our prisoners -- which it has promised to release soon -- are still in prisons, like those at Heliodrom near Mostar, Dretelj, and Ljubusko. We also insisted on having a hospital sent to us, a large field hospital in the east side of Mostar, which is currently in the port Ploce and has been there for a long time. It was said that this issue has been resolved and that it is now up to the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] to transport the hospital, and that there are no further obstacles. [sentence as heard] The helicopters are unfortunately still in [Croat-held] Medjugorje, I mean our two helicopters which arrived there to pick up the wounded. According to the Croatian side, the problem there is that we have not released 71 Croat prisoners who were on the list. We will have to examine this issue again. I must say that the Croat delegation surprised us with one of their proposals. We were taken by surprise by it. It is a draft agreement on comprehensive cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. They are offering a creation sometime in the future of a common market, a customs union, and even a monetary union between the two states. They also proposed that we have free access to the sea, that there should practically be no borders between the two states, and so forth. This is an interesting proposal which, I must say, was made at an inopportune time. Of course, we did not reject such a proposal. We did not accept it either. We did not have the mandate to discuss it. I told them this, but said that we will examine the proposal seriously, to see all its implications on Bosnia-Herzegovina, to see what it contains, and what the political, economic, and other consequences would be. Among other things, the creation of a so-called common market was envisaged. This was an interesting proposal that took us a bit by surprise. I must emphasize that these talks were talks between the two state delegations. In our state delegation I had with me Foreign Minister Ljubijankic and Mr. Komsic. On their side, apart from Tudjman and Dr. Granic, their deputy prime minister and foreign minister were representatives of the Bosnian Croats. This was, in the main, the outcome of the talks which ended this evening. [end recording]
