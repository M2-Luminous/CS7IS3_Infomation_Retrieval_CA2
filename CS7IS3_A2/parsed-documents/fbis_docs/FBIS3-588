Freedom Front representatives were present at the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] in Johannesburg this afternoon, but did not submit the party's list of election candidates when they saw that the IFP was not there. Earlier there was confusion over whether General Viljoen had submitted a candidates' list because he went into the IEC offices. A Conservative Party MP [Member of Parliament], Dr. Pieter Mulder, told the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] that the Freedom Front did not hand a candidates' list to the IEC today. Twenty-three of the 28 parties which registered for the election handed in candidates' lists this afternoon, with many of them arriving minutes before the deadline. The result was that the 4.30 deadline was extended to give the latecomers time to hand in their lists. The ANC [African National Congress] and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] were among the parties which arrived late.
