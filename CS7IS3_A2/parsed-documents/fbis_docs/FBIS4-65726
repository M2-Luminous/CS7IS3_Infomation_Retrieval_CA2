Increasing optimism is also noticeable in the assessment of the further economic development in Germany: For the first time this year, a majority of Germans (52 percent) believe that the German economy will improve. In fact, optimism is still greater than in the east, but it has increased in both parts of Germany. Remarkable Trends These two trends are among the most remarkable results of the May poll which was carried out by the Mannheim election research group among over 2,000 citizens in east and west German for the ZDF political barometer. The general political mood has changed in different ways in east and west Germany in the past four weeks: In the west, support for the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] has slightly declined, whereas it has clearly increased in the east. the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] achieved slightly better results in the west, but lost considerable support in the east. There have been no changes for the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], which would receive under 5 percent of the vote. Support for Alliance 90/Greens has slightly dropped both in the east and the west. In the whole of Germany, the CDU/CSU was supported by 35 percent in May (unchanged), the SPD by 41, and the FDP by 4 percent. Alliance 90/Greens received 9 percent (-\2 percentage points), and all other parties together 11 percent (+\2), including the Republikaner at 4 (+\2), and the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] at 4 percent (unchanged). As usual, these results have not been assessed according to their political significance. Thus, a comparison of the question concerning future voter behavior and the popularity measurements of the political barometer with the politically assessed results of other polling institutes is only possible to a limited extent. For this reason, the political barometer publishes the "projection," which means that the political mood measured in the topical investigations are projected to an election result ("If Bundestag elections were held next Sunday..."). This calculated projection is based on findings concerning the long-term stability of voter behavior during Bundestag elections resulting from the social structures, and on findings concerning the theoretical outcome of Bundestag elections under "normal" conditions. In May the result is as follows: CDU/CSU 38 percent (+\1 percent as compared with last April), SPD 39 percent (unchanged), FDP 5 percent (unchanged), Alliance 90/Greens 8 percent (-\1), other parties 10 percent (unchanged), including the Republikaner at 4 and the PDS at 3 percent. Thus, a coalition between the SPD and the Alliance 90/Greens could rely on a parliamentary majority (47 percent) in May, too. Good Rating for the Government Satisfaction with the government -- as usually measured on the basis of a scale reaching from +\5 (very satisfied) to -\5 (very dissatisfied) -- has again improved throughout Germany in May. to -\0.4 percent. This is the best rating for the government since May 1992; in April it was still -\0.6, and in March -\0.9. At 0.3, the performance of the SPD in its opposition role has been assessed slightly better in May than in April (0.2) What is remarkable about the results of the poll by the election research group in May is that the popularity of the 10 major politicians -- according of those polled -- has not decreased: Chancellor Helmut Kohl's popularity has slightly increased throughout Germany from 0.1 to 0.3, Labor Minister Norbert Bluem improved his rating from 0.7 to 0.9, Finance Minister Theo Waigel from -\0.4 to -\0.2, Parliamentary President Rita Suessmuth from 1.0 to 1.1, and CDU/CSU Bundestag group leader Wolfgang Schaeuble from 0.9 to 1.1. Preference for Scharping Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's popularity has clearly increased throughout Germany (from 0.4 to 0.7 percent). Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who is still considered one of the 10 major politicians by the population, received a rating of 2.6 in May (2.5 in April). At 1.1, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping reached the same value as in April throughout Germany. The popularity of the SPD's presidential candidate Johannes Rau has clearly increased -- from -\1.5 to +\1.9. Nothing changed for Brandenburg Labor Minister Regine Hildebrandt (1.8 percent; known to 61 percent). In May, too, the majority of the German population prefers Rudolf Scharping as new chancellor. His lead over Kohl has again increased slightly. A total of 40 percent of all those polled would prefer Helmut Kohl as chancellor. In April the percentage was 39 and in May 35 percent. Fifty-one percent would like a Chancellor Scharping. The share of those who did not want to or could not make a decision dropped to 9 percent in May. It is true that, at 55 percent, support for Scharping is still greater in east Germany than in the west (50), but the difference has become smaller. Support for Kohl, too, is largely the same in east (39) and west Germany (40). Sixteen percent of all Germans believe that it is already clear who will win the next Bundestag elections in October; 83 percent are of the opposite view. In May, the majority of Germans also expect a victory of the Bonn opposition parties, but the lead over the CDU/CSU has decreased. In the whole of Germany, 40 percent believe in a victory of the SPD and its leader, and 5 percent in a majority for a coalition between the SPD and Alliance 90/Greens. A total of 27 percent expect a victory of the CDU/CSU and of Helmut Kohl, 5 percent a continuation of the existing government coalition, and 15 percent do not know who will win the next Bundestag election. An election victory by the CDU/CSU is considered more likely in the west. The same applies to the SPD. A grand coalition or an alliance between the SPD and the Alliance 90/Greens is viewed more likely in the east. Mood for Rau as President In the event that no party can govern on its own, the following preferences resulted form the May poll: Coalition between the SPD and the Alliance 90/Greens 24 percent, grand coalition (CDU/CSU and SPD) 23 percent, and continuation of the existing coalition 15 percent. A few days before the election of the president by the Federal Assembly, Johannes Rau enjoys a clear lead among the population. Asked about the president they would prefer out of four candidates, exactly 50 percent chose Rau, 19 percent Roman Herzog, 16 percent Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, and 4 percent Jens Reich. Every 10th German has not yet made up his mind. The preference for Rau is even clearer in the east (53 percent) than in the west (49 percent). Herzog can rely on more support in the old laender (20 percent) than in the east (16 percent). Irrespective of the popularity among the population, 40 percent expect Herzog to win presidential elections; only every third German believes in a victory for Johannes Rau. In May the fight against unemployment was again the major topic in Germany --even though its significance declined slightly in the east and the west. Asked to mention two issues, without any suggestions being given, 55 percent of the west Germans chose unemployment. It was followed by asylum and foreigners (31 percent), right-wing radicalism (17), environmental protection (13), inflation and economic developments (12), crime, law and order (7), rents and housing (6), problems resulting from German unification (5), other social problems (5), weariness of politics (5), and taxes (5). The priorities are as follows in the east: Unemployment (79), crime, law and order (17), problems resulting from unification (14), asylum and foreigners (10), rents and housing, right-wing radicalism, economic developments and upswing (9 percent each), other social problems (7), pensions, peace and detente, reduction of social benefits, and environmental protection (5 percent each).
