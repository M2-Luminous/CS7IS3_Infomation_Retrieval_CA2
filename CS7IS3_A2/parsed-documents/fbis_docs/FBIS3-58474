Most of those disappointed are to be found in what was the four-party coalition, while some of the harshest reactions have come from the Christian Democrats [DC]. [DC leader Mino] Martinazzoli said the government has had a short life. He wanted elections to be held in June. Guido Dell'Aquila has carried out some interviews: [Begin recording] [Gerardo Bianco, DC spokesman in the Chamber of Deputies] I was not expecting this outcome because the position taken in parliament by the majority parties reconfirmed confidence in the government. In other words, Ciampi and his government still have a parliamentary majority, so the justification for his resignation has origins outside parliament. [Marco Pannella, Radical leader] The country knows that everything is once again in the hands of the institutional authorities, which certainly offers a wealth of wisdom and honesty to the whole country. [Achille Occhetto, Democratic Party of the Left leader] Today's action is important because it is the only pacifying action which can be implemented in our country. It gives citizens the instrument of a parliament which truly represents the new Italy and hopefully a government with progressive forces at its center. [Umberto Bossi, Northern League leader] It is a government which has remained in office despite the fact that the whole country wants change, wants an election. It seems to me that consequently a legitimate action is being carried out. It seems to me that Ciampi has upheld civil liberties -- he has kept his word. [end recording]
