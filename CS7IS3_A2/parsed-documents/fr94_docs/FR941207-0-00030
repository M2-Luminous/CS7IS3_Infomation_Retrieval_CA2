FR941207-0-00030 FR941207-0-00003 Collateral The final rule permits, subject to certain conditions, institutions to take into account qualifying collateral when assigning the credit equivalent amount of a netting contract to the appropriate risk weight category in accordance with the procedures and requirements currently set forth in the Board's risk-based capital guidelines. The Board has added language to the final rule clarifying that collateral must be legally available to cover the credit exposure of the netting contract in the event of default. For example, the collateral may not be pledged solely against one individual contract subject to the master netting contract. The legal availability of the collateral must be addressed in the legal opinions. Walkaway Clauses The Board has considered the suggestion made by some commenters of a phase-out period for outstanding contracts with walkaway clauses. The Board continues to believe that walkaway clauses do not reduce credit risk. Accordingly, the final rule retains the provision that bilateral netting contracts with walkaway clauses are not eligible for netting treatment for risk-based capital purposes and does not provide for a phase-out period. Novation The proposal required all netting contracts, including netting by novation agreements, to be supported by written legal opinions. The Board does not agree with commenters that a grandfathering period for outstanding novation agreements is needed. Rather, the Board continues to believe that all netting contracts must be held to the same standards in order to promote certainty as to the legal enforceability of the contracts and to decrease the risks faced by counterparties in the event of default. Under the final rule, a netting by novation agreement must meet the requirements for a qualifying bilateral netting contract. Other Issues The Board has considered all of the other issues raised by commenters. With regard to documentation, the Board reiterates that, as with all provisions of risk-based capital, a banking organization must maintain in its files appropriate documentation to support any particular capital treatment including netting of rate contracts. Appropriate documentation typically would include a copy of the bilateral netting contract, supporting legal opinions, and any related translations. The documentation should be available to examiners for their review. The Board recognizes commenters' concerns that the proposed rule was limited specifically to interest and exchange rate contracts. The Board notes that both the Basle Accord and the Board's risk-based capital guidelines currently do not address derivatives contracts other than rate contracts. This final rule does not attempt to go beyond the scope of the existing risk-based capital framework and applies only to netting contracts encompassing interest rate and foreign exchange rate contracts. The Board, however, notes that the Basle Supervisors' Committee issued a proposal for public comment in July 1994 to amend the Basle Accord that explicitly would set forth the risk-based capital treatment for other types of derivative transactions, such as commodity, precious metal, and equity contracts. In this regard, the Board issued a similar proposal, based on the Basle Supervisors' Committee proposal, to amend its risk-based capital guidelines (59 FR 43508, August 24, 1994). Until the Basle Accord has been revised and the Board's risk-based capital rules have been amended to encompass commodity, precious metal, and equity derivative contracts, the Board, rather than automatically disqualifying from capital netting treatment an entire netting contract that includes non-rate-related transactions, will permit institutions to apply the following treatment. In determining the current exposure of otherwise qualifying netting contracts that include non-rate-related contracts, institutions will be permitted to net the positive and negative mark-to-market values of the included interest and exchange rate contracts, while severing the non-rate-related contracts and treating them for risk-based capital purposes as individual contracts that are not subject to the master netting contract. (This treatment is similar to the treatment applied to a netting contract that includes contracts in jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting is not supported by legal opinion. With non-rate-related contracts, however, legal opinions on severability are not required.) The Board notes that the regulatory language with regard to the calculation of potential future exposure remains essentially the same as that proposed. The Board has clarified an underlying premise of the current exposure method for calculating credit exposure as set forth in the Basle Accord, that is, the add-on for potential future exposure must be calculated based on the effective, rather than the apparent, notional principal amount and the notional amount an institution uses will be subject to examiner review. 9 9 The notional amount is, generally, a stated reference amount of money used to calculate payment streams between the counterparties. In the event that the effect of the notional amount is leveraged or enhanced by the structure of the transaction, institutions must use the actual, or effective, notional amount when determining potential future exposure. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Board hereby certifies that this final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small business entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. Paperwork Reduction Act and Regulatory Burden The Board has determined that this final rule will not increase the regulatory paperwork burden of banking organizations pursuant to the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Section 302 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;325, 108 Stat. 2160) provides that the federal banking agencies must consider the administrative burdens and benefits of any new regulation that imposes additional requirements on insured depository institutions. Section 302 also requires such a rule to take effect on the first day of the calendar quarter following final publication of the rule, unless the agency, for good cause, determines an earlier effective date is appropriate. The new capital rule imposes certain requirements on depository institutions that wish to net the current exposures of their rate contracts for purposes of calculating their risk-based capital requirements. For these institutions, any burden of complying with the requirements of netting under a legally enforceable netting contract and obtaining the necessary legal opinions should be outweighed by the benefits associated with a lower capital requirement. The new rule will not affect institutions that do not wish to net for capital purposes. For these reasons, the Board has determined that an effective date of December 31, 1994 is appropriate, in order to allow banking organizations to take advantage of netting in their year-end statements, if they so desire. For these same reasons, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) the Board finds there is good cause not to follow the 30-day notice requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553(d) and to make the rule effective on December 31, 1994.
