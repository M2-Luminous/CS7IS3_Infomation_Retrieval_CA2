Alpo Rusi, Martti Ahtisaari's foreign policy advisor and a member of his cabinet, told us about them. He held forth at an Association of Political Editors lunch conference on Wednesday [30 March]. Rusi said that a direct referendum will also force us to look for new ways of taking action. One of these is the president's direct contact with citizens. "The president wants to listen to the pulse of the nation. He can also instill courage in citizens in this tight spot we are in," Rusi said. According to Rusi, Ahtisaari's first meeting with citizens in central Finland was a pleasant experience. The president wants to be in contact with citizens in the future "without waiting lines." Rusi was pressed for an answer to the question as to whether the wielding of power or even competition with the government in the area of domestic policy will also be associated with [the president's] rounds in the provinces. Rusi assured us that behind these visits there was at least no deliberate effort to wield power or consciously impose a political viewpoint. "Direct dialogue with citizens has been lacking from Nordic democracy," Rusi said. He also alluded to our possible membership in the EU, and noted that, as the supranational exercise of power increases, one's own democracy must be in good working order. Rusi said the president also wants to be "more communicative" and he is accustomed to "rapid communication." "Spokesman," a New Practice The number of the presidential advisors has been increased by four. The advisors from the cabinet, in which Rusi is on loan from the Foreign Ministry, constitute the most important ones. He most recently served in the ministry as a foreign policy advisor. Before that, he served as chief editor and researcher on the Centrist paper LALLI, among other posts. Rusi takes care of the president's relations with the international press and reports on events occurring in connection with visits. He may also issue statements, that is, he may act as a sort of "spokesman." This practice is new in Finland. Rusi was asked how the cabinet has been preparing for the visit of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party, to Finland. Rusi said that they are closely following Zhirinovskiy's behavior. "We will certainly hold onto our own authority," he went on. Zhirinovskiy is coming to Finland this Easter with Russia's Council of Europe delegation.
