What do the hostile leaflets say? Enemies and other disappointed people have begun to use these leaflets after failing to achieve their goals through other ways. They wonder if we see and hear our people. We saw and heard them, and obviously it is they who no longer hear or see as result of their failure. The child who called God during celebrations on the leader's birthday asked me: Did they not hear me? Did they really not hear her or see her? Did they not hear the people declaring their love for and loyalty to the beloved leader, as well as their wishes for his health and long life? Did they not see the candles of joy flickering in the spring breeze in every house, every shop, and every work site? Did they not see how the elderly, the men, the women, and the children made 28 April a personal festival, in addition to its being a collective one? God has blessed this love despite the well-known impact of the unjust blockade on the people's lives and mood. There is no doubt that they saw and heard all this but do not want to admit the reality because it hurts them and destroys their interests. They launched a third world war to destroy the vigor of this impossible love. By God they could not disturb him. So, how can they harm him by issuing leaflets with ridiculous contents written in poor style? We cannot blame them, especially since there is nothing left to them except nonsense. For our part, we will continue to live with this noble love.
