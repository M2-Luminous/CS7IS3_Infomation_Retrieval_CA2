FBIS4-59493 "drnes094dd_94020" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas on Plans for Opposing Autonomous Authority Hamas on Plans for Opposing Autonomous Authority PM1605091294 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Arabic 13 May 94 p5 PM1605091294 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Arabic BFN [Unattributed report: "Ghawshah Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Hamas Will Not Use Violence Against Palestinian Autonmous Authority"] [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has announced that its opposition to the Palestinian autonomous authority in Gaza and Jericho will be political, informational, and popular, and that it will never use violence against it because all the violence will be aimed at the Israeli Zionist occupation. It said that the opposition circle has increased with some of the negotiation "pioneers" joining it, having been frustrated. This came in a statement made by Hamas official spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Amman. He said: The members of the Palestinian police are our brothers and sons of the Palestinian people and it is inconceivable in any circumstances that the Palestinian police would confront their own people. But he added: If there are some sick minds who agree to serve the Zionist occupation, the people inside [the occupied territory] will know how to deal with them depending on the circumstances arising from such behavior. Hamas' official spokesman defined the mechanism for his movement's political opposition in the coming phase under the Palestinian autonomous authority as follows: 1. Expose and point out the loopholes, mistakes, and drawbacks of the Cairo agreement. 2. Expose the Zionist hegemony over the autonomous administration which began with the entry of the police forces. The members of these forces were subjected to an inspection of their arms and a baggage search, and they were issued with identity cards by the occupation authorities. 3. Explain to all sectors of the Palestinian people that the laws and regulations enforced in the [Gaza] Strip and Jericho will be Zionist occupation laws and regulations and that any amendment or modification will be subject to a certain mechanism and subject to the approval of the Zionist authorities. 4. Explain that the Gaza-Jericho agreement places certain unpatriotic commitments on the Palestinian authority. Hamas and the Palestinian opposition will expose all these commitments one by one, beginning with the undertaking distributed to the detainees requiring them to renounce terrorism and accept the Cairo agreement as a condition of their release, and ending with the assertion that collaborators should not stand trial and should not be harmed. The Palestinian opposition, Ghawshah said, is currently creating the broadest possible popular base in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and that base is growing every day on the grounds of opposition to the agreement. He noted that some of the "pioneers" of the Madrid conference and then the Washington conference, such as Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, and some of the Oslo "pioneers" such as Yasir 'Abd-al-Rabbuh of Fida [the Palestinian Democratic Union], and the People's Party and some sectors of Fatah itself, have joined the opposition. Some Fatah detainees refused to sign the occupation's undertaking committing them to acceptance of the Cairo agreement. Not only did they refuse to sign, they also condemned the agreement. Ghawshah stressed that Hamas is present everywhere and is a skillful player on the Middle East chess board, and that it will act at the right time in the interest of the Palestinian people. He said that Hamas will not disappoint those who have placed their confidence in it and will play its part fully in continuing the jihad operations against the Zionist occupation. The official spokesman refused to reveal Hamas' plan in that respect but he said "we have made preparations."
