The HSP would like to see Hungary ruled by a coalition government pursuing three major foreign-policy aims: rapid integration with European structures, including NATO; normalized relations with neighbouring countries; and ensuring autonomy for cross-border Hungarian minorities. "It would be good if the country had a fully-formed new government by late June or early July. The HSP is ready to conduct expeditious coalition talks in public," Szekeres said.
