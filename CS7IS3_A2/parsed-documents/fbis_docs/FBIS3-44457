This year was the tenth consecutive year that the capital maintained a double-digit increase rate in the total retail value of consumer goods. In the past year 11 department stores and shopping centers in the city joined the list of big-name companies with sales volumes exceeding 100 million yuan-worth. The total number of such undertakings rose from less than half a dozen only a few years ago to 26 by the end of last year. According to a survey, the combined sales volume of 120 major companies (0.08 percent of the total number of enterprises in Beijing) in the sectors of general merchandise, electrical appliances, cultural goods, clothing and foodstuffs made up for 20 percent of the city's total last year. Experts attributed the surge in sales volume to the reform measures coupled with the drive for the establishment of a market economy as well as to robust purchasing power and an ample supply of goods. Major reform measures put into effect by the Beijing municipality last year ranged from lifting price controls on grain and edible oil to introducing the share-holding system to more companies. As a result, over 6,000 small firms expanded their business last year. They said such reforms have ended the monopoly of state-owned enterprises in the retail sector. Collective, individual, private and joint ventures are playing increasingly important roles and have helped to turn Beijing into the largest commodity distribution center in north China. The sales volume of the city's non-state-owned commercial enterprises last year accounted for 61 percent of the total figure.
