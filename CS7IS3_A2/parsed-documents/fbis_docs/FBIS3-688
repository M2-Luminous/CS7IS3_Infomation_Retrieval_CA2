There has hardly been a break in the delicate negotiations, except over the Christmas holiday period, and UNITA's foreign affairs spokesman Jorge Valentim has told reporters in Lusaka that they are almost exhausted, as Joy Mwinga reports in this telex from Lusaka. Jorge Valentim said the pace of discussion at the UN-brokered talks was so fast that there was a danger that the two sides would end up with what he called another bad agreement that was incapable of resolving Angola's future crisis. He complained that the two delegations were not being given time to consult their leaders at home about the issues and he warned that UNITA would not hasten the pace of talks just to accommodate the agenda of the UN security Council. Mr. Valentim said that no one had the right to force the two sides to work faster. The Security Council is scheduled to meet next Tuesday to discuss the Angolan crisis. Considerable ground has been covered in the talks, with the two sides last December agreeing in principle to a cease-fire. This morning, they had resolved all but five, out of the 17 issues considered crucial if national reconciliation is to be achieved, including the decentralization of government and UNITA's participation in the economy. They have yet to agree on UNITA's participation in government however, the most critical item on the agenda. Last week, UNITA dismissed government proposals on this front as a smooth joke.
