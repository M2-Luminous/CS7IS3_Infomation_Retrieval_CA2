In an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT after he announced his decision to break away from the government, he added that "Sudanese citizens' conditions have deteriorated badly, and the collapse now includes all aspects of life, economic, social, political, and security." Aldo Ajo accused the National Islamic Front, led by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, of destroying state institutions. He said: At least 40,000 people have been dismissed from civil service, the Army, and the other security forces. He said that many capable and experienced people have been dismissed and replaced by cadres from the Front. [passage omitted] He went on: "With regard to security, no citizen feels secure at present. With regard to the judiciary, there is no longer justice in the usual sense, because most of the senior judges have been dismissed and replaced by judges from the Front throughout the country -- which has made the judiciary in the country a partisan body designed to protect the Front's elements and interests. The same applies to the police, whose elements have been exposed to dismissal and displacement. In a nutshell, there is no justice in the usual sense in Sudan." On the situation in southern Sudan Aldo accused the government of escalating the war. He said that "the government has moved the war to new dimensions, raising the jihad slogan for the first time and using Islam in an entirely unlawful manner to mobilize people and prompt them to fight their fellow citizens." He added that "some people and imams say in mosques that what is happening in the south is not a jihad in the Islamic sense, but the government silences or arrests them." He said that the government thinks that "forcible Islamization is the only means to unify Sudan." He said that these practices have angered many southerners and led to the total collapse of trust between north and south. [passage omitted] Attacking the government's foreign policy, he said: There is no clear well-planned policy, and the statements issued by the foreign minister appears to be completely different from what is issued and exercised by other elements. He added: "We feel that Minister Abu-Salih makes statements aimed at repairing foreign relations, while other organizations like the popular world friendship organization and the Popular Arab and Islamic Conference, led by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, continue their own policies. In fact the state follows the decisions and plans of these organizations." He went on: The policy of these organizations is hostile toward all the Arab regimes in the region and toward the world as a whole, because the regime wants to export the model of its revolution. He said that Sudan has begun to receive extremist elements from outside and has begun to know terrorism for the first time in its history. And that "planning and training for the foreign extremist elements are provided in Khartoum, namely in places like mosques and private farms." [passage omitted] On his position on the proposal of self-determination for southern Sudan, Aldo said that "the Sudanese have forgotten the separation proposals in the south since 1972. Separation was not even raised after the war broke out again in 1983. But the government's policies, its escalation of the war, and its raising of the jihad slogans have split the country and caused the southerners to raise the self-determination question once again." He added that self-determination does not necessarily mean separation. But people's right to choose remains a political right which cannot be ignored, especially if the present regime continues its escalation and annihilation policies against the people in the south.
