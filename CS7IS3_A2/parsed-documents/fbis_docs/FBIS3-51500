FBIS3-51500 "drlat009_c_94013" FBIS-LAT-94-009 Document Type:Daily Report 13 Jan 1994 MEXICO Chiapas Crisis Peace Demonstration Held in Mexico City 12 Jan PA1301015694 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0045 GMT 13 Jan 94 PA1301015694 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [From the "Vector 21" newscast] [Text] At exactly 1630 [2230 GMT] this evening [12 January] a demonstration for peace in Chiapas State left the Revolution Monument and headed to El Zocalo Square in Mexico City. Thousands of members of people's organizations, independent worker's unions, political parties, student groups, and human rights advocates make up this enormous contingent. The demonstrators -- singing, chanting, and waving banners -- asked for a peaceful solution, not an armed solution, to the conflict in that region. They chanted: Peace yes, war no. Traffic remains insane, mainly in downtown Mexico City, as groups of demonstrators continue to converge on the square. Fortunately, no serious incidents have been reported thus far. Security operations are being carried out by 600 units from the General Secretariat of Protection and Highways and coordinated with the District Judicial Police. As of this moment, no incidents have been reported. Main roads and avenues such as Paseo de la Reforma, Juarez and Hidalgo Avenues, Lazaro Cardenas and Francisco Madero Street, and others have suffered the consequences of the demonstration. It should be pointed out, however, that commuters have realized the significance of the grand demonstration and, instead of expressing their anger, have understood the message of peace for Chiapas. The obvious roads have been blocked throughout the two hours of the demonstration, but alternate routes have also been overcrowded. The commentary here is that fortunately no incidents have been reported up to now, except for the heavy traffic, especially around this main square in Mexico City. Thousands of voices are calling for peace in Chiapas State. [Paris AFP in Spanish at 0056 GMT on 13 January transmits a 150 word, Mexico City-datelined report that notes "more than 100,000 demonstrators, according to observers, chanting 'Death to the Institutional Revolutionary Party' and 'Salinas is a murderer,' filled the plaza in front of the National Palace." The report also states that "the demonstrators paraded an effigy of Emiliano Zapata, crying vivas to Zapata and painting the Zapatista National Liberation Army symbol on walls as they marched." According to AFP, the crowd chanted "Death to the bad government," "cease the bombings," and "massacre or Indians," reminiscent of "the slogans used in Latin America during the 1960's and 1970's."]
