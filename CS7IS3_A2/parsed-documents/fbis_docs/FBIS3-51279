And this was no small achievement; the law culminates a year of work and provides for a reform that will, in his opinion, revolutionize a service that has been in the doldrums. It will also realize a constitutional dream of universality, solidarity, and efficiency. Others, in contrast, believe it will pull the plug on health care. They say it is an immature effort at privatization with an excessively complicated and unintelligible text, in which each article is two pages long. What no one doubts is that if the goal of giving every Colombian--including the 10 million who live in extreme poverty today--a whole package of health services is achieved over the next seven years, a veritable social revolution will have occurred. To achieve this objective, health contributions in 1994 will rise from 7 percent to 12 percent, and of those funds, 1 percent will be earmarked for subsidizing the poorest of the population. With a view to expanding coverage, 374 billion pesos in new resources is guaranteed in next year's budget, a social tax on weapons has been created, and beginning in 1997, 15 percent of the tax on Cusiana oilfield revenues will go to subsidize poor people's health care. In addition, the budget for social investment in health will increase each year as a percentage of GDP. It is true that such resources have never been allocated in the history of health care, but to leap from that to the notion that by the year 2000 there will be no difference between rich and poor would seem to be a revolution on paper, a mere utopia in the mind of Minister Juan Luis Londono, who defended the plan in an interview granted to EL ESPECTADOR. The striking thing about Colombia, he maintained, is that it spends less than it should on health care, but it is totally surprising that coverage under the system is so low. It is barely higher than that of Haiti and Bolivia. And ironically, when serious projections are made of how much good it would do to eliminate poverty, one of the principal difficulties is pessimism. This attitude is deeply rooted among intellectuals, who are very disparaging about the possibilities of social policy. "We have a discourse that attempts to persuade us that nothing ever changes in this country, and since nothing ever changes, it is not worth making an effort, because what the hell is social policy for?" [Sarmiento] What is the real purpose of health care reform? [Londono] The general purpose is to provide health care for all Colombians, because that is the main thing they lack today. Some 10 to 12 million Colombians have no health care, but there are 25 million who do not have Social Security. [Sarmiento] But Colombia is too poor a country to guarantee health care for everyone from one year to the next. [Londono] It is not from one year to the next. It is a gradual program. That is one of the obsessions people have had, thinking that overnight you can produce miracles. I call it the totoya theory: todo para todos ya [everything for everyone right now], which is a fundamentalist vision shared by some segments of society that are so desperate they have lost touch with reality. We have designed a plan so that over a period of 8 to 10 years, people will have that access. Why 8 to 10 years? Because that is how long it has taken in the most successful countries in the world: Costa Rica and Korea, which began their reform with per capita income figures not far from those of Colombia. [Sarmiento] Where will the money come from? [Londono] This is not just rhetoric. In the 1994 budget, the fiscal allocation, which is the contribution the nation makes to the departments in relation to what is allotted for health care, will rise by more than 50 percent. Not only will the departments receive more money, so will the municipalities. Altogether, they will receive 60 to 65 percent more. In addition, the Social Investment Fund (FIS) has been created, spending on the Colombian Family Welfare Institute (ICBF) will increase considerably, and the National Health System will receive 400 billion pesos in net new resources. Part of these funds will come from the 100 billion pesos derived from the reform of Social Security, which basically will come from the provision that all Colombians will pay to give the poor access to health care; that provision represents about 50 billion pesos, and the government and the municipalities will contribute a similar amount. If we combine them, that makes 400 billion pesos in new money for health care, something unprecedented in this country. [Sarmiento] What was the greatest obstacle in the debate on the bill? [Londono] The program basically was attacked from two flanks, by those who long for a single public monopoly, and by those who accuse us of being privatizers. The interesting thing in Colombia is that we have managed to create our own model, and it is a lie that we are privatizing. What are we going to do? Define a single health care plan that will be equal for everyone and that will gradually converge, because there is not enough money for totoya, and if people want to have it all, we have lost the battle at the outset. [Sarmiento] What can a poor man and his family expect beginning in 1994? [Londono] We cannot create false hopes. The reform will not give health care to the entire population as of 1 January next year. It is a program that requires the construction of a system: On the one hand, we must get the money; 400 billion pesos is a lot of money, and we need much more. What can they expect? We are generating a program so that the poorest people in the country and the families of those who have the ability to pay will move closer together right away, and in the not too distant future--eight years--they can be equals in a comprehensive plan, like the one that Social Security Institute (ISS) beneficiaries have today. The reform will take full effect in May, so the principal goal, in terms of equity, is to give access to the system to a million poor families, the most downtrodden in the country, through subsidies in keeping with demand. We have 150 billion pesos that will enable us to reach a million families, to whom we will provide a health care plan amounting to 150,000 pesos per family per year. The rich people in this country may think that a pittance, but you have to understand that the poorest 10 percent of this country have annual family incomes of 600,000 pesos, and we are going to give that group a raise equivalent to 25 percent. [Sarmiento] What guarantee is there that this reform will not become paralyzed under the new government? [Londono] The reform has two advantages: It is very good, and it has been the product of a great effort at coordination. [Sarmiento] Many think that you are excessively optimistic, and that the program is really not that good, that it was debated less than the pension program. [Londono] They have the wrong impression. The problem is, pensions have sparked much more interest in the private sector and have drawn much more press coverage. Since the program I proposed was for the poor, a lot of people said what the heck, that does not matter to me, and there was this idea that it was not very important. Meanwhile, a process of consensus was created. I spent a year, during which 70 percent of my time was devoted to meeting with people. There has been an incredible degree of consensus; the problem is that I do not reach such consensuses in the press. [Sarmiento] There are those who say that the next few years will be spent reforming the reform. [Londono] I would hope that this process would have the same dynamic as the economic liberalization, which was very controversial three years ago, the focus of a lot of fear. Many groups pinned their hopes on reversing the liberalization process, and today they see that it is irreversible, that it has had some undeniable benefits, and that it may need some small adjustments. [Sarmiento] Do you think this reform is ambitious, but it is a revolution on paper? [Londono] No. I think that what makes the program interesting, and very different from other reforms that have been launched in the past, is that it has two conditions of viability: first, financial viability, because it is not demagogic; and secondly, political viability, in the sense that it is not a reform imposed by technical experts, but the product of a very broad democratic consensus. And in spite of everything, it is a very technical reform; it is consistent and comprehensively articulated.
