FR941121-0-00077 FR941121-0-00009 We proposed to revise the beneficiary administrative review procedures to offer an immediate review by the PRO with which the hospital has an agreement under ยง466.78. We proposed to adopt the same timeframes for immediate PRO reviews for HMO and CMP enrollees that are applicable to fee-for-service beneficiaries. Upon receiving a written notice from the HMO or CMP or a hospital of a determination that an inpatient hospital stay is no longer necessary, the enrollee (or authorized representative) would have until noon of the first working day after receipt of the notice to file (by telephone or in writing) a request for immediate PRO review. The PRO would notify the HMO or CMP that an appeal has been filed and require the HMO or CMP to provide any pertinent records or information by close of business of the first working day immediately following the day the beneficiary made the appeal. Further, in response to a request from the HMO or CMP, the hospital would be required to submit medical records and other pertinent information to the PRO by close of business of the first full working day immediately following the day the HMO or CMP makes its request. The PRO would also solicit the views of the enrollee who requested immediate PRO review (or the enrollee's authorized representative). The PRO would have 1 working day after receipt of the information from the HMO or CMP to make a determination. The HMO or CMP would be financially liable for the costs of the hospital stay until noon of the calendar day following receipt of the PRO determination. In addition, we also proposed to prohibit the HMO or CMP from billing the Medicare beneficiary for the added cost of hospital days during the immediate review process. An enrollee who requests immediate PRO review would not be entitled to any subsequent review, under the HMO's or CMP's administrative review process, of the issue of whether hospitalization was still needed. However, the PRO determination would be subject to appeal under the administrative and judicial review process set forth in 42 CFR part 473 (that is, PRO reconsiderations and hearings and judicial review of PRO reconsiderations). As under the current fee-for-service system, the beneficiary who requests that a PRO reconsider its determination would not be protected from financial liability. Under the proposed rule, the hospital would not be required to be a concurring party in a discharge decision if the HMO or CMP issues the notice of noncoverage. However, the hospital could submit the request to the PRO for immediate review on behalf of the HMO or CMP enrollee. We proposed to clarify that, with one exception, the HMO or CMP is financially responsible for the costs of the hospital stay until noon of the calendar day following the day the PRO notifies the enrollee of its review determination. Under the exception, a hospital may not charge the HMO or CMP (or the beneficiary) for the costs of the continued hospital stay during the PRO review process if the hospital files the request for immediate PRO review on behalf of a beneficiary and the PRO upholds the noncoverage determination made by the HMO or CMP. C. Providing Administrative Review Rights to HCPP Members Section 1833(a)(l)(A) of the Act provides that an organization that furnishes services on a prepayment basis may elect to receive payment for Part B services on a reasonable cost basis rather than a reasonable charge basis. There is no indication that the Congress intended to deny Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in these organizations (referred to in these regulations as health care prepayment plans (HCPPs)) their full administrative review rights under section 1869 of the Act because they receive services through an organization that chooses this alternate payment option. The regulations at 42 CFR part 417, subpart D, applicable to HCPPs, do not, however, specifically address administrative review rights for Medicare enrollees of HCPPs.
