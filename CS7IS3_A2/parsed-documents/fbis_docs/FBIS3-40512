The total figure for the sales, which consisted mainly of craft such as launch vehicles and of software, was ¥308,007 million, a drop of about 16 percent from the previous year. The total of the spacecraft sales was ¥175,005 million (an increase of 12 percent over the previous year). The sales of the H-II launch vehicle, manufactured with local technologies, dropped to ¥53,465 million (a 12.6 percent decrease) as it was nearing its completion. On the other hand, space shuttle and satellite sales increased by ¥2,206 million (a 82.4 percent increase) and ¥120,034 million (a 37.2 percent increase), respectively. Of the total sales of ¥308,007 million, 85 percent consisted of domestic sales, and the rest was export. However, ``30-35 percent of the domestic sales were double-counted'' (SJAC's comment), as they were counted twice in some cases, once when the government ordered, and again when the principal contractors issued orders to subcontractors. Therefore, the actual size of sales is smaller than what appeared in the statistics. On the other hand, the ``services provided,'' which are tabulated separately because of their nature of business, consisted mainly of leasing business, and the total sales were ¥58,740 million. Because of the increasing use of communication and broadcasting satellites, the sales figure more than doubled over the previous year. The survey was done in August of this year, with questionnaires mailed out to 85 firms involved in space development; 66 companies responded, and the results were processed to make the report.
