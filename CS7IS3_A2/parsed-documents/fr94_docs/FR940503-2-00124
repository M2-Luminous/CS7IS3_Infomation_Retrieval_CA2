FR940503-2-00124 FR940503-2-00084 B. Customer Protection The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Global Telecommunications Index Options (including full-value and reduced-value Global Telecommunications (LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that: (1) the special risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly, because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options currently traded on the CBOE, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors in Global Telecommunications Index options and full-value and reduced-value Global Telecommunications Index LEAPS. C. Surveillance The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a security index derivative product and the exchange(s) trading the securities underlying the derivative product is an important measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the security index product less readily susceptible to manipulation. 28 In this regard, the CBOE, NYSE, Amex, and NASD are all members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary surveillance information. 29 Further, as to the foreign components of the Index, either the Exchange has comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements with the primary foreign markets for the securities underlying the ADRs or the U.S. is the relevant market for surveillance purposes. 30 28 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31243 (September 28, 1992), 57 FR 45849 (October 5, 1992). 29 See note 19, supra. If the prices of the ADR components, or the composition of the Index, should change so that greater than 20% of the weight of the Index would be represented by ADRs whose underlying securities were not the subject of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with the CBOE, then it would be different for the Commission to reach the conclusions reached in this order and the Commission would have to determine whether it would be suitable for the Exchange to continue to trade options on this Index. The CBOE should, accordingly, notify the Commission immediately if more than 20% of the numerical value of the Index is represented by ADRs whose underlying securities are not subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. Such a change in the current relative weights of the Index or in the composition of the Index may warrant the submission of a rule filing pursuant to Section 19 of the Act. In determining whether a particular ADR is subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement see, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 31531 (November 27, 1992), 57 FR 57250 (December 3, 1994); and 33554 (January 31, 1994), 59 FR 5622 (February 7, 1994). 30 See Securities Exchange Act release Nos. 31531 (November 27, 1992), 57 FR 57250 (December 3, 1992); and 33554 (January 31, 1994), 59 FR 5622 (February 7, 1994). D. Market Impact The Commission believes that the listing and trading of Global Telecommunications Index options, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, on the CBOE will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets. 31 First, as described above, for the most part, no one security or group of securities dominates the Index. Second, because, at least 90% of the numerical value of the Index must be accounted for by securities that meet the Exchange's options listing standards, 32 and because each of the component securities must be subject to last sale reporting requirements, 33 the component securities generally will be actively-traded, highly-capitalized securities. Third, the 10,500 contract position and exercise limits applicable to Index options and Index LEAPS will serve to minimize potential manipulation and market impact concerns. Forth, the risk to investors of contra-party non-performance will be minimized because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be issued and guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation just like any other standardized option traded in the United States. 31 In addition, the CBOE has represented that the CBOE and the OPRA have the necessary systems capacity to support those new series of index options that would result from the introduction of Index options and Index LEAPS. See Memorandum from Joe Corrigan, Executive Director, OPRA, to Eileen Smith, Director, Product Development, Research Department, CBOE, dated February 14, 1994. 32 See Amendment No. 1, supra note 4. 33 See February 14 Letter, supra note 8. Lastly, the Commission believes that settling expiring Global Telecommunications Index options (including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is consistent with the Act. As noted in other contexts, valuing options for exercise settlement on expiration based on opening prices rather than closing prices may help reduce adverse effects on markets for securities underlying options on the Index. 34 34 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30944 (July 21, 1994), 57 FR 33376 (July 28, 1992).
