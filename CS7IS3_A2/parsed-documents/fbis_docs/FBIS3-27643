Among the 28 countries and regions that have invested in this inland province, the officials said, Taiwan now ranks second after Hong Kong in the number of cooperation projects and the volume of investment. Taiwan businesses signed 132 cooperation projects with the province in 1993, promising to invest as much as 356 million U.S. dollars, the officials said. That made the province's Taiwan-funded projects jump to 248, and the volume of contracted Taiwan investment to 391 million U.S. dollars, the officials noted. Since the province's first Taiwan-funded project started in 1989, Taiwan businesses have been set up in ten of its major cities. The officials believe that Shanxi's rich resources of coal and iron, its cheap labor and large market are just what Taiwan investors are looking for. They said Shanxi's investment environment is improving rapidly. The airport in this provincial capital is under expansion, regular flights have started between Taiyuan and Hong Kong, and the telecommunication networks of many cities have been updated. What is more, the officials said, the interests of Taiwan investors are guaranteed by preferential investment policies and all-round investment services. So far, 70 percent of the Taiwan-funded businesses are in the field of manufacturing, including coal processing, textiles, metallurgy, machinery, electronics and foodstuffs. While Taiwan investors tended to choose small and medium-sized enterprises as their partners in the beginning, the officials said, more and more of them are now turning to large state enterprises. Besides the manufacturing sector, Taiwan investors established new businesses in Shanxi in 1993 -- in a hot springs resort, a luxury hotel and real estate. Last year trade between Taiwan and Shanxi was valued at 29.861 million U.S. dollars. The inland province exported coal, pig iron, cast iron, toys and agricultural products and imported raw chemicals, steel and machinery. However, the officials said they believed that the biggest breakthrough in the relations between the two sides in 1993 was in personnel exchanges. For the first time in several decades, altogether 155 persons from Shanxi visited the island province. Among the 155 was an official delegation headed by provincial Director of the Coal Industry Wu Sansong and a folk dance troupe. On the other hand, visitors from Taiwan continue to come in ever-increasing numbers. Among the nearly 2,000 Taiwan visitors in 1993 was a delegation from the Association for the Promotion of Mining and a 48-member group from the Chinese Drama Society. Cooperation between the two sides has also been expanded to publishing, the cinema, sports and many other fields, the officials added.
