FR940127-0-00042 FR940127-0-00011 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 13 [DA 94&hyph;3] Commercial Operator License Examinations AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This order clarifies that the Commission rather than COLE managers will grant examination credit when appropriate and that applicants who desire examination credit must submit documentation supporting their request. This action was needed to clarify the rules. It will eliminate procedures that are unnecessary and duplicative of functions performed by the Commission license processing staff. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 24, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Cross, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554 (202) 632&hyph;4964. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Order Adopted: January 3, 1994. Released: January 11, 1994. By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau: 1. Section 13.205 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 13.205, currently provides that a commercial operator license examination (COLE) manager must give examination credit to an examinee holding certain documents. 1 This procedure is unnecessary and duplicative of a function performed by the Commission license processing staff. We are amending §13.205, therefore, to clarify that the Commission rather than the COLE manager will grant examination credit when appropriate, and §§13.9(c) and 13.13(c) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 13.9(c) and 13.13(c), to clarify that applicants who desire examination credit must submit documentation supporting their request. 1 These documents are an unexpired (or within the grace period) FCC-issued commercial radio operator license, an FCC-issued Amateur Extra Class operator license, and a Proof of Passing Certificate issued within the past 365 days. The purpose of granting examination element credit is to recognize that an examinee previously has passed an examination that covers the same material and, therefore, does not need to demonstrate again his or her knowledge of this material. 2. We also are moving the showing required of an applicant to qualify for a radiotelegraph Six Months Service Endorsement from §13.201(c) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 13.201(c), to §13.9(d) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 13.9(d). This change is intended to clarify that qualification for the Six Month Service Endorsement is determined directly by the Commission rather than the COLE Manager. 3. Because the rule amendments adopted herein are nonsubstantive in nature, the notice and comment provisions of section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, therefore, need not be complied with. Authority for this action is contained in §0.331(a)(1) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 0.331(a)(1). 4. Accordingly, part 13 is amended, effective February 24, 1994, as set forth below.
