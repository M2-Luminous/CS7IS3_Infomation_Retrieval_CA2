The award will be granted during the national expanded UPEC [Union of Cuban Journalists] plenum, which will also be held on 14 March. The plenum is to examine important matters related to the development of the press in Cuba, following the sixth UPEC Congress. UPEC president Tubal Paez announced that the commemoration, instituted as an historical tribute to the founding of the newspaper PATRIA by Jose Marti, is being observed nationwide, with homage being paid in discussion and exchange forums. These have already begun in Cienfuegos. The UPEC presidency reported that UPEC is working on restructuring the provincial emulation competitions in order to choose a site for the Press Day events and the PATRIA newspaper award. In this capital, Cuba's journalists paid homage to Enrique de la Osa, Santiago Alvarez, and Adigio Benitez [all names as heard] -- living legends in print journalism, cinematography, and graphic arts. Certificates were awarded to commemorate the moment. The moment, however, was far more memorable to those who attended the meeting that followed the initial ceremony, which opened to the collection of stories and the broad vision of professionals who, through their different ways of doing things, have set press standards. At the meeting to pay homage to De la Osa, Alvarez, and Benitez, one of the fascinating subjects turned out to be the revival of ("Nao") and "Hanoi: Tuesday the Thirteenth" ["Hanoi, Martes Trece"], two of the best-remembered plays by the man who founded the (ITAI-Latinoamericano) newscast. UPEC's homage to three great members of the national press constituted reaffirmation of the value of Cuban journalism, its perspectives, and its spirit.
