CASUS BELLI Issa Kostoyev, the president of Russia's representative in the Ingush Republic, returned to Nazran at about midday on 31 October. He had not been able to accomplish in Moscow any of the things he considered critical and urgent. A Russian procuracy special affairs investigator and professional analyst, he saw the inner interconnection of events; he knew where it may all end, but he had not been able to avert any of it. He had asked the president for an audience many times--through the audit administration or in personal cables--but never received a reply. Meanwhile, he was getting telephone calls from Nazran every day. And every day the news was increasingly more alarming. An APC [armored personnel vehicle] speeding along a rural street ran over and killed an Ingush girl. An investigation found the driver not at fault. A day later an officer of the North Ossetian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] shot and killed two Ingush. The republic procurator released the murderer from detention. A group of Ossetian militiamen encountered a crowd of agitated Ingush. Three Ingush and two militiamen were killed in the clash. The militiamen were given a ceremonial burial; Galazov himself, as well as members of the government, were present... Kostoyev saw that the Ossetian militia had no hesitation in aggravating the situation, and could guess who needed this and why. The Ingush' spontaneous rage had to be stopped; they had to be prevented from being drawn into an armed conflict that was doomed. Reckless emotions, or perhaps also the ambition of some authoritative Ingush figures, were pushing them into a skillfully set trap. On 24 October at a joint session of three rayon soviets in Nazran the decision was made to block entry to and exit from Ingush villages in Prigorodnyy Rayon, and to call up volunteers to form self-defense brigades and subordinate them to a headquarters consisting of rayispolkom [rayon executive committees] leaders and the OVD [Department of Internal Affairs]. When Justice General Issa Kostoyev learned of this, he realized that the Ossetian leadership had been handed a "casus belli"--a pretext for war: creation of illegitimate organs of authority on its territory. The Supreme Soviet of the North Ossetian SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] convened for an emergency session and presented an ultimatum: Remove the roadblocks and surrender the weapons. Otherwise it will be done by force. Only the president could stop the swift movement towards the perilous cliff. Kostoyev passed all the documents to him through aides. But the president did not meet with him. Finally, it looked as if he would have some luck. B.N. Yeltsin scheduled a meeting with his local representatives on 27 October; Kostoyev sent a note: Disaster may strike any day; please, hear me out. He did not know yet that on that day the Supreme Soviet of North Ossetian SSR had approved a statute on the national guard and national volunteer corps. This was a gross violation of the Constitution, but nobody ever paid any attention to the Constitution in Russia. On that day the formation of an independent North Ossetian army was completed. An army is created in order to fight. The note was the only one--it was impossible to overlook it; still, no meeting took place. A day later Khizha held a meeting in his office, but Georgiy Khizha, chairman of the North Caucasus Region Security Council, had only a very vague understanding of the subject of the conversation. To Khizha's credit, he rather quickly admitted it, and they agreed to meet the next day so that he could look into the history of the problem in more detail. Kostoyev showed up, but this meeting did not take place either. He was told that Khizha was ill. The next morning--a telephone call from Nazran. This was 31 October--the day declared by Vladikavkaz as the beginning of the Ingush aggression. General Savvin, who was leaving for North Ossetia, gave Kostoyev a ride on his plane. Straight from Beslan airport Savvin sent him in a military helicopter to Nazran. It was there, in the evening, that Kostoyev learned that Khizha was in Vladikavkaz. VLADIKAVKAZ, 31 OCTOBER 1992 Sergey Shoygu and Gennadiy Filatov arrived in Beslan in their aircraft late in the evening. Gaydar called Shoygu in the morning in Yekaterinburg, where the latter made a stopover on the way to Siberia, and asked him to immediately fly to Vladikavkaz. An armed conflict had flared up between Ossetians and Ingush, said the first deputy prime minister; the situation is complex, and the GKChS [State Committee for Emergency Situations] chairman should assist Deputy Prime Minister Khizha, who has already left for the region. Shoygu took with him his deputy, Colonel General Filatov. An agitated crowd in the square in front of the Supreme Soviet building demanded alternately that the North Ossetian government resign and that the army corps interfere, but more than anything else they urged that military warehouses be seized so they could be armed. All the local and visiting officials gathered in the office of Chairman A. Galazov. Galazov was briefing Khizha on the situation. From his report it followed that early in the morning the Ingush had attacked the Chermen post, disarmed a military unit, seized several APC's, and were moving in the direction of Vladikavkaz. Units of Ingush thugs, said Galazov, were well organized and armed. Serious fighting is going on in Chermen and other villages. During the day Galazov delivered an address on local television that alarmed the entire republic. He compared the current events with the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. Shoygu got the impression that very few had a grasp of the situation. There was a lot of confusion, and another thing that surprised him was that people straight from the street kept barging into the office--where the entire Ossetian leadership, a deputy prime minister of Russia, multistar generals that had flown in, and Minister of Security Bzayev himself were holding a meeting--yelling that their children had been killed, parents abducted and taken off, and old people thrown out of their homes. "Georgiy Stepanovich," Galazov was persuading Khizha, "you can see for yourself--unless we distribute arms, we will be smashed." Khetagurov, chairman of the North Ossetian Council of Ministers, supported Galazov and said that at least 15,000 submachine guns should be issued to arm the people. It would come out later that Ossetians had taken hostage the wife and daughter of the corps chief of staff, Major General Skobelev. Now Galazov and Khetagurov were directly demanding armaments. We, Ossetians, are getting killed, they were saying, while you are sitting here thinking about whether to give people arms or not. On Khizha's order, upon telephone approval by Grachev and Gaydar, that same night 642 units of firearms were delivered to military draft offices and distributed: submachine guns, machine guns, grenade launchers, and ammunition for them. In addition, 18 infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) were also made available. Khetagurov still was not satisfied. Sergey Shoygu issued ammunition to meet the needs of the North Ossetian MVD, but that was not enough--on his orders he also put at their disposal 57 heavy T-72 tanks. He "recalled" this only when confronted during the investigation with his letter to a military unit commander. "Somebody had to take responsibility; I had the guts to do it. They were manned by military crews," Shoygu explained. Yes, the crews were rented out. Residents of Ingush villages would see their houses smashed by Russian tanks, driven by Russians. Meanwhile, the fluctuations in the behavior of the crowd in front of the Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers building, which alternately quieted down and became agitated, were far from random. It was Colonel General Savvin's observation that this was organized by someone on purpose, in order to exert pressure. Another crowd, led by a procuracy officer who appeared out of nowhere, besieged the training center of the military school in Komgaron; six officers were seized and threatened with execution, after which the attackers' demands were met. They forgot, however, to warn the cadets guarding the arms. The cadets fired warning shots in the air, and when they ran out of ammunition, the crowd tore into pieces two boys who had only been in school for half a year. A report was released to the press that this was Ingush' doing. IZVESTIYA later had to run an apology. FROM THE IZVESTIYA FILE In the fall of 1991 the Prigorodnyy Rayon Administration for Agriculture purchased 21 BRDM-2 [armored reconnaissance and patrol vehicle] equipped with night vision devices, radio transmitters, and filtration and ventilation systems. On 9 June 1992 in Vladikavkaz, 12 self-propelled artillery systems (SAU 2S 1) of 122-mm caliber were seized. On 10 June, a central artillery base was seized, from which 14 KaMAZ trucks with ammunition and more than 14 units of firearms were stolen. The attack was led by O. Teziyev, chairman of the South Ossetian Council of Ministers. No legal proceedings against him have been initiated. According to unconfirmed data, on the eve of the armed conflict a train carrying 24 units of APC-80 with full complement of armaments arrived; the recipient--the North Ossetian MVD. According to military counterintelligence data, as of 4 November 1992 the following arms had been stolen: one BRDM, one 85-mm artillery gun, two IFV guns, 307 submachine guns, 788 pistols, 15 machine guns, 93 carbines, and a great quantity of ammunition. According to the data of North Ossetian official organs, the North Ossetian MVD in October 1992 had at its disposal: 1,065 submachine guns, 304 Stechkin automatic pistols, 113 CPG-9 antitank grenade-launchers, 11 antimissile defense systems, 68 large-caliber machine guns, 36 armored personnel vehicles, and 1,016 grenades. According to the data of North Ossetian official organs, the national guard and the people's volunteer corps had at their disposal 826 submachine guns, 23 machine guns and grenade launchers, 53 units of APC-80, and four units of IFV's. (We assume that the official data are understated.) *** R.Z. Gelikhanova, attorney (former address: 20 Shmulevich Street, Apt. 27, Vladikavkaz; currently lives in Nazran): On 30 October there was a seminar at the Ministry of Justice. It went as usual. I went to the Leninskiy Rayon OVD. I was amazed to see sand bags piled up along the entire corridor and the assembly hall located across it. To my question as what it was, an OVD officer replied: "We are going to defend ourselves against the Ingush." I was at the OVD between 1200 and 1230. On the morning of 31 October my husband and all my Ingush neighbors were taken somewhere, and about 1200, on the orders of Experimentmebel [Experimental Furniture] Director Dzutsev, my apartment was broken into and an OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments] officer's family moved in. (Footnote 1) (About 17,000 Ingush lived in Vladikavkaz, working in the city's various offices and enterprises. By the end of the day of 31 October, many of them had already been arrested; by the first days of November not a single family remained. Shaldon, an area of the city with a concentration of Ingush-owned family homes, had been burned to the ground; about 600 state-owned apartments and all their contents were given to new tenants.) NAZRAN, 31 OCTOBER 1992 By daylight the square in front of the administration building in Nazran was overflowing with people. Many men brought arms with them--some hunting, some military type. The price of a submachine gun at the Nazran city market that day went up from 150,000 [rubles] to 400,000. People had begun gathering late the night before, when the first messengers from Oktyabrskoye woke up their relatives. The previous day, 30 October, a young resident of Dachnyy, Yandiyev, was killed at a bus stop by a sniper shot from a roof, and in the evening firing on Ingush quarters began in Kambileyevka and Oktyabryskoye. The fire was from large-caliber machine guns and either mortars or some sort of missile systems. It appeared that the fire came from the roofs of multifamily apartment houses in the rayon center of Oktyabrskoye. Crowds of Nazran residents and inhabitants of other Ingush towns and villages were brought to the square by one and the same question: They are killing us again; why? Youths were urged to go and settle the score with the Ossetian militia. But just as the republic itself was not yet a state, neither was the crowd in the square a military formation. Experienced people tried to stop the tidal wave, but nobody listened to them any longer. In Zhiguli cars, buses, and KaMAZ trucks the crowd rushed toward Chermen--the nearest village on the territory of North Ossetia. The Nazran militia closed the traffic-control barrier on the highway; somebody in a car smashed through the barrier, after which the militiamen, too, were carried away by the human stream. By the evening the news came: At the intersection leading to Chermen the crowd disarmed a patrol unit, seized six APC's, let the Russian soldiers go, and in the village proper engaged in a fight with the Ossetian militia; there were casualties on both sides. It was all there in Chermen on that horrible day: plundering, arson, and hostage-taking. The Ingush finally did what they had long been pushed into doing--they took up arms. Vladikavkaz television and North Ossetian newspapers reported: In the early morning of 31 October a column of well-armed Ingush commandos accompanied by armored vehicles crossed the border of sovereign North Ossetia near the village of Chermen and moved on to Vladikavkaz. Simultaneously, individual gang formations invaded Ossetian villages from the flanks. Thus began a preplanned perfidious Ingush aggression against the neighboring republic. Telephone communications with Vladikavkaz were disrupted on 31 October and restored only the next day. Kostoyev's telephone conversations with Khizha were full of confusion and as a rule ended with the deputy prime minister's ominous phrase: "We are quite serious!.." FROM THE IZVESTIYA FILE According to official data, by the beginning of the conflict the Ingush side had at its disposal 176 submachine guns, seven machine guns, five grenade launchers, 90 antitank grenades, and 500 hand grenades. This data apparently does not take into account privately acquired firearms. *** Isa Yunusovich Buzurganov, former resident of Kambileyevka village (currently living in Nazran): Even before the 30th, APC's began to canvass our streets, stopping by Ossetian homes and openly distributing arms. On the night of 30-31 October we fully realized the hopelessness of our situation. After 2200, a long siren sounded at the Kambileyevka chemical plant; alarm signals also sounded at other enterprises. That is when intensive firing on our houses began. The first shot came from an APC moving along Mayakovskiy Street in the direction of five-story apartment buildings. After a long burst of fire it disappeared; and then shooting started from all sides. During the night, at about 0400, they started firing at us with grenade launchers from the direction of the veterinary clinic on Rechnaya Street; fire from automatic weapons went on continuously. The grenade launchers accomplished their task--our homes were in flames. By the morning of 31 October, shortly after 0700, this hell subsided. By about 0900 a delegation arrived, headed by General Savvin's deputy--that is the way he introduced himself--and Sikoyev, North Ossetia's deputy minister of internal affairs, and Yakub Kushtov and Ruslan Tatiyev. They inspected the buildings demolished or damaged by shelling, and talked to the people. Sikoyev and the general began to apologize, saying that there would be no more shooting and the guilty ones would be punished. Precisely at this moment another round of firing began; Sikoyev became very nervous, rushed about, started calling somewhere, and shortly afterwards they departed, leaving us in complete uncertainty. This was hardly a "delegation." Most likely, all four arrived from different directions: General I.I. Kapliyev, the deputy of [internal troops] commander V.N. Savvin; the commandant of Vladikavkaz, S.I. Sikoyev; Sunzhenskiy Rayon Soviet Chairman Ruslan Tatiyev; and member of Ingushetia's People's Council Yakub Kushtov. Many eyewitnesses to the events recall that a heated exchange ensued right there between Kapliyev and Sikoyev. Strange as it seems, the events of that night were not reported in either the Ossetian or the central press, although eventually they surfaced in official materials--inaccessible to some, unrequested by others. A year later A. Shchukin, the chief of a composite investigative group, replied to an IZVESTIYA inquiry: There is such a version; we are working on it. Still working on it! Had it been worked on by the investigative group, A. Galazov would not be able to continue repeating to this day the canned version of preplanned aggression by Ingush national-extremists.
