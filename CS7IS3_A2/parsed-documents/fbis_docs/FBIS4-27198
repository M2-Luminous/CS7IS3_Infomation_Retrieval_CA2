The declaration by the SDPJ's central committee came at the end of a two-day meeting in Tokyo. The SDPJ is demanding the disbanding of Hata's fragile minority coalition government and the formation of a new coalition supported by a majority of parties, including itself. The SDPJ did not join the Hata government when it was formed a month ago after his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, backed by the party, resigned in a dispute over the former premier's personal financial dealings.
