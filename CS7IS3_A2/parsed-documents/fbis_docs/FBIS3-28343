The tax rates on whiskey, however, will be left unchanged. The raise will increase the tax on beer by 8.86 yen per 633 milliliter bottle. The retail price of beer is likely to rise by 10 yen per bottle, coordinators said. The raise, which will become effective in May at the earliest, has been sought by the EU countries, which complained that liquor tax rates on shochu are much lower than those on whiskey. As a result of the increase, tax rates on whiskey will be 3.9 times those on grade A shochu instead of the existing 5.1 times, and 6.0 times those on grade B shochu instead of the current 8.7 times, the coordinators said. The tax on sake will increase the price of a 1.8 liter bottle by 12.6 yen.
