However, the public admission of his wish to seek the Sandinist candidacy in the 1996 presidential elections has caused confusion over the nature of the document. Ramirez says he does not want to appear to be binding the signers to back a candidacy, "but rather, a position," and insists that the FSLN must renew itself in order to win the coming elections. Otherwise it will have to wait until the year 2002. [Irias] What is the relationship between the special congress in May and the 1996 election process? [Ramirez] The special congress in May is not specifically designed to open up election prospects for the FSLN. However, the congress does become a political platform for the 1996 elections by virtue of the fact that the platform definitions that we make will necessarily be a reference point for society in terms of the election because they cannot be abruptly changed. These platform definitions of democracy, the Armed Forces, the government, relations with the United States, violence, and methods of struggle will be a mirror in which society will view us as an election option. The effects of the FSLN's democratization process will serve as a parameter indicating whether or not we have a party that has evolved. It will show whether we have a party with procedures for open admission and greater proselytizing activity because, starting in May, we shall have to step up our proselytizing profile in organizational terms and strive to become a winning party. This will all depend upon party structure and our political readiness to go into operation rapidly in an election situation. [Irias] What would happen if the special congress were to decide that a renewal of this type is not necessary? [Ramirez] I think we must fight such a tendency with great imagination, creativity, and determination. A congress that merely marks time and that devotes itself to mulling over ideological concepts in order to prove that we are a party that is ideologically pure would not put us in a politically advantageous position. I think the FSLN has to articulate a very clear message for society, what it wants and does not want, what it has to offer in terms of an alternative solution to the major economic problems facing us. It must also state what the FSLN believes the role of the individual in society must be, its views on the safety of the individual, his property and beliefs, war and violence. All of which must be elucidated in political terms in order to make the Sandinist election goals viable. I must think in preeminently political and therefore election terms if, indeed, we are to go into major elections because the FSLN's victory in 1996 is vital. I would be enormously concerned if the Sandinist Front were defeated again in 1996 and forced to rebuild its election base in 2002, out of power for 12 years. [Irias] You have expressed presidential aspirations. What conditions must exist for this to occur? [Ramirez] I am proposing to the FSLN and Nicaraguan society a party that is transformed, renewed, and resting on truly democratic foundations, internally speaking. The last thing I would ever do would be to propose a bossist take-it-or-leave-it option to Sandinists, stating that my person, my figure, is indispensable to the FSLN's election interests. I have merely spoken of the legitimacy of my aspiration to hold an elective post rather than of the aspiration in itself. I have tried to put back into the closet the old skeleton which says that aspiring to elective office in the FSLN is a cardinal sin. On the contrary, I believe that in a revolutionary party, individuals have the right to their own aspirations and I want to legitimize that fact. I want a renewed FSLN. Then and only then shall we decide on presidential candidates. If the Sandinist Front does not become a force in terms of empowerment as a force capable of winning, then choosing preliminary candidates will serve no purpose whatsoever. I decided to place my name on the document "For a Sandinism That Goes Back to the Majorities" in order to force yet another skeleton back into the closet: casting the stone while hiding one's hand. I was indeed a decisive factor in the formation of that faction and in the drafting of that faction's views. I agreed to place my name on it out of loyalty to its 1,000 signers, but I do not want to appear to be forcing the signers to back a candidacy, but rather, a position. I have not tried to gather signatures backing me personally. When I decide to announce as a precandidate in the elections representing the FSLN, I will begin to speak with complete legitimacy, and the party will have a means to determine who the candidate will be, because there will certainly be several. What I refuse to accept is for the leadership to decide on a single candidate who will then be imposed on the party's rank and file. [Irias] Did the National Directorate decide that its members would not sign any document or participate in the activities of the factions? [Ramirez] Opinions were expressed that it was not advisable for members of the National Directorate to head factions within the FSLN or sign documents, but none became an actual decision. This happened after a number of members of the DN attended the founding meeting of the Beijing Guerrilla faction, who obviously did not sign the document. They did attend, however, and I consider them part of that core of founders and recognize their right to do so, just as I reserve the same right to discuss related positions with other comrades. After the document "For a Sandinism That Goes Back to the Majorities" came out and the matter was discussed once again, we agreed that members of the DN should have freedom of opinion and the interplay of factions, while respecting the rules of a high-minded debate. I do not think the DN could make a decision to prevent its members from participating in the factions because it is almost of a provisional nature. We will report when the congress elects a new leadership in May. Within the DN itself, we should accept the possibility of the competence of candidates and how to resolve it in the most appropriate fashion. There could be several candidates for the post of secretary general of the FSLN. We would be speaking of immediate proselytizing action rather than action relating to an assumed presidential candidacy in the distant future. No one has decided that there will be only one candidate for every post and we no longer have elections by lists. We must expect several candidates for every elective post; that is inevitable. [Irias] What is your view of the election results in the Atlantic Coast area? [Ramirez] I believe that what happened resulted from the Sandinists' inability to engage in election proselytizing. The FSLN is still unprepared to be a party that will win the majorities, as those elections show. Our comrades on the Coast made an enormous effort, but the central party machinery did not lend them sufficient support. We are not acting like a national party called upon to win in regional elections. The duty of a party is to win, not compete for second place! [Irias] Should the FSLN form alliances for election purposes? [Ramirez] As a general rule, I think the FSLN should be open to alliances--particularly in a civil struggle in which it is votes that define victory--while always bearing the national purpose in mind. I do not think the Sandinists are the sole proprietors of the solutions to the country's crisis. I wish there were a union of forces in which the FSLN would play the central role and set the course for emerging from the country's crisis in 1996. [Irias] Will you run for the National Directorate at the next congress? [Ramirez] I have not yet decided. I would like to be a part of the leadership elected by the congress and I would not refuse an elective post. Nor am I blackmailing anyone, as has been written and stated on the radio, saying that if the congress does not do what I want, I will withdraw from it or even switch to another party. I do not believe in political bossism consisting in having men be more important than things: the party, our institutions. Bosses are capable of sacrificing anything: the unity of a party, the coherence of a plan, the viability of a country, in order to reign personally. I am not like that. However, I do reserve the option of not running for an elective post if the ratio that emerges from the congress indicates that there is no possibility of transformations like those I believe the FSLN needs in order to face the election challenge politically speaking. Here we have yet another skeleton to put back into the closet: that it is a cardinal sin to run for elective office and a cardinal sin if you do not run because you are threatening our unity. As a member of the FSLN, I shall always defend the fact that failing to appear on a list of candidates at any given moment should not alarm anyone or lead people to believe I am attacking unity. [Irias] Does the National Directorate function as the real leadership of the party? [Ramirez] The DN does not function as the real leadership of the party, as proved by the fact that if a special congress was indeed called ahead of the scheduled date of June 1995, it is because of recognition of a crisis of leadership in the party. The feeling of collegial leadership has been lost and the Sandinist Assembly is not functioning as such. Most of the resolutions passed by the Sandinist Assembly exist only on paper and have not been carried out within the party. The departmental organs are also in crisis. Not only is the FSLN engulfed in an identity crisis, but it is facing an organic crisis as well. It was because of it that we were unable to contribute effectively to an election victory in the Atlantic Coast region. For all of these reasons, the FSLN's renewal as a party is essential.
