The employees, who have been staging partial strikes for the past two weeks, requested Parlacen's mediation. The Parlacen Information Office reported the commission members are: Guatemalan Deputies Vinicio Cerezo, Eduardo Meyer, and Manuel Conde and Marco Tulio Castillo, who is a Honduran and president of the [Parlacen] labor, union, and social issues commission. Parlacen President Jose Francisco Guerrero, a Salvadoran, met with the government employees who had requested the mediation and offered to talk to Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio. The request for Parlacen's mediation, which the executive still has not yet accepted, is another action taken by the strikers to pressure the government into accepting their demands for a 40-percent wage hike. Approximately 30 leaders of the National Federation of State Workers Unions (Fenasteg), which represents approximately 180,000 employees, remain in the government office waiting to meet with De Leon Carpio, who is not at the Presidential Palace. Fenasteg Secretary Armando Sanchez has said they will not abandon the palace or allow personnel to enter or leave the building until they get a positive response.
