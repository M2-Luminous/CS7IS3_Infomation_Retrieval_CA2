"Social-democratic in character, the programme lays stress on welfare and is by all means reformist." The premier added that decisive steps were in view for 1994 as far as restructuring and privatisation are concerned. He mentioned that the government was open to "a dialogue with political parties in search of (restructuring and privatisation) solutions, and, if good ideas are expressed, we are definitely ready to take them over." The head of the Romanian executive rejected the "slogan" saying that no reform had been carried out in Romania and showed that important good things were achieved in 1993 in external relations "in consequence of our policy of reform that has been known and recognised as such." Premier Vacaroiu admitted that "things did not go equally well as regards restructuring and privatisation," although "more than 3,000 assets were sold and more than 300 small- and middle-sized commercial companies were privatised." The pace was too slow, implied Premier Vacaroiu, who mentioned that 2,000 of the 6,7000 companies selected for privatisation so far would be passed to private hands by making use of the vouchers distributed to the population about two years ago, for which shares can be bought."
