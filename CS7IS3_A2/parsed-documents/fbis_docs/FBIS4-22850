Komarovskaya; UDC 620.197:669.71:546.7] [Abstract] Film metal-oxide heterostructures are widely used with different electronic devices. In order to develop carriers for a vertical magnetic recording, magnetic films based on metal oxide heterostructures on aluminum surface have been intensely studied for the last several years. The magnetic medium with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is realized in these film systems by formation of cell structures with distributed needle- like particles of ferromagnetic metal. The Moessbauer effect offers great potentials for studying these films. The objective of this study was, by applying the Moessbauer effect, to obtain information on the kinetics of the process of filling the cells, or pores, and information about the magnetic condition of needle- like particles. The film metal-oxide heterostructures were produced by electrochemical sedimentation of iron in the pores of the anode oxide film, formed on the aluminum surface by anodizing in the sulfuric acid electrolyte. The results of Moessbauer measurements demonstrated that magnetic and non-magnetic components were present in the spectra of all examined samples. The studies also indicate that by an appropriate selection of the anodizing condition and consecutive sedimentation on the aluminum surface, magnetic films, suitable for application in devices with a vertical information recording method can be obtained.
