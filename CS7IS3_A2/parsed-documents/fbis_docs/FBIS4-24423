According to a recent survey and remote sensing by meteorological satellite, the east China province is expected to produce 20 billion kg of wheat, a little more than last year. Wheat production accounts for half of Shandong's annual grain harvest. The province sowed 4.4 million hectares of wheat this year, a little less than last year. But total output can be better as per unit production can reach 5,805 kg per hectare, up by 240 kg over last year. Local officials attributed the growth of summer crop output to improved field management, favorable weather conditions and intensified efforts in technological extension services, as high- quality seeds were provided for 95 percent of the sown areas.
