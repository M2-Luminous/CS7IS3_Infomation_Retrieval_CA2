To quote Filatov, in individual regions strong efforts are being made to preserve the Soviet system of authority. Moreover, the local executive bodies are under the pressure of the representative ones. Asked about the possibility of postponing elections to local bodies, Filatov told Interfax that the presidential decree on reorganizing the local authoritative and self-government bodies, according to which local elections must be held in the first quarter of the year, should be made more flexible. The implementation of this document demonstrated, said Filatov, that individual regions should work out their own election schedule. If the local conditions demand that elections be held in June or in autumn, such elections should be held during these periods. He expressed hope that the most vitally important problems arising in society would be analyzed by the Public Chamber and recommendations would be given to the president and government on ways of adjusting their work and taking more reasonable decisions. He said no one should fear lest the Public Chamber, a consultative body, might juxtapose itself to the Federal Assembly. This is a normal international practice whereby public forces gather at a round table and express their views on the most essential state problems. This is going to be the president's public relations agency, he said.
