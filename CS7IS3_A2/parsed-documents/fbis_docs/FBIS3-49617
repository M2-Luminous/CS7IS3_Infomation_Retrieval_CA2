FBIS3-49617 "dreeu008__a94028" FBIS-EEU-94-008-A Document Type:Daily Report 12 January 1994 ANNEX Slovakia SDL Sees `Omission' as `Warning Signal' AU1101170494 Prague CTK in English 1517 GMT 11 Jan 94 AU1101170494 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava, January 11 (CTK) -- The omission of Slovakia from the countries cited by both German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister John Major as eagerly awaiting NATO membership is a warning signal for the Slovak Government, Democratic Left Party (SDL) Chairman Peter Weiss said today. Major had said that the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary were the Central European countries with the fastest-developing democracies and the clearest demands for NATO membership. Weiss said this meant the Slovak Government needed to analyze the country's situation, since forgetting about or directly minimizing Slovakia could lead to the destabilization of the Central European region. In connection with the demands of Hungarian minority leaders formulated on January 8 at the meeting in Komarno, SDL deputy and Council of Europe parliament representative Lubomir Fogas pointed to the closing document of the Vienna summit of October 8-9 last year, which charged a committee of ministers with drawing up a proposal for a supplement to the European Agreement on Human Rights in the area of culture and individual rights, especially the rights of national minority members. This supplement, Fogas said, spoke unequivocally about the solution of minority problems on the basis of the individual rights of citizens, as declared by the Slovak Constitution. The Komarno meeting had overstepped the framework of this recommendation, he said. The division of the country for administration is not a matter of parcelling up land, but is an act which should use social, economic, demographic, transport, and other analyses and should not be limited merely to the national minority side of the question, Fogas said. He added that the decentralization of state power would be debated at Slovak Parliament's 26th session at the end of January.
