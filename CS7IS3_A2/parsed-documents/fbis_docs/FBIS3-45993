It will do this by enhancing its cooperation with China's financial education department and increasing its investment in China's key infrastructure construction this year. Liu Maolin, manager of the firm's Beijing representative office, made the announcement over the weekend. Liu said, in the field of financial education, the firm will conduct a series of lectures on basic finance and sophisticated international currency management. The firm is seeking opportunities for giving these lectures, setting up scholarship funds and investing to facilitate the education departments in the universities in Beijing. The total investment in this sector will be between 2 and 3 million yuan ($229,000 and $344,000). The firm also plans to further its involvement in the key infrastructure projects of China this year. It will explore co-operative opportunities with the Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and other financial and investment firms, domestic and overseas alike, for investment in the Three Gorges Project and Shanghai's Pudong New Area. Liu said that his firm planned to introduce its sophisticated and patented techniques in finance to China, but not sell it. He said China can learn its technology through "cooperation projects." The firm, handling daily transaction of floated currencies worth around $2 billion, contends it has the technology to predict future trends in 24 different international currencies. To guarantee the success of the firm's plan, a high-profile delegation will soon be organized by the firm's headquarters in London to visit Beijing. The delegation hopes to make an overall inspection of China's financial and educational departments.
