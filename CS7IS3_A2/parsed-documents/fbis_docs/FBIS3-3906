Chen Huangyou said: In his government work report develivered at the current NPC session, Premier Li Peng, in accordance with the basic work principle decided by the party Central Committee, set forth the various tasks for 1994. The report fully manifests the "general principle for the work of the whole party and country" -- "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability" -- set by the CPC Central Committee. The work for this year of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee and government will conform to and serve this principle; we will rely on the common efforts of people across the province and do a better job in our work in all areas. "How will Jiangsu accommodate and serve the work of the whole party and country to promote its own development?" Chen Huanyou said the first thing to do is to continue to deepen reform. He said: The scope, depth, difficulty, and intensity of the major reform measures adopted by the state this year are all greater than those of the past. Although there are risks and contradictions in making reforms, now is a favorable time for making reforms -- a good job in reform this year will lay a good foundation for our future reform and development. According to the central authorities' plan, this year Jiangsu will give prominence to making reforms -- we will promote mutually-supportive reforms in all areas, with the focus on building a modern enterprise system and on promoting reform of the macroeconomic management system. We will do specific work in detail and in a down-to-earth manner, and will properly publicize, explain, organize, coordinate, and carry out the adopted reform measures to ensure practical results. He added: The task of this year's reform and development is very heavy. By seizing the opportunity of this year's reform of the foreign trade system and the foreign exchange management system, Jiangsu will promote opening up to the outside world within a larger scope and sphere and at a higher level, and will interweave its economy with the international economy at a faster pace and in a better way. We will further expand the capacity for and raise the level of utilizing foreign funds, make positive efforts to expand foreign economic and technological cooperation, and build up various kinds of development zones starting from a high level and using high standards. Chen Huanyou stressed: The heavier the task of reform and development is, the more we need to work hard to improve the quality of economic growth. This year, the focus of Jiangsu's economic work will be placed on improving the quality and efficiency of and on raising the level of its economic growth. We should bear in mind that "development is the last word." We should develop at the highest possible speed those export-oriented projects producing marketable products with good efficiency. Of course we should make the best use of our subjective initiative and attach special importance to relying on technological progress and on raising workers' educational levels in readjusting the economic structure, in improving the quality of economic growth, in raising the entire economic level, and in improving the overall economic results. Chen Huanyou also explained how Jiangsu will accommodate and serve the work of the whole party and country and promote regional economic development by further improving the province's infrastructural facilities, by stepping up the development of its basic industries, and by further ensuring its social stability.
