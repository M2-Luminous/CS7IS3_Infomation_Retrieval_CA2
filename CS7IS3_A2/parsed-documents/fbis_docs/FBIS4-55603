He will be awarding medals and shaking diplomats' hands. In April of 1993 (in the previous Sejm), the SLD submitted its own constitutional draft. Since then, Lech Walesa successfully made life miserable for the SLD several times already. As soon as Walesa signed the Budget Law, a group of Sejm deputies for the SLD made an attempt to amend the Small Constitution. They wanted to severely limit presidential powers, but the Belweder reacted in strong terms: The president even made a declaration that he "will dissolve the Sejm" even if he is "subsequently charged by the Tribunal of State." In the end, however, a cease-fire came into force: Aleksander Kwasniewski promised that the SLD will not tinker with the Small Constitution, and Walesa promised to accept the SLD's new candidate for finance minister, as well as allow deputy ministers coming from the SLD into the Ministries of Defense, Internal Affairs, and Foreign Affairs. Corrections After a Lesson But, after this lesson, the SLD changed its previous draft of the "big" constitution. It blows a strike, first of all, to the president, whoever he happens to be (presidential elections are scheduled for fall 1995). The SLD draft suggests cutting short the president's term of office from six years (the old version) to five years. Instead, the Sejm's term would be expanded: It would last until the first session of a new Sejm. The SLD wants to avoid a case similar to that of Hanna Suchocka, who was in power without the Sejm's supervision. The point is also to make it impossible for a future president to block governmental nominations (as happened in the case of Dariusz Rosati, the SLD's initial candidate for the post of finance minister), to drag his feet over signing the budget, or to try to avoid accepting individuals from the governing party or coalition into the presidential ministries. Almighty Prime Minister The SLD now wants the Sejm to appoint a prime minister, with the president having a say only after four unsuccessful attempts by the Sejm (he could also order early elections in such cases.) Under the previous draft, it was the president who made a motion in the Sejm to have a candidate approved. The SLD also changed its mind concerning ministers: They are to be appointed not by the president but by the prime minister (under the old version, the president was to perform the role of a notary public; he would sign a nomination at the request of the government's chief). The president would lose the privilege of appointing the attorney general. According to the SLD's new draft, this would be done by the Sejm, which would also appoint a chancellor of the law, who would supervise the conformity of draft laws with the legal system. A Lesson Over Budget The Polish Peasant Party and the SLD were scared until the very last moment that Walesa might not sign this year's budget. The SLD wants to avoid such traumas in the future: Under the proposals, the president would have to either sign the budget or veto it within seven days. However, the Sejm could overrule such a veto by a three-fifths' majority, thus forcing the president to sign the budget anyway. Under the previous draft, the SLD treated the budget almost the same way as other types of laws: The president could sign or veto the budget within 15 days; he could also address an inquiry to the Constitutional Tribunal over the budget's conformity with the Constitution. Concordat, Work, Personality The SLD has been saying for a long time that the Concordat with the Vatican is discriminatory vis-a-vis non-Catholic churches. In the new constitutional draft, the party makes things perfectly clear: Nobody can be placed at an advantage by any kind of law or international agreement. The SLD declares a regime of a "social market economy" (even though the statute of Social Democracy of the Polish People's Republic speaks of democratic socialism), it wants to provide legislative guarantees for a 40-hour workweek (which the striking miners demanded recently), and it guarantees a right to organize strikes, but it also leaves a safety valve in the form of the possibility of banning strikes, for instance, in strategic sectors of the economy. The SLD declares in its draft that work is "the fundamental precondition for the development of the human personality," and it wants to give every citizen the right to "unrestricted development of his or her personality" and to "freely chosen work done for just remuneration." The SLD promises free education in public schools, free health service at public clinics and hospitals (but only such services as are "necessary for health protection"), and the right to a dwelling.
