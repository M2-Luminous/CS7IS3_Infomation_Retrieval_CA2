He spoke at a working meeting of several ministries and departments which will participate in the expedition. The mission plans to carry out comprehensive monitoring of the radiation, ecological and biological situation in the area of the submarine's wreckage with the use of advanced equipment and to realise several technological operations aimed at minimising a possible leakage of products of plutonium corrosion into the environment. It is also planned to implement a unique operation at a depth of 1,700 meters to seal, with special hatches, six ports in the submarine's bow where there are six missiles, two of which are with nuclear warheads. This will decrease the speed of water currents and minimise the leakage of products of plutonium corrosion. The operation on installing hatches will be simulated on the sub's specially built full-scale mockup. Meeting participants noted that there is no experience of conducting similar operations at such depths. Khetagurov said in conclusion that the expedition is an expensive undertaking. Nevertheless, it is necessary for Russia and the entire international community. Therefore, it should be carried out at a high technological and organisational level.
