There is a deadlock on the political level because no new government has been formed since the elections. The old one is still in place. Now when everyone is expecting a cabinet reshuffle, no minister works. The president himself said on television that Guinean ministers do not believe in God and that they spend all their time consulting fetish priests as they do not know whether they will remain ministers or not. So ministers do not work and neither do civil servants. Civil servants no longer obey their ministers because they could also become ministers in future. The administration, therefore, is not functioning properly and political life has come to a standstill. On the financial level, an IMF team visited the country in March but no agreement was signed, so there is also a deadlock at that level. On the economic level, investors have recently hesitated to invest in the country because of insecurity, corruption within the legal system, lawlessness, and an administration bogged down by bureaucracy. Coupled with this, political uncertainty does not augur well for the economy, so there are no investments. On the social level, people's living conditions have worsened terribly, especially in the informal sector. Petty traders and others have had their shops damaged and vandalized without any compensation.... [Ovono, interrupting] Do you not think that the opposition is partly to blame for this political, economic, and social deadlock since the government, and indeed President Conte, have made an effort by inviting the opposition to become part of a national union government? [Conde] I think it is a double-edged invitation because since the elections, extremist elements within the presidential group have forced President Lansana Conte to brutally suppress Rally of the Guinean People [RPG] activists. In Haute-Guinee and Guinee-Forestiere Regions, RPG activists have been arrested, imprisoned, beaten, and asked to pay heavy fines so it is rather confrontation that the authorities have extended to us. [passage omitted]. In our view, the government is doing everything possible to destroy the RPG but, thank God, the more RPG activists are suppressed, the more determined they become. [Ovono] Do you not believe that as a member of the national union government, you, as the RPG leader, could help to end this state of affairs? [Conde] You know, people engage in politics for two reasons: They do so either because they have an ideal [words indistinct] or because they are bread and butter minded and therefore fight for a portfolio or for a presidential seat. The RPG is a party that is fighting for an ideal. This ideal, which remains the same, is the fight for democratic change in Guinea and the establishment of the rule of law for sound and rigorous management of state affairs: in other words, the fight against all forms of corruption and ethnocentrism. We can join in the management of state affairs only if this will help achieve this ideal. Of course, we try to avoid excesses; we do not want clashes because we do not want a civil war. That is why I said I did not come to govern cemeteries; but that does not mean we are going to accept just anything. We are not bread and butter minded, that is, we are not ready to give up our ideals for material gains. [passage omitted]
