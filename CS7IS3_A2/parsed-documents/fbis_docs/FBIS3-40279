The republic government reexamined the package of stabilization measures because the government task forces working on the implementation of the program proposed certain changes and additions to the original decisions. The government also called for the active involvement of government officials and authors of the measures in order to mobilize all the public, from enterprises to state bodies and citizens, to work for the implementation of the program. Thus, the citizens of Serbia will be informed as soon as possible about the substance, nature, and implementation of the measures offered as the most suitable manner for coming out of the crisis. The republic government examined the draft of the new criminal law and established the procedure for sending this important law to the National Assembly of Serbia for adoption.
