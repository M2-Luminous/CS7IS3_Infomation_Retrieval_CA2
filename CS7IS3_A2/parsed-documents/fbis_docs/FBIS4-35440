Only a few writers addressed matters of substance. Rabin has never professed to be the consummate diplomatic speaker Abba Eban is, or the speech purist that Shim'on Peres is. For better and for worse, one of his most prominent qualities is the harmony of his mouth with his heart. He says what he thinks. Literati will define it as credibility, and it was because of his credibility that he was elected to his position both in Labor primaries and in the national elections. He is not going to change in his eighth decade, and despite all the criticism leveled at him, I have not detected any strong public nostalgia for his predecessor, Yitzhaq Shamir, who was not an Abba Eban disciple in the mysteries of diplomacy either. Likewise, I sense no ardent longing for the predictable leadership of Binyamin Netanyahu, and no walls moved at the news of the prospective participation in the premiership race of Ari'el Sharon, who -- with his typical tact -- chose the period of memorial days for the fallen of the Lebanon War, that unnecessary war, to make his announcement. Another candidate who has announced his intentions, Refa'el Eytan, is not famous for dainty speech either. True, the state comptroller reminded us that a man is as good as his style, but the style is affected by the job. Style required of a judge or a state comptroller is not equal to that expected from a Knesset member; ministers' and politicians' style is not expected to emulate that of teachers and rabbis. In some positions, we expect officials to conform with a certain style, and if they do not, they should be ousted. In some elected positions, all we can do is put the elected official's deeds, misdeeds, and style up for the electors' scrutiny once every few years. It is doubtful whether many of the prime minister's political supporters disagree with his approach to matters of substance, with the exception of one. The only matter on which many sense Rabin went too far in style as well as content was his blatant criticism of the state comptroller. But do many people think Netzarim is a genuine settlement, one so important that it must not be removed at any cost, under any conditions? Does Netzarim contribute to national security, or is it a burden on the security forces? Of course, Rabin could have phrased this sentiment differently, but no refined expression would have changed the substance. And do many people, including right-wing supporters, believe the vagrant yeshiva in Jericho's Rachel's Tomb is important? The fact that Hanan Porat, the national martyr, sits there rolling his eyes heavenward, bestows no sanctity or religious significance on the site. Does every mosaic in Eretz Yisra'el automatically call for a yeshiva and the deployment of security forces in the defense of every fanatic drawn to it? Is there such a dearth of yeshivas and synagogues in the country that holy studies can be held only in Jericho? And since when is Jericho a holy city, and who has lifted the ancient ban on it? The prime minister provided the media, which has to fill pounds of paper for the weekend press, with topics. But their alacrity was exaggerated in most cases. It is too soon to mourn the Rabin government or draw its balance sheet, although it will mark two years in office in six weeks. It should be said in the prime minister's credit that so far, he has carried out the main objective he undertook when he was elected: He has promoted the peace process. In domestic and economic spheres, insufficient results of the declared intention to change national priorities are discernible, but there are signs of improvement in several fields. There are signs of certain growth and of falling unemployment. There have been important developments in the spheres of foreign trade and investment. Serious steps were made toward infrastructure development. The pace is inadequate, and more should be done. But bureaucracy gets in the way, and Treasury officials, the "Fogels" -- one of the prime minister's most justified verbal coinages -- often act as if the Likud was still in power, exploiting the finance minister's frequent preoccupation with other matters. In the near future, we would expect the prime minister to do more and to decide on many issues that were delayed during the negotiations with the Palestinians. We hope he will decide on the next health minister today. If there is any truth to the rumors that Rabin's candidate is Efrayim Sne, then it is an excellent choice, both for the health and the political systems. The 50-year- old Sne is member of the younger Labor party generation, and he is undoubtedly an asset in many fields. His appointment would be a precedent of the right man getting the right job, and we hope it will bode well for the future. If Rabin decides to appoint another minister so as to maintain inner balance, the candidate will be apparently Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, who has made a long way from his "poodle" days. The choice is undoubtedly difficult, but high-ranking positions will await the other candidates in a not- too-distant future. Many would like to see Avraham Burg as Zionist Federation chairman and Hagay Merom as party secretary general. In the meantime, the prime minister must decide also on his nominees for cabinet secretary and media adviser. These key positions must not be left unmanned for long. Rabin must highlight his national and partisan leadership with more than blunt and stern utterances; he must do it by deed -- in Jericho and Netzarim, as well as in the government complex in Jerusalem and the Labor headquarters in Tel Aviv.
