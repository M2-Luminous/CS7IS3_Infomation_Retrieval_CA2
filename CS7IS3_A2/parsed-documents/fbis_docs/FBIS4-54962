Good morning to you, Sir. [Kolodko] Good morning to you, and to you, Ladies and Gentlemen. [Woyciechowski] When one reads newspaper headlines from the past few days, they resemble war reports: Battle for Popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases]--that is the kind of title that keeps appearing every day. What is this battle for popiwek all about, and who is fighting whom? [Kolodko] I hope this will be the last battle because popiwek is a palliative situation; it is not a good solution. As everyone knows, it was introduced quite some time ago with the goal of regulating the rate of salary increases. We have been using it as an instrument of anti-inflationary policies, and it seems that it is the working people or the trade unions that are fighting the government, or, to put it in broader terms, the authorities in general--after all, popiwek is [words indistinct]... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Actually, the fight is with the finance minister--that is, you--because it is you who ultimately decides the issue. [Kolodko] I would not like to think that this fight is with me. No, it is not the finance minister who decides, even though he naturally enjoys specific powers, he suggests certain solutions, there is the whole legislative process... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But what about you, personally? Are you in favor of the popiwek? [Kolodko] I am not in favor of the popiwek, and I have just told you about some steps concerning what should be done to resolve this palliative situation that is not the optimal solution. And we are indeed resolving it. Now, I understand that the popiwek has been applied for so long because, even though it was not the best solution, it still kept nominal salaries in check and, by controlling salary inflation, the popiwek unquestionably contributed to decreasing price inflation. [Woyciechowski] But how does the popiwek fit into a free market economy? Is there any country in the world, a capitalist country such as Poland, that has introduced this instrument? [Kolodko] The popiwek does not fit into the free market economy very well because it obviously limits the sovereignty of economic units and enterprises, whereas we are eager for them to really conduct their own economic policies. Let me put it this way: I am referring first of all to operational activities and decisions regarding the distribution of economic surpluses into that part that is being invested and that part that is devoted to salaries--that has to be an independent process, whereas the popiwek is about the state's interference in decisions about distribution in an enterprise, and the popiwek's evil is about breaking apart a fundamental relationship in economic processes between awarding efficient labor... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is the popiwek a necessary evil? Is that your assessment? [Kolodko, hesitating] It used to be a necessary evil, and right now it is also a necessary evil, but currently, we, the governing coalition, are suggesting--the Sejm already approved of that and the Senate will debate it today--namely to apply what I call the mechanism of the setting sun, meaning that we should impose on ourselves the rigor--I mean, not so much we ourselves as parliament will impose it on us as the government--that we should abandon the popiwek irreversibly, definitely, and, I hope, forever, and that should happen by the end of this year. This is really a very short period of time... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] By the end of this year? [Kolodko] Exactly. So that means eight months in which a whole range of other systemwide solutions must be prepared that will facilitate labor efficiency and award increases in labor efficiency, but that--God forbid--will not result in an increase of inflationary pressures, which are very strong in Poland to begin with. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister, how did your first week on the job go? You have been a deputy prime minister for one week now. [Kolodko] It passed under conditions of a great deal of work and enormous pressures, on the part of not only the striking miners but also the mass media and people I met in the hallways of the Office of the Council of Ministers building. First of all, I spent the week trying to overcome an organizational jungle because a certain confusion occurred as a result of the vacancy at the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister for almost three months... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What happened when, after three months, you entered the empty office of the deputy prime minister and finance minister? Was there a huge pile of papers to be signed, or was it not like that at all? [Kolodko] No, as far as that is concerned, everything had been very well prepared. What did happen, however, was that there were lying--or actually hanging in midair, I should say--some unresolved issues and problems, and I think the infamous popiwek and the highly complicated sociopolitical situation, I mean the wave of strikes I hope are on the decline now, this is what I encountered there. Some issues are being resolved and some need to be resolved soon, and the government is working on that. Some proposals will be presented soon, but the whole point about conducting economic policies is about finding the right way or method to resolve problems faster than new problems arise. One must have a colossal imagination and colossal psychological discipline, and, of course, one must have the appropriate economic knowledge. As far as the knowledge part is concerned, I studied and analyzed these issues for quite some time, so I am positive about that aspect. But actions need to be intensified by all means, and, from that standpoint, I can understand the impatience of trade unionists, of working people and businessmen who have unambiguous expectations vis-a-vis the government for it to fulfill some earlier declarations, especially those made during the election campaign, as far as the coalition parties are concerned. I did not take part in the campaign, but right now it is also my problem to keep the commitments. [Woyciechowski] Let us go back for a moment to the first week. During your first week in the post of deputy prime minister, you must have read a great many secret documents, figures, and statistics. After this first week, do you view Poland's economic situation better or worse than a week ago? Is it very bad, very good, or just average? [Kolodko] I have not read very many such secret figures. As deputy prime minister, I receive certain material labeled secret and confidential, and sometimes I wonder what makes something secret as opposed to confidential. My knowledge about the country's economy is comprehensive enough to be able to avoid some secret knowledge of which we would still not be aware... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So that means you were not surprised by anything over the week? [Kolodko] No, from that perspective, I was not surprised by anything. [Woyciechowski] But is it your assessment today that the situation is better or worse than what you thought a week ago? [Kolodko] As far as the situation of the Polish economy goes, and also future prospects ahead of the economy, I say that the week introduced no major changes [words indistinct]... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So what is the economic situation like? [Kolodko] I still think that, first of all, future prospects are good, even though today I have more problems on my mind because if it were not for the strikes, protests, and this horribly arranged social dialogue--I mean the strikes--my optimism would definitely be even greater to some extent, but I still approach this in a very constructive way, and I think we have good chances for resolving a whole range of economic problems to everybody's advantage. It so happens that the Polish economy has already entered a growth period, and I regard it as my main mission to conduct the kinds of policies that will strengthen the growth trend or even accelerate growth. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister, on the one hand, there is growth, but, on the other, when you compare Poland with the Czech Republic, for instance, or with Hungary, we have a much higher inflation level and huge unemployment. Are these the two biggest obstacles--I mean inflation and unemployment? [Kolodko] There is no doubt that they are both limitations to economic policies, but they are also those parts where our economic policies should be concentrated... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What must be done to halt the growth of inflation and to bring inflation to a normal level? Do you have an ideas on that? [Kolodko] Yes, I do. Of course I have ideas. But this process is...[Kolodko pauses] You touched upon two issues here: inflation and unemployment. There is no doubt that, especially over the short run, there is a relationship between... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is inflation caused by unemployment, or is it the other way around? [Kolodko] I mean, reducing inflation by subsequent percentage points under the current conditions--if it is not done with a certain monetary-fiscal sophistication, I would put it this way--may cause a further increase in unemployment. The goal of economic policies... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In a word, the lower the inflation, the higher the unemployment? [Kolodko] Yes, I mean, if we tried to reduce inflation currently by applying instruments similar to those that were applied at the beginning if 1990, there is no doubt that this would result in a further increase in unemployment while one of the goals of socioeconomic policies of this particular government--and rightly so, in my view--is first of all to keep reducing the rate of unemployment growth--and we are practically at that stage now--followed by reductions in the rate of unemployment as such. [Woyciechowski] How does inflation in Poland come about? What is its source? Is there any one source of inflation in Poland? [Kolodko] Oh, no. There is no single source. Inflation is very complex, and it is partially of a structural nature, and partially it.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What do you mean by structural nature? [Kolodko] I mean that the structure of our economy continues to be such, that, given the current systemwide solutions--unfortunately, this brings in the popiwek again--the flow of income is rising at a slightly faster rate than the flow of real supply--that is, production--so this causes [words indistinct].... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is this because someone awards raises to somebody? [Kolodko] That is true, and also because, in macroeconomic terms, we pay out--that is, we introduce more money into the economy, through various channels, not only through salaries, than would be justified by a physical growth of the product. [Woyciechowski] To make a long story short, we earn too much, Mr. Prime Minister? [Kolodko] Oh, no, we do not earn too much. Right now our real wages are increasing because work efficiency and output are also increasing. Therefore, it would seem that it should be easier for us to conduct economic policy. Today's disputes are not over how to distribute the decreasing production and how to share the ever-growing amount of poverty, but over how to share this richness, which is increasing, however slowly. I understand that today social protests have become more intense, and certain tensions have built up because people can already feel, which is based not only on their intuition but also on facts and observations, that it is rising. Now, the question arises... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That wage increases are being given? [Kolodko] I would not like to use the word given because this keeps us in the epoch of the Polish People's Republic: Either someone gives something or it is obtained by fighting. What one actually can obtain by fighting is only poverty--the more strikes, the slower wage increases will be; the more strikes we stage, the more.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Talking about the strikes. What is your opinion on them? Do you agree with the opinion of those who claim that these are first of all political strikes, aimed at the coalition? [Kolodko] I would not like to interpret them in this way. However, as an economist, I do not fully understand these strikes, and, frequently, when I observe the situation carefully, I can see that first there is a strike and only then do the strikers search for demands that should be submitted. After that, demands follow that have not been discussed 24 hours or even 24 days beforehand. In this sense, one can interpret these strikes as political; however, all political players are involved in it--politicians who have certain ambitions, certain views. We often have disputes not over the differences of views but over the differences of interests. This is why it is next to impossible to reach an agreement, a consensus, because the interests are different. Now, if I were to look at this from the standpoint of a nurse, a physician, a teacher, a miner, or a driver, I can understand the people's reaction: When they hear that our economy is already developing, that the situation is good and is to improve, it is understandable that they would like to benefit from this as well. The mechanism that is supposed to resolve these difficulties must be institutionalized. We place great emphasis on the negotiations of the trilateral commission. We treat it very seriously, and, from the point of view of... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] During the negotiations in the trilateral commission, it was promised...[Woyciechowski pauses] Actually, it was not you who promised it. Representatives of the Finance Ministry promised that the personal income tax would be less severe. What is your opinion on this? [Kolodko] It will not really be less severe. The unionists want this: If the next tax bracket is exceeded, the person who exceeds it should be able to pay the tax along with his or her spouse. In that case, the advance payments should not be made. We have calculated this in the Finance Ministry--what the financial result of such an operation is in a year. It has also been discussed before. An agreement is possible here, and we are arriving at such an agreement, which the government, wherever there is.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, will the tax be less severe or not? You protested when I said that it would be. [Kolodko] Well, it will be less severe if we look at it from the viewpoint of the entire year. It is a certain concession for those taxpayers. However, it is a matter that does not make any greater perturbations in the sphere of public finances. In this area, the government is reaching an agreement with the trade unions. However, I would like such matters to be regulated quite unequivocally when the budget law is prepared. Again, I am a realist, but I will now tell you this anecdotal story: I recently visited Japan, and, in this country, people are allowed to stage strikes only in March because the budget enters the fiscal year on 1 April, and, once the budget has been passed by a democratically elected parliament, then, in a democratic society, there comes the time of hard work.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Then you would like a similar situation in Poland? Would you like one month to be chosen for strikes? August, for instance? [Kolodko] You know, actually I would not like any strikes in Poland. I believe that, in a more or less normal situation, which we are more and more, it is possible to reach agreement even on very difficult issues. I am a realist, and I do not think we will reach a situation in Poland where there will be no strikes at all. I can imagine.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is it possible in Poland today to fulfill the election promises made by the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance? [Kolodko] This depends on how they are interpreted and over what period they should be fulfilled. The foundation of my economic policy or my view of he economic policy is the necessity of prolonging time. I assume that the work we are going to do will be done in the constitutional period of one term. [Woyciechowski] This is what you discussed in the Sejm--the medium-term program, the medium-term strategy. This medium term means how many years? [Kolodko] Yes, I am even working on a strategic program, I would say. I would like to add, however, that a strategy is implemented over a longer period than terms of governments, even in stable societies.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That is six, seven, or eight years? [Kolodko] Six, seven, or eight. Let us say.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] This is, then, the economic program on which you are working. [Kolodko] Of the year 2000. Yes. However, what this government must try to implement is a medium-term strategy. Because I am also the finance minister, I attach great importance to the preparation of the so-called medium-term financial strategy. In this area, we have reached a certain creative agreement with the president of the National Bank of Poland. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister, what will the situation in Poland look like in two or three years? How high will inflation be? How much will our incomes increase? How much will the zloty be devaluated? [Kolodko] I think that, in three years, the situation in Poland will be noticeably better, which does not mean that all groups will be the beneficiaries.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] How high will inflation be? [Kolodko] In three years, if we manage to implement our economic policy, inflation will near the level of approximately 10 or 12 percent.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That is, just like Hungary today? [Kolodko] Well, it is still very high inflation. This should be clear. Compared to Western standards--jthe OECD or the European Union--it is very high inflation. However, if we take into account the inflationary hell in which we have been in recent years.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] How much will our incomes increase within three years--2 percent, maybe more? [Kolodko] Well, more. According to the calculations of the Central Planning Administration, which concerns the increase in the GDP, it is estimated that real wages this year may increase more than was envisioned in the budget law. What you said--that is, 2, 3, or 4 percent--is guaranteed this year. If.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] They will increase more. What do you mean by 5 or 6 percent? [Kolodko] Within this year or within three years? [Woyciechowski] This year? [Kolodko] No, this year I believe they will increase 3 to 3.5 percent.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That makes 10-12 percent within three years, does it not? [Kolodko] They can certainly increase that much. We will also have money for much faster increases in investments, for financing growth and development, because this policy must really be very prodevelopment. We must think increasingly more about future generations, not only about this present-day consumption. [Woyciechowski] How high will the devaluation of the zloty be? In the Sejm, you promised to defend the Polish currency. Is it not going to be devaluated so often? [Kolodko] It is not devaluated very often. That is, on the one hand, we must implement the policy of strengthening the currency so that this will further stabilize the economy and influence macroeconomic stabilization; on the other hand, we are still faced with the dilemma of to what extent we should take advantage of the exchange rate as an instrument of shaping the current circulation. On the one hand, there is a certain temptation; there is pressure, especially from groups linked to exports, to devaluate the zloty because this makes exports more profitable and restricts the import trends. Right now there are no reasons to head for a faster and greater devaluation. There is only the question of when we will pass to the stage of shaping the exchange rates more freely within the framework of the interbank system. For the time being, we are employing the so-called crawling pack [preceding two words in English]--that is, adjusting monthly devaluation, based on the basket of currencies. There is the question of on what level this ratio should be. Now, earlier you asked about the causes of inflation; one of these causes is such a mechanism of devaluation: If the Central Bank devalues the currency by 1.6 percent a month, it sends information to all consumers and manufacturers that the price of foreign currencies goes up by the average of 1.6 percent a month. More or less, in the same rate, the price of everything else goes up as well. This gives a signal to what we economists call inflationary expectations.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The Central Bank is partially to blame for this inflation? Is it Ms. Waltz? [Kolodko] It is not the fault of Ms. Waltz or the Central Bank because it is both the cause and the result. This mechanism also consists in the following: We adjust the price of money to the costs that go up for other reasons. I do not want to say a banal thing--here everything depends on everything else. It is a very complex system of interdependencies. The point is that we should quietly and gradually reach the lower levels of the crawling pack [preceding two words in English]. It is possible that, from time to time--now this time has not yet come, that we will have to make a correctional devaluation. However, the main goal is to stabilize the exchange rate, and this is the function of inflation. On the other hand, this inflation is the function of.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] This is what you call the protection of the Polish currency. What about the denominations? Do you like the bank notes with six zeros? When will the zeros be less numerous? [Kolodko] I do not like them. This sometimes makes calculations quite complex. Our views are clear: The currency in Poland must be redenominated. Work is under way.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Will this be done in January or a year later? [Kolodko] I would like us to be ready with this on 31 December.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] At the end of the year. The last question. I have read in the papers today that, on Monday [9 May], the government will go to Lansk for two days, to that magnificent residence--this time not for a rest but for a session of the government. Why is the government escaping from Warsaw and hiding in the Lansk forest to hold a session? [Kolodko] Well, I do not know.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is this going to be a secret session? [Kolodko] I think this will be done because the waiters there are not on strike. I do not know whether those residences are magnificent; I have never had the pleasure of visiting them. I will go there for the first time and in this new role of mine. Now, seriously. Prime Minister Pawlak proposed such a solution to have more time for a quiet, substantive, and lengthy discussion over this long-term strategy we are preparing. I would also like to present my concepts in greater detail. This is why we want to leave for Lansk. This was planned much earlier. The prime minister insists on this proposal. The idea is that we should go there, close the doors, as it were, and discuss issues in quiet.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Put aside the cellular telephones. [Kolodko] Also the cellular telephones, which sometimes are a distraction--they make people concentrate on things outside rather than on the issues we are supposed to discuss. I think then we will know more questions. I also believe we will be able to answer some of them. Now, I also said this in the Sejm: I treat very seriously the principle of "Nothing About Us Without Us." I hope that we--my colleagues in the government and I--will be able to discuss these issues here with you and the listeners quite often. I hope we will be able to subject this to public evaluation, that we will argue and debate, until we feel pain. However, I hope we will not strike because strikes.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, who will feel the pain, the ministers or the people? [Kolodko] Well, sometimes we will all feel the pain because we will have arguments about how to distribute the effects of the growing work efficiency. Now, the process will be difficult all the time. Everyone who is involved in it will feel the pain.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Will everyone feel the pain equally? [Kolodko] No, because it will be fair--fair means unequal. [Woyciechowski] Thank you for the interview, Mr. Minister. [Kolodko] Thank you.
