Service chiefs say the 2,300 troops there are so thinly spread that they could be dangerously exposed if the war worsens. The Chiefs of Staff have yet to make an unconditional formal recommendation to the Government to send reinforcements, but their concern is growing. Senior soldiers have decided to give urgent support to a request from Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose, the British UN Commander, for another battalion of infantry. Gen Rose is understood to have told the Chiefs of Staff that the ceasefire he has brokered around Sarajevo -- and is extending to other areas -- could crumble without more troops to enforce it. There is also a growing concern in the Army that the Government, which argues that extra troops should come from other countries, is failing to back a senior British officer who is widely acknowledged to have transformed the situation around Sarajevo with his tougher attitude to the warring factions. Authoritative sources confirmed last night that there were now serious differences between Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, and military chiefs, who want an additional battalion to be sent to Bosnia for three months. Ministers hit back, saying that the previous advice from the military on reinforcing the British contingent has been "ambivalent." A senior source in the Ministry of Defence also stated that the Chiefs of Staff had so far made only one formal recommendation to the Government: that the sending of additional troops should be conditional on other nations agreeing to put in extra men. The Cabinet's committee on Defence and Overseas Policy (OPD) has firmly backed Mr Rifkind's opposition to sending another battalion until other Nato countries, particularly the United States, make a contribution. After weeks of arguing the case behind doors in Whitehall, senior officers now want the issue made public. The opening shot in a remarkable trial of strength between the armed forces and the Government was a letter to The Daily Telegraph on Tuesday from Lord Bramall, former Chief of the General Staff, who still has close links with the Army. He said it seemed incredible that the Government had "largely spurned" a request by such a senior general. "You could hardly imagine the French or even the American Government taking such a negative view if one of their own generals had achieved so much." The Government's opposition to sending more troops was reaffirmed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary. In an article in yesterday's London EVENING STANDARD, headed "Why we won't be dragged into the quagmire," he acknowledged that the UN might need extra men, but said that Britain, with France, Spain, Holland, Canada and Malaysia, were doing their bit. "The extra should come from elsewhere," he said. However, it was disclosed last night that the French, who have the largest contingent in Bosnia, have decided to send out a replacement battalion. It will overlap with the existing forces there, and provide valuable additional support for the UN peace keeping force under Gen Rose's command. Senior ministers confirmed there was still strong opposition in the OPD Cabinet committee to sending more troops. So far, all that has been agreed is the despatch of 60 men with mortar locating equipment and permission for Gen Rose to redeploy some Coldstream Guards already stationed in Bosnia. Although Mr Major, who chairs the committee, is sympathetic to Gen Rose, some of the Cabinet's most heavyweight figures are opposed to any deeper involvement. They are backed by most Tory MPs, who fear that Britain could be sucked into a "Vietnam-style" conflict. On the one side are Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Harding, Chief of the Defence Staff, Gen Sir Peter Inge, Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon and Adml Sir Benjamin Bathurst. Lined up against them are Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, Mr Rifkind and Mr Hurd. The Attorney General, Sir Nicholas Lyell, also attends OPD meetings, largely to give advice on international law. Mr Clarke -- the second most powerful member of the Government -- is the strongest opponent of sending more troops. Mr Rifkind, who pointed out last week that there were only 15 US personnel on the ground in Bosnia, has also formed a close alliance with Mr Hurd in arguing that other countries should make a contribution before Britain does more. The Prime Minister is said by colleagues to be acutely aware of the danger that the Government could be accused of failing to back a British general at a crucial moment in the Balkan crisis. Mr Major was in the forefront of pushing for British backing for a more "muscular response" by NATO in the wake of the Sarajevo market place massacre. In talks with President Clinton in Washington on Monday [28 February] Mr Major urged him to reflect urgently on the UN's need for more troops to enforce the ceasefires now being established in Bosnia. But the President again reaffirmed that America would not contemplate sending ground troops until there was an overall peace settlement. Mr Major suggested that a contingent of Italian troops could be sent to Bosnia when he later met the United Nations Secretary General, Mr Butrus Butrus Ghali, in New York. This is now under active consideration . At Westminster there is growing concern over the rift between the Cabinet and the military chiefs. It is the most serious dispute on operational matters that has developed between this Government and the Army. There is now evident worry at the highest levels over the dangers faced by the British contingent in Bosnia. The soldiers are said to be tired and spread out in small groups, without the ability to defend themselves against an all-out attack. Gen Rose will have an opportunity to state his case for more troops when a deputation from the cross-party Commons defence select committee visits the British peacekeeping forces in former Yugoslavia early next week. The general will travel to Split on the Croatian coast to meet them. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative MP for Upminster and chairman of the select committee, said last night that he backed the Cabinet's view that other countries should be expected to play their part first. "If more troops are sent we want to be sure we can extricate ourselves. Otherwise we could find ourselves going down the Vietnam road." But Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, who will be part of the select committee deputation, said: "When a British general performing a very difficult United Nations command actually asks for more troops, his Government has a pretty specific obligation towards him. ``I don't think that ministers should let people take these commands unless they are willing to give them the necessary support.''
