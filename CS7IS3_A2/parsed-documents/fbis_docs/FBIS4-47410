Puzankova, Scientific Research Institute of Foot and Mouth Disease, Vladimir; UDC 616.98-078.33] [Abstract] Enzyme immunoassay is the preferred test for diagnosing viral and bacterial infections among animals for a number of reasons, among them its simplicity and quickness of execution, its high level of sensitivity, the accessibility and stability of the reagents used. The researchers here developed a field technique that will analyze a serum sample for the presence of antigens or their antibodies and provide on-site results. Test results are produced within 30-40 minutes (as opposed to the best current time of 3-4 hours), without the need for complex instrumentation. References 11 (Russian).
