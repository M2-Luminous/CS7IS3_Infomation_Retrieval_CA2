[passage omitted] Another issue is the issue of hajj. Unfortunately, this year with the immaturity shown by the Saudi regime, our society was deprived of its holy objectives in this political and religious rite of Islam [disavowal of infidels ceremony]. The Saudis addressed the issue very badly. They could have solved the problem much more sensibly and not caused differences between the two important countries of the region. They could have taken more of our pilgrims. The ceremonies could have taken place in a way so as not to cause any problems for them. We had informed them that we did not wish to disturb anyone and that we intended to hold religious ceremonies. However, we have to wait to see under what conditions they took this immature step, we have to wait to understand its roots. Of course, today Islamic unity and the unity of Muslims is very important for us as a principle alongside the principle of disavowal. We attach as much importance to friendship as we do to disavowal. These two go together. To prevent a new crisis and with the agreement of the esteemed leader [Khamene'i], we prevented the occurrence of a new sedition in Arabia. We do not think it is appropriate under the current conditions in the world of Islam ...[sentence incomplete as heard] The world of Islam has many crisis points: Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Nagorno-Karabakh, Bosnia, Palestine, Somalia, Iraq -- and recently, unfortunately, Yemen in which a senseless, wrong-headed civil war has been started and in which Muslims are being sacrificed for the selfishness and ambitions of various individuals and factions. The blood of the people is being shed, the wealth of the poor people of this region is being burned. We have so many crisis points. The leader of the revolution wisely prevented another crisis taking shape. However, the Saudis should think harder about this issue. A task that does not cause them any disruption and which can be correctly undertaken with the agreement of both sides ...[sentence incomplete as heard]. A hajj that means hajj to a Shiite can take place. We hope that the situation they created this year will act as a lesson to them so that it is not repeated next year. [passage omitted] We hope that we can have a program acceptable to both sides for next year's hajj in which both our views and the views of the Saudis are catered for, and through which the Saudis' concerns will be alleviated. [passage omitted] Finally I would like to refer to my recent visit to Gilan Province. If I deliver a sermon after such visits I usually refer to them and explain a few issues. People are quite aware and I only mention a few points. Many things became clearer to us during that visit. Indeed we saw Gilan Province full of epic, solidly on the [revolution] scene, faithful to the revolution and supportive of our imam [Khomeyni] and our leader [Khamene'i]. [passage omitted] Anywhere we went masses of people gathered -- in Rasht and other provinces -- which was even beyond our expectations. Usually the end of the crowd could not be seen. People were so happy and cheerful which made one wonder about the amazing negative propaganda bombardment that our people are subjected to. Various podiums within the country, media and foreign radios usually enlarge problems. They speak of high prices, inflation, economic and political problems, and other small talk. They speak of ordinary incidents as huge incidents causing insecurity. And such a great deal of propaganda bombardment has not had the slightest effect on the people. That is very strange. Why are our people so aware? Of course that awareness does not exist only in Gilan Province. [passage omitted] I think that our people see the realities of life and juxtapose them against this misleading propaganda and slogans and realize how much the revolution has done for them.
