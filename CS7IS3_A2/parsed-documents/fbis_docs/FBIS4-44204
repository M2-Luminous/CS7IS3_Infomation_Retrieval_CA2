"When 11 countries out of 12 have agreed on a name, I don't see why we should change tack," Juppe said in this southwestern city, referring to Britain's veto of Dehaene at the European summit in Corfu, Greece at the weekend. "Jean-Luc Dehaene's candidacy was a good one and the British veto provoked this crisis which the EU [European Union] really did not need. I hope that by July 15, wisdom and reason will prevail," he said. Germany, which takes over the six-month revolving presidency of the EU on Friday from Greece, has called another summit for July 15 to resolve the issue of who will succeed Jacques Delors, a French socialist, to head the EU's executive commission. In Paris, Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said Dehaene "is an excellent candidate and remains so." He remarked that only Britain had vetoed Dehaene who had otherwise been backed by the 11 other European Union leaders in Corfu. "It will be Germany's task to find the consensus on Dehaene. It's easier to go from 11 to 12 than to start again at zero," Duque said. [passage omitted] Dehaene himself told RTBF public television that "I remain a candidate." "A consensus must emerge at the European council on the name of the European president and the fact that Europe is blocked by Britain is not good, all the more so as Mr. Major's opposition is motivated by domestic reasons," he said.
