What has been the international reaction? Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys has answered this and other questions from our correspondent. [Gylys] Reaction has been coming in from all sides: We have responses from our neighboring Estonians and Latvians, and from Russia. I would say that they are normal. I think that our desire was unexpected to many countries, even though we have maintained close contacts with NATO. Last spring, I met with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner. Recently, National Defense Minister L. Linkevicius visited the NATO headquarters. Our president has been corresponding with the secretary general. We have also expressed our position on NATO at its Cooperation Council and the CSCE forum. I have detailed our stand to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher during his meeting with the Baltic foreign ministers in Riga. The reaction from the Baltic states is slightly different. Estonia's response is more reserved. By the way, the Baltic states were informed about our move in advance. I would like to say that Russia could also contribute to the creation of a new security system in Europe. This will become possible when democratic tendencies win once and for all in Russia. Adopting this decision, Lithuania followed its interests of national security. This decision is not directed against anyone. We are moving into an era of nonconfrontational politics. [Vinickas] We have heard some voices claiming that the expressed desire to join NATO is the opposition's accomplishment. Could you comment on this? [Gylys] It is said that success always has many parents, while failures are orphans. I do not deny the opposition's contribution, but I remind everyone that the joint Seimas [parliament] resolution on foreign policy issues was supported by the votes of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] faction. It is then that the president was advised to apply for NATO membership. The LDDP leadership considered this issue thoroughly for a long time. Our stand was as follows: Lithuania should participate in international security structures. I admit that the opposition and the ruling force must look for common interests, if this is possible, and seek a consensus. However, the statements that, for example, all moves of the opposition are positive, while those of the government are correct only due to pressure, do not enlarge our possibilities to conduct a national foreign policy, as our opponents say. I see a contradiction between the urge to conduct such a policy and a completely negative reaction to our each move which the opposition approves. [Vinickas] It is understandable that joining NATO is a process. In your opinion, when will it be possible to find out whether NATO approves of this process? [Gylys] I would note that it was important to us to state our position. I think that the NATO summit will discuss its future strategy and place in the contemporary world. The rapprochement between NATO and Central and Eastern Europe should be mutual. NATO must make up its mind concerning its approach to Eastern and Central Europe: It would either adhere to old and tougher principles or lower the crossbar slightly and speed up the process of integration in creating a common European security system. Western politicians say that they would not like to create conditions for a recurrence of confronting blocs. We could also speak about our preparedness. Lithuania's current military budget is "transparent." On the other hand, we must achieve public control of our military structures, because such demands are being put on us. I would confirm that the movement toward NATO is an evolutionary process. We could only ask whether this evolution would be intensified. This does not depend on Lithuania alone. One is often left with the impression that some Lithuanian politicians believe that foreign policy is conducted as if of its own volition. However, this is not the case. As an imposing organization, NATO understands its dilemmas and is aware of its responsibility to preserve peace on the continent. [Vinickas] Thank you for the interview.
