[MFIAJ], in reference to the fact that the insurance sector has become one of the focal points in the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, said: "We are considering plans to set up a meeting ground where officials from the private sector can hold discussions to deepen their mutual understanding." Onoda, who is also president of the Sumitomo Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd., made the comment at a news conference held the same day. He also disclosed there are plans to revise the existing system to give easier access to membership in the MFIAJ for foreign insurance companies which have entered the Japanese market. The MFIAJ already holds meetings with foreign insurance companies which have entered the Japanese market. Onoda, however, feels these meetings have remained too routine. He disclosed the MFIAJ is thus considering plans to set up a forum where top-level meetings can be held to discuss a broad range of topics. The plans are expected to materialize as early as this coming summer.
