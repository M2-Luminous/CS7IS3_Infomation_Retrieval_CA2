This has been told to journalists by Russia's Defence Minister Pavel Grachev at the end of his private talks with Armenian leaders on Wednesday [8 June]. In Grachev's words, it will finally decided on Thursday how many military bases will be set up, and what personnel they would employ. As INTERFAX has learned from a negotiator, Russia is looking forward to creating two military bases in Armenia: one for a motorized infantry regiment at Erevan, the other for a motorized infantry division positioned at Gyumri. In Grachev's view, an appropriate agreement with Armenia will be signed by 1 September. "By then, Army officers must decide for themselves who will stay in Armenia and who will return to Russia," Grachev said. Military experts believe that the issue on funding was crucial to the talks between Ter-Petrosyan and Grachev. According to a spokesman for Grachev, the Armenian leadership wish that Russia would pay for leasing the sites for its Army in Armenia. However, the Russian side insists on the free use of Armenian lands in military purposes. Negotiations on that continued on Thursday. During his tour of Caucasian republics, Grachev also plans to meet with Georgia's leader Eduard Shevardnadze to discuss with him the possibility of Russian military presence in that republic (presumably at Tbilisi, Akhalkalaki, and Batumi -- IF). Besides, Grachev intends to discuss peace-keeping activity in the zone of Georgian-Abkhazi hostilities. As he reported to journalists, at a meeting with President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan slated for June 11, he would raise the issue on the need for that republic to adhere to the agreement on a Karabakh settlement, signed in Moscow on 17 May. Otherwise, he said, Russia would halt all mediation in resolving this conflict. "If the conflicting parties want to stop the war, the signing of the Moscow accord is the best chance for that," Grachev stressed. IF Note: On 17 May, Russia's Defence Minister Pavel Grachev mediated the signing by the leaders of Armenia and Karabakh of an agreement on a stage-by-stage settlement in Karabakh. Only the Azerbaijani side refused to sign the accord. Stage one provides for a ceasefire to be followed by a disengagement of hostile troops by 10-15 km, and by setting up mixed observation posts. During stage two and three, negotiators are to focus to ways of liberating the captured Azerbaijani territories and determining a status for Karabakhs. Searches for a Karabakh settlement through Russian mnediation began in Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek in early May when lawmakers from Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, and Karabakh signed a protocol to cease-fire and disengage the troops. Azerbaijan refused to join the accord then. Only one month later, on 8 June, at a session of the Interparliamentary Assembly in St. Petersburg, did the Azerbaijani Parliament's Speaker Rasul Guliyev put his signature under the Bishkek agreement. However, he argued that the document "does not solve all Karabakh problems." In his opinion, since the protocol "only provides for a cease-fire, documents are required to work out a comprehensive settlement." He reported at the session that essential papers were being drafted with help from CSCE, CIS through Russian mediation." "Azerbaijani is ready to negotiate these issues and determine a status for Karabakh but only after all Azerbaijan lands have been freed by political means," Guliyev remarked. In his words, some Azerbaijani forces are trying to aggravate the conflict. They regard the Bishkek accords as a provocation from neighboring states. Nonetheless, Guliyev advocated an early deployment of peace-keepers in Karabakh to operate under UN and CSCE control there. The Armenian Parliament's Speaker Babken Ararktsyan claims that a shaky truce in Crabs [as received] can be breached any time, if the Bishkek protocol is not backed up by legal documents to be signed by heads of state. He is convinced that without such signatures, the document "is incomplete in terms of the law." At the same time, he stressed that the Bishkek accord "has played its peace-keeping role."
