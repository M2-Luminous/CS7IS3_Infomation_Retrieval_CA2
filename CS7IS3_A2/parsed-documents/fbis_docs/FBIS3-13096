This was the two men's second telephone conversation in two days. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the talk was held following a consultation held at the prime minister's office, in which an effort was made to draft answers to the PLO's queries, which had been presented as a precondition for renewing the negotiations. Our correspondent adds that the appropriate conditions for resuming the negotiations have not been created as yet, but there is satisfaction in Jerusalem about the renewal of a direct link with the PLO.
