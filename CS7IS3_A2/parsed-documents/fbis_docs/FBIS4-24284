As is normally the case, in its attempt to hinder the peace talks, UNITA wants to introduce new elements in the issue connected with Jonas Savimbi's status which has already been discussed and has received the consensus of all parties. Our correspondent Alves Antonio reports. Negotiating teams from the government and UNITA have finally approved specific principles for national reconciliation which, among other things, include the issue of installations for Jonas Savimbi's organization. Thus, the government and UNITA are now able to tackle practical issues in the implementation of modalities for national reconciliation which include the major guidelines and a future government of national unity. Surprisingly, UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim said and we quote, it is not necessary to have a special status for President Savimbi, unquote. Meanwhile, regarding this issue, the government version is different in that Savimbi's status has already been discussed and approved. What UNITA now wanted was to introduce new changes. This being the case, the government is demanding from UNITA a written document saying that it wants to withdraw this issue from the dossier.
