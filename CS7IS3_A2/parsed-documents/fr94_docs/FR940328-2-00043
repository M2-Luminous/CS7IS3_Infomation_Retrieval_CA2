OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0480. Title: Application for Earth Station Authorization or Modification of Station License. Form Number: FCC Form 493. Action: Revision of a currently approved collection. Respondents: Businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 2,500 responses; 24 hours average burden per response; 60,000 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: FCC Form 493 is a multipurpose application form used to request Commission authorization for new or modified radio station facilities under Part 25. The form is used for a number of satellite services governed by Part 25 covering several classes of stations. Part 25 services include Domestic Fixed-Satellite Service; International Fixed-Satellite Service; Radiodetermination-Satellite Service; and Mobile Satellite Service. FCC Form 493 is used to apply for a license to construct and/or operate a transmit/receive earth station, a transmit-only earth station; to register a domestic receive-only earth station; to license an international receive only earth station; or to modify a granted license or registration. On 10/21/93, the Commission adopted a Report and Order establishing rules to govern the licensing and regulation of non-voice non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems (NVNG MSS). Applicants will use FCC Form 493 to apply for approval for transceivers in the NVNG MSS. Several questions on the form require applicants to submit further information in the form of exhibits. Applicants are advised to refer to 47 CFR Part 25 before completing the form to determine whether other showings are necessary in addition to that specified in the form. FCC Form 493 will be used by FCC staff to determine the applicant's eligibility to operate earth station facilities and to receive requested modifications to earth station facilities. The agency would not be able to determine the applicant's eligibility for acquiring an authorization without this information. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary.
