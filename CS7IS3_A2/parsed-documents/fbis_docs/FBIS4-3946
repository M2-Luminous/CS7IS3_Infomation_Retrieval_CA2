FBIS4-3946 "drchi080_v_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 TAIWAN Council Seeks More Data on Qiandao Incident Council Seeks More Data on Qiandao Incident OW2604075594 Taipei CNA in English 0726 GMT 26 Apr 94 OW2604075594 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Lilian Wu] [Text] Taipei, April 26 (CNA) -- The cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday [26 April] that it would not send a group to mainland China to discuss the March 31 Qiandao Lake murders until the mainland supplies more information about the crime. The MAC statement represented an about-face from its earlier call for a Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) delegation to visit Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province later this week to learn more about the mainland's investigation into the March 31 murders, in which 24 Taiwan tourists and 8 mainlanders were robbed and killed while on a pleasure cruise. SEF is Taiwan's non-official conduit for mainland-Taiwan relations. MAC asked the mainland to submit autopsy reports and details of the crime scenes to SEF before the delegation, comprised of SEF officials, retired police detectives and relatives of the victims, leaves for Hangzhou. However, mainland authorities have not responded to the request. SEF wrote Monday to its mainland counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), to request the information before it decides when to send the delegation. MAC official said that the request was made on behalf of the relatives of the victims, who said their trip would be futile without the proper information and would only endorse Beijing's handling of the case. The official said that the delegation's departure would depend on ARATS' supplying such information. MAC Deputy Director-General Su Chi said Tuesday that when the delegation leaves for the mainland, it would not only seek to learn the truth behind the crime, it would also try to establish a formula for handling future threats to the life and property of Taiwan residents on the mainland.
