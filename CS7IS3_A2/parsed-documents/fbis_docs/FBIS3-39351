There should be no doubt about the firm determination of NATO and its member nations to act against those responsible so that the resolutions of the UN Security Council are respected and the suffering brought to an end. In this context it is essential that the Bosnian Serbs lift without delay the siege of Sarajevo and that the heights around the city and the means of access are placed under the control of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]." So said the North Atlantic Council (NAC), on August 9 1993. A week earlier it had decided "to make immediate preparations for undertaking, in the event that the strangulation of Sarajevo and other areas continues, ...stronger measures including air strikes against those responsible." Six months later, the siege has not been lifted. The heights and means of access remain under Bosnian Serb control. The "strangulation" of Sarajevo and other areas continues. So did the shelling, more or less continuously until, last Saturday [5 February], one shell landing in a Sarajevo street market brought the city's agony back to Western television screens and, thereby, jolted NATO into...well, not action exactly, but a new meeting and a new ultimatum. "No one should doubt NATO's resolve," says President Bill Clinton. On past form that is exactly what one should doubt. True, this time there is a precise deadline. The Bosnian Serbs have been given 10 days, not to end the siege of Sarajevo but -- "with a view to ending it" -- to withdraw, or "regroup and place under UNPROFOR control" their heavy weapons located within 20km (12.5 miles) of the city centre. After that, such weapons not under UNPROFOR control will be "subject to NATO air strikes." Inhibiting factors No further meeting of the NAC is required, and the "request" from the UN secretary-general has already been received -- though "close co-ordination" with him, as the person to whom UN commanders on the ground are answerable, will still be necessary. Last year, the concern of UN commanders for the safety of their troops was one of the main inhibiting factors. Now, it seems, that factor has changed sides. General Jean Cot, the overall UNPROFOR commander, and General Sir Michael Rose, the commander in Bosnia, both favour a tougher line to restore some credibility to their mandate. They see air strikes, or at least the credible threat of them, as a useful, perhaps even essential, element in that strategy. NATO's excuses for not acting, if its bluff is called, are running out. One familiar excuse has reappeared, in the shape of strong protests from Russia. But Western governments can hardly allow good relations with Russia, however desirable in themselves, to be their only objective. And Russia, for its part, should consider the effect on Western and Moslem public opinion if it appears to aid and abet the Serbs in a policy of starvation, massacre and conquest. Maximum Confusion So the Serbs would be unwise to call NATO's bluff, and the signs are they are not going to -- at least not directly or immediately. They have promised to move their guns and observe a ceasefire. But they are masters of prevarication. (Remember their symbolic but tactically meaningless withdrawal from Mount Igman last August.) It would be altogether in character for them to move some weapons, invite UNPROFOR to take "control" of others in circumstances which make UN soldiers effectively their hostages, and then accuse the Bosnian government either of breaking the ceasefire or of concealing some of its own weapons, or both, so creating maximum confusion. It is equally likely they will increase the pressure elsewhere in Bosnia, most obviously on the Canadian garrison at Srebrenica. Relief of the Canadians by a Dutch contingent had been proceeding more or less smoothly. It seems incredible that NATO's latest decisions make no mention of this, nor of opening the airport at Tuzla, the two specific demands made by the NATO summit exactly a month ago. If NATO had a strategy in Bosnia it should have reiterated these two demands and made them subject to the same deadline. The airport at Tuzla, especially, offers the only real hope of relief for suffering civilians in central Bosnia and thus also the only hope of restoring credibility to the entire UN operation -- as the letter on the opposite page, from the Oxfam representative there, points out. It is also crucial to any strategy for maintaining even part of Bosnia as a viable state under government control, which must be the centrepiece of all peace plans and mediation efforts. But NATO does not have a strategy. It has only a spasmodic reflex of reacting to events under public pressure.
