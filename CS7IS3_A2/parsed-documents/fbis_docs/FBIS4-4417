The U.S. Government reacted by criticizing the package as "insufficient" and made it clear that it would not go along with Japan's call for a resumption of the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The Japanese Government is trying to accept the U.S. reaction calmly, noting: "Their reaction is somewhat tougher than we had anticipated" (according to a top official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry). The U.S. Government has criticized almost all aspects of the package including management of Japan's macroeconomic policy and the automobile and auto parts sector. As a result, attention will focus on whether the Hosokawa government will be able to map out another package of more concrete measures opening up the Japanese market and relaxing bureaucratic regulations, while overriding resistance from the business community and concerned ministries and agencies, and overcoming the rift in the ruling coalition parties before July when the summit talks of major industrialized nations (the Naples summit), which will mark a juncture in Japan-U.S. relations, are held. At a 30 March session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said: "U.S. Trade Representative Kantor is not disappointed with the package; it is a first step. I have heard that he will pay attention to how Japan maps out another package of measures in June." The government itself has acknowledged that it had decided to delay taking more concrete measures on opening up the Japanese market and relaxing regulations by the end of June. The prime minister had expressed hopes for resuming the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks when the package was announced. But, the consensus in concerned ministries and agencies is that "it would be impossible for the package to open the way for resuming the framework talks." U.S. Trade Representative Kantor has said, "The ball is still in Japan's court," but it is not easy for Japan to hit the ball back into the U.S. court. With regard to the macroeconomic measures--the focal points of which are the continuation of tax cuts and an increase in public investment--Japan needs to settle the issue of raising the consumption tax. With the waning unifying force of the Hosokawa government, the issue of raising the consumption tax will undoubtedly develop into an issue that could shake the Hosokawa government. As one of the conditions for resuming the framework talks, Mr. Kantor has cited "the use of qualitative and quantitative indexes to determine whether opening the Japanese market is successful in the individual sectors." In this way, he has hinted that the United States would again bring up "numerical targets" for discussion; this was one of the causes for the break off of the framework talks. U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo Mondale has criticized plans compiled by Japanese automakers to boost their purchase of foreign-made auto parts, pointing to "their low growth rate." Saying "I am especially disappointed" with the automobile sector in the package, the U.S. ambassador has called on Japan to take more concrete measures to boost its imports of not only foreign-made auto parts, but foreign-made automobiles. However, it is difficult for Japanese automakers to drastically increase their purchase of foreign-made auto parts. The government has kept the door to compromise with the United States on the numerical targets closed and there is no room for the government to concede to the United States in the individual sectors. The United States is expected to ask Japan to take bold steps to relax regulations and give foreign firms more access to government procurement. Finance Minister Fujii, MITI minister Kumagai, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura are all in charge of mapping out the measures for opening the Japanese market and relaxing bureaucratic regulations. While Fujii and Kumagai are affiliated with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Mr. Takemura is affiliated with Sakigake [Harbinger]. Some point out that the ongoing delicate confrontation within the ruling coalition parties is making it difficult for the coalition government to deal with external issues.
