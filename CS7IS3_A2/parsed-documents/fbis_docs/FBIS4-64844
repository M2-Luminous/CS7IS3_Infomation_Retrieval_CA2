In his opinion, "all Francois Mitterrand did [in yesterday's speech on nuclear deterrence] was harp on general principles." [Bernard] Yesterday, Francois Mitterrand adoapted a very "Gaullist" tone. This is something you must be happy about. [Baumel] Given the way things were orchestrated, as well as the setting and the audience chosen, and in view of the uncertain world situation and the unpredictable threats we are surrounded with, I would have expected the president of the Republic to give a clear definition of the new directions our national defense is to follow. What we got instead was the stubborn repetition of a number of principles first upheld by General de Gaulle in a very different context. All Francois Mitterrand did was harp on general principles in an attempt to show 12 twelve months before the end of his presidency, he remains in control. His statements about the continuation of the moratorium on nuclear testing is testimony to his determination to maintain the status quo. His speech was nothing more than a "farewell to arms." On the other hand, I can only be happy about Francois Mitterrand's newfound belief in the nuclear deterrent, which he opposed for 30 years! [Bernard] What was it that you would have liked to hear? [Baumel] After reaffirming those general principles which nowadays are taken for granted by everyone, Francois Mitterrand should have moved on to tomorrow's defense policy. In the current context, focusing on yesterday's world is inappropriate; what we must concentrate on is the disruption of former equilibriums throughout the world. [Bernard] Which means? [Baumel] I shall limit myself to three examples. First of all, while the traditional doctrine must be preserved, it was necessary to go beyond the old principle of deterrence, which was born of a bipolar balance of world power. Today, there are a multiplicity of threats against our country, including from Third-World countries beyond the Mediterranean. Such threats could one day be backed by chemical or nuclear weapons. Second, the president said not a word about reform of the national service, about the choice between conscription and a professional army. Nothing was said about the indispensable professionalization of our military system, although it is a necessary step toward a professional army, that is, toward the army of the future. Last, no decision was announced with respect to the major programs that were launched during the Cold War and whose weapons systems will be partly obsolete by the year 2005/2010. To an extent, this jeopardizes new programs.
