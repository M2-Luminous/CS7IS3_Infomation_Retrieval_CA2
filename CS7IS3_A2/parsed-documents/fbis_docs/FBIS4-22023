A Karlsruhe Office press release on Thursday [14 April] says that the vehicles, found on 2 February and 14 March, are registered to Klaus Steinmetz, liaison man of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, whose information led to the bloody antiterrorist operation in Bad Kleinen. Already, on 24 March, the chief federal prosecutor initiated investigations of unknown perpetrators on suspicion of RAF membership and causing a bomb explosion. A passenger car and a motorcycle were discovered. The chief federal prosecutor's office did not reveal where the vehicles were found. Both vehicles have reportedly been used "by a great number of persons" in the past. Technical analysis of the passenger car turned up evidence that might indicate its use for terrorist crimes.
