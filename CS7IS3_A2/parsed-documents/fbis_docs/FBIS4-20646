As a hydrocarbon it dissolves readily in organic solvents, and its processability is excellent. Although the research is still in its preliminary stages, Assistant Professor Komatsu hopes to use the new compound to develop functional materials such as catalysts that control single-electron reactions, or electrical elements. The new organic compound is tetrakis-bicylcoocteno-cyclooctatetraene, whose structure consists of an octagonal cyclic hydrocarbon to which four T-shaped portions are attached. It is capable of accepting and donating four electrons, becoming either an ion with a charge of +2 or an ion with a charge of -2. This is a larger number of electrons than previously known organic compounds could accept and donate, which makes it highly reactive with other substances. The first step in the synthesis is to react a bromide of the T-shaped bicyclooctene with an organic solvent. By removing the bromine while simultaneously causing four molecules to react with each other, an octagonal cyclic hydrocarbon is formed as four bicycloocteno portions join together. The new compound is stable in air at room temperature. Highly reactive free radicals are generated by exposure to visible light, showing that it is an organic catalyst that reacts with other substances. Organic compounds dissolve more easily in organic solvents than do inorganic catalysts. Assistant Professor Komatsu says, "This is still the preliminary stage of research, so the fields of application are not yet clear, but the excellent stabilty and solubility should lead to functional material applications."
