A cost may not be allocated to an award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been assigned to an award as a direct cost.

However, typical examples of indirect costs include general administration and general expenses, such as the salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel administration, maintenance, library expenses, and accounting. ATP shall interpret indirect costs in accordance with 48 CFR part 31 or OMB Circular A&hyph;122, Attachment C. 5.
