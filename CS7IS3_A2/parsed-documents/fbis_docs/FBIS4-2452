Bao was seized just 12 hours after the arrest of another prominent activist in the city, as French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, whose country has a record for championing human rights, arrived in Shanghai. "Eight policemen took him away this morning at 9:10 a.m. (0110 GMT)," Bao's father said by telephone, adding that the police had given no reason for the arrest. "When (Bao) asked them to produce some arrest papers, they simply said they didn't need any," he said. Bao was taken to a local police station, the father said, adding that he hoped his son would be released within 24 hours. The latest detention followed the arrest Friday evening of the secretary general of the Shanghai-based Chinese Human Rights Association, Wang Fucheng. "It looks as if this is the start of a major crackdown on dissidents," said the association's spokesman Yang Zhou, who was himself detained and questioned by police twice last month. Since April 1, three other members of China's pro-democracy and human rights campaign have been detained -- Wei Jingsheng, 43, and Xu Wenli, 49, who came to fame for their activism in the late 1970s and were released last year after long jail terms, and Wei's secretary, Tong Yi. Wei is officially under investigation for purported "new crimes." The ministry of public security and the Beijing police denied Saturday any knowledge of Xu's detention. Yang, also contacted by telephone, said Wang had not yet been released. Bao, 31, who recently sent a letter urging the Chinese government to push Tokyo into paying reparations for atrocities committed during the 1937-45 Sino-Japanese war, had previously been detained March 21 during the visit to Shanghai by Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Wang Fucheng, a 30-year-old entrepreneur, spent three years in jail for "counter-revolutionary" activities during the 1978-79 Democracy Wall Movement. He had previously been held for three days in mid-March during a police sweep of dissidents in Beijing and Shanghai. Balladur, meanwhile, arrived in Shanghai on the third day of a four-day official visit aimed at repairing ties with China that were damaged two years ago when France sold Mirage fighter-bombers to Taiwan, Beijing's rival. China has systematically rounded up dissidents during visits by VIPs, in an apparent attempt to thwart embarrassing contacts. Similar steps to harass or detain activists were taken during visits to China last month by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the Japanese premier.
