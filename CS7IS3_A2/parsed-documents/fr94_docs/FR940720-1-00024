FR940720-1-00024 FR940720-1-00007 In order to oversee access activities properly which provide for the security of the data and system, VBA may, without notice, inspect the accessor's computer systems, review its security procedures, and monitor its access activities. VBA may revoke access privileges in two circumstances. The first is based on applicable confidentiality statutes, e.g., the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. §552a, and 38 U.S.C. §§5701 and 7332. Whenever an individual or organization is no longer entitled to access a particular claimant's records as a matter of law under the applicable confidentiality statutes, VA will terminate that individual's access privileges to that particular claimant's automated claims records. VA may also revoke access privileges based upon failure to comply with the regulations. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has certified that these proposed rules, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the regulations, therefore, are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses requirements of sections 603 and 604. This certification can be made because the regulations facilitate representative access to their claimants' information while imposing little in the way of cost or administrative burden. Further, the rules affect only the small number of entities and individuals which represent claimants in claims before VA. This regulation is subject to review under Executive Order 12866.
