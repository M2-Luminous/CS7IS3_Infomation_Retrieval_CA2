But local Palestinian leaders have ordered no celebrations and they have made it clear that the gesture is not enough to bring the Palestinians back to the peace talks. On this, Mark Weiss reports: [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [break in reception] [Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, broadcast in progress] ...approaching a reluctant conciliatory attitude. I mean Rabin cannot always approach issues by trying to carry out cosmetic changes and by doing too little too late. We are not looking for appearance. We are looking for serious substance, and therefore I think that moves or steps that appear to be steps of appeasement rather than drastic or genuine dealing with serious issues would not achieve results. [Weiss] What specifically do you want Israel to do that is realistic, that could possibly bring the Palestinians back to the talks? ['Ashrawi] I think what is very realistic is to accept an international presence, not by putting limits on what is in the DOP [Declaration of Principles] and saying international civilians are unarmed, but rather by making the international presence of a serious international force that would be able to play the role of a buffer zone to observe and to monitor, to prevent the recurrence of such incidents, and to change the whole atmosphere. I also think that disarming the settlers is not unrealistic at all. It's a genuine requirement which would serve both sides, because they are also challenging the rule of law in Israel. I think beginning the removal of the settlers from the populated areas, particularly in al-Khalil and Qiryat Arba', would also show seriousness of intent and a genuine commitment to deal with these issues. [Weiss] Other Palestinians noted that today's release is only bringing forward the release planned for later this month to mark the end of Ramadan. [end recording] The view from the Likud is that the release of Palestinian prisoners encourages and solicits terrorist activity against Jews. Likud faction chairman Moshe Qatzav accuses the government of surrendering and ingratiating itself in front of Yasir 'Arafat. The Moledet party, claiming the release complicated Israel's security situation, said the government had not learned from the experience of the prisoner exchange with the Ahmad Jibril organization.
