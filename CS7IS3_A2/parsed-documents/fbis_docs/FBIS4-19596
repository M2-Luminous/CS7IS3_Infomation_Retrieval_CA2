Turkey has accumulated a certain amount of internal and external debt, he said, and the interest on these debts is hurting Turkey's public finance. This is not such a strange situation, he said, and the state takes the necessary measures. Demirel went on to say: I insist that the basis of the monetary problem in Turkey today is the citizens' lack of trust in their own money. I call on my people to trust the Turkish lira. As long as you run away from your own currency by buying U.S. dollars or other currencies, you will continue to depreciate your own currency.
