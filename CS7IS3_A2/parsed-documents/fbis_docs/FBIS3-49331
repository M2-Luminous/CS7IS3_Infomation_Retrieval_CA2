Vladimir Nikolic has the details: [Begin Nikolic recording] Apart from the official proposal of the agenda, members of the DS Main Committee were also presented with a proposal by Zoran Djindjic, chairman of the Executive Committee. For the time being, it is certain that the items on the agenda that are undisputable and up for discussion are reports on past elections and the election of DS deputies to the Republican Assembly. One has the impression that no one has anything against holding an extraordinary convention, so one may expect that its date will also be established. What has attracted the public's attention is certainly the proposal by Zoran Djindjic, chairman of the Executive Committee, to hold a vote of confidence in Party Chairman Dragoljub Micunovic, which has confirmed the stories about disagreements and rifts in the DS' top leadership. We have just learned at the DS Information Service that the proposal to hold a vote of confidence in Chairman Micunovic has received the necessary majority of votes from the present members of the Main Committee -- that is, that the somewhat-amended agenda proposed by Djindjic was adopted. We would also like to add that when it was decided to hold the session behind closed doors, correspondents were told that they will be informed of the session's outcome by an announcement or possibly at a news conference.
