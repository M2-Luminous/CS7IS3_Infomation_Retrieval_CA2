V. Kozyrev and Personal Envoy of the RF President, Ambassador for Special Commissions and the Leader of the Russian Mediation Mission for Peaceful Settlement in Nagornyy Karabakh V. N. Kazimirov, 22 November"] [Text] [Kozyrev] What we are talking about is a truly extraordinary incident that will be related in detail by V. N. Kazimirov. Unfortunately this isn't just simply an incident. The impression is created that politics are behind it. I'll be happy if my impression is proven wrong, but this will depend now on swift and determined actions, chiefly by the Armenian leadership. Let me acquaint you with the text of the Statement of the Council of Ministers and Government of the Russian Federation. The statement speaks for itself. I can add that we have already been waiting 2 days for an official explanation from the Armenian side. I discussed this in my first statement right after information on this incident became known. Unfortunately all I've received so far is an incomprehensible paper from Armenian Minister of Foreign Affairs V. A. Papazyan, which I can't accept, and on the basis of which further contact with him is hardly possible. I would like to say that we believe the version of this incident told by the Russian personal envoy of the president, who was directly conducting negotiations with Armenian leaders at that moment. I have to believe my own ears, because I had a telephone conversation with Armenian President L. Ter-Petrosyan, and by the way with Azeri President G. Aliyev as well; moreover this mission was being conducted on the basis of a personal agreement in accordance with instructions from the RF president. One more remark. There has recently been considerable discussion of our position regarding protection of the Russian-language population. I must say firmly that we will closely protect the Russian-language population, and defend its interests and Russian interests, no matter where this happens and no matter in whose presence, even if these are our friends. In this case I'm referring to Armenia. The attitude toward Russian official envoys, Russian servicemen and compatriots on the territory of any state, be it in the near or far frontier, will be the touchstone upon which the sincerity of friendly relations, and of the possibility in general of any good-neighbor relations with any state, will be proven. And transgressions upon these persons will be viewed in the minimum as an unfriendly act, and in the absence of a swift and determined reaction to rectify such a situation the most decisive measures will follow immediately, automatically, as emphasized in the Statement of the RF President. I can assure you that we need not wait long for the most decisive steps to be taken in this case. [Kazimirov] In accordance with A. V. Kozyrev's telephone conversations with the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia and with leaders of Nagornyy Karabakh, a special envoy of the RF president was sent to Baku, Yerevan and Stepanakert to work out specific issues concerning cessation of military activities in this conflict. After a few days in Baku it became necessary to go first to Yerevan and then to Stepanakert. It was arranged on the basis of a suggestion by authorities from the administration of the president of the Armenian Republic that the Armenian-Azeri border would be crossed in the vicinity of the Azeri city of Kazakh. I must emphasize that this point has nothing in common geographically with Nagornyy Karabakh, it is in the northern part of the Armenian-Azeri border, far from Nagornyy Karabakh. Consequently the cast of characters consisted of the Armenian and Azeri sides, plus a Russian mediator. Such was the mutual understanding that was reached. We set off for the city of Kazakh. Unfortunately we arrived late, after dark, and therefore we had to postpone crossing the border to the morning of 20 November. In the meantime the Azeri side made radio contact with the Armenian side, negotiations were conducted, and the place at which our group was to cross the Armenian border was designated. At the very last moment the Armenian side raised objections, which is something that has already become an absurd tradition in the course of the conflict. Each time, coordination of the routes of travel of peacemaking missions--Russia's in this case and that of the SBSYe [not further identified]--has invariably transformed into an absurd contest between the sides as to what routes particular envoys are to travel. But in any case the Armenian side--Yerevan, the administration of the president of the Armenian Republic--was quite well aware of the place to which the Azeris were going to take us. We arrived in this place at 10 o'clock in the morning of 20 November. Azeri Colonel Sadykhov, the regional commandant, implemented precautionary measures, and would not allow us to travel together as a single column, preferring instead that we waited behind a hill at the outskirts of the partially destroyed town while he sent only the lead vehicle forward. The vehicle was gone for 40 minutes, we were worried that something might have happened to it, since it takes no more than 15 minutes to drive there and back. We soon heard shots, isolated ones at first. We later found out that they were firing at the wheels of the Jeep occupied by the Azeri battalion commander and three private soldiers sent ahead with the purpose of reaching agreement with the Armenian side, after which the entire column was to begin moving. The isolated shots were followed by automatic fire, and then a large-caliber weapon went into action. Experienced servicemen determined from the sounds of the shots that the fire was from a Shilka antiaircraft gun and from grenade launchers mounted on an APC. In any case this was intensive, coordinated fire, and not just one or two random shots, as was asserted. It became clear that something happened with this vehicle, because all of the shots were heard in direct proximity. The Azeri soldiers tried to rescue the ones who were in trouble, but their attempts to approach were cut of by fire from the Armenian side. That's the way the incident developed. It seems to me that the latest incident once again demonstrates the entire absurdity, the entire senselessness of this conflict, and it should encourage its fastest possible settlement. It is precisely toward this, toward cessation of fire and military activities, that the Russian mediation mission was working. The participants of the press conference replied to questions from journalists. [CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, USA] Can you talk in a little more detail about the explanations from the Armenian minister of foreign affairs? Why do you call them inadequate? You said that decisive steps would be taken in the immediate future unless an adequate response is forthcoming from the Armenian government. What do you mean by "decisive steps" in this particular case? [A. V. Kozyrev] I wouldn't want to go into the details now. What we're talking about is diplomatic exchange of notes, but in this case it all boils down to an attempt by the Armenian side to accuse, naturally, the other side, as is regularly done in the course of a conflict. Obviously there are times when it's hard to determine exactly who is responsible for a particular incident. I'm reminded in this connection of my own experience when I was in Karabakh last year. Many of my traveling companions--the military and my security service--assert that our helicopter was fired on between Stepanakert and Shusha (at that time Shusha was still in the hands of the Azeri side). But then first of all, it was rather difficult to determine the nature of the fire, because the helicopter wasn't hit, and second, it was impossible to make any conclusions and prove what side was firing, because we were in a zone between the two warring sides. In the latter case--that's what I started with--we have all the grounds for believing the president's personal envoy and ambassador for special commissions, who has lengthy diplomatic experience, including in zones of conflict--not only in Karabakh, where he's already been working for 2 years with the mediation mission, but also in Angola. Such that he encountered nothing new either in the smell of gunpowder or in determining where the border was, and so on. The attempt to send me a note that was clearly based not on a wish to get to the bottom of the affair but on a desire to automatically deflect accusations can't be viewed as anything more than a personal attack. That's first. Second. The note contains the implication that if the appropriate interpretation isn't made, it would be difficult for V. N. Kazimirov to continue his mediation mission. I must say that if I were in the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I'd be worried about something else right now. Not about the choice of Russian diplomats to carry out peacemaking missions, but about a swift reaction to our offers. This brings us to your second question. We're not talking about some kind of threats. I hope there aren't any "super-insightful" reporters around, Western or Russian, who are going to start talking about "neo-imperialism"--I don't wish to let my imagination run away with me, but I can probably say that if something similar happened at the level of a personal envoy of the country's president, and in such blatant form, in the case of an American diplomat in some part of the world for example, I think that we would have already seen an aircraft carrier within not binocular but visual range. This isn't "gunboat diplomacy," it's a policy of normal protection of one's interests and of citizens, supported by all of the rules of international law. I repeat that I'm not going to let my imagination run away with me, but we are talking about the government's statement, which says distinctly and clearly that it "...reserves the right to take the most decisive steps." And because we're naturally assuming that this paper--I can't even call it a note--this paper that Mr. Papazyan sent isn't the opinion of the Armenian president, I think that there's still time. Frankly speaking I'm certain, I simply can't even imagine something different, all the more so because I personally reached agreement with President L. Ter-Petrosyan, whom I know very well, and I haven't the slightest doubt that no one is about to take matters to such an extreme, that what the statement calls for will be done swiftly--an official apology and immediate steps to punish those who are directly responsible for this act. [Interfaks Agency, RF] Will Russia's peacemaking mission in Nagornyy Karabakh be continued? What is Russia's relationship to Ukraine's nuclear drift in the course of ratification of the START-I Treaty by the Ukrainian Parliament? [A. V. Kozyrev] What we need to do now is get to the bottom of this incident. Let me turn your attention once again to the text of the statement, which says that in this case primarily the Armenian leadership, and of course the other participants as well, would have to guarantee the necessary conditions for carrying out the mediation mission. We are not refusing to help. This is all being done incidentally at the request of the supreme leaders of these states, on the basis of agreements between the presidents, both written and oral, in close contact with the SBSYe. I feel that we will of course continue providing aid in the appropriate forms, but I hope that this incident will help our partners to realize certain realities. It may be that the parties to the conflict, including the Armenian side, have already essentially reached the point beyond which direct harm begins to be inflicted not only on the population drawn into these conflicts but also upon the national and state interests of Russia. This can do unpredictable harm both to the interests of Armenia and, let me repeat once again, the interests of Russia. Therefore I hope that the last incident, which is of independent significance, will help people to regain their senses in terms of general military policy in this region as well. As far as Ukraine is concerned, I can say once again what I said before: This has nothing to do with some sort of Russian-Ukrainian dispute. It's a great pity certain SMI [not further identified], both here and in the West, render these problems precisely in this key. What we are talking about is whether the regime of nuclear nonproliferation will persist in Europe and in the world as a whole, or whether it will be brought down. After all, Article 1 of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons makes references precisely to rejection of nuclear weapons or the impossibility of possessing them. Unfortunately the Ukrainian Parliament's announcement made reference to their possession, to the notion that the nuclear warheads are Ukrainian property. Thus what we're essentially talking about is the first announcement in many decades of a direct violation of the regime of nuclear nonproliferation. This has nothing to do with Russian-Ukrainian ties, there's only the one fact. I am personally convinced that Russia is interested, perhaps even more than any other state, in preserving and strengthening the regime of nuclear nonproliferation, inasmuch as it is on the perimeter of our borders that their spread is probable. Understandably, violation of this regime by one state can quite possibly evoke a chain reaction. We already have North Korea, with which complex negotiations are being carried on, and as you know, we are displaying sufficient restraint and calm, but this question naturally continues to trouble us. We are in contact with the North Korean side. Collapse of the regime of nuclear nonproliferation is naturally impermissible to us. I'm certain that this is precisely the key in which the discussion on this question should proceed. As for whether the discussion will involve a possibility or a fait accompli will depend entirely on how Kiev itself interprets the parliament's decision. We know that there are nuances in the approaches, at least judging from press reports, in the approaches of the president and government on one hand and of the Supreme Soviet on the other. All of this requires definite and precise clarification. Otherwise this is a decision that is doubtlessly equivalent to shaking up the entire system of modern international relations. Under the system that has evolved, there have been five nuclear states up until this time. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union and formation of the CIS, documents clearly and distinctly saying that only one nuclear state should remain on the territory of the former USSR were signed at the highest level in Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. In other words five officially existing nuclear powers must remain in the system of international relations. The Ukrainian Parliament's decision essentially says in legal language that there is now a sixth state that is openly and legally a possessor of nuclear weapons. This is a new international situation. [LOS ANGELES TIMES, USA] What national interests is Russia pursuing in Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast? In light of the approaching winter, it would be interesting to learn how Russia plans to change its aid to Armenia. Where can we get any specific information as to what Russia is doing in terms of social, military and other aid to Armenia and Azerbaijan? [A. V. Kozyrev] Russia has a very broad spectrum of interests in Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, beginning with purely humanitarian (in the final analysis, this war is a tragedy) and ending with geostrategic. This region is a zone of special interests and special responsibility to us. We have historical ties with this region, including a long history of various sorts of legal international acts and agreements. Naturally none of this has been cancelled out, all of this still stands. And we of course will work to stop the war in the region. Finally the widening of the conflict that recently occurred. What we are dealing with now is not the territory of Nagornyy Karabakh as it was in the past, but with territory extending far beyond all reasonable limits in the description of Nagornyy Karabakh itself. Matters have gone as far as streams of refugees, and situations creating a possibility in the region, or an excuse--we can call it different things--for drawing other forces into the conflict. You can understand why I'm talking about Russia's national and state interests. I personally saw to it that the corresponding leaders would know that we have our limit, beyond which the mediation mission could grow from persuasion into something else. In any case we can consider no only reinforcing the mission's efforts at persuasion and negotiation, but also other methods. I believe that this should be clear. It is the Russian Federation that has the highest interests there. We highly value the interest shown in this region by the SBSYe, and we are working very actively with other states, but this is a region in which our interests are affected much more directly than the interests of many other states, including due to the presence of a Russian-language population there, our economic ties, and so on. As far as specific information is concerned, I believe you can get it from the Russian Federation State Committee on Economic Cooperation With Member States of the Commonwealth. But if the situation doesn't change, I'm afraid that no specific information will be needed, things will remain at zero.
