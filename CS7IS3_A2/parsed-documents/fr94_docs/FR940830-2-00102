(``California SunCare'') entered into agreements with certain dealers to fix and maintain the resale prices of California SunCare products. California SunCare has agreed, without admitting any violation of the law and without being subject to any monetary penalties, to the entry of a civil Consent Order prohibiting certain pricing practices in the United States, including for a period of five years prohibiting California SunCare from announcing to the public or to any dealer that California SunCare has a resale pricing policy that contains any provision that provides that: (a) California SunCare will sell only to a dealer that prices at or above California SunCare's suggested resale price, and/or (2) California SunCare will terminate any dealer for pricing below California SunCare's suggested resale price. A copy of the Order is enclosed. Should you have any questions concerning this letter, please feel free to contact me. ␣Sincerely, Carla M. Stern, Attorney, Midwest Field Office, United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, Midwest Field Office, Suite 600, 209 South LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60604, Telephone: (312) 353&hyph;7530, Nora M. Manella, United States Attorney, Roger E. West, Assistant United States Attorney, Telephone: (213) 894&hyph;2461. Attorneys for Plaintiff United States of America, Plaintiff, v. California Suncare, Inc., Defendant. Civil Action No. 94&hyph;5522ABC; Competitive Impact Statement. The United States of America, pursuant to Section 2 of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (``APPA''), 15 U.S.C. §16(b), submits this Competitive Impact Statement in connection with the proposed Final Judgment submitted for entry in this civil antitrust proceeding. I Nature And Purpose Of The Proceeding On August 12, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint under Section 4 of the Sherman Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. §4, alleging that the defendant California SunCare, Inc. (``California SunCare'') engaged in a combination and conspiracy, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §1, to fix the price of indoor tanning products sold by California SunCare to dealers throughout the United States. The complaint alleges that, in furtherance of this conspiracy, California SunCare: (a) established and communicated to dealers a minimum resale price for indoor tanning products from California SunCare; and (b) obtained agreements from dealers to maintain the minimum price as a condition of receiving and continuing to receive indoor tanning products from California SunCare. The complaint also alleges that as a result of the combination and conspiracy, prices of indoor tanning products have been fixed and maintained, and competition in sales of indoor tanning products has been restrained. The complaint alleges that the combination and conspiracy is illegal, and seeks to enjoin California SunCare from continuing or renewing the alleged combination or conspiracy and from engaging in any combination or conspiracy or adopting any practice or plan having a similar purpose or effect. The United States and California SunCare have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance with the APPA, unless the United States withdraws its consent. The Court's entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate the action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction over the matter for possible further proceedings to construe, modify or enforce the Judgment, or to punish violations of any of its provisions. II Description Of Practices Giving Rise To The Alleged Violation Of The Antitrust Laws California SunCare, a California corporation, is a leading seller of indoor tanning products in the United States. Indoor tanning products sold by California SunCare are manufactured in California by California SunCare. California SunCare sells indoor tanning products to dealers which sell them to indoor tanning salons, which in turn sell them to consumers. Each year, California SunCare publishes a resale price schedule stating the price at which California SunCare believes its products should be resold by dealers to salons. During the period from November 1992 through April 1994, California SunCare confronted several dealers who were selling California SunCare products at a discount. The discounts included new customer discounts, discounts for trade association members, and free product after a certain number of bonus points had been earned on previous purchases. California SunCare obtained agreements from these dealers to maintain California SunCare's announced resale prices on indoor tanning products. In April, 1994, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice began an investigation into California SunCare's pricing policy.
