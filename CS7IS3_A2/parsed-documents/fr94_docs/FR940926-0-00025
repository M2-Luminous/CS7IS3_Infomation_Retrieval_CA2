FR940926-0-00025 FR940926-0-00008 40 CFR Part 112 [SW H&hyph;FRL&hyph;5078&hyph;7] RIN 2050&hyph;AD 30 Oil Pollution Prevention; Non-Transportation-Related Onshore Facilities; Correction AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule; corrections. SUMMARY: EPA is making technical corrections to errors in the technical appendices to the final rule for facility response plans required by the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, which appeared in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34070). EFFECTIVE DATE: August 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bobbie Lively-Diebold, Oil Pollution Response and Abatement Branch, Emergency Response Division (5202G), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460 at 703&hyph;356&hyph;8774; the ERNS/SPCC Information line at 202&hyph;260&hyph;2342; or the RCRA/Superfund Hotline at 800&hyph;424&hyph;9346 (in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, 703&hyph;412&hyph;9810). The Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD) Hotline number is 800&hyph;553&hyph;7672 (in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, 703&hyph;412&hyph;3323). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34070) revising the Oil Pollution Prevention regulation, 40 CFR part 112, originally promulgated under the Clean Water Act. The revision incorporates new requirements added by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq., that direct facility owners and operators to prepare plans for responding to a worst case discharge of oil and to a substantial threat of such a discharge. Need for Correction As published, the final rule contained a number of minor technical errors that may prove to be misleading and are in need of clarification. The reasons for these technical changes (including clarifying section references and correcting minor grammatical errors) are, for the most part, self-evident. None of these changes is intended to effect substantive requirements; they only correct inadvertent errors in the July 1, 1994 final rule and ensure consistency within the Appendices to the final rule, and between them and the regulatory text. Corrections 7 and 8, while also technical and non-substantive in nature, warrant a brief discussion. To avoid confusion, corrections 7 and 8 are made to clarify that the Emergency Notification Phone List and Spill Response Notification Form are each separate parts of Section 1.3.1 of the overall response plan. Thus, items 2 and 3 of Section 1.1 each call for a partial inclusion of Section 1.3.1 (item 2 calls for the Emergency Notification Phone List and item 3 calls for the Spill Response Notification Form). Together, items 2 and 3 call for the complete Section 1.3.1. As published, the final rule incorrectly stated that items 2 and 3 each called for the complete Section 1.3.1. This is being corrected to state that each calls for only part of Section 1.3.1. In addition, an inaccuracy in the summary section of the preamble to the final rule needs to be noted. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulates non -transportation-related facilities under sections 311(j)(1)(C) and 311(j)(5) of the CWA as delegated by Executive Order 12777. The preamble language in one instance incorrectly and inadvertently indicated that the Oil Pollution Prevention regulation applied to transportation-related facilities. Correction of Publication PART 112_[CORRECTED] Accordingly, the final rule is corrected as follows: 1. On page 34110, in the third column, in the first paragraph under section A.2.3, in line 7, ``A2(b)'' is corrected to read ``A.2.2''. 2. On page 34111, in the first column, in the first paragraph under section B.2.3, in line 9, ``B2(b)'' is corrected to read ``B.2.2''. 3. On page 34112, in the first column, in section 1.2.8, the text which reads ``Other definitions are included in ยง112.2, section 1.2 of Appendices C and E, and section 3.0 of Appendix F'' is corrected to read ``Other definitions are included in ยง112.2 and section 1.1 of Appendix C''. 4. On page 34112, in the third column, in section 4.3, in line 9, the text which reads ``section 1.2'' is corrected to read ``section 1.1''. 5. On page 34114, in the third column, in section 7.3, in line 4, the text which reads ``for Groups 1'' is corrected to read ``for Group 1''. 6. On page 34115, in the first column, in section 7.4, in line 4, the text which reads ``for a facility'' is deleted. 7. On page 34124, in the first column, in section 1.1, in item 2, the word ``complete'' is corrected to read ``partial''. 8. On page 34124, in the first column, in section 1.1, in item 3, the word ``complete'' is corrected to read ``partial''. 9. On page 34135, in the second column, in the heading for section 2.1, the text which reads ``Page One_General Information'' is corrected to read ``General Information''.
