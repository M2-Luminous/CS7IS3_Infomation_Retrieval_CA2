Section 86.098&hyph;8 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.096&hyph;8. Where a paragraph in §86.096&hyph;8 is identical and applicable to §86.098&hyph;8, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;8.'' (a) through (b)(5) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;8. (b)(6) Vehicles certified to the refueling standards set forth in paragraph (d) of this section are not required to demonstrate compliance with the fuel dispensing spitback standards contained in §86.096&hyph;8 (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(iii): Provided , that they meet the requirements of §86.098&hyph;28(f). (c) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;8. (d) Refueling emissions from 1998 and later model year gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle and petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle light-duty vehicles shall not exceed the following standards. The standards apply equally to certification and in-use vehicles. (1) Standards _(i) Hydrocarbons (for gasoline-fueled Otto-cycle and petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles) . 0.20 gram per gallon (0.053 gram per liter) of fuel dispensed. (ii) Organic material hydrocarbon equivalent (for methanol-fueled vehicles) . 0.20 gram per gallon (0.053 gram per liter) of fuel dispensed. (2)(i) The standards set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section refer to a sample of refueling emissions collected under the conditions set forth in subpart B of this part and measured in accordance with those procedures. (ii) For vehicles powered by petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle engines, the provisions set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be waived: Provided , that the manufacturer complies with the provisions of §86.098&hyph;28(g). (3)(i) A minimum of the percentage shown in Table A98&hyph;08 of a manufacturer's sales of the applicable model year's gasoline- and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle and petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle light-duty vehicles shall be tested under the procedures in subpart B of this part indicated for 1998 and later model years, and shall not exceed the standards described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Vehicles certified in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, as determined by the provisions of §86.098&hyph;28(g), shall not be counted in the calculation of the percentage of compliance. Table A98&hyph;08._ Implementation Schedule for Light-Duty Vehicle Refueling Emission Testing 1Model year 1Sales percentage 1998 40 1999 80 2000 and subsequent 100 (ii) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in §86.094&hyph;14(b) (1) and (2), are exempt from the implementation schedule of Table A98&hyph;08 of this section for model years 1998 and 1999. For small volume manufacturers, the standards of paragraph (d) of this section, and the associated test procedures, shall not apply until model year 2000, when 100 percent compliance with the standards of this section is required. This exemption does not apply to small volume engine families as defined in §86.094&hyph;14(b)(5). (e) through (f) [Reserved] (g) through (k) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;8.
