It is the third such selection and is significant as this year is the International Year of the Family. According to Zhang Lianzhen, a member of the secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF), it is aimed at promoting the development of family culture and guiding people to pursue a civilized, healthy and scientific life style. "The 30 families are excellent representatives of the more than 200 million families in China," Zhang said. They represent a happy family atmosphere and colorful family life. All the family members are actively taking part in China's economic construction and making contributions to society, said Zhang. Among the 30 families, ten will be awarded gold and silver prizes through a public ballot and specialists' appraisal, Zhang said. The selection process was jointly organized by the ACWF, China Central Television, four magazines and a newspaper specialising in women and the family, and an enterprise in Sichuan Province.
