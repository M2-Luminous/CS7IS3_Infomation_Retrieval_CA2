His potential allies responded, "We will go the other way." [Goldenberg] This is a very interesting situation. I understand that the Russian media somewhat specifically explain the results of the elections in their country, and openly hesitate to speak of the victory of Yeltsin's opponents. About 70 percent of the local press is subordinated to the president and the government. But what prevents the Ukrainian press from doing this? No publication has asked the Liberal-Democratic Party of Ukraine [LDPU] to comment on this issue. KIEVSKIYE NOVOSTI is a pleasant exception. I will repeat: The situation is paradoxical. Everybody comments on the victory of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], except LDPU. And we have a lot to speak about. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and his people were very interested in Ukraine at one time, which is completely understandable. They invited the Ukrainian liberals and sought to establish solid ties. We immediately dissociated ourselves from them. This is why: Zhirinovskiy's party was not born in a vacuum. A few people remember its constituent congress. What advertising can do! I am absolutely convinced that it is an offspring of the USSR's special services and those who controlled their activities... It is known that an entire program for discrediting liberalism was once worked out. Gorbachev's ideas and his famous slogan about socialism with a human face were supposed to be more attractive for the people. Then suddenly, Vladimir Volfovich appears on the political horizon. "There is such a party!" Simultaneously with discrediting the idea, they received an argument with opponents of the multiparty system. It is not enough for you to have one party? You will get one more... There has been no liberal party in Russia after all. LDPR cannot be considered one. Zhirinovskiy's adherents, politely speaking, have nothing to do with democracy or liberalism. In Ukraine, the situation is different. Our position is in many aspects upheld by the Constitutional Democratic Party and the Party of Free Peasantry. Together, we form the New Ukraine union. Our ideas are close to the Labor Congress of Ukraine and...the Party of Beer Lovers. Do not laugh, there is such a party. There is also the Liberal Party of Ukraine. There is nothing like that in Russia. LDPR is only a name, nothing more. [Vezhnin] Nevertheless, in my opinion, Zhirinovskiy conducted the electoral campaign brilliantly. [Goldenberg] I would not overestimate the success of Zhirinovskiy. Initial assessments show that representatives of the red-browns are in the minority in the Russian parliament. The voting was not only on party lists. Nevertheless, I agree that the success of Zhirinovskiy and [Russian communist leader] Zyuganov should be seriously taken into consideration. There are no LDPR structures in Ukraine today. Yet, another threat exists. The term "zhyrynovshchyna" more and more often can be heard in politicians' lexicon. The Ukrainian legislature is not an exception. As soon as a deputy begins to criticize the party of power, he is instantly tagged: "This is zhyrynovshchyna!" I believe that this card will be actively played before the elections... There is appropriate ground in Ukraine for those who would like to repeat Zhirinovskiy's success. However, I believe that extremist forces will not prevail. [Vezhnin] No matter if somebody likes this or not, Vladimir Volfovich has ridden into the Russian legislature on a white horse. What chances will the Ukrainian liberals have in the upcoming elections? [Goldenberg] Taking into account current realities, I believe that if 35 percent of democrats enter the new legislature it will not be a bad result. We hope that representatives of LDPU will be part of that 35 percent. [Vezhnin] Do you not think that today's democrats, or more precisely, people who have proclaimed themselves as such, are losing their chances day by day? Let us be frank: Many of them rode into the Supreme Council on the tide of caveman anticommunism, inspiring us, common mortals, for the battle against privileges of the party nomenclature... Today, those democrats enjoy privileges, about which their predecessors could not even dream during the 70 years of communism, and are quite pliable in the hands of the old and new nomenclature. Are there any guarantees that the total disappointment with democrats will not lead another Zhirinovskiy to the political Olympus? [Goldenberg] Do you claim that democratic deputies have been bought? This is very sad, of course. It is a pity that this is possible. The explanation is very simple -- this is due to our poverty. However, I would like to say something else. The people cannot forgive the deputies corps their cars bought at dumping prices, luxury apartments, and all-mighty privileges... But, nobody has ever admitted that not only certain deputies but also parties have sinned. Analyze activities of our parties over the last two or three years. Read their various statements. Today, they criticize the president; tomorrow they will praise him for what he did yesterday. The people do not have to believe those who will deceive their expectations tomorrow. [Vezhnin] If it is not a secret, who does LDPU believe should become president? [Goldenberg] I will be frank. We would like [former Deputy Prime Minister] Volodymyr Lanovyy to become president of Ukraine. He is a man, to whom, we believe, there is no alternative in Ukraine today. [Vezhnin] You must agree, that this sounds somewhat bizarre. Your party belongs to the New Ukraine union, whose leader is [former Supreme Council Speaker] Volodymyr Hrynyov. His latest statement on establishing the Interregional Reform Block with [former Prime Minister] Leonid Kuchma gives the former speaker very good chances. Taking into account the fact that Kuchma has recently been elected chairman of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, meaning that he has received unanimous support of this significant force, this team looks quite promising. Isn't it more logical to bet on a leader? [Goldenberg] The Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc undoubtedly has a great chance, and it would be naive to deny this. Still, we are not going to bet on it. We have never considered the former prime minister an advocate of market reforms, and we do not approve of what has recently taken place. This is a mistake. I am talking about Hrynyov's position. The New Ukraine is on the verge of collapse today. This is sad and bitter, but real. Hrynyov's alliance with recent supporters of the nomenclature is a block of individuals, not parties. By the way, our party successfully cooperates with Vladimir Popov [not further identified] on establishing his electoral bloc. We have been joined by the Union of Private Entrepreneurs, other serious structures, and, of course, the Fund for Restoring Ukraine's Economy. [Vezhnin] Suppose you have managed to achieve your goals. Who could head the Cabinet of Ministers, given the new president? [Goldenberg] It is possible that the president himself. He is a determined supporter of market reforms in Ukraine. This would undoubtedly be the most optimal variant.
