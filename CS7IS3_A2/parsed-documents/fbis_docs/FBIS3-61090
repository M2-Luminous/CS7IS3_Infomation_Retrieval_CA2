I would like to ask the following question in terms of this: what kinds of measures, what kinds of questions are involved with providing services to the president and the cabinet of ministers? [Abiqayev] It is not necessary, in order to answer that question, to list the duties of the president as formulated in the primary law of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Constitution, and the duties of the cabinet of ministers as established in special constitutional law, or go into detail about each duty. We must, however, understand the fact that the president is the head of state, that he manages the executive authority of the republic as a unified system, and that the cabinet of ministers decides questions of government. Thus, these two institutions of the republic leadership are involved with all sectors of state life. You can understand, in terms of this, the broad scope of the work of the apparate and where the emphasis lies. When the institution of the presidency was first established in Kazakhstan, it had its own apparate as did the Kenges of Ministers. When the two were unified, we investigated how these things were in other countries. However, we strove to find our own way. Whereas there were previously more than 500 officials in the two apparatees, now there are 380. It is possible that staffing will decrease still more. However, it is now increasing. That is the first thing. Second, we have specified exactly what each person and each part of the apparate is concerned with: what is being done by ministries and committees, what the central apparate is concerned about, what must be turned over to oblast governments. A sovereign and independent Kazakhstan has become a part of a world public. We must take in hand measures and very important reforms intended to get our country out of a very deep crisis. A second era of privatization, as the basis of a market economy, and of the ending of state ownership, has begun. However, the law on privatization is still being discussed with some production establishments in the United States with its history of more than two hundred years. Moreover, we made some mistakes when we first pushed privatization forward. We can say that this was the case in regard to the privatization of residential housing. However, we are pressing forward resolutely. We must understand our responsibility as an independent country to enter upon the road of world development. However, starting from the question of which countries we should go to first in our international relations and what policy we should maintain in regard to what nation, and how we must receive honored foreign guests, it is all virgin territory for us. We have entered into economic relations with some of the most developed nations in the world. We have established joint industries to jointly master our riches. One aspect of the proper control over such complex operations with their many problems is through the apparate. Let me state one thing: as the president has said about this, the divisions of the apparate do not replace ministries and state committees. The apparate must provide the services of the president's office and cabinet of ministers, which enjoys the entire executive authority, in terms of organization and of cadres, in terms of creating favorable conditions for providing analysis on specific circumstances and the results of public opinion surveys on some given issue, and even for the fullest and most effective operations of the president's office and of the government. The measures to be carried out to achieve this, and the issues are extremely numerous and, other than those connected with daily services, must be determined separately with respect to every event or circumstance. [Smayyl] Those organizational measures you mentioned in passing require that the apparate have powers at a level set by the leadership and that you have influence upon the appropriate ministers and chairs of committees. The chief of the president's apparate in the United States is in many areas considered second to the president... [Abiqayev] In my view, it is appropriate to evaluate any given service in terms of how its level of power benefits the people or common concerns to a superior degree. In these terms, we must not understand involvement with organizational measures as diminishing one's stature. However, if we try to make comparisons with conditions in the United States, I think that this does not reflect the real state of affairs. I do not look at my office in terms of exerting authority over another or in terms of rule. I was twice an assistant to President Nazarbayev when he was chairman of the Council of Ministers and later first secretary of the Republic of Kazakhstan Communist Party. When he became president, I was entrusted with taking charge of the apparate. Fate has determined that we have to live and work in difficult and interesting times. If I am able to guarantee the proper functioning of the presidential command, I think that I will have fulfilled the responsibility assigned me by the times. Under such circumstances, the deciding issue should not be how high my position is in the presidential command structure. [Smayyl] The fact that the time of the president and others holding high governmental posts is scrutinized and divided by the minute is something which the people have hitherto been unwilling to believe. Thereby, is it possible that the president is unable to do what he wants to do because of the influence of a strict daily regime? In general, how is the work day of the president planned? [Abiqayev] The work schedule of the president is in truth extremely tight. However, this is not to say that the president is allowed no time for creative efforts, to evaluate some circumstances or the other, or to carry out his thoughts and ideas. This fact is shown clearly by how N. Nazarbayev's work schedule is planned. The president's Secretariat prepares suggestions for a normal month assigned for every week and every day. At this time, various long-term policies and analytical assumptions, the circumstances of the period, whatever measures there are from various authorities and organizations, social-political organizations within them, of high officials at various levels or of citizens in the ranks, and what requests will be made for meetings, are borne in mind and carefully researched. In any case, the scope of the president's heavy work load is determined in connection with activities in the international sector and the resolution of socioeconomic problems in Kazakhstan. In addition, planned as part of monthly work schedules are conferences with the leaders of the republic, receiving citizens and ministers, trips within Kazakhstan, and meetings with various specialized workers. For the president's creative work, time is allotted likewise for him to work with documents and acquaint himself with newspapers and magazines and reviews of the press. The draft of the work plan is reported to the president and it is altered and expanded if he sees the need. Now as for your question of why the president's time is analyzed to the minute, I think that it is necessary for him to be able to accomplish the business planned for each day by organizing carefully activities of this sort. This teaches people to establish a work regime and to learn how to use time well. It should be mentioned in passing that if people brought questions before the president which should be resolved elsewhere, at other levels, then at times even vital questions of state would be delayed. At the same time, one must not think that the president has become entangled in his strict daily regime. On occasion, if Nursultan Abishuly thinks that emphasis should be placed on questions raised by those persons he receives and the time allotted is too short, it often happens that the president will remain at work until 1:00 in the morning to resolve some question which has come up in this way. In fact, at a time like the present, when unresolved problems and questions are overflowing, we have gotten used to having the president work on Saturday and sometimes on Sunday. [Smayyl] It is well known that there are a great many people sending the president letters and asking to see him. Specifically, what kinds of letters reach the hands of Nursultan Abishuly? What kinds of persons does he receive with what kinds of problems? Who determines this? [Abiqayev] Indeed, what you say is true. The number of requests, appeals, and suggestions coming to the head of state and the number of persons asking to see him are not decreasing. During the past period of the present year, more than 2,000 letters arrived each month and nearly 500 citizens were received each month at the apparate. One must add to this the letters received by the president when he is on a trip and those citizens he receives in local areas. We get a lot of letters from CIS countries and from abroad. Nearly half of the president's mail are letters expressing support for his policies. There are many letters requesting help. Most of them are solved at the oblast level. However, we seem to think that only the president call solve all the problems of Kazakhstan. As for letters read personally by Nursultan Abishuly and those persons received by him personally, the situation is as follows: the Apparate Division for Letters and Receiving Citizens provides to the president a summary of the letters arriving each month. The summary includes a discussion of the geography of the requests and appeals, of questions raised, and of the social circumstances of those writing the letters. At the same time, classifications are made of suggestions and thoughts regarding major problems, and letters directed at the development of our state and people. Direct assignments are given to the president, vice-president, prime minister, their deputies, oblast governors, and ministers, and to other high officials in terms of the classified letters and there is follow-up to make sure that the assignments are fulfilled. Likewise, we analyze what those people wanting access wish to say and we make suggestions to the president. The head of state himself selects the people he wants to see and directly assigns other persons to be received by the appropriate official. [Smayyl] A short time ago, United States Ambassador Courtney was received by Nursultan Abishuly and gave him a letter from the American President. Do you know what that letter was about? In general, when heads of state write letters to one another, what kinds of things are they about? [Abiqayev] At first letters from foreign heads-of-state to the president of Kazakhstan had a purely official character. They were, it would seem, congratulations in connection with some special occasion or letters sent after some particular event. The president provided human warmth to this official style. He inquired about families, about kin, and freed the letters of stuffiness. Not long after such qualities began to be felt from the answering letters. We sent a letter to United States President Bill Clinton in connection with the establishment of an Aral fund and the selection of Nursultan Abishuly as Kazakhstan president. The United States chief of state made known his warm feelings in his letter to the president of Kazakhstan, supported the establishment of the Aral Fund, and said that he had given the appropriate orders. Likewise, he expressed his approval of the intention of Kazakhstan to become a country without nuclear arms. Our relations with the United States have continued to develop and relations at the industrial level have proven successful. However, governmental authorities have failed to give attention to Kazakhstan at the required level. We spoke about this to Ambassador Courtney. The words had their effect. Recently United States Special Ambassador Strobe Talbott, presented the greetings of President Clinton, and said that the United States Government would devote special attention to the government of Kazakhstan. There was thus an agreement to make preparations for bilateral discussions at the ministry and for a meeting of the two heads-of-state. In general, when we talk of writing letters or of communication, it is in regard to pursuing a given question. If there is agreement of views, talks are carried out at the foreign minister level and specific steps are taken for a meeting of the heads of state. [Smayyl] It is well known that both the president and the prime minister are concerned with questions in all sectors of life and are making decisions fateful and important for the country. As a person who has been there when so many questions have been decided at the state level in an independent Kazakhstan, tell us: does the president come to fundamental decisions in advance or does he seem to make decisions taking the suggestions and thoughts offered him into consideration? Are the suggestions and thoughts offered by the presidential staff adequate from you point of view? Can you recall a case where the president was indecisive and unable to come to a specific decision? [Abiqayev] Before I fail to answer your question let me look in detail at a previous question. "Do the suggestions and thoughts of the president's staff satisfy you? The question is not the value of the suggestions and thoughts. It should be in terms of whether or not they satisfy the president. Becoming an independent country and achieving this in a very difficult time places many, many questions before us. Under such circumstances, we must recognize that expression of the most complex suggestions and ideas from the president has a role in the formation of a new society in Kazakhstan. But as to the specific question, I cannot say that all the suggestions and thoughts expressed equally satisfy the president... [Smayyl] Nurtay Abiqayuly, let us try to get one thing clear. Are there those on the president's staff who argue with him? To whom among those surrounding him does the president listen? What does he think of his opponents? [Abiqayev] The words of opponents should not be directed so much at argument or at debate. If intelligent thoughts, well-conceived ideas are expressed, President Nazarbayev is ready to exchange views with them, to argue about those areas where there is disagreement, and to support his own policies. He strives to convince his opponents that he is right, to talk people into accepting his views, and to make them his supporters. If during a discussion he realizes that his ideas are wrong, he stops supporting them. There has been repeated criticism that we do not know how to take the views of others into consideration and that we are unable to work with opponents. Courage is needed to argue with the president and, on occasion, to come out against him. If one is opposed to him, one will have to justify one's ideas in detail. However, Nazarbayev respects the views of Minister of Economics Beysenbay Iztilewov on theoretical questions. He takes into consideration the views of such persons as Minister of Finance Yerkeshbay Derbisov, First Deputy Prime Minister Dawlet Sembayev, Minister of Agriculture Baltash Turysnbayev, Qwanysh Sultanov on spiritual matters, and Abish Kekilbayev. I suspect that the people know that the president takes counsel with the other high officials of the republic: with the chairman of the Supreme Kenges, with the vice-president, with the prime minister, and carries out the appropriate work. May God preserve us from becoming like some other countries where one leader is in competition with the other; where one comes out against what the other has said. The people are harmed by this. If the leading officials of the state know how to achieve concord, understanding, necessarily mutual respect, disagreeing only when necessary, then conditions will be created for the intelligent resolution of problems, whatever they are. In any case, we must make it a virtue that national character comes first and foremost from the head of state. From what has been said above one should not conclude that the president pays no attention to others on his staff. Nazarbayev listens readily to good ideas whatever their source. To finish this question, let me return to your original question about presidential decisions. We have said that ideas about very important questions connected with the present era of transition, about the process of our country's consolidation, and about the market economy continue to come from the president. That is to say, the president expresses key ideas and strategies for solutions. Documents connected with very complex questions are prepared and he reviews them in detail. They are also discussed at meetings where the president is present or at sessions of the cabinet of ministers. In this way documents are signed. At present drafts of documents are prepared by those suggesting them. They are discussed in detail and ways of achieving them discussed. Signatures are collected starting with the lowest officials up to the heads of government. Only them do I place the document before the president. President Nazarbayev entrusts me with seeing to it that everything is in order and that the document is not contrary to existing law. The Kazakhs have the expression "expect a person not to have done a lot of things but to have experienced a lot of things." The president's rich life time experience, the fact that he is thoroughly involved with the broad masses, his amazing quickness of thought, and abundant knowledge make it possible for him to express well-based, intelligent thoughts with regard to whatever the question. He is altogether divorced from any conceit. He always offers new ideas that are proper. Whatever the question, it is clear that President Nazarbayev has his own solution. However, he does not choose to force his decisions on anyone. In my view, first, it would seem as if he is testing himself and whether or not his thoughts are founded on those of the masses or not. Second, it would seem as if others are being subjected to a presidential test in such cases. [Smayyl] As you know, there was a certain chilliness among the people towards the words spoken by the president at the time of his trip to the United States to the effect that: "we are still learning how to do things." There was incomprehension about why he was late in expressing his views regarding the August 1991 Moscow revolution, at the time of the referendum in Russian following it, and at the economic solidarity of the "Slavic three..." [Abiqayev] Questions about this were at one time also asked of the president and he answered them completely. In my view, we must understand the need for the policy adopted by Kazakhstan in connection with events taking place in Russia to be different than that of some other CIS country. Second, what would we be doing becoming involved in the internal affairs of Russia, an independent country? Our relations with our neighbor to the north are very good. The heads of the two nations cooperate in many questions. Some credulous souls have said that the president was frightened in connection with the situations mentioned above and wish to blame him by saying that he did not know what to do. I speak as someone who knows the president well: Nazarbayev's personal resolution impresses everyone whoever they are, but must not the chief of a great nation be concerned with the mood of the time? For that reason, I think that the policy maintained by the chief of our country was the very best policy. However, which of the new ideas expressed in his speech in the United States were wrong? If you think it over, all of us, beginning with President Nazarbayev, are still learning. This being the case, is it not a good thing to learn from a country with a history of more than 200 years. [Smayyl] Nurtay, in the division of function you discussed above, you said that the apparate was concerned with investigation of the cadre policy of the leadership, with investigation of state officials and cadres appointed by the government, and with making nominations. How do you understand that aspect of your duties? [Abiqayev] The cadre question is something very complicated and serious. Whether work gets done or not is, in my view, connected with what kinds of cadres are managing what sector. That is to say, because Saghat Tugelbayev, recently appointed governor of Atyraw Oblast, is an energetic leader, an oblast which has for many years seen no benefit whatever from the oil it produces, is now showing that it is altogether possible to renew the Atyraw area through that wealth. During last August and September, when the president was in various oblasts of the republic, he returned in a particularly good mood from his Atyraw trip. There are many good cadres among rayon governors. When the government of Almaty Oblast carried out a measure connected with privatization in Talghar Rayon, the president was satisfied with what the governor of the rayon, Alikhan Toybayev, did. Another example is the process of privatization which makes special demands on cadres. If there is someone who does particularly well in this area, it is the chairman of the state committee, the deputy prime minister. Zhanibek Keribzhanov, who manages this authority, understands production and financial questions extremely well. However, the president has himself contributed a great deal to the privatization question. Many ideas have been expressed by Nazarbayev himself. Is not the question a matter of continuing to hone and carry out those thoughts in terms of its scope and of every circumstance? At present individuals have come to the apparate who are sharp, who are adequately informed about economic questions, political conditions, and management techniques, and who, above all, actively support and actively carry out the policies of the president and of the government. Their average age is around 44. [Smayyl] Formerly there was a well-known, single system for educating, training, choosing, and placing cadres. Most cadres were selected from the Komsomol, or from various industries. What is the situation now. Representatives of many nationalities live in Kazakhstan along with the Kazakh people. Is not the continuation of the division of the Kazakhs into hordes creating difficulties in developing a cadre policy? Speak as forthrightly as possible. What are the guiding principles in this area? [Abiqayev] You are right, there was previously a carefully defined system in cadre policy. This policy certainly had its disadvantages and advantages. Bearing in mind present circumstances and the demands of democracy, we have taken in hand the creation of a new system for choosing cadres. This new policy takes fully into consideration the responsibility borne by cadres and social circumstances. We are in the process of looking into the cadre question from the lowest level to the very highest levels of the president's staff, each according to his functions. It should be said that at the present time of transition to a market economy the president is not happy with the work of some oblast governors and some ministers. In this connection we are looking at young cadres known for their competence in industry and in commercial organizations. The fact that there are representatives of many ethnic groups living with the Kazakhs is not, as you suggested, making cadre policy more difficult. The question is one of which factor one chooses to emphasize. If all residents of the republic think of themselves primarily as Kazakhstani, who should be concerned about what nationality, what place, what parents someone comes from. The primary measure must be a person's competence, knowledge, skill, and justice. Thereby there should be no concern about percentages as in past years. [Smayyl] Since you have spoken about those years, let me ask a connected question. During the days of the December Incident, Abiqayev, first secretary of the Frunze Rayon Party Committee, was opposed to arming the peoples' militia with wooden clubs and cleavers and the word quickly spread that: "I will not go against my own people." However, the person who was then first secretary of Oktyabyr Rayon became a secretary of the Central Committee for producing the cleavers... [Abiqayev] Alas, he heaped up such iron weapons in front of our rayon party headquarters.. [Smayyl] Tell us, did those words have an influence upon your subsequent fate? [Abiqayev] When I spoke those words, I was not thinking that I was creating some historical heroism. When various [i.e., different] instructions began to come down from various places, those words came first to the tip of my tongue. Subsequently, they have had no influence at all upon my life or my career. [Smayyl] Some have said that your father was the neighbor to the president's father... [Abiqayev] Lots of people want to be the president's family, friend, or, if all else fails, neighbor. If they are not, they pretend that they are and begin to envy. There is nothing special about our fathers being neighbors. I was born in another village. However, there are those who speak sarcastically in this way about the fact that I, like President Nazarbayev, one of the old-time people, am the son of a herdsman. The "preservation among the Kazakhs of division into hordes," as you worded it, cannot be said to be a factor having a decisive influence upon cadre policy. Most of those making a lot of noise about this or that horde or clan have limited need for horde or clan interests. They are calling up the souls of their ancestors, and, exhibiting a false shame, are striving for power and hiding behind the shadows of figures with influence on the people. They are looking out for their own interests. All the talk about clan with regard to chief officials is, in any case, because of that. To go on repeating such talk after the great meeting recently at Ordabasy is tedious. Let me repeat again: the primary measure of what one accomplishes is one's humanity. [Smayyl] How are nominations for cadres to be appointed to high office made? At least, there must be someone who first mentions a certain person. But who are these people? [Abiqayev] There must be an investigation. Ideas are collected on what is being done in each sector. If a position becomes available, as you know, various kinds of letters are received and various people make various suggestions. However, according to the established order, the following persons make the first suggestions: first, the president and the other leaders of the republic; second, there is a division in the apparate concerned with the oblasts; third there is a division carrying out cadre policy; fourth, there are the deputies of the prime minister in every sector; fifth, there are the committees of the Supreme Kenges; sixth, you can add me to their ranks. Such suggestions are made by officials of the apparate too. Since they are in contact with cadres on a daily basis, there are many occasions when their evaluations, thoughts, and viewpoints are altogether different. [Smayyl] Some feel that, since they come in contact on a daily basis and work closely with leading officials, they themselves are really in control of things. What do you think should officials in the apparate be like? [Abiqayev] We have noted that there is a system for selecting cadres. If any one becomes arrogant, or mercenary, if they attempt to make personal gain from their work in the apparate, we have little to do with them. It seems that at present some build up their own machine when they enter the apparate and when they go to the oblast bring people along with them. We cannot be in agreement with officials who fail to understand the proverb: "if you are great, be small." Understanding that every person has his own character, and respect for all is a quality absolutely needed for apparate officials. This question, in terms of the apparate managed by you which provides services for the president and the government, must be the primary question for you at any time. Do these special characteristics of your office have an influence on your personal life? [Abiqayev] At a difficult time such as the present, the fate of the nation and of the land of our people has been entrusted to the hands of Nazarbayev. I know that my presence on the president's staff under such circumstances is a responsibility assigned me by fate. However, I and my family know well what this responsibility demands. Since the reins are held in the hands of the president for the entire people, we must all assist him in carrying out all his thoughts and plans. Only then will our nation pass quickly from the time of consolidation and, entering upon the path of development, grow to maturity. However, if everything that is Kazakhstan is able to stand on its own two feet, it will be clearly visible from every corner of the world.
