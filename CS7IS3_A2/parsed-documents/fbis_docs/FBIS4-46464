Valeriy Kovalev under "National Armies: View of an Observer" rubric: "Who Is Marching Under the White-Red-White Banner?"] [Text] Two years ago, in March 1992, the Supreme Soviet of Belarus passed a resolution on the preservation of the Republic Armed Forces. And as early as May, they organized a Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus, which began to implement this resolution. In contrast to some other republics of the former Union, Belarus did not have to begin to build a national army from scratch. It inherited from the Armed Forces of the USSR a powerful force grouping numbering about 170,000 men and equipped with the most up-to-date combat equipment and armament--Belarussian Military District, an air army, a separate air defense army, an airborne division, large rear bases, arsenals, and depots. It was on this solid foundation that the Belarussian Armed Forces were established. One must give credit to the higher leadership of the Republic and to the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus: they did not force the process artificially. Everything possible was done to see to it that the transformation of the Republic's Armed Forces took place smoothly and without severe disruptions of the fate of individuals. People with shoulder straps were given the opportunity to think and to get their bearings. This made it possible to avoid a mass outflow of military personnel from the Republic. By the end of 1992, they had concluded the legal formation of the Armed Forces and the military doctrine of Belarus was affirmed. On 31 December of that year, officers and warrant officers swore allegiance to the Republic. And only after this did the second and principal stage in the establishment of the Armed Forces begin--the reduction of the numerical strength of the forces and the transition to a new organizational and personnel structure. According to the plan, it will continue until 1 January 1995. In the opinion of Col.-Gen. Pavel Kozlovskiy, minister of defense of the Republic of Belarus, however, the basic tasks in the reduction and reform of the Armed Forces have practically been completed already and as time goes on their appearance will not change substantially. What does the Belarussian Army look like after two years of "swimming by itself." A higher leadership and command agencies have been established and are functioning: the Ministry of Defense and the main staff. The next step is that of the Army corps that are replacing tank and combined-arms armies. There are three of them. The 28th Army Corps includes three separate mechanized brigades, a base for the storage of armament and equipment (BKhVT), and a set of corps units. They include units of missile forces and artillery, signal troops, and engineer troops. The Seventh Army Corps is made up of mechanized brigades, three BKhVT, and units subordinate to the corps. The Fifth Army Corps has two BKhVT and a set of corps units. If necessary, the bases for the storage of arms and equipment can form mechanized brigades. Thus, the mechanized brigade is the basic combat unit of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus that is independently capable of performing the tasks of mobile defense. It has four or five battalions: one or two tank and two or three mechanized battalions. It numbers from 3,000 to 5,000 men. According to specialists, the brigade in this form is not so far behind the previous division in firepower but is more mobile than the latter and is better commanded. The air forces have likewise undergone some changes. Instead of the former aviation regiments and divisions, nine air bases of different purposes have been established. Several antiaircraft missile brigades and regiments and individual air defense groups form the basis of the republic's air defense forces. The separate 120th Guard Rogachevskaya Motorized Rifle Division and the 103rd Airborne Division that are part of the ground forces represent a real power. In the process of reform, the Armed Forces were subjected to significant cuts. In 1992-1993, almost 13,000 officers and warrant officers were discharged from them. There are a little over 100,000 men "under arms" at the present time. The strength of the armed forces will be reduced to approximately 80-85,000 by the beginning of 1995. In short, the emphasis has been put on the establishment of a relatively small army that performs purely defensive functions. The Ministry of Defense considers that numerical losses must be compensated through up-to-date armament and equipment, high proficiency of personnel, and qualified command cadres. It is another matter whether the Republic will be able to maintain this potential at the same level in the future. This is by no means a rhetorical question. Belarus, just as the other states of the CIS, is experiencing an extremely serious economic crisis. This year the military department has been allocated a sum that amounts to only four percent of the Republic budget. It is asserted in the finance-economic directorate of the Ministry of Defense that this money is sufficient for only the most urgent needs. In the words of Aleksandr Tushinskiy, first deputy minister of defense of the Republic of Belarus, many other problems affecting the combat readiness of the Republic's Armed Forces are arising because of the limited financial possibilities. As everyone knows, one of its most important components is the proficiency of personnel. There is combat training in the forces but it is becoming more and more difficult to organize it. In the units of the Air Force, for example, they are talking with concern about the logged flight hours of pilots approaching a critical level of only 20-30 hours. In the ground troops, the shortage of vehicle resources is forcing the lion's share of exercises to be carried out without taking equipment and people to the training centers. Simulators help out to some extent but there are not enough of them. The meager budget of the military department gives rise to still another serious problem. It is a matter of the social protection of service personnel. The government and Ministry of Defense of the Republic are making considerable effort to provide tolerable conditions for them in their service and daily life. In two years it was possible to cut almost in half the number of officers without apartments. Last year the housing stock of the Ministry of Defense was increased by almost 3,000 apartments. By 1 January 1995 it is planned to reduce the number of those waiting for housing by another 3,000. But even after this there will still be more than 7,000 families waiting.... Dissatisfaction with their current material situation is forcing many military personnel under various pretexts to leave the service for the reserves or to go over to the armies of other countries of the CIS. According to the personnel directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus, the shortage of platoon leaders alone is now 700 men and this number continues to grow. The Armed Forces of the Republic now have more than 1,500 vacancies for officer positions, mostly pilots and communications personnel. The once abundant flow of applications from officers desiring to return to their homeland has practically dried up--the conditions of service do not suit them. The personnel problem is being made worse by the fact that the two military schools in the Republic cannot provide for the training of officer cadres in all specialties. Cadets have to be sent to Russia for schooling. And this is not inexpensive these days. This year it is proposed to begin the transition to contract service but these plans had to be postponed for an indefinite time. The reason is the same as before. One could continue for some time the list of difficulties that the Belarussian Army encountered in the phase of its formation. Alas, there is one root to most of them--the acute shortage of financing. Apparently, in making the decision to establish their own armed forces, the higher levels of authority in the republic were not entirely clear about what their support will cost. The past two years have made it quite obvious that much more funding than was thought will be required to maintain even a relatively small but up-to-date and well-armed army that is really capable of defending the sovereignty of the state. The matter is clear: either the Armed Forces will obtain at least the minimum that is needed and they will survive or they must be given up entirely. There is no third choice. It appears that they have recognized this in the Government of Belarus. In speaking to generals and officers recently on the results of a command and staff exercise, Prime Minister of the Republic of Belarus Vyacheslav Kebich declared that the Council of Ministers of the Republic is greatly concerned about the situation developing in the Armed Forces. He also assured them that the government of the Republic will persistently pursue the course of close cooperation in the area of defense with other countries of the CIS and above all with Russia, which will make it possible to develop the military with fewer expenditures and greater efficiency.
