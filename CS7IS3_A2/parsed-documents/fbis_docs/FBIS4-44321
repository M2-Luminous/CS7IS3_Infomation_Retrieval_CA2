This was an opportunity for Europe to put words into practice and to assume a common purpose. But no such thing has taken place. On the contrary, Europe is but an indifferent, not to say reluctant, witness to a humanitarian rescue operation which it is letting France perform alone. At France's peril, but also to its credit. There are those who diffidently promise some logistical support, or a few packages of supplies. Italy, which initially appeared to support France's initiative, is now setting down conditions. Belgium, whose involvement in Rwanda was deep, maintains that it will not send a single man. Great Britain hears nothing, sees nothing, says nothing. As for Germany, it is hiding behind its constitution, a convenient and customary alibi for doing nothing. As for all the others they are reneging. In short, Europe is missing at a time when one of its own members, France, is resolutely committing itself. [passage omitted] People will find it difficult to forget that, when the hour required some generosity, courage, and responsibility, Europe was nowhere to be seen. Such is not the case of France, however. It is showing by force of example that a nation remains a nation and that it still knows how to act alone when danger is knocking at the door. Europe has proved unable to fulfil the promises made in Maastricht. Too bad. Because it is shouldering this burden alone, France should not refrain from a feeling of pride at having upheld its traditions. France is coming to the rescue of a people in mortal danger. It does not matter whether it has partners or not. What does matter is for it to succeed. [passage omitted].
