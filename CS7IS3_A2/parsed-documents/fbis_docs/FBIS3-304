The students, who last Monday began a "sit-in" strike at the embassy and who have disrupted activities at the mission, Wednesday sent a telex message to authorities in Niamey on their grievances, Adamou Tahirou, Vice President of the Union of Niger Students in Nigeria, told AFP. Niamey has also yet to pay the students, who are studying sciences, banking, engineering, computer science, business administration and arts in Nigerian universities, registration fees for last year and this year as well as other allowances, Adamou said. In a telex message Wednesday by the embassy, a copy of which was shown to AFP, the mission urged the government of Niger to send buses to Nigeria to "repatriate" the students immediately because the embassy might not be able to take care of the cost of the hospitalisation of the students, some of whom are already suffering from "physical weakness". "The students are in a catastrophic situation" following non-payment of seven months of arrears of their allowances, according to the embassy. Niger's ambassador to Nigeria, Maman Mansour, confirmed to AFP the "sit-in" strike of the students and the debt of seven months arrears of grants to the students.
