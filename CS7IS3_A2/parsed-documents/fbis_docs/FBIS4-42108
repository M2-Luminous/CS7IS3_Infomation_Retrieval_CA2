The finances of the defense forces are now so overextended that major cuts in activities and materiel projects will be necessary after the election. For the JAS project alone there is a shortfall of 4 billion kronor over the next few years. "It can be said -- and needs to be said -- without any beating around the bush that the economic margins for the full implementation of the defense bill are extremely small," the Moderate Coalition Party's Arne Andersson, the chairman of the Defense Committee, said in the Riksdag two weeks ago. Defense Minister Anders Bjorck takes a completely different view. In the Riksdag debate on defense on 4 May -- the same day that SVENSKA DAGBLADET published new figures about the defense forces' hard-pressed finances -- the following was heard from the defense minister: "Figures plucked from the air, rigged and groundless, published to serve certain purposes when there is a defense debate." But since the beginning of the year the Defense Ministry has been alerted by Supreme Commander Bengt Gustafsson and Air Force chief Lars-Erik Englund to significant problems in the field of economic planning, chiefly in relation to the JAS project. According to military headquarters, Anders Bjorck is not particularly interested in tackling the problems before the election. "The defense minister is clearly prepared to leave the beginnings of a bankrupt estate behind him," a high-ranking officer in the planning department at military headquarters said. SVENSKA DAGBLADET has seen an internal document put together by the Defense Committee on 11 May. The document makes it clear that if the krona does not become stronger and the dollar weaker within the next year the Air Force and the JAS project will be faced with major economic problems. Hitherto the crisis has not been an acute liquidity problem. But in the 1994/95 budget year the two-year lag of the "incomplete price compensation system" for the defense forces could lead to a liquidity problem because the changes in exchange rates since 1992 have been very great. A liquidity problem would mean that the Air Force would quite simply be unable to pay its bills. "The price compensation system was not designed, when it was introduced, to deal with changes as large as those there have been recently," the defense committee writes. In addition to the exchange rate problems and the difficult balancing act between budget and five-year planning in the defense forces, the Air Force has also admitted an annual error of 342 million kronor in reporting the materiel costs of the JAS project. In their reports to the Defense Ministry the planners have failed to inform the ministry that there is an indirect exchange rate dependency in Swedish JAS materiel and this means that too little money has been given to the Air Force. According to the Air Force chief, this misreporting alone will lead to a shortfall 1.7 billion kronor in the period 1994-99. When the exchange rate problems, which arose when the krona was cut adrift from the ECU (import prices fro the JAS project then rose by 25-30 percent), are added to the misreporting a shortfall of almost 4 billion kronor for the same period arises. In the years up to 2005 the shortfall will increase to all of 7 billion kronor if the krona does not become stronger. If the conditions affecting the Air Force's planning and finances are not straightened out by the government, Air Force chief Englund, who retires on 1 July, believes that he cannot take responsibility for orders for radar pursuit missiles, warning and countermeasure equipment, and the reconnaissance capsule for the JAS 39 Gripen. These very important systems -- crucial for possible future exports of the 39 Gripen -- will simply have to be removed from the plans. "Of course, one alternative is to take a chance and hope that the value of the krona rises by 30 percent against the dollar, but who can guarantee this? The dollar is also thought to be undervalued at present. We have to plan in line with real and correct figures," the headquarters officer said. The defense forces have been wrestling with poor planning and financing for decades, both under Social Democratic and nonsocialist governments. It seem to be verging on the impossible to reach a five-year balance between money allocated, materiel orders, and operations. A little while ago the Defense Ministry was forced to pay out an additional 400 million kronor to the Navy. If there is a Social Democratic government this fall it is expected that, regardless of the current planning problems, there will be major cuts in defense in order to continue the process of modernization that has been initiated. The Social Democrats want to cut the Army by 50 percent and also cut 1 billion kronor from the defense budget. Liberal Party leader Bengt Westerberg, who can envisage ruling together with the Social Democrats, has given advance warning of cuts of up to 30 percent in the defense budget after 1997. All in all the whole issue is an equation that is very difficult to solve. * * * Footnote: A defense bill covers a period of five years and sets out levels of military activity and purchases of materiel for an amount of money fixed by the Riksdag.
