FBIS4-7942 "dreeu068__a94030" FBIS-EEU-94-068-A Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 ANNEX Slovakia HZDS `Will Not Support' Manifesto HZDS `Will Not Support' Manifesto AU0804094394 Prague CTK in English 1812 GMT 7 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0804094394 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, April 7 (CTK) -- Former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) will not support the new government's manifesto because it does not address its fundamental task -- preparations of early parliamentary elections, deputy prime minister of Meciar's shadow cabinet Sergej Kozlik said today. The public statements by Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova and Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus that the manifesto was to cover a period longer than what remained until early elections (September 30-October 1) give rise to the question whether the present coalition really counted on the elections. "There are also signals of further HZDS deputies' departures," Kozlik said adding that this would give the government parties further votes to assert the passage of a constitutional law abrogating early elections. Former Finance Minister Julius Toth (HZDS) criticized the economic part of the manifesto. He dismissed the part calling the preparation of the division of the Czechoslovak federation unconceptual and the parts pointing to the vague taxation system, double rate of inflation in 1993 compared with 1992 (25.1 percent) and neglect of writing-off enterprises' debts. Toth said he had received "the Czech-language version of the federation's split scenario in August. During the next two and a half months we had to take such measures as to prevent Slovakia's collapse after January 1, 1993 (when Czechoslovakia split)." Both Kozlik and Toth pointed out that the former opposition called unfeasible considerations about a zero growth of the gross domestic product, an approximately 12 percent inflation and a maximum 17 percent unemployment, but now, when it is in power it uses the same macroeconomic indicators. Toth said that according to the latest statistical data, industrial production in Slovakia rose by 17 percent against January 1993. The GDP will grow in the first quarter of 1994 as envisaged by the former government, he added.
