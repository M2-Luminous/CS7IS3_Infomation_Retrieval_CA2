He said forming a new government would evidently be a task for a coalition which would probably be made of the political parties constituting the current government. At a joint news conference with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz here Kovac reiterated his support for the improved relations between Slovakia and Hungary which he said were not yet really good and neighborly. Kovac said that now, after the Hungarian parliamentary elections, new conditions are being created for general progress, including the progress in solving a dispute concerning the Gabcikovo hydroelectric project on the Danube. Goncz confirmed that in this case technical questions are at issue but also political and national minority problems. He pointed out that Slovakia had not complied with recent recommendations by the European Union concerning the Gabcikovo dam.
