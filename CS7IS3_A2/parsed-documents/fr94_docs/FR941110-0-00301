FR941110-0-00301 FR941110-0-00018 C. Disease and predation. Black twig borer ( Xylosandrus compactus ) has been cited as an immediate threat to all extant populations of Flueggea neowawraea (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). The black twig borer burrows into the branches and introduces a pathogenic fungus, pruning the host severely and often killing branches or whole plants (Howarth 1985). All known plants of Flueggea neowawraea suffer slight to severe defoliation and reduced vigor due to infestations of this alien insect. Evidence of predation on two of the taxa by ungulates (cattle, deer, goats) is documented on Oahu, Lanai, and Maui. On Oahu, plants of Bonamia menziesii at Lualualei grow over native vegetation and drape well below the browse line of cattle, indicating the potential for cattle to feed on the plants (HHP 1992b30). On Lanai, axis deer are known to feed on this species, especially at Kanepuu. Depredation of Hibiscus brackenridgei ssp. brackenridgei by goats has been observed on Lanai and Maui. Goats are known to eat the branch tips and strip the bark of the plants (HHP 1992e14). While there is no evidence of predation on the other 11 species, none of them are known to be unpalatable to cattle, deer, or goats. Predation is therefore a probable threat to species growing at sites where those animals have been reported ( Diellia erecta, Flueggea neowawraea, Neraudia sericea, Plantago princeps, Sesbania tomentosa, Spermolepis hawaiiensis, and Vigna o-wahuensis ) (See Factor A.). D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms Of the 12 species in this ruling, a total of 10 have populations located on private land, 2 on County land, 10 on State land, and 7 on Federal land. With the exception of Neraudia sericea which is restricted to private land, all of the other species occur in more than one of those ownership categories. The known populations of these species located on Federal lands are inadequate to ensure their long-term survival.
