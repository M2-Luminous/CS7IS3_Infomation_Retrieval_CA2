This was a statistically substantiated conclusion made at a science and practical conference, which took place in the Plavskiy district of the Tula region on Tuesday. The conference was held with participation of experts of the Moscow-based Academy of Medical Sciences. Although the Plavskiy district got the most significant portion of the radioactive pollution in the Tula region, not a single case of acute radioactive exposure was registered, according to the statistics. Moreover, according to the data on the regional spread of various diseases, the situation in the district is even safer than average in the region and in the districts with a good record in this respect. There are fewer cases of child mortality, diseases of the endocrine system and congenital anomalities among its population. However, the fact that inhabitants have come to apply to the hospitals for medical assistance more rarely over the last few years, casts a shadow of doubt over the reliability of the statistics. According to Yelena Kuznetsova, who works for the Regional Committee for Environmental Protection, which studies the problems of the Chernobyl aftermath, the statistics must be treated cautiously, whereas the fact that the inhabitants of the district neglect medical services causes serious concern.
