The organization said that it would temporarily suspend its activity pending the High Court's ruling. Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that in its announcement, the Kakh movement asserted that all its activity had been carried out within the framework of the law. Justice Minister David Liba'i said that the Justice Ministry was currently preparing an amendment to the Antiterror Act according to which the judiciary, and not the Israeli Government, would be made responsible for declaring which groups constituted terrorist organizations. Here are some reactions to the cabinet's decision to declare the Kakh and Kahana Hay movements terrorist organizations: PLO official Abu-al-'Ala' said that although this constituted a positive step, it was too little in relation to the enormity of the Hebron massacre. Likud Knesset Member [MK] Mikha'el Eytan said that the decision came too late. Such a decision, he said, should already have been made by earlier Likud governments. Mikha'el Eytan added that many people had been led astray by these movements. The Committee of Arab Local Councils welcomed the decision but said that it was not enough. The settlers should be taken out of Hebron and those capable of harming the fabric of relations between Jews and Arabs should be disarmed. Uri Ari'el, the secretary general of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, said that the decision should have been made by a court and not by the executive level.
