He said that any delay in the peace talks is a "waste," noting that the Arab states have not called for suspending the negotiations but for postponing them. He pointed out that the Palestinian and Israeli leaders need peace and that the peace process must move forward. In an interview with the Lebanese magazine AL-HAWADITH, President Mubarak stressed that cooperation is needed and is in the best interest of all peoples. He noted that, despite the animosity that existed between the French and the Germans, their common interests dictated that they cooperate. In the interview, President Mubarak described terrorists as "hired criminals paid by some quarters that seek to cause unrest in Egypt or any region." He noted that these quarters spend a lot of money to carry out their plans. President Mubarak added that the Hebron operation is sheer extremism, noting that extremism exists in the United States, England, Australia, and elsewhere. In his remarks to AL-HAWADITH chief editor Milhim Karam, President Mubarak touched on the new world order, which he described as "a chaotic order." He pointed out that it is "wrong" to call it the new world order. He said that this order is transitional and not the end of the road. As for the new world order, he added, it will come when this chaotic order is over. Regarding Iraq, President Mubarak said: We are against partitioning Iraq. Our position is clear and firm on this matter. President Mubarak described Egypt's relations with Saudi Arabia and all the Gulf states as "good and fraternal relations." He described Egypt's relations with Lebanon and Syria as "fully fraternal relations." Turning to Egypt's relations with Russia, President Mubarak said they are "good relations." He added: I do not wish to antagonize any country. There is a problem with Iran, and it is the one that seeks to antagonize Egypt. We have no relations with Iran. We were about to exchange ambassadors a year ago, but they disagreed among themselves. Asked about the Hebron massacre and its impact on the peace process, President Mubarak said that the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque is an "appalling tragedy" that pained us all. He added: But despite what happened and the difficulties facing the negotiations, we believe that the peace process is fundamental to the Palestinian people and the entire region. President Mubarak expressed confidence that the peace process will continue. He added: I know that the Palestinian and Israeli leaders need peace and that extremists anywhere on earth do not want that because they like to live in an atmosphere of extremism. President Mubarak stressed that the peace process is serious. He noted that despite the obstacles that exist, which is natural in an issue that goes back 45 years, peace will come, and the Palestinian issue is at the core of the conflict. He expressed his belief that extremism in Israel will not triumph and will not blow up the peace process, which is a just demand by all peoples. He also expressed confidence that Lebanon and Syria will reach a solution with Israel over the Golan and south Lebanon. Replying to a question on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre's impact on the Cairo Agreement, President Mubarak said he expects the negotiations to resume soon after people have calmed down and that the parties concerned will sign an accord now that they have come so far. He added: I tell the Palestinians to put their feet on the ground first and then make demands. He noted that the Palestinian side is talking while it is outside its land. He stressed the need for cooperation and coordination between the Palestinians and the parties directly concerned with the peace process and said: I have a duty to fulfill, which is unifying the fold. Commenting on Arab summits, he said that they are not held annually and that Arab division after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait resulted in a rift in the Arab world. He affirmed that he is doing all he can to clear Arab air for the good of the nation. Concerning Iraq, Mubarak said: We support the Iraqi people and stand against partition. We are saddened by their suffering because they are Arab Muslim people. (?Had) Saddam Husayn (?heard) my sincere advice, it would not have happened, his position would have been stronger, and Iraq's power would have been a tributary for Arab strength. On the situation in Algeria, he said: I hope our brothers in Algeria under President Zeroual's regime will put an end to the odious extremism that will destroy all the nation's resources. If the parties concerned want the survival of their country, they should sit with the Algerian president to discuss solutions to end their problems. Regarding the Lockerbie issue, President Mubarak said: We have exerted enormous efforts, but the world today is preoccupied with Bosnia and Somalia. I hope we will find a way out for Libya to resolve the problem because the handover of the two Libyan suspects is "difficult and sensitive." Asked about the situation and challenges in Africa in his capacity as current chairman of the OAU, President Mubarak noted the numerous problems facing development there. He said enormous efforts are necessary and that we are doing our best to end the conflicts, which are "border disputes." He referred to the problems in Liberia, Nigeria, Somalia, and Sudan. He said that had the African countries adhered to the African summit's resolution in the 1960's, when the late Egyptian President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir asked them to stick to the borders left by colonialism.... [sentence incomplete as received] Speaking about the Somali problem, President Mubarak said that the African summit has entrusted a committee with the task of ending this problem but there are difficulties in our way. He added: We hosted in Egypt some of the rival parties with the exception of General Farah Aidid who did not want to come. Mubarak emphasized that as OAU chairman he does not take sides with any party against another but that he speaks about all of them with extreme fairness and neutrality. He said: We are working for Somalia's unity and the Somali parties have to agree among themselves so that their people can survive. Asked about Sudan and the Hala'ib issue, President Mubarak said: What is this Hala'ib? They want to fabricate a story with us. They did so during the days of the late Presidents Anwar al-Sadat and Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir. Al-Turabi wants to create a problem. They are free to do as they please but as for us we have no problem. President Mubarak stressed the need to launch a dialogue between the north and the south and said it is unreasonable for the north to live a very affluent life while the south lives at subsistence level. As for the Nonaligned Movement, Mubarak said: They are all aligned. The small countries need the big ones to help them in development. This is what brother Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi said and he is right; everyone is aligned. But as for today, with whom and against whom should alignment be? The Nonaligned Movement is losing the reasons for its existence. Asked about development in Egypt, the president noted the great efforts that have been made to rebuild the infrastructure and said: We have spent 100 billion pounds for this purpose. On the effect of the acts of violence on tourism in Egypt, President Mubarak said the number of tourists arriving in Egypt has indeed decreased but Egypt, which has seven thousand years of civilization, will not be affected by a group of terrorists who have nothing to do with religion.
