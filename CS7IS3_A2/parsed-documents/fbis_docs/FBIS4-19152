Sweden has said "no" to a request from the UNHCR that it continue to fly in food and medicine. Swedish Hercules aircraft have been taking part in the airlift to Bosnia since the end of January. Two or three times a day a Swedish plane with much needed supplies has landed in Sarajevo. According to the original agreement with the UNHCR, Swedish aid deliveries would continue for three months, up to 20 April. The UNHCR's request for an extension of a further three months has been turned down after consultations between Aid Minister Alf Svensson and Defense Minister Anders Bjorck. For primarily technical and not political reasons the Defense Ministry is unable to agree to an extension of the agreement, Foreign Ministry assistant under secretary Lars Schmidt announced. "Among other reasons the Hercules aircraft are much the worse for wear. One of the aircraft is flying practically nonstop," he said. Only two of the Air Force's eight Hercules aircraft are being used for the flights to Sarajevo. The reason is that these two are the only ones which have special defenses against attack by heat-seeking missiles. According to Aid Minister Alf Svensson, one of the reasons why Sweden has said "no" is that the UNHCR's request came too late. "We have to be able to plan for things like this. And, from the beginning, there was talk of only three months." Alf Svensson said that he has no objections to the way the Defense Ministry views the matter. "I cannot insist on Swedish aid flights to Bosnia if both Swedish personnel and the Swedish aircraft are run down." The decision to end aid flights was not reached for economic reasons, according to the aid minister. He stressed that Sweden is prepared to resume aid flights again at a later date. For the time being at least the Defense Ministry has also said "no" to Swedish aid flights to Tuzla. "The security question has not been resolved yet. The necessary preconditions for an airlift do not exist in Tuzla," Lars Schmidt said. According to Ingemar Cederberg, assistant under secretary at the Foreign Ministry and responsible for the coordination of disaster aid, the question of aid flights to Tuzla has been partially resolved because Norway has responded positively to a request that it undertake such flights, if they are possible from the safety and security viewpoint. The airlift to Sarajevo has been suspended since Monday as a result of the escalation of the conflict.
