FBIS TRENDS-24JUN94-CHINA-U.S. China Touts Progress in IPR Protection, Warns Against China Touts Progress in IPR Protection, Warns Against Sanctions SUMMARY Mindful of the need to demonstrate progress in protecting intellectual property rights (IPR) in China or face the imposition of new U.S. sanctions, Beijing in recent days has been publicizing the steps it is taking to protect these rights. At the same time, Beijing has warned Washington that any attempt to pressure China on the IPR issue will be counterproductive. END SUMMARY Seeking to deflect U.S. criticism of its IPR protection efforts, Beijing has undertaken an extensive propaganda campaign to document China's alleged progress in this area. As the centerpiece of this campaign, Beijing on 16 June issued a white paper entitled "Intellectual Property Protection in China" that chronicles the history of China's legislation on this issue and details its alleged progress in implementing these laws (see box). In a clear reference to Washington, the paper, which was released by the State Council's Information Office and carried by Xinhua on the 16th, denounced as "unfounded" charges by "some naysayers" that Beijing has "not yet established a 'full and effective' intellectual property system." Beijing, the paper claimed, has made "big strides" in protecting IPR and now has a "complete legal system" for their protection. BOX: Progress in IPR Protection The white paper offered the following as evidence of China's progress in protecting intellectual property rights: -- Programs in IPR education have been initiated at "over 70 institutions," and the education system for training professional personnel in this field has provided "batch after batch of qualified personnel in IPR protection." -- In 1993 China received "170,000 applications" for trademark registration, including "130,000 applications for new trademarks." -- Higher people's courts in several provinces and municipalities directly under the central government--such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan--have, since 1992, established intellectual property rights courts. Intermediate people's courts in "all special economic zones as well as Beijing and Shanghai" have also set up IPR courts, while the intermediate people's courts in the capitals of other provinces and autonomous regions and municipalities have set up "collegial panels" specializing in IPR cases. From 1986 to the end of 1993, "3,505 cases concerning IPR disputes were accepted and handled by people's courts throughout the country." -- Between 1992 and 1993, the people's courts "have accepted 734 criminal cases for counterfeiting trademarks, of which 731 have been tried, with 566 people being sentenced to fixed terms of imprisonment, criminal detention, or other punishments." -- China today has "more than 50 patent offices" established by local governments and "more than 20 patent offices" established by various ministries and departments under the State Council. China also has "well over 7,000 full-time trademark administrative personnel throughout China in addition to 300,000 part-time personnel." -- From June 1991 to the end of 1993, "local administrative organs" have "investigated and dealt with more than 150 cases" involving pirated books and video products. -- In the last ten years, "administrative departments for industry and commerce" have dealt with "130,000 cases of trademark violation and counterfeiting," including "3,000 cases involving the counterfeiting and other violations" of foreign trademarks. END OF BOX Despite its claims of substantial progress in protecting IPR, the white paper admitted that China still has "much work" to do to "optimize" its IPR protection system. In particular, the paper noted that "awareness" of IPR remains "comparatively weak and underdeveloped" in China and in "some" government departments there is "insufficient appreciation of the importance" of IPR protection. The paper went on to say that the State Council has drawn up a "Decision on Further Strengthening IPR Protection" which, when implemented, will mark a "great new step forward" in China's efforts to "ensure" IPR protection. PRC Media on IPR Protection Since the beginning of June, Chinese media, particularly Beijing's English-language paper, China Daily, have been replete with examples of China's alleged progress in protecting intellectual property rights. -- Trademark protection. On 3 June, for example, China Daily provided evidence of China's alleged success in protecting trademarks, reporting that "a number" of illegal producers and retailers in Guangdong Province had been "closed down" for infringing on the rights of British holders of the Lucozade trademark. The article went on to note that Chinese administrative authorities handled "13,042 cases of trademark infringement and counterfeiting," of which "about 500 cases involved foreign trademarks." The 19-25 June edition of Business Weekly--China Daily's weekly supplement--touted China's efforts in protecting foreign trademarks, such as M & M, Readers' Digest, and the Financial Times, quoting a lawyer with the Beijing office of a U.S. law firm as saying that China's IPR laws provides "protection which is as good as that in other Asian countries." -- Compact and laser disc piracy. A 13 June China Daily article highlighted China's alleged progress in addressing another area of U.S. concern, the piracy of compact (CDs) and laser (LDs) discs. The article claimed that "momentum is gaining" in the nationwide crackdown against pirated CDs and LDs. According to the paper, the crackdown, which began in mid-April, is "particularly gaining ground" in Beijing, Jiangsu, and Guangdong. In Beijing, for example, police "last week" allegedly "smashed" three stores, confiscating 1,607 LDs and 125 CDs in addition to 1,480 cassettes and tapes. In Jiangsu Province, the paper said, investigators targeted two LD factories and found one of them- -which was fined 200,000 yuan ($23,000)--in violation of the copyright law. They also conducted "six secret checks" in the provincial capital, seizing 5,000 smuggled and pirated discs. In other cities, they "seized more than 15,000 copies." In an interview carried by Xinhua on 21 June, Shen Rengan, a deputy director of the State Copyright Bureau, cited more evidence of China's alleged progress in protecting IPR. According to Shen, "incomplete statistics" show that in 1993 the State Press and Publications Administration (PPA) "confiscated 480,000 boxes of pirated videocassette tapes." He said Beijing has achieved "remarkable results" this year in its crackdown on audio-visual publishers. An 18 June report on Shen's remarks went even further, suggesting that the crackdown had resulted in "several" illicit production lines being "destroyed." -- Book piracy. In yet another effort to show China's progress in this area, a 21 June China Daily report revealed that Beijing has started a crackdown against book pirates. According to the article, police have been "cracking down" on the sale of "illegally published and pornographic" material following the issuance of a PPA "directive" requiring PPA regional branches to "cooperate" with local Public Security organs in starting a "comprehensive search" for pirated books and pornographic material. The paper claimed that the crackdown has been particularly successful in Beijing, Hunan, and Guangdong, and quoted Huang Xiaoxin, a spokesman from the PPA's Distribution Department, as saying that printing houses and backroom printing shops in these locales had been "closed down and the main offenders arrested." In Hunan, for example, Huang said that a number of people from a county printing house are now "awaiting trial" for "illegally printing" 250,000 copies of the Xinhua Dictionary. Huang went on to note that a book merchant now awaiting trial in Heilongjiang Province faces the "death penalty" if found guilty of pirating. New Legal Punishments In addition to indicating that Beijing plans to step up its efforts to protect IPR, Chinese media reporting has also suggested that Beijing plans to legislatively stiffen the penalties for copyright infringement. Song Jian, State Councillor and head of the State Science and Technology Commission, for example, suggested that new penalties are in the offing, noting, in a statement carried by Xinhua on 16 June, that Beijing plans to "further amplify" its laws and regulations and that future punishments for IPR violations will be "more severe." According to a spokesman for the National People's Congress (NPC), the upcoming session of the NPC Standing Committee, which is scheduled to open on 28 June, will again "deliberate" the draft regulation regarding copyright violations. The NPC Standing Committee had discussed, but failed to pass, the regulation at its last session in early May. Media reporting at the time had indicated that the draft regulation included provisions for prison sentences of up to five years, criminal detention, and/or fines for those convicted of "serious" copyright violations (Xinhua, 5 May). Warnings on U.S. Sanctions Although admitting that China's present IPR protection system has a number of shortcomings, Beijing has indicated that attempts by Washington to pressure China on IPR issues will be counterproductive. Deputy Director Shen, for example, clearly had Washington in mind when he pointed out that "threats to exercise pressure" through sanctions does not represent a "constructive attitude" toward seeking a solution to what he said are the "inevitable" problems accompanying the development of an IPR protection system (Xinhua, 21 June). Hui Yongzheng, a Vice Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, went even further in warning Washington, saying that while China is "always ready to cooperate" with others on the IPR issue, it will "resolutely oppose any act of interference in its internal affairs under the pretext of IPR protection" (Xinhua, 22 June). Prospects With growing internal pressure from its own market reforms acting as the driving force for change, Beijing will continue its efforts to develop a comprehensive IPR protection system. However, it is likely that differences over IPR issues will continue between Washington and Beijing. (AUTHOR: HEBBEL.
