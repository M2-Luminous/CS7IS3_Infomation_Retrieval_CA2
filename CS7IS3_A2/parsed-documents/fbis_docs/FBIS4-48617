A policeman said they were asking for a pay increase of 60 per cent. Reports said the Lesotho Government responded by saying police would receive a 10 per cent increase in line with other state departments. The country's defence force has been deployed to prevent plundering. There have been incidents because there were too few soldiers to adequately patrol several rural areas.
