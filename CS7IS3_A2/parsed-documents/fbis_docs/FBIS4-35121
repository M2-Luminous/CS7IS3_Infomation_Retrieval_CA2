They will also have to limit their investments to the revised ceiling of $7.6 billion established in this year's budget. Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero and Planning Minister Beni Veras today officially conveyed this decision to the officials of major state-owned companies -- Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], Eletrobras [Brazilian Electric Power Company, Inc.], Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc.], and the Rio Doce Valley Company (CVRD). The two ministers have thus defined the scope of action of these companies to prevent them from jeopardizing the implementation of the real. Ricupero said: "While state-owned companies are usually regarded as the adversary, we would like them to have an active participation in implementing the new plan." Ricupero and Veras installed the Interministerial Board, a body that will be charged with monitoring the expenditures of state-owned companies. The board, which will be of a temporary nature, will convene once a week to monitor spending by state-owned companies. Today Veras presided over the first meeting, at which he emphasized the need for state-owned companies to control their expenditures so as not to hurt the implementation of the economic plan. The most controversial topic was the government's reaffirmation that President Itamar Franco will veto any attempt at changing the investment ceiling established in the budget. Raul Jungmann, executive secretary of the Planning Ministry, said: "If a state-owned company obtains a budget amendment to increase its investments, the government will veto it." None of the company officials uttered any complaint at the meeting. Telebras President Adyr Silva avoided a direct criticism of the government's restriction, but noted that he will have to spend $2.5 billion just to fulfill President Franco's request to expand private and public telephone lines. This amount alone almost absorbs the total of $2.9 billion allocated for Telebras this year. The government is also concerned about negotiating with CVRD the need to control its budget spending and the salaries of its workers. The CVRD signed a management agreement with the government whereby it has autonomy over its administration. Speaking after the meeting, Jungmann said: "I am absolutely convinced that the CVRD, as well as the other state-owned companies, will comply with the revised budget allocations for 1994." The Special Secretariat for State Enterprises [Sest] estimates that this year, CVRD will spend a maximum of $225 million; Petrobras, $2.1 billion; Telebras, $2.9 billion; Eletrobras, $1.4 billion; ports, $187 million; Itaipu, $82 million; and other companies, $213 million. The installation of the board opens a new stage in the control of state-owned companies. A provisional measure reorganizing Sest and transforming the Committee for the Control of State Enterprises [CCE] into a council linked to Sest was published today in the DIARIO OFICIAL. The old CCE no longer exists, and Ledir de Paula Reis, former chief of the International Reserves Operations Department, has been appointed to head Sest. As a result of the structural changes introduced to Sest and CCE, the government has gained more power to control state-owned companies. Jungmann notes that the former structure was based on presidential decrees, while the current structure is based on a law. Sest will now perform the role of the Department for Coordination of State Enterprises. The former CCE, which in the past was not linked to any organization, has now been placed under the basic structure of the Planning Secretariat. The CCE will consist of the finance and planning ministers, the Sest secretary, and the secretary for economic policy of the Finance Ministry. The two executive secretaries will no longer serve on the CCE.
