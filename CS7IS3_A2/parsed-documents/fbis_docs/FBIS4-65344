Ruehe wants to eliminate these posts by means of transfers and early retirements. There should be no dismissals, said the spokesman. Even when Stoltenberg (CDU) was defense minister, ways of reducing the number of employees were considered. BILD AM SONNTAG has reported on these economization plans, referring to a confidential letter Ruehe sent to the Bundestag Defense Committee, announcing the personnel reduction. Ten subcommittees are to be abolished.
