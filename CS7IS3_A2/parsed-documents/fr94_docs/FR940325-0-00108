FR940325-0-00108 FR940325-0-00016 (v) Standard time data methodology . This methodology provides for a cost estimate for labor. Standard time data are a catalogue of standard tasks typically undertaken in performing a given type of work. (vi) Cost- and time-estimating relationships (CERs and TERs) . CERs and TERs are statistical regression models that mathematically describe the cost of an item or activity as a function of one or more independent variables. The regression models provide statistical relationships between cost or time and physical or performance characteristics of past designs. (3) Other cost estimating methodologies . Other cost estimating methodologies that are based upon standard and accepted cost estimating practices and are cost-effective are acceptable methodologies to determine the costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources under this part. (c) Compensable value . (1) Compensable value is the amount of money required to compensate the public for the loss in services provided by the injured resources between the time of the discharge or release and the time the resources and the services those resources provided are fully returned to their baseline conditions. The compensable value includes the value of lost public use of the services provided by the injured resources, plus lost nonuse values such as existence and bequest values. Compensable value is measured by changes in consumer surplus, economic rent, and any fees or other payments collectable by a Federal or State agency or an Indian tribe for a private party's use of the natural resources; and any economic rent accruing to a private party because the Federal or State agency or Indian tribe does not charge a fee or price for the use of the resources. (i) Use value is the value of the resources to the public attributable to the direct use of the services provided by the natural resources. (ii) Nonuse value is the difference between compensable value and use value, as those terms are used in this section. * * * * * (2) Valuation methodologies . The authorized official may choose among the valuation methodologies listed in this section to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) or may choose other methodologies provided that the methodology can satisfy the acceptance criterion in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Nothing in this section precludes the use of a combination of valuation methodologies so long as the authorized official does not double count or uses techniques that allow any double counting to be estimated and eliminated in the final damage calculation. (i) Market price methodology . This methodology may be used if the natural resources are traded in the market. In using this methodology, the authorized official should make a determination as to whether the market for the resources is reasonably competitive. If the authorized official determines that the market for the resources, or the services provided by the resources, is reasonably competitive, the diminution in the market price of the injured resources, or the lost services, may be used to determine the compensable value of the injured resources. (ii) Appraisal methodology . Where sufficient information exists, the appraisal methodology may be used. In using this methodology, compensable value should be measured, to the extent possible, in accordance with the applicable sections of the ``Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisition'' (Uniform Appraisal Standards), Interagency Land Acquisition Conference, Washington, DC, 1973 (incorporated by reference, see §11.18). The measure of compensable value under this appraisal methodology will be the difference between the with- and without-injury appraisal value determined by the comparable sales approach as described in the Uniform Appraisal Standards. (iii) Factor income methodology . If the injured resources are inputs to a production process, which has as an output a product with a well-defined market price, the factor income methodology may be used. This methodology may be used to determine the economic rent associated with the use of resources in the production process. This methodology is sometimes referred to as the ``reverse value added'' methodology. The factor income methodology may be used to measure the in-place value of the resources. (iv) Travel cost methodology . The travel cost methodology may be used to determine a value for the use of a specific area. An individual's incremental travel costs to an area are used as a proxy for the price of the services of that area. Compensable value of the area to the traveler is the difference between the value of the area with and without a discharge or release. When regional travel cost models exist, they may be used if appropriate. (v) Hedonic pricing methodology . The hedonic pricing methodology may be used to determine the value of nonmarketed resources by an analysis of private market choices. The demand for nonmarketed natural resources is thereby estimated indirectly by an analysis of commodities that are traded in a market. (vi) Unit value methodology . Unit values are preassigned dollar values for various types of nonmarketed recreational or other experiences by the public. Where feasible, unit values in the region of the affected resources and unit values that closely resemble the recreational or other experience lost with the affected resources may be used. (vii) Contingent valuation methodology _(A) *␣*␣* This methodology may be used to determine lost use values of injured natural resources. * * * * * (3) Other valuation methodologies . Other valuation methodologies that measure compensable value in accordance with the public's WTP, in a cost-effective manner, are acceptable methodologies to determine compensable value under this part. 17. Section 11.84 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (d)(2), (f), and (g) heading, (g)(1), (g)(2) introductory text, (g)(2) (i), (ii), and (iii); removing paragraph (h); and redesignating (i) as new paragraph (h) and revising it to read as follows: §11.84 Damage Determination phase_implementation guidance. (a) Requirement . The authorized official should use the cost estimating and valuation methodologies in §11.83 of this part following the appropriate guidance in this section. (b) Determining uses . (1) Before estimating damages for compensable value under §11.83 of this part, the authorized official should determine the uses made of the resource services identified in the Quantification phase. * * * * * (d) Uncertainty . *␣*␣*
