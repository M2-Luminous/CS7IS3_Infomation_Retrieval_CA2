Noe Pino said this will be a difficult year for Hondurans because of the high fiscal deficit left by the previous government. Noe Pino said it will also be difficult because price freezes will be lifted and fluctuations are expected in the exchange rate. Noe Pino added, however, that the family basket tax will not increase. An tax increase on luxury items is being analyzed, he noted.
