The meeting's result proved that the differences between both parties are still considerable and that there is very little time to overcome them. The deadline is only 11 days off and many of the measures the Brazilian Government could take to stave off sanctions must be passed by Congress. The foreign minister noted: There are still differences of perceptions that could not be settled today. Nevertheless, we will keep in contact in the next few days. We decided that we would speak on the phone if necessary. This is not an easy situation, but it is not impossible to surmount either. Kantor was circumspect in his remarks. He said it was a productive meeting, "but there are some issues whose settlement is still pending." Having assessed the meeting, another U.S. official involved in the negotiations later defined the situation: -- This is a very complicated situation because our differences of opinion over certain items on the list under discussion are still quite considerable and serious. The United States is convinced that Brazil does not give adequate protection to copyright, patent, and trademark rights and demands that this state of affairs be changed. Following the expiration of the first deadline [for taking corrective action] (last May), a period of six months was established to enter into negotiations. This period was extended another 90 days last November and the deadline is 28 February. This could be the fateful date. Amorim declined to speculate about the implications of possible retaliation by the United Sates. He said: -- We are working on the assumption that we will be able to prevent retaliation. After being asked openly what his wager on the denouement of this conflict was, the minister evinced uncertainty: -- I am neither optimistic nor pessimistic. Amorim asserted that both parties came up with new ideas but refused to disclose them. Kantor had at least mentioned that. In practice, the Brazilian Government has 11 days to try to convince the United States that this time it will indeed make the concessions that have been demanded. If a trade sanction were imposed on our country, it would consist of a surtax on several Brazilian products entering the American market. The idea behind this is to offset the losses incurred by U.S. companies in Brazil -- a little more than $500 million -- due to piracy.
