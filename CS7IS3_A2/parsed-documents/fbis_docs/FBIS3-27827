The visit is being made at the invitation of Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] National Assembly. The delegation consists of 10 members of parliament from six different political parties, representatives of the Thai mass media, and other personnel. An official ceremony to welcome the high-level Thai parliamentary delegation was held at the National Assembly Hall. On hand to welcome Prof. Marut Bunnak, his wife, and the visiting Thai delegation were National Assembly Chairman Saman Vi-gnaket and his wife; Chaleun Yiapaoheu, member of the National Assembly from Oudomsai Province and chief of the National Assembly Secretariat Commission; Dr. Khamliang Phonsena, member of the National Assembly from Champassak Province and chief of the National Assembly Commission for Foreign Relations; and other prominent figures. The Thai parliamentary delegation's visit to the LPDR is the first of its kind in the 18 years since the establishment of the LPDR. The visit, therefore, is an auspicious sign for the further development and strengthening of the longstanding relations between the two countries of Laos and Thailand, especially between their legislative branches. The Thai delegation's visit to the LPDR will last three days. While they are in Laos, the parliamentary delegations from the two countries will meet to discuss issues of mutual concern. After that, the Thai delegation will pay courtesy calls on Lao party and state leaders and visit three economic and cultural establishments in Vientiane.
