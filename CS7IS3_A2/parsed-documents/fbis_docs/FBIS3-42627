Formed in November 1992, the Commodity Producers of Russia Federation unites federal, republic, kray, and oblast branch unions, associations, and other combines of commodity producers. Its founders include the Association of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Russia, the Agrarian Union of Russia, the League of Assistance to Defense Enterprises, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and the Russian Union of Labor Collectives. The congress adopted a decision on membership of the FTR for the Union of Oil Industrialists and the Trade and Industry Chamber of Russia. The forum delegates adopted in respect to the results of the work a Declaration on the Rights of Commodity Producers of the Russian Federation. In accordance with a resolution of the congress, the Federation Council Presidium was instructed to convey to the president of the Russian Federation and the Federal Assembly and Government of Russia the main proposals and demands of the congress. As follows from the documents of the congress and the debate conducted within its framework, the FTR's main goals for the transitional period are protection of the rights and representation of the interests of the combines of commodity producers of Russia in the organs of state power and administration, furtherance of the development of domestic industry, the agrarian sector, and enterprise and the formation of a system of social partnership, and the enhancement of the social prestige and the revival of the historical traditions of Russia's commodity producers. The by-laws of the federation, which were approved by the Second FTR Congress, have now been registered with the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation. In accordance with an instruction of the congress, FTR Chairman Yuriy Skokov will hold consultations with the Government of Russia, the leaders of factions of deputies of the Federal Assembly, the leaders of political parties and grassroots movements and organizations, and entrepreneurs for the formulation of a concerted position on questions of socioeconomic policy taking account of the interests of the commodity producers. Declaration of the Rights of Commodity Producers of the Russian Federation We commodity producers, enterprise outfits, managers (directors), and entrepreneurs--all who are employed in the sphere of commodity production, regardless of forms of ownership, types of economic activity, and political persuasion--affirm that: --the building of a democratic federal state based on the rule of law is possible only on condition of the reform of the economy for the creation of efficiently functioning commodity production; --the chosen model of radical economic transactions in Russia has brought about a progressive decline in commodity production and increased crisis. Account is not being taken of the fact that the entire infrastructure of the country's industrial, technological, and scientific and technological potential was formed under fundamentally different conditions and that for its adaptation to a truly market environment a transitional period is necessary. The fundamental goal of the reforms--a rise in Russians' living standard--is being sacrificed. The Federation advocates the implementation of reforms and sets as its goal recognition and protection of the rights of the commodity producers based on self-organization and the harmonization of their interests in the process of reform of the economy. The Commodity Producers Federation, Recognizing Its Responsibility to the Country and Society, Declares: --its right to conclude a master agreement with the government of the Russian Federation enshrining a qualitatively new system of mutual relations in the implementation of economic transformations for the creation of efficient commodity production; --its right to devise and sign as quickly as possible with the organs of state power of components of the Russian Federation regional agreements for the formulation of the optimum mutually acceptable mechanisms of economic reform locally; --its right to participate in the elaboration of all legislative instruments and enforceable enactments concerning commodity production and to submit them for consideration to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and other organs of state power in accordance with current legislation; --its right to assurance by the state of protection of the vitally important interests of the commodity producers as an essential condition of the preservation and strengthening of Russia. The state's self-withdrawal from the accomplishment of the tasks of support for domestic commodity production is impermissible; --its right to support by the state for the priorities of the domestic commodity producers in the process of privatization. We are opposed to the rash redistribution of the national wealth to the detriment of the vast majority of the population; --its right to a long-term state protectionist policy in the interests of the domestic commodity producers. We support Russia's active inclusion in the world market in the interests of the national economy, but we are opposed to the conversion of our fatherland into a raw material appendage of the developed countries; --its right to participate in the creation of a comprehensive system of social protection of the commodity producers. The Federation will uphold and defend the rights of the domestic commodity producers within the framework of current legislation in interaction and cooperation with organs of federal and regional power and administration and with all domestic organizations and movements expressing the interests of business circles and the work force. P.S. A lengthy meeting between Yuriy Skokov and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was held recently. The meeting discussed problems of Russia's economic and social development, ways of extricating commodity production from the profound crisis, and questions of support for the interests of the commodity producers. As reported by information sources within the government, the discussion was of a constructive nature. Yuriy Skokov also met with members of the government and also leaders of certain factions of deputies.
