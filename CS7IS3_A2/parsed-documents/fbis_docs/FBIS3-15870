And although the relevant agreements were reached at the meeting in Ashgabat, according to a number of experts the prospect of admission is in doubt. Now the latest session of the CIS Coordinating Consultative Committee has opened in Moscow. "In principle the question has already been resolved," TRUD's correspondent was told by Ukrainian Embassy Minister-Counselor Vladimir Fedorov. "The only thing being discussed now is the terms." But I. Korotchenya, executive secretary of the CIS Coordinating Consultative Committee, has a completely different opinion. "This question was still being worked on in Minsk," he recounts. "At the moment it is too complex to admit Ukraine. The republic has not signed the economic union's charter." Immediately after the end of the session, TRUD's correspondent asked Committee Chairman A. Shokhin to comment on the situation. "Today we approved the idea of joining and even the draft agreement on Ukraine's admission," he remarked. "The time this process will take depends on the republic itself."
