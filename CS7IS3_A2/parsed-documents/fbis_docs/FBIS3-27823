The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We must also vigorously accelerate the technological revolution in rural areas and, thus, industrialize agriculture. Industrializing agriculture entails implementing a set of modern technological processes and carrying out tasks to build irrigation systems, use electric equipment and chemical fertilizers in farming, and mechanize farm work. If we industrialize agriculture, we can develop the rural economy into a large-scale economy based on modern machinery and technology and rapidly increase agricultural production; remove differences in agricultural labor and industrial labor; and liberate peasants from heavy labor. Industrializing agriculture is an indispensable task to ultimately resolve the rural question. First, because this can meet material preconditions for resolving the rural question. As the "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question" points out, a slow increase in agriculture's productive forces is an important factor that gives rise to backwardness in rural areas compared to urban areas. A socialist society is an advanced society based on superior socialist relations in production and a high material and technological base. If we are to consolidate the socialist system and fully display its superiority, we must continuously expand and strengthen socialist relations in production and improve the material and technological base to a high level required under socialism. A victory of the socialist revolution in urban and rural areas makes it possible for socialist relations in production to prevail dominantly in rural areas. A high material and technological base that can highly display the superiority of the socialist system does not automatically result from a victory in the socialist revolution. If we are to further consolidate the established socialist rural economic system, fully display its superiority, and achieve a complete victory of socialism, we must continuously develop the technological revolution on a higher level and build a strong material and technological base of the rural economy, even when the socialist system has been established. Industrializing agriculture is a fundamental way to build a strong material and technological base of agriculture to comply with the innate demands of the socialist rural economic system. Industrializing agriculture continuously makes it possible to carry out the technological revolution, equip the rural economy with modern machinery and technology, widely apply the latest achievements of agricultural science to farming, and, thus build a strong material and technological base of the rural economy and eliminate the slow increase in agriculture's productive forces compared to the industrial sector. Today, our country has vigorously carried out the rural technological revolution under the party's wise leadership, and, as a result, peasants are farming using science and technology and working more easily and joyfully. The work to build irrigation systems and use electric equipment in farming has already been completed, the work to comprehensively mechanize farm work and use chemical fertilizers in farming has been implemented on a high level, and the chuche farming method has been implemented. As a result, agricultural production is being developed rapidly based on modern science and technology. Agricultural productive forces have improved to the level of those of the industrial sector, and the gap between industrial labor and agricultural labor is being narrowed significantly. These achievements are a material basis for ultimately resolving the rural question. Second, industrializing agriculture is an indispensable task because this will quickly fulfill ideological requirements for resolving the rural question. The ideological reform of people is closely related to the material basis. People's ideology and will are affected by the material conditions of society to a certain extent. Labor activities are a basic sphere of people's lives. Eliminating the fundamental difference between peasants' labor activities and those of workers in other fields and liberating peasants from heavy labor will make peasants lead more independent and creative lives and endlessly demonstrate their positive creativity and revolutionary ardor. When peasants are liberated from heavy labor and their lives become more independent and creative, they will more positively play their role of masters in rural construction and vigorously accelerate socialist rural construction. When agriculture is industrialized, all processes in agricultural production will completely become technological processes, just like in industrial production. This is a favorable development that can change peasants' working conditions and their lives and more rapidly reform their idea and will into the working class' advanced ideology. Consequently, industrializing agriculture plays an important role in promoting an environment for resolving the rural question. In this way, industrializing agriculture strengthens a material and technological basis in rural areas, eliminates a gap between increases in agriculture's productive forces and increases in the industrial sector's productive forces, and, consequently, plays an important role in ultimately resolving the rural question. We must vigorously carry out the technological revolution in rural areas and, thus, consolidate the previous achievements and complete the industrialization of agriculture.
