The role of a second-rate supernumerary waiting in the lobby to find out what decisions are being made at NATO Headquarters is not a suitable one for Russia. The supporters of joining NATO on the terms formulated by the Americans in the "Partnership for Peace" concept proceed on the basis that the alternative is unacceptable. Fourteen states, including Ukraine, Moldavia [Moldova], and Georgia, have already signed applications to join NATO. If Russia misses its chance, they say, it will find itself internationally isolated. As events in Sarajevo and Gorazde have shown, there is currently "no real coordination" and the NATO powers are "staking a claim to a monopoly on decisionmaking." We do not need that kind of "partnership," Yuriy Ushakov, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's All-European Cooperation Department, said. He argued that it would be easier to combat this evil from within the Atlantic bloc rather than on the outside. A similar line of thinking was followed by Major General Pavel Zolotarev, a Defense Ministry representative, who believes that it is impossible to expect the NATO bloc to disband itself, "even if we try to flex our muscles"; therefore it would be better for Russia to take part in the process of moving our former enemies "away from containment through deterrence [sderzhivaniye cherez ustrasheniye] to containment through partnership." If we remain on the sidelines, Russia will be "distanced from the integration processes in Europe" and play into the hands of those circles who would like to "turn NATO into a closed anti-Russian bloc." The general referred to the lack of a mechanism for military cooperation with the Atlantic alliance, but reassured those who are afraid of NATO attempting to "discipline" Russia or, even more, of our soldiers being placed under the command of U.S. or German generals. The most determined opponents' objections were summarized in an anonymous note issued to everyone, which stated that "Partnership for Peace" had been dreamed up to "preserve and further strengthen (expand) NATO, to establish the bloc's strategic influence in East Europe, and to move its front lines right up to the borders of the Commonwealth states and, in particular, Russia." The debate discussed the correlation between the commitments which Russia would have to make to NATO and the commitments it has already made under the Treaty on Collective Security within the CIS. The military threat to Russia currently comes not from the West but from within the Commonwealth, which dictates our regional security priorities, General Leonid Ivashov of the CIS Military Cooperation Coordination Headquarters, stated. Weightier arguments "against" were voiced by Lieutenant General Aleksandr Tymko, chief of the Border Guards Main Staff, who viewed the problem in a purely professional light -- NATO "will be striving to reach Russia's borders." In his opinion, the growing Estonian territorial claims on Russia, Lithuania's disagreement with the line of the border, the increasing activeness of extremist groupings, and the development of special subdivisions in the Baltic countries should be taken into account. It cannot be ruled out that "partnership" with the West European powers would destroy the CIS countries' collective security system. Gennadiy Yampolskiy, leader of the State Committee for the Defense Industry, recalled that military production in the country had fallen five-fold, and Russian arms exports amount to just over $2 billion -- 15 times less than the U.S. figure. There is keener competition on the arms markets, lobbyist methods are being used against Russian producers, the Missile Technology Control Regime is being exploited, and Western firms are trying to win orders from East European countries for the modernization of old Soviet weapons. Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the CIS Affairs Committee and the organizer of the debates, considered it necessary to note that the timing for joining the "Partnership for Peace" program had been badly chosen; the fears of being isolated take no account of the Eurasian nature of the Russian Federation -- something which he called "political color blindness." We are not being allowed access to the new "distribution of labor" in arms markets, which makes us suspect our partners of "putting out a contract to kill" the Russian military-industrial complex. Judging by the results of the hearings, the Duma will make the following recommendations -- that there should be no rush to join NATO in this currently undefined way; that, as a minimum, talks should be held on the entire range of military-technical aspects of cooperation; and that a decree on the compulsory ratification of the act governing Russia's accession to the "Partnership for Peace" program be adopted as a federal law. Subsequently, as Zatulin put it, work will have to be done to ensure that "all the relics of the `cold war' are consigned to the archives -- that is, not only the Warsaw Pact, but NATO as well."
