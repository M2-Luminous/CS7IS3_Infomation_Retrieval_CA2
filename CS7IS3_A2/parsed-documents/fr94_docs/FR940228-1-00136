(4) An institution whose participation in the FFEL programs ends under paragraph (c)(1) of this section may not participate in the FFEL programs until the institution_ (i) Receives notification from the Secretary that the notice ending the institution's participation is withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) of this section; or (ii) Following the period described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, satisfies the Secretary that the institution meets all requirements for participation in the FFEL programs and executes a new agreement with the Secretary for participation in the FFEL programs. (5) If the Secretary withdraws the notification of an institution's loss of participation pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the participation of the institution is restored effective as of the date that the institution received notification from the Secretary of the loss of participation. (6) Until July 1, 1994, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply to a historically black college or university within the meaning of section 322(2) of the HEA, a tribally controlled community college within the meaning of section 2(a)(4) of the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. 1801(a)(4)), or a Navajo community college under the Navajo Community College Act (25 U.S.C. 640a&hyph;640c). (7)(i) If the Secretary's designated department official receives written notice from an institution whose participation ends under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, within seven calendar days from the date on which the institution receives notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, that the institution intends to appeal the end of participation under paragraph (d) of this section, the institution may, notwithstanding ยง668.26(d) continue to participate in the FFEL programs until no later than the 30th calendar day following the date on which the institution receives notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section. (ii) If an institution satisfies the conditions in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section for participating in the FFEL programs until the 30th calendar day following the date on which the institution receives notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the institution may, notwithstanding ยง668.26(d), continue to participate in the FFEL programs after that date, until the Secretary issues a decision on the institution's appeal, if the institution, by the 30th calendar day following the date on which the institution receives notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, files an appeal that is complete in all respects in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. However, the appeal of an institution relying on paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section is not considered incomplete by virtue of a guaranty agency's not having yet complied with_or having failed to comply with_34 CFR 682.401(b)(14), which requires the agency to respond to an institution's request for verification of data within 15 working days, if the institution submitted that request within 10 working days from the date on which the institution received notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and the institution simultaneously submitted a copy of that request to the Secretary's designated Department official. When the institution receives the guaranty agency's response, to complete its appeal, the institution must submit the verified data to the Secretary's designated Department official within five working days in order to continue participating in the FFEL programs until the Secretary issues a decision on the institution's appeal.
