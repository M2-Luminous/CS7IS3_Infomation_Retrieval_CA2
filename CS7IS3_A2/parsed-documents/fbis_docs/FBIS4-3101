FBIS4-3101 "drchi074_n_94020" FBIS-CHI-94-074 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 Economic & Agricultural Steel Output, Imports Rise in First Quarter Steel Output, Imports Rise in First Quarter HK1604053594 Beijing CHINA DAILY in English 16 Apr 94 p 1 HK1604053594 Beijing CHINA DAILY English BFN [By staff reporter Pei Jianeng: "Output of Steel Rises by 7.6 Percent in 1st Quarter"] [Text] Steel output reached 22.95 million tons in the first quarter of this year, 7.66 percent more than the same period last year, it was revealed yesterday. China produced 20.29 million tons of rolled steel and 22.14 million tons of iron from January to March, increases of 9.47 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively, according to figures from the Metallurgical Industry Ministry. However, the output of iron ore, reported at 48.7 million tons, fell below the ministry's production target, officials said. But the general increase in output was accompanied by a rise in product quality, the officials added. The ratio of advanced continuous casting--a symbol of technical capacity in steel making--also rose, from last year's 32.82 percent of steel output to 38.62 percent, in the first quarter of this year. Manufacturers' profits and taxes also increased markedly during the first quarter, going up 16.7 percent over last year. China produced 88.3 million tons of steel last year making it the world's second biggest producer, behind only Japan. This year the target is 93 million tons and officials are optimistic about the chances of hitting the target. In the first two months of the year, China imported 2.3 million tons of rolled steel, 8.1 percent more than the same period last year. Meanwhile, it exported 150,000 tons of rolled steel, an increase of 57 percent. Although the government lifted the price ceilings of steel products at the beginning of this year, market prices have remained stable as supply and demand are roughly balanced, officials said. It is expected that China's total demand for rolled steel will hit 100 million tons this year. About 90 million tons will be supplied by domestic production and stockpiles. Officials said China still needs to import about 1O million tons of rolled steel this year. Last year it imported a record 30.26 million tons of rolled steel because of overheated investment in fixed assets. Officials said a shortage of capital is still the biggest headache for domestic steel makers. And the new tax burdens imposed on iron mines may cause most of them to lose money this year, officials said, adding that the transport bottleneck will also affect steel production, One of China's major steel makers, the Beijing-based Shougang Group, produced 1.85 million tons of steel and 1.47 million tons of iron in the first quarter, respective increases of 29 and 33.78 percent.
