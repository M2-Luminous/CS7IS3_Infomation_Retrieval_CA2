Civil Administration officials gave al-Natshah and his colleagues a report about the municipality's financial situation and other documents. Al-Natshah then went to the municipality offices and began discharging his duties. He told our correspondent Moti Amir that he had asked the Civil Administration to remove the curfew and the closure on Hebron in order to ease the lot of the population, and that the Israeli officials had promised him they would look into the matter. The outgoing mayor, who had been appointed by the Civil Administration and discharged his job until this morning, was asked to vacate his office and hand it over to al-Natshah.
