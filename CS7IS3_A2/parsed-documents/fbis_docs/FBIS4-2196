But now, taking the dive has become a daily occurrence. Last year, tens of thousands of technicians in economically strong east China broke their "iron rice bowls" and found jobs in enterprises not run by the state. Experts held the enforcement of retirement insurance as one of the determining factors in this conceptual revolution, as people in collective or private businesses can also draw old-age pensions. It is a far cry from the old labor insurance regulations, which were drawn up in the early 1950s and providing that only the staff in state enterprises could enjoy free medical treatment and old-age pensions. So far, 85 million employees throughout the country have taken out the new retirement insurance. The new system, under which premiums are shared between the government, employers and retirees, has covered more than 500,000 businesses, giving benefits to 17 million retirees. In 1990, trial operation of the new pension insurance started in Nanchang, capital of east China's Jiangxi Province. Seeing its initial success, over 300 cities have followed suit. As early as three years ago, over 90 percent of Nanchang's enterprises and 500,000 people were included in the system. Now, about 90,000 persons have retired on an annual pension of 20 million yuan raised in the new way. People welcome the new rules, for they have removed or reduced an obstacle to changing jobs. Statistics show that from January to August last year, 70 percent of over 10,000 job hunters in Nanchang city streamed into non-state firms. And more than 3,000 engineers and managers flowed to township businesses in Zhejiang Province. Even people in state-owned enterprises have realized that the system can help them hold the "iron rice bowl" more firmly. For example, workers in the Nanchang No. 1 Linen Textile Factory, which suffered losses for several successive years, have had a hard time, while the retired can obtain full pension from the municipal social insurance bureau. Xiong Xiaofeng, an official with the city's labor bureau, surmised that China's fast developing market economy has necessitated the system. At present, the insurance sector in Nanchang has extended into such areas as unemployment, maternity and industrial injury coverage. Last year, the city paid two million yuan in compensation to 900 lying-in women, people injured on the job and people out of work. Xiong said that there is a long way to go for China to set up a sound insurance system, to relieve the heavy financial burden on enterprises which have to cover big-number medical bills and old-age pensions for their employees.
