The SEF delegation will stay near Qiandao Lake for two days [words indistinct] to Hangzhou Thursday. During their stay, they will inspect the boat on which 24 Taiwan tourists and eight mainlanders were robbed and murdered while on a lake cruise. SEF Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Hui-yu, in summing up the talks on the first day Monday, said only that he had to see relevant exhibits before he could continue to discuss the matter with ARATS authorities. He said that at the present stage, SEF could only say it was trying to learn more about the incident. SEF and ARATS are non-official conduits set up to conduct cross- strait relations in the absence of official ties. During the first day of talks on the crime, the mainland maintained that only three suspects took part in the robbery and murder and no members of the mainland military were involved. The three attempted to blow up the ship after the killings, but failed, the mainland said. Ji Shaoyan, a Hangzhou coroner, insisted that no bullet or other wounds were found on any one of the victims. He said that all the victims suffocated from carbon monoxide poisoning when explosives were thrown into a tiny 17-square-meter space on the lower deck of the boat into which all the victims were herded at guns' point earlier. He said that some of the bodies were so badly burned that the heads fell off the bodies when the victims were removed from the ship. The SEF delegation, comprised of SEF officials, criminologists, and representatives of the victims, posed more than 200 questions surrounding the incident during the first day. ARATS used a briefing, videotape, slides and question and answer sessions to explain the incident. Representatives of the victims were dismayed after hearing the briefing and the videotape on the aftermath of Qiandao Lake incident. SEF Deputy Secretary-General Hsu also said that SEF was disappointed after not being allowed to meet with witnesses and suspects in the case.
