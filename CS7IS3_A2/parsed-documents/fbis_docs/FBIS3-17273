The talks will resume next week. They will be mediated by Russian troubleshooter Vitaliy Churkin, U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith and EU and UN representatives. In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Churkin praised the activity of the mediators whose efforts have helped the sides pull through the hardest stages of the talks. Although no formal decision was adopted, progress is obvious, he added. Churkin said that "previously, such meetings focused only on local truces on the line of engagement. Now we are seeking full disengagement of troops to rule out aimed fire along the front that stretches for several hundred kilometers." "The terrain where the disengagement line should run is very difficult, while the situation, from the military and psychological point of view, bears the burden of two-year hostilities. Considering the three-month break in the negotiation process, it was impossible to reach the pace allowing us to finish the meeting in just one day," the Russian diplomat said. With a week to go before the next round of talks, the sides will iron out technical details and think over their arguments and position once again. "Today's meeting has helped speed up the whole process of settlement in former Yugoslavia and I hope that this week we will be able to reach more progress in two directions -- the Bosnian issue and Serb-Croat relations," Churkin said. "The discussion was rather concrete and to the point. I think we will be able to maintain this approach at the second round of talks scheduled for March 29," he concluded.
