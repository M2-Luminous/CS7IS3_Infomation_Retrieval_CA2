The People's Bank of China granted $140 million of an Asian Development Bank loan to the Tangshan and Chengde city people's governments. Of this sum, Tangshan will take $85 million and Chengde will take $55 million. This time, Tangshan will use this Asian Development Bank loan for carrying out a group of projects for improving the city environment, including the gas supply and transmission project of the city gas company, the heating supply project of the city heating company in the central district, and four other projects. Chengde city will use this loan to build the coking gas project. Upon completion, the industrial sector and citizens may replace coal with gas, the daily gas supply may reach 470,000 cubic meters, about 80 percent of citizens may have gas supply, and all the produced metallurgical coke will be supplied to Chengde Iron and Steel Company. Thus, we may have gas supply in these two cities and fundamentally solve the pollution problems in these famous historical and cultural cities.
