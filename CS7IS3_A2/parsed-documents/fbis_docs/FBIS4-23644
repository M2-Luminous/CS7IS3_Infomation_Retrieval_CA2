One of the most important processes that has taken place since this Cabinet was formed was the discussion and the inputs with regard to the president's state of the nation address. It was an important moment because here you have three different parties within the Cabinet, the result of the particular contest of the election. And, for the first time, we all of us had to sit and say: Is there anything that binds us together sitting here? Is there a common basis on which we can operate as a Cabinet? We began to address the question: What is this Government of National Unity [GNU]? On agreement so far in Cabinet. We have now, all of us, agreed that the country needs reconstruction and development, that you can't come into Government just to run a bureaucracy, to keep things ticking over. That if this GNU is to mean anything, it's got to have a visible effect. Everybody said fine, and then there was agreement on important detailed elements -- where the president said let's get these particular programmes going in the next 100 days to signal a serious intent to change the country for the better. It gives everybody common purpose. That was the first test of the unity concept. On his relationship with ministries. Every day I am in contact with a lot of the Ministers, not just ANC Ministers. A Minister might want a decision, and might call or send a note to say what do you think. And it is possible to judge and say it sounds right, or it doesn't sound right, because there is a broad framework. Ministers have no problem with that contact regardless of the parties to which they belong. I think the relations are very good. I don't think anybody feels they are being used by another party. On dealing with disagreements. Matters that could have been contentious have been dealt with in this co-operative spirit. For instance, the Ingonyama Trust business, the land issue. It was dealt with in a very open manner, no fights, and a quite serious intent to say this is what happened, let's go into it. Because we have a basic context, you can deal with the matter. It's not a case of one party getting advantaged or whatever. It's a question of whether we can sustain this decision, or not. I'm saying nobody feels threatened. Generally within the Cabinet, there's a great deal of co-operation. On co-operation between ministries. Take the question of the release of children and juveniles, the amnesty question and so on. You would find the Minister of Justice, Dullar Omar, and the Minister of Correctional Services, Sipho Mzimela, dealing with it together a lot of the time -- one from the ANC, one from the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], working together very well, joint presentations to Cabinet and so on. I think the same is true of the relationship between the two deputy presidents. I've always had a good relationship with him (F.W. de Klerk) and that's not changed. On how De Klerk is adjusting to his new role. I think he is adjusting. Clearly, you would not believe me if I said he was not conscious of having (formerly) been the leader -- of course he is -- but I think he accepts the fact that Nelson Mandela is president, with that constitutional role. But I think he also accepts that, apart from constitutions, this is the leader of this country in more ways than are defined on paper. He accepts that, and I think he accepts that he comes from a minority party. But of course you will see that he is in the process of adjustment. On how Mangosuthu Buthelezi is adjusting to his new role. We sit next to each other in the Cabinet, so we are always whispering things to each other. I haven't had a sense of him needing to adjust as much as Mr de Klerk. He has walked in as a Cabinet Minister, he has his portfolio, and he behaves like all other Ministers. On the new Government's priority. Underlying everything is actually changing the conditions of life of the people of the country, in every way. Whether in terms of providing jobs, clean water, better health, education and so on, this has to be the main thrust. On the role of deputy presidents. We carry out tasks to assist the president. As of now we have a decision to establish at least three Cabinet committees, which will do a lot of preparatory work for Cabinet meetings. You've got a Cabinet committee, for instance, which will deal with security and intelligence matters, one which will deal with economic matters, another to deal with social and administrative questions. And the chairpersonship of those committees will be distributed between the president and his deputy presidents. On the first and second deputy presidents. The constitution does not talk about first and second deputies, it talks about a deputy president from the majority party and a deputy president from the minority party. Clearly, in political terms, the deputy president from the majority party represents the majority. (President Mandela) uses the terms first and second deputies because that is the political reality, but the constitution does not say that. The constitution says that Cabinet meetings, in the absence of the president, would be chaired on an alternating basis by the deputies, but that is all it says. The rest is really up to the president to decide. On Constand Viljoen's role until now. Constand Viljoen is an important political figure. We very deeply appreciated his courage in saying that to the extent that there was a peaceful constitutional way of addressing issues, that is the way they should go. We were sensitive to the fact that there were many people on the right wing who were very vocal, very threatening, who were putting on a lot of pressure to take another route. We thought it was an important act of statesmanship that he took the route he took. On Viljoen's future role. We would want to respect the opinion he represents. It might not be massive in terms of numbers, but we would want to ensure that he plays his own role in terms of this making of the new South Africa. Sure, if they had had the numbers, it would have been very good to have him in the Cabinet. But the role of a Constand Viljoen, beyond what is provided for in the constitution, is something that must continue to receive some consideration. On his own role in Cabinet appointments. The Cabinet was chosen by the president. There was a meeting, for instance, of the NEC [National Executive Committee] of the ANC just before the elections. It was agreed that the president would choose the Cabinet, and of course would consult as he wished. I know for a fact that he consulted many people -- the leadership of COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], the SACP [South African Communist Party], individuals, myself as an individual. And in terms of the constitution he consulted De Klerk, Buthelezi and so on. There isn't any particular person -- certainly not me -- who was the determining factor in terms of the selection of the Cabinet and the deputy ministers. On his view of the Cabinet. I think it's a very good Cabinet, and I personally don't agree with the criticisms of some people. If you take, for instance, the Foreign Minister (Alfred Nzo), if you look at the Cabinet as it stands now, you would find very few people who have had as much exposure in terms of foreign affairs as he has. You should look at his own history. On rumours that he effectively runs the foreign ministry. No. I think it really wouldn't matter who had been appointed foreign minister -- we would have to come to their assistance. The fact of the matter is that I was in charge of the ANC's international relations for I don't know how many years, and therefore am most familiar with current foreign policy positions. It doesn't really matter who you would have chosen, the same thing would have happened. On Cyril Ramaphosa's absence from the Cabinet. Well, for some time we had been discussing the possible impact of the election, the formation of a Government, Parliament, and all that, on the functioning of the ANC. There were three major deployments that had to be done. One to Parliament, Government and Cabinet. Another to the public service and the army. The third to the ANC. Clearly, all three areas were important. It is in that context that Cyril has been saying for quite some time that he thought, as secretary-general of the ANC, he needed to be among those people who would stay in the ANC and therefore not have any other responsibility. I have discussed the question with Cyril since the end of last year, when he raised it. And he persisted with that position, up to now. On whether Ramaphosa's position might change. It's a continuing challenge. Personally, I have no role in deploying people. But I don't think this matter generally has been resolved in terms of the ANC. I think we have to continue looking at the question of that deployment, and might have indeed to redeploy people as we see what is happening. Whether out of Parliament to other positions, and so on. So it's a continuing responsibility. That kind of thing is going to happen, and I think we should read it straight, as it is. It is quite a challenge to the ANC. I'm personally quite convinced that in the whole process of making sure that we have rational and effective deployment of people, you make sure of effective participation in all three areas. You foresee certain things and prepare for them, but in the actual practice, as you begin to work, experience will tell you something. I would imagine personally that there will still be a shifting around of people. People could be redeployed. On whether he now sees himself as heir-apparent to Mandela. No, no, no. You see, Nelson Mandela is president of the ANC and he is president of this country. That is all there is to this matter. On how long the post-election honeymoon will last. I think the honeymoon arises from the expectation that things will change for the better. I think it's necessary and possible to sustain that optimism among people by actually bringing about that change. Its the urgent responsibility of the Government to show visible results. And I think we can and shall. People will begin to see movement as far as informal settlements are concerned, houses being built, children and expectant mothers getting free treatment in hospitals. I think things will happen -- they have to happen, to change the country for the better. I think that so long as the Government sticks to its promises in terms of that delivery, that mood of optimism will persist. This is not to say that there are not going to be hiccups and explosions, but there is so much that needs to be changed for the better -- and the potential for changing things for the better is so big that we ourselves have not even quite understood the potential energy that resides among our people, which will be set free by these changes. So I don't think we are in for a short honeymoon period -- unless the Government doesn't do its work. On the controversy over politicians's salaries. The Melament Commission was set up by the TEC [Transitional Executive Committee] to look at the whole question, because there were no rules. At the end of this month, if there hadn't been something like this, none of the MPs would have been paid. So the Melament Commission was set up as a temporary emergency measure, and they've made their recommendations and also drafted a Bill to create a new salaries commission, remuneration commission, to look at the question again. So the Melament Commission recommendations are very temporary. What they have said will be replaced by what will come out of the other commission which will be appointed. On the peaceful nature of the election and inauguration. We had been dealing with the potential for violence for quite some time. In 1986 I had a discussion with the-then chairman of the Broederbond, Mr de Lange. We have dealt with this matter with the IFP for a long time, and in discussions with the Afrikaner Volksfront. Even later than that, with the police. Three weeks before the elections senior police officers came to see me. I had wanted to see them also, and so we sat and discussed the need to secure the elections to make sure that there was no violence. We set up a joint task force which then met every day. So by the time we came to election day we were quite familiar with where the problems might come from. There was a danger that there might be an eruption somewhere, but I think the positions that were taken up by the Freedom Front and by the police (made a big difference).
