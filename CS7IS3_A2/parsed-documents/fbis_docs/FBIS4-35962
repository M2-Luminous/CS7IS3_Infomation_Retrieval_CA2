The meeting in the northern Iraqi town of Irbil took place at the initiative of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), a coalition of Arab and Kurdish groups opposed to President Saddam Husayn. The INC announced after the talks that a new joint operation room was being formed to implement a ceasefire between Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The PUK leader, abroad when the fighting broke out in early May, was airlifted back to northern Iraq last week on board a Turkish helicopter to overfly KDP-controlled areas. After several ceasefire accords, calm returned to most of Iraqi Kurdistan at the end of May. But fresh clashes erupted Saturday in the regions of Halabjah and Qal'at al-Dizah, near the Iranian border, according to the CNI. The CNI says more than 600 people are believed to been killed in the power struggle between the PUK and KDP, which have controlled northern Iraq in defiance of Baghdad since the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War.
