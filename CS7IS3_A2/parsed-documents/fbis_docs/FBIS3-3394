Tremendous achievements have been made in the work since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. In particular, since reform and opening up, the party and government have taken various measures to strengthen work for helping the poor. For example, funds have been increased and traditional means of helping the poor have been readjusted and improved to change the nature of such work from a relief to a development orientation. It has been proven in practice that implementing development-oriented work for aiding the poor by taking into account market demand, relying on scientific and technological progress, as well as developing and utilizing resources of impoverished areas to promote commodity production, not only can solve the problem of inadequate supplies of food and clothing, but can also help get rid of poverty and encourage prosperity. Currently, the measures have fairly rapidly changed the outlook of a considerable number of long impoverished areas. However, as China is a fairly large country with different local situations and unbalanced development, progress in some areas is still fairly slow and a number of people have yet to be extricated from poverty. In particular, a small number of people in especially poor areas are still living under very difficult conditions. Recently, the State Council formulated a program aimed at extricating 80 million people from poverty in seven years, and declared a final war against poverty. During the ongoing two sessions [the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress and the Second Session of the Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee], this station reporter Yang Fan interviewed State Councillor Chen Junsheng, head of the State Council's Leading Group for the Economic Development of Impoverished Areas. Yang Fan: "Mr Chen, I am a reporter from the China National Radio. One of our government's major tasks this year is to help impoverished people. Can you tell us what the government's tasks are in this regard?" Chen Junsheng: "The goal of our program for aiding the poor is to extricate 80 million people from poverty in seven years. We will help them solve the problem of inadequate food and clothing. We will help them get rid of poverty and ultimately become prosperous and achieve a comfortable standard of living. We should not wait until the next century, but must accomplish this task within the present century."
