He added that this, however, is countered by reality because our democratic system is firm and stable. Caldera made this statement during a joint news conference with Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva at the Yellow House. Caldera recalled that recently rumors persistently circulated in the country about his presumed death, which had to stop when all Venezuelans confirmed that he was totally active. [Begin Caldera recording] I am convinced that the democratic system in my country is a firm and stable reality, and will be maintained despite all the rumors unleashed by those who are interested in creating situations of violence and instability, taking advantage of the grave circumstances of an economic crisis. We are all aware of the seriousness of this crisis and we know that we must make great efforts to overcome it. [end recording] Caldera attributed the fall of the bolivar to the wave of rumors, which in turn has increased inflation. [Begin Caldera recording] We are fighting against inflation, but rumors are the main cause for its increase. We are facing a situation of shortages and price fluctuations in which speculators take advantage of any factor or announcement that the inflation rate is up to increase prices to unacceptable levels. We will handle this problem with courage and determination. [end recording] President Caldera said that despite the crisis in the financial system, the fact that foreign investors are still interested in investing in our country is proof that Venezuela will be able to overcome this crisis and reactivate its economy. Meanwhile, Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco Silva said that his country is willing to assist Venezuela under the current circumstances and to strengthen commercial ties between both countries.
