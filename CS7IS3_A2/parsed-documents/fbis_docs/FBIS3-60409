The measures include deferring the date of marriage, terminating pregnancies and sterilization, according to a draft law on eugenics and health protection, which was presented to the current session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee. Explaining the law to participants at an NPC session that opened here today, Minister of Public Health Chen Minzhang said that the measures will help prevent infections and heredity diseases and protect the health of mothers and children. Under the draft law, those having such ailments as hepatitis, venereal disease or mental illness, which can be passed on through birth, will be banned from marrying while carrying the disease. Pregnant women who have been diagnosed as having certain infectious diseases or an abnormal fetus will be advised to halt the pregnancy. Couples in the category should have themselves sterilized, the draft says. China is in urgent need of adopting such a law to put a stop to the prevalence of abnormal births, Minister Chen explained. Statistics show that China now has more than 10 million disabled persons who could have been prevented through better controls. The draft also stipulates that organizations that are engaged in pre-marital checks, eugenics, pre-birth diagnosis or sterilizations should be approved by the authorities at the county level and above. Personnel involved in this area should be subjected to strict training, Chen said. The minister of public health called on medical authorities at various levels to establish a comprehensive network for the implementation of the law. The draft does not state whether China will adopt euthanasia to eliminate congenitally abnormal children, saying that the international community has not come to a conclusion on that issue. The draft also does not touch on the issues of artificial fertilization or test-tube babies because the effects of these techniques have caused some disputes and because it's too early to put any limitations into law, Chen said. Minister Chen said the government should strengthen its control and supervision of these techniques. He called for the Ministry of Public Health to work out tentative management measures of control.
