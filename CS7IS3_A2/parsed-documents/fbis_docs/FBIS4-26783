A group of passengers called in to tell the Beijing-based CCTV, China's only national TV station, that they intended to sue a domestic airline over a delayed flight. Three days after CCTV covered the issue in a peak-hour program called "Focus Moment," the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) put out new rules for airline companies to compensate delayed travelers. "Focus Moment," whose hot-line paging number is publicized nation-wide, received hundreds of telephone calls from all over the country. Zhang Haichao, producer of the program, said that it is one of the most popular programs in the capital because ordinary people want to have their own voices on the air. Like CCTV, all TV and radio stations in Beijing are government sponsored. Most of them have broadcast phone-in programs in the past two years, which enjoyed wide popularity that promises good returns. Wang Liang, director of the Beijing Communications Radio Station, said that these programs are encouraged by the government because they are "close to the people and to life." The government has stipulated that in a market economy, the media must operate both with good social efficacy and good economic returns. Wang, former director of the Beijing Economic Radio Station, opened the first live phone-in broadcast program in Beijing a few years ago. He said that in such a program, the studio speakers are open to questions from all kinds of people, regardless of the callers' age, literacy or background. People found a vent for their anger at some problems in daily life through such phone-ins. Recently, many people called in to the traffic radio station to complain about chronical traffic jams at a busy fly-over in west Beijing. The radio station reported: "the bridge design is inefficient," and it suggested drivers should go by other routes. Many people took the advice and the jam at the bridge improved. The complaints have dropped off. Most of the radio and TV stations learn in what topic the audience are most interested through letters and phone calls. They also do regular or occasional surveys to see what is their share of the potential audience. Some hot-line programs are done from the site of an incident, so people can get information from the background sounds and pictures. Sometimes, candid cameras are used to record illicit activities. Beijing residents like these programs better than the others. A CCTV survey showed that its hot-line program "Oriental Time and Space" has the second slot in audience rating among all its programs, beaten only by the news.
