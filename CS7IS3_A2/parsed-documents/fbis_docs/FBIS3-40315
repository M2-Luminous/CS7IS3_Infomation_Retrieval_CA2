Kucan talked with the editor and answered listeners' questions. With regard to Mrs. Albright's invitation for Slovenia to join the Partnership for Peace program within the NATO framework, which was also the topic of yesterday's talks between President Kucan and U.S. Ambassador Wendt, Kucan emphasized that the NATO Council will make the final decision. It will not only debate the military aspect of the partnership but will also evaluate the openness of the Slovene economy and the human rights situation in our country. The president hopes that we will pass these "entrance" exams. He noted only one possible deterrent: We still do not have civilian control over the military sector. With regard to Slovene relations with the Balkans, he thinks it is necessary for Slovenia to formulate a clear strategy towards this area now and not to wait until the end of the war when it would be ineffective. Referring to the Geneva agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, Kucan did not see any reason for optimism if this is only an agreement between two partners at the expense of the third one, that is, at the expense of Bosnia and the Muslims. Referring to new party alliances in Slovenia, he said that it is a natural tendency for the parties to unite and form alliances. He expects a merger of the parties on the right and in the center of the political spectrum in the near future while nobody wants to be on the left yet. He is concerned by the trend to polarize the political arena, to divide the people between "ours" and "yours," "red" and "black." Evaluating the effort to create an independent Slovene state, he said that, accordingto the European standards, we succeeded. However, now that we have to organize life in a state that is law-abiding and socially responsible, a will to define a common interest and common vision seems to be lacking. In his assessment, people in power are not sufficiently aware that, in the final analysis, all the government's decisions must serve the people. Responding to the question as to whether he, as a president, is suing somebody at a time when this seems to be the "fashion," he stated that he is not suing anybody, although he would have reasons to seek moral satisfaction; however, he does not want to solve political disputes in court since the courts have a backlog already.
