Velika Kladusa has been experiencing unprecedented terror and (?suffering) under the veil of [word indistinct] quasi democracy for (?six) months, the appeal states. The peace that was established on 12 January has only partially helped us to alleviate the consequences of Abdic's insane idea. We are most concerned by the fact that our town, your town, is now full of foreigners, who are pushing arms into people's hands, people who, for their own aims, have caused a fratricidal war. The arms that they have pushed into people's hands will always be an obstacle to peace and therefore we should listen to reason. The appeal further states that Velika Kladusa has been burdened by about 2,000 orphans since 3 October last year, children whose fathers have been killed. They were forced into a struggle for some kind of a quasi state. There are many more children in this region who are without fathers. This should be a warning to listen to reason and find a peaceful settlement of the crisis, the appeal of the Velika Kladusa War Presidency states, asking its citizens, particularly members of the paramilitary formations, to be sensible and place themselves under the command of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina by 10 February of this year.
