Report on Activities Carried Out Between the Third and Fourth Sessions of the Central Committee 16. In assessing activities carried out by the Frelimo Party between the third and fourth sessions, the Central Committee made important decisions to improve the functioning of party organs at this stage of important political, economic, social, and cultural transformations promoted by the Frelimo Party. 17. Thus, the Frelimo Central Committee decided to systematically and suitably upgrade the party's working methods in all echelons. 18. It recommended the continued adoption of working mechanisms and methods at all levels of party structures to guarantee that individual members produce a better collective work, leading to a more active intervention, permanently affecting each militant and sympathizer, as well as all social layers, so that they may join Frelimo and actively participate in the building of a society of peace, justice, and progress. 19. The session stated the need for improved vertical and horizontal communication among all party organs. 20. Taking into account the need to train Frelimo Party members and sympathizers for a more effective and mobilizing role in the implementation of its tasks in the community, the Central Committee decided to take measures to increase production and timely dissemination of study material, information, and propaganda. 21. The demand for a greater coordination between the party and the government at all levels was strengthened with a view to improving the operation and effectiveness of party and government activities in society. 22. In view of demands posed by the electoral campaign and the need to increase the party's ability to respond to ongoing challenges, the Central Committee decided that it was urgent and fundamental to strengthen the Central Committee Secretariat and the Provincial Committee Secretariats, recommending the Political Commission and provincial committees adopt appropriate measures. 23. The Frelimo Party Central Committee noted with satisfaction the significant growth in members who joined the party ranks since its last session as a unequivocal sign of the mobilizing capacity of its members and the prestige Frelimo enjoys among the Mozambican people. 24. The Central Committee urged all its members to redouble their efforts and actively participate in each cell, in working places, and in residences to ensure the continued popularity of the party and a convincing victory in the October 1994 elections. 25. The fourth session also recommended the intensification of cadre training activities in a pragmatic way, taking into account the aims, needs, and priorities of the party. 26. Taking into account the necessary funds for the success of Frelimo's electoral campaign, the Central Committee: A. Recommended all party cells and committees at various levels immediately begin fund raising campaigns; B. Urged all party members to pay their fees as stated in the directive on payment of fees; C. Encouraged all party organs to use and manage party property in an austere manner. 27. Taking into account the level of relationship, friendship, cooperation, and solidarity with friendly parties, the Central Committee recommended the strengthening of such relations, and the mobilization of assistance for the holding of our party's electoral campaign. 28. Taking into account the domestic and foreign factors affecting Mozambique's socioeconomic development, the Frelimo Party Central Committee saluted the achievements of the Mozambican Government in the fulfillment of the main activities provided for in the government's program of action since the holding of the Third Frelimo Party Central Committee Session. 29. The Central Committee urged the government to continue its efforts to implement the General Peace Accord, and the activities planned for national reconstruction and normalization of life in the country. 30. The Frelimo Party Central Committee also urged the government to speed up the implementation of measures to ease the hardships resulting from the implementation of the Economic and Social Rehabilitation Program, particularly among the lower income brackets. 31.

Establishment of mechanisms leading to improved management and use of land, and the speedy solution of land disputes. 32.

The Central Committee also saluted the initiatives of the people in support of demobilized soldiers and returnees, particularly their integration into social and economic structures. 34. The Central Committee noted that the people responded positively to the appeal for an increase in agricultural production during the 1992-93 season, though the problems they faced in the bartering of products did not permit the surplus of a number of regions to reduce the shortages of others. 35. The Central Committee urged the government to take measures and adopt mechanisms that will lead to the timely intervention of businessmen in the bartering of products to encourage agricultural production. 36.

The Current Situation of the Peace Process 46. The Central Committee assessed the report on the current situation of the peace process and noted that: A. The Mozambican Government continues to strictly implement the General Peace Accord. B. Although the international community has been assisting in the implementation of the General Peace Accord and in the democratization of Mozambican society, the Frelimo Central Committee noted with concern a number of patronizing attitudes toward Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] by some members of the international community, as well as actions likely to downplay the seriousness of the violations of the General Peace Accord, and to underestimate maneuvers for the nonimplementation of agreed timetables by that armed movement. C. In open contradiction with its public statements on the upholding of democracy and rights, Renamo continues to: - Ban the movement of citizens in areas under its control, thus violating the General Peace Accord and the Constitution of the Republic; - Prohibit the carrying out of economic activities -- namely, hunting, fishing, and logging in areas under its control, violating the letter and spirit of the General Peace Accord and the Constitution of the Republic; - Assault and detain citizens, intimidating people with threats of violence both in areas under its control and in other parts of the country, in violation of the fundamental freedom and rights of citizens. E. [as published] Renamo has been confining mostly children, elderly, and disabled people in assembly areas, with no clear-cut explanation about the destination and purpose of its men who are really physically and militarily fit to wage war. F. The Frelimo Central Committee has observed with concern that the weapons delivered by Renamo to Unomoz [UN Operations in Mozambique] are not only old and obsolete, but do not correspond to the principle of one man one weapon. 48. [as published] Aware of the need and the imperative for peace, the Central Committee salutes all efforts made by the government in the search for mechanisms and actions leading to the maintenance of an atmosphere of peace, the upholding of sovereignty and interests of the Mozambican people within the framework of the implementation of the General Peace Accord. 49. The Central Committee cautions against maneuvers likely to prevent legislative and presidential elections from taking place in our country as scheduled in October 1994. Reiterating the need for strictly adhering to that date, the Central Committee urged the government to define measures to: A. Speed up the process of troop confinement; B. Guarantee a real and effective disarmament of all forces; C. Ensure the agreed demobilization of military personnel and promote their reintegration; D. Actively participate in the formation of the new Mozambique defense forces; E. Speed up the minesweeping operation, giving priority to areas to where people are returning; F. Intensify actions to combat crime. 50. The Central Committee salutes the international community's contribution toward the implementation of the General Peace Accord and the deepening of democracy in the country, and appeals for continued actions to ensure the success of its mission in Mozambique, and a more positive Renamo role in the implementation of the General Peace Accord. 51. The Central Committee urges the government to speed up the effective integration of areas under Renamo control in the administration of the Mozambican state, a fact that will contribute to real stability and will permit all parties to carry out their political activities in those areas. Situation in Southern Africa 52. The Frelimo Central Committee expresses its total support of the efforts made by the ANC and other progressive parties in South Africa to hold the first general multiracial elections in an atmosphere of peace and stability in South Africa. Only if the democratic forces representing the true aspirations of the South African people come into power will South Africa become stable and participate effectively in regional cooperation. 53. The Frelimo Party Central Committee salutes the spirit of tolerance shown by the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] and the Angolan Government in the search for solutions leading to the establishment of a lasting peace for Angola and its martyred people. The Central Committee urges UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] to adopt a similar attitude to minimize the suffering of the Angolan people. 54. The Central Committee expresses the hope that the current Malawian political process, characterized by dialogue among the different political forces will produce great achievements, and that that dialogue may lead to the best ways of upholding the interests of the Malawian people. Criterion For Selecting Candidates to Parliament 55. The Frelimo Central Committee reviewed the proposed criterion for the selection of candidates for the Assembly of the Republic for the October 1994 elections and salutes the efforts made by the Electoral Office in the drafting of that document. 56. Taking into account the need to select the finest sons of the Mozambican people to uphold their best aspirations, the Central Committee decided to: A. Accept the registration of people who volunteer as candidates at their committees; B. Ensure the selection of candidates to Frelimo lists in the party's provincial committees. 57. The Frelimo Central Committee decided to give priority to the following people in the composition of its lists: - Mozambican women - Youth - Workers from public and private institutions - Peasants The Frelimo Central Committee also decided to give special importance to the following people in the composition of its lists: - Businessmen - Intellectuals - Combatants - Members of social associations and institutions. 58. In line with Frelimo's tradition of rallying the support of leading sectors of society in the search for the best future for the country, and, in the current circumstances, for the consolidation of peace, the strengthening of national unity, and the promotion of democracy and progress, the Central Committee decided to hold a national meeting of cadres in June 1994. 59. The Frelimo Central Committee decided to hold a special session of the Central Committee in June to assess the level of readiness of the October 1994 campaign. Proposal for the Government's Program for the Post Electoral Period 60. The Frelimo Central Committee assessed the Government's Draft Program for the Post Electoral Period. The draft program will be reviewed, taking into account the contributions made during the current session. The draft program will be submitted to the upcoming special session of the Central Committee. 61. The Central Committee decided to take part in the October 1994 multiparty elections. 62. The Fourth Session of the Central Committee, expressing the highest aspirations and the unequivocal will of all Frelimo members and sympathizers, decided to declare Frelimo Chairman Comrade Joaquim Chissano as a candidate for the post of president of the Republic in the presidential elections to be held in October 1994. 63. The Frelimo Central Committee affectionately salutes all the Mozambican people for their commitment to the various tasks of national reconstruction. The people have given magnificent lessons in reconciliation and building of social harmony in the various parts of the country, of which the reception and social reintegration of displaced persons and returnees, and the tenderness in sheltering orphans and abandoned children are singled out. The Central Committee salutes in particular the youth and women for the enthusiastic manner in which they have taken part in the consolidation of peace, national unity, and in the process of normalization of life. 64. The Central Committee salutes the residents of Matola for the affectionate manner in which they welcome the members of that organ, and for the solidarity expressed in messages addressed to Frelimo. 65. The Central Committee gives thanks for the gifts from the residents of this city in support of the Fourth Session of the Central Committee and the Frelimo electoral campaign. Mozambican people, Frelimo members and sympathizers, women and youth, peasants and workers employed by public and private institutions, soldiers, intellectuals and combatants, teachers and nurses, entrepreneurs, and members of social associations and organizations, the Frelimo Central Committee urges everyone to take part in large numbers in the first general multiparty elections in our country, which we all want to be free and fair. The Frelimo Central Committee urges all Mozambicans to unite around Frelimo for the upholding of peace, sovereignty and territorial integrity, the strengthening of national unity, and the building of a democratic society based on progress and social justice.
