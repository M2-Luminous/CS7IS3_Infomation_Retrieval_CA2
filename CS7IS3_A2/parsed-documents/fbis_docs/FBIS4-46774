Forget about Them!"] [Text] [Mikhaylov] It is known that the government staff has been reorganized. But what has happened to the traditional nomenklatura privileges of the current civil servants? We have fought for so long and fiercely against them that, in principle, we were supposed to have abolished privileges a long time ago... [Katukov] If you will permit me, first about the reorganization of the staff of the Government of the Russian Federation. In our view, the staff has become more compact and significantly more efficient. A number of subdivisions have been eliminated, and now the staff of the Government of Russia consists of 17 departments and three directorates (juridical, organizational-technical, and record-keeping directorates) and the secretariats of the chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation and his deputies. As for "privileges," let us agree on terms. Take a computer, typewriter, or a dictaphone for a journalist--are these privileges, or instruments that are necessary for work? It is generally recognized that "privileges" are a certain kind of additional or above-norm advantages or benefits, if you wish, that have nothing to do with the nature of the work. This relates in different degrees to a worker, a farmer, and an office employee, including a government official. Everything a government official needs, depending on the volume and nature of the work he performs, is stipulated and described in special documents. [Mikhaylov] Telephone apparatuses with special communications were always the pride of the former party nomenklatura. As far as I know, they have not vanished even now. Who has the right today to use "secure government communications" with the state seal on the dial disk? [Katukov] With respect to special communications, the circle of persons who have the right to use it is regulated by the "List of Positions of Managerial Workers of the Russian Federation That Are Furnished Governmental Communications." [Mikhaylov] But precisely what is this kind of communications? [Katukov] Precisely telephones of the government ATS [Automated Telephone Station] that are commonly called "secure government communications," which guarantee confidentiality in conversations both within the bounds of the city of Moscow and between cities (PM-communications--government long-distance). [Mikhaylov] What are the staff salaries of senior government officials now? [Katukov] Staff salaries are established by an authorized staff schedule. In accordance with this document, a federal minister has a salary of 312,000 rubles [R]. The rest of the existing percentage additions to position salary are for difficult and special work regimes and an addition for length of service similar to that which exists in other state institutions and enterprises. [Mikhaylov] And what are the salaries of the president and the prime minister? [Katukov] The staff salary of the president of the Russian Federation is R467,900, and of the chairman of the government--R422,400. Practically no government makes a secret of this, and ours is no exception. [Mikhaylov] To whom in the Government of Russia is a personal car now available? [Katukov] In answering your question, I would like to note immediately that the question concerns official motor vehicle transport exclusively. On the staff of the Government of the Russian Federation this right is possessed by chiefs of departments and directorates, managers of the secretariats of the chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation and his deputies, and assistants (advisers) of the chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation. [Mikhaylov] And the ministers? [Katukov] Federal ministers and the directors of other federal departments of the Russian Federation also have the right to use official motor vehicle transport year round in accordance with the nature and volume of their work. As a rule, this is a Volga GAZ 3102 or GAZ 31029. [Mikhaylov] But some ride in Mercedes? I wonder who? [Katukov] Still fresh in our memory are the times when an enormous number of government ZIL's and Chayka's--which the people called "member-carriers" [chlenovoz]--were driven around Moscow. The picture is different today. It is no secret that the operation of that same armored government ZIL is not comparable to the financial costs of the foreign make that you mentioned and is not in the domestic limousine's favor. The assignment of a Mercedes to higher staff personnel is made through special decisions. This decision was made in the Government of Russia with respect to the first deputy chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation and the managers of federal, commonly so-called "power," ministries and departments: Defense, Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, the Foreign Intelligence Service, and the Federal Counterintelligence Service. [Mikhaylov] And who is supposed to have a security guard? [Katukov] Guaranteeing the safety of senior government officials also presupposes a security guard for the chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation, his deputies, and the managers of the "power" ministries and departments mentioned above. [Mikhaylov] What is happening now with the former fourth Main Directorate of the USSR Ministry of Health? At one time its splendid polyclinics served the party elite. And now? [Katukov] If you have no objection, I would make a correction--not only the "party elite" but also workers of the central staffs of the former CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers. At the present time it is the Medical Center under the Government of the Russian Federation that serves the workers of the central staffs of the Federal Assembly, the president's office, the government, and the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court, and the Court of Arbitration, and, also, as before, a number of institutions of culture, science and education, and specific individuals whose services were especially noted by the state. [Mikhaylov] But what about government dachas? Who is now supposed to get a year-round suburban dacha? [Katukov] The existing "Statute on Procedure for Granting Accommodations for Rest in Dacha Communities and in Pension and Rest Homes" provides for year-round paid use of dachas. This right is given to those officials who also get an official vehicle. The exception are assistants (advisers) to the chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation who are granted rest accommodations in the summer period. [Mikhaylov] And ministers? [Katukov] Ministers and managers of federal organs of the executive branch also have the right to year-round use of dachas that are within the jurisdiction of the administration of affairs of the president of the Russian Federation, but their deputies do not. In addition, the area granted is in accordance with the size of the family, and payment is in cash. [Mikhaylov] What is the situation now with distributors for special clientele? I have in mind special food rations, special sections in GUM [state department store], and special shops. [Katukov] Let us ask ourselves the question: "What is the feasibility of maintaining special clientele distributors, given existing real life in Moscow? After all, practically everything can be bought now in a regular store. There are no longer any kind of special food rations and special sections. The network of shops, it is true, remains. You can have whatever you like made for yourself, but for your own hard-earned money. For example, to have a two-piece suit made costs a client R180-200,000 on the average, regardless of the official's position. [Mikhaylov] Does it not seem to you that for a majority of government officials all these telephones, vehicles, and dachas also give genuine meaning to their activity and are a measure of their success in life? [Katukov] I would not be sincere even with myself if I did not answer unambiguously. Unquestionably, a layer of such civil servants remains on the staff, nevertheless, the main part of the staff of the Government of the Russian Federation consists of respectable people, professionals. For these people, all the things we have talked about are only an instrument in their work--the government communications telephone, the presence or absence of an official motor vehicle, or a dacha, never was and never will be a criterion of their success in life. They could have left a long time ago for "big money" and specifically for the "benefits" that exist in other jobs with their numerous "privileges." It seems to me that what "holds" them here is a feeling of duty, inculcated by years of state service, and an understanding of the fact that their experience and knowledge are necessary now as never before. As for state employees who live with other categories and values in life, the present day indicates that with the emergence of new and increased demands in their work, people like this do not last, and they leave. [Mikhaylov] Do you consider that a government staff employee position is a profession? [Katukov] Actually, this is so. Moreover, I am convinced that this is one of the difficult professions. If for no other reason than that everyone has to master its ABC's on the job; after all, we do not have diplomaed state civil servants, and higher educational institutions do not train them. And, by the way, my first specialty is military doctor. What I am engaged in now in the service is a result of daily training in the school of the government staff over several years. I do not consider it a disgrace to learn and exchange experiences among one's colleagues. [Mikhaylov] What do you think is paramount in this profession? [Katukov] Veracity, a sense of duty, and a sense of obligation.
