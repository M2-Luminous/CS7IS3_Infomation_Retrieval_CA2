The 47-year-old politician is a native of Volgograd and is a graduate of the Volgograd Agricultural Institute and a candidate of technical sciences. He was a senior lecturer at a higher educational institution and secretary of a CPSU district committee in Volgograd and was head of a department in the Central Committee of Polozkov's Communist Party of the RSFSR. He is a leader of the Socialist Workers Party. In the former Supreme Soviet he was cochairman of the Communists of Russia faction and dealt with questions of the work of the soviets and the development of local government. He enjoyed among democrat deputies the reputation of a "communist with whom you could negotiate." He ran for the Duma not from the Socialist Party, which was extremely unsuccessful, but preferred the company of the agrarians, who obviously had a better chance. Ivan Rybkin won the competition for the post of speaker by a one-vote margin. In the democratic milieu, his victory was seen as a sign of a "Red revanche"; in the opposite camp, as the triumph of common sense. For the deputies who did not come into contact with Rybkin in the Supreme Soviet, and for the public at large even more, he remains Mr. X and "the man from nowhere." After a week of the speaker's activity, an OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer asked representatives of a number of Duma factions and groups of deputies to introduce the chairman of the Duma to our readers. Sergey Shakhray (Party of Russian Unity and Accord): I have known Ivan Petrovich for three years and can say that he is for parliament a far more dependable leader than Khasbulatov in the former Supreme Soviet. He is restrained and purposeful. He senses intuitively that, despite the fact that he represents the communist-patriotic spectrum in the Duma, it is, for all that, in the interests of the whole house to support the minority also in order that it too be represented structurally and be heard and participate in debate. He is afraid of allowing a situation where there remain in the Duma only the right wing and where Zhirinovskiy and Travkin take turns at the podium. His stated desire to form in the Duma a political "center" accords fully with ours. The Party of Russian Unity and Accord faction has made at times successful, at times unsuccessful, attempts to create some stratum between the radical wings so that if the speaker's intentions are sincere, we are prepared to interact with him. Nikolay Travkin (Democratic Party of Russia faction): Rybkin is just the necessary compromise that it is permissible to reach in this Duma with this alignment of forces. It was clear, on the other hand, that a person oriented sharply to the left or sharply to the right could not have gotten elected to this position. And Rybkin is not a "revolutionary" of either left or right. As far as his style of chairing the sittings is concerned, people may make of it what they will. I would prefer a stricter style. I would not switch on the microphones in the hall at all--only in case of a dire emergency. I believe that society has already passed the stage at which everyone was inordinately sensitive to whether a thing was "democratic" or "not democratic." We are now more in need not of what is connected with rights, but of what is connected with responsibility for the accorded rights. Nikolay Lysenko (unregistered Russian Way faction): Rybkin is a professional, of course, but he is a person not without inveterate apparatus habits. Despite the fact that by European standards he is still quite a young politician, he is a young politician "with an old suitcase." The communist baggage that he carries with him and the most profound imprint of the communist mentality in him are obvious to me. I do not believe that Rybkin is the speaker whom the new Russia needs. He is, perhaps, a pretty good speaker for the troubled times in which we are living, even the optimum figure for harmonizing the actions of the Duma with the Federation Council and the president. But the new Russia should have a new speaker not so much in terms of his age as in terms of his ideological baggage. Sergey Baburin would for me, for example, have been a far more acceptable candidate for this office. Gennadiy Burbulis (Russia's Choice faction): We should have the courage to separate the idea of a person that was shaped by years of joint political struggle from his normal possibility of self-renewal. For this reason I decline comment on Mr. Rybkin's political past and believe that we may be quite sincere in supporting the formulas that he has promulgated as chairman of the State Duma. I personally, in particular. Parliament exists so that people might have better lives. And our entire ideological struggle should be subordinated to this. I have the impression that Mr. Rybkin is interested in such a position, and in this sense I will help him, as a man. Sometimes, however, signs of a predetermined goal, which he is attempting to achieve as aggressively as possible, show through. There have been several topics where the natural right of the deputy minority, even if this has been one deputy, has been scornfully rejected. This is disturbing, it is impermissible. Vyacheslav Marychev (Liberal Democratic Party of Russia faction): Our faction voted for Rybkin. But I have a very guarded attitude toward him. I believe that this is an attempt to return to power by people who have already been there. But to avoid an intensification of the crisis in the Duma, the faction decided to vote for Rybkin, and we voted "Aye." I complained to Rybkin about the fact that he had not recognized Lysenko. Although the faction gave me a telling-off for this and although I do not know Lysenko personally, I was angered by the disdain with which Rybkin had treated him. He apologized to Lysenko, it is true, but this episode reminded me of the communist past. Irina Khakamada (unregistered Union of 12 December group of deputies): I can say only one thing: Yesterday and the day before, the sittings were chaired by Speaker Rybkin; today they are being chaired by Mityukov. Speaker Rybkin is a representative of the Agrarian Party and of the pro-communist lobby, so to speak; Mityukov is a representative of Russia's Choice. I like the way the sittings were chaired yesterday and the day before better. That is, I mean that Rybkin is a person who knows how to do his job professionally.
