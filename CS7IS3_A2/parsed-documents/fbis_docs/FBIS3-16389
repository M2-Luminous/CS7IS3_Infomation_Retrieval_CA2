"We hope the three-month operation really starts when promised," Tarand said. The government today set concrete tasks to several ministries to guarantee safety of the operation. The environment minister told BNS the Cabinet is now "organizationally ready" for the removal of fuel. "It is most unlikely that an accident should occur in Paldiski, but we must be prepared for any eventuality," Tarand said. "For example, a fire may break out, which may involve leakage of radioactive substances, and in this case people will have to be evacuated. Estonia must guarantee the safety of the population." The environment minister said the government laid main responsibility for safety on the Rescue Department, the Environment Ministry, the Estonian Railways, and the Economics Ministry. "The dismantling of the two nuclear reactors in Paldiski does not directly concern Estonia, since we lack specialists for this and, besides, Russia regards the reactors as a state secret," Tarand said. "We are, however, interested in everything that concerns the removal of fuel." Tarand claimed Estonia and Russia haven't yet agreed on what is to become of Paldiski after the fuel has been removed. "What remains is the shells of the reactors, purification systems, and some solid and liquid nuclear waste," the environment minister said. "Russia asks for five years to eliminate them, which we think is too long. On the other hand, we cannot make too stiff demands (on Russia), since Estonia lacks a radioactive waste depository and the cost of building one would be enormous. To resolve the issue, probably pressure from third countries is needed." Russia plans to use new, TK-18 type containers for the removal of nuclear fuel from Paldiski. This is the first time they will be used in such operations. Tarand said he has heard rumors that the containers "were a couple of weeks ago shipped off to Estonia from Vladivostok or some other faraway place," but that they "were stuck halfway." "The new containers are a better alternative if only because they haven't previously been used for transporting nuclear fuel and they are not radioactive," Tarand said.
