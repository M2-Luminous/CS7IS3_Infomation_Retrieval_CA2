On Friday he left for the Ivanovo region, where a missile army is stationed. Shumeyko was accompanied on his trip by commander-in-chief of the strategic missile troops Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev. The missile army is partly armed with the newest "Topol" missile system, destined to become the core of Russia's future strategic missile forces. Igor Sergeyev told ITAR-TASS that today's talks between the missile troops command and Vladimir Shumeyko would center around the problems faced by those troops. These problems, he said, "are rooted in the share of the budget which is to be allotted the strategic missile troops". Shumeyko will be shown the troops' battle capabilities and the main components of the training which those who are entrusted with the country's nuclear weapons must undergo. The Federation Council chairman intends to meet with some of the army's officers as well. Sergeyev said he was grateful to Shumeyko for deciding to first visit the strategic missile units before making a decision on the military budget. "That is explainable, since the Russian military doctrine lays the most responsibility for the state's safety and stategic stability on our forces. The strategic missile troops are the main component of Russia's strategic nuclear forces", the general said. He further noted that the many problems encountered by the troops are being resolved without compromising their battle capabilities and reliability. The strategic missile troops had to shoulder most of the responsibility under the START-1 and START-2 international disarmament treaties. At present, the commander-in-chief explained, about 60 per cent of the rocket carriers and warheads of the strategic nuclear forces are concentrated in the missile troops. These types of weapons are due to be reduced to one-sixth their former size. Sergeyev also pointed out that, even without any international treaties, Russia would have to eliminate the weapons which used to be produced in the other ex-Soviet Republics. Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev declared at a recent press conference that the country's strategic nuclear forces were the main guarantee of Russia's security in the modern world. At present as well as in the future, the top priority in the development of the armed forces will be given to strategic nuclear weapons, which are the main deterrent factor against any outbreak of hostilities, he said. The divisions and regiments of the strategic missile troops, which are at the centre of the nuclear forces, are now being technically reequipped. In the last two years, seven more missile regiments have been made battle-capable, all equipped with new stationary and mobile missile systems. At the same time, strategic missile units are being withdrawn from the other ex-Soviet Republics. By the end of 1994, another four missile regiments are due to be relocated to Russian territory.
