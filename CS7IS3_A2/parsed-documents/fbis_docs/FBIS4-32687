Lekic "voiced the opinion that the peace process in connection with the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict is entering its most delicate stage to date, and that its end will either mean qualitative improvement or a plunge into an even deeper crisis and uncertainty." According to the Montenegrin foreign minister, by accepting or rejecting the furure peace plan, the warring sides in Bosnia will definitely declare themselves either for peace or for the continuation of the war. The Italian foreign minister was reported as having said in talks with Lekic that his country holds Montenegro's constructive contribution to the current peace process in high esteem and he expressed Italy's readiness to go on aiding Montenegro in alleviating its difficulties. Contacts between Italian and Montenegrin representatives so far have been assessed as positive, and it was concluded with pleasure that they have lately been registering an upward trend. Hope was expressed that cooperation between Montenegro and Italy will be promoted after the sanctions are lifted.
