Diseases which were a rarity just a few years ago have now increased in frequency, and this cannot but be alarming, since after all, these are infectious, dangerous illnesses. Some of them are acquiring epidemic proportions, as is evidenced by statistics of the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight. While in 8 months of last year only 1,801 persons caught diphtheria in Russia, in the same period of this year there have been as many as 5,888 cases, including 1,459 children. Since the beginning of the year 254 persons have died. Dysentery morbidity grew from 73,628 cases to 89,238. The number of syphilis patients almost tripled in comparison with last year--there are 25,599 of them. Of 194,833 gonorrhea patients registered in 8 months of this year, 1,601 are children up to 14 years of age. And even pediculosis--ordinary lousiness, which threatens typhus--has gone beyond the 181,000 mark. These, by the way, are only the cases that have been recorded by the sanitary-epidemiological service, while in actual fact the infections may be much more widespread. It is clear that all of these outbreaks, foci and epidemics are not the result of the good life. Nikolay Vladimirovich Shestopalov, the administrative chief of the State Sanitary-Epidemiological Service of the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, provides a concrete explanation for the causes of the country's epidemic danger. [Shestopalov]The gates of neighboring and distant countries have been flung wide open, and the number of people crossing the federation's borders, including from countries in which cholera is a problem, has increased considerably. I am referring to people on business, commercial and tourist trips. In addition many refugees, persons without a permanent place of residence and vagrants spending the nights in terminals, cellars and attics have appeared. Such a backdrop favors the spread of infections. People busy with what they believe to be the more important problems of survival have become less responsible about their own health, and they are not taking reasonable precautions against infections. Public health in general and the sanitary-epidemiological service in particular do not have enough resources for normal preventive work: Because of insufficient and late financing we are unable to carry out all of the necessary measures fully--medical checkups, analyses, disinfection, vaccination etc. But speaking in general, political, economic and social crises inevitably lead to complication of the epidemic situation in any society undergoing periods of change, and what we observe in our country today confirms this. [Kudinova]That's true, and if we recall history, beginning with the ``childhood of mankind,'' or the Age of Antiquity, epidemics, or ``mory'' as they were referred to in the distant past, always accompanied upheavals in a state. They were viewed in cultures of different peoples and centuries in the same way--as the vengeance and punishment of the gods, as ``divine punishment.'' Naturally the mechanisms of monitoring and curtailing the spread of infection can no longer work well in connection with economic devastation, but could it also be that the defense mechanisms of the human body also break down? After all, pathogenic viruses and microbes exist in stable periods of history as well, but they don't always evoke massive epidemic disease. [Shestopalov]If we're talking about the laws by which epidemics arise, we should recall the well known physiologist Selye, who justified the theory of stress. Stress is the body's natural defense reaction to an external effect, as a rule a response to a situation differing from normal. Stress mobilizes the body's defensive forces. But stress has its antipode as well--distress. This is excessive, over-the-line stress, which lasts abnormally long and which ultimately results in inhibition of defensive forces. The economic and political instability of recent years, the lack of social protections for the population, the decrease in standard of living, local wars and conflicts in different places in our country, uncertainty in tomorrow--aren't these enough reasons for distress? The immunity of the people is suppressed, there is no barrier to diseases, and consequently the individual easily catches ailments to which he is exposed, and infections he encounters. [Kudinova]Distress is still present, and obviously it is threatening us with epidemics of even greater scale, since after all, judging from your statistics, morbidity is growing. What are sanitary-epidemiological oversight services doing to keep the situation from getting out of control? [Shestopalov]In order to carry out preventive work to the fullest, we are trying to preserve the structure and function of our services to the maximum, although this is requiring colossal effort: There is nothing with which to pay for gasoline, electric power and building rent, and there is not enough money to acquire instruments, reagents, nutrient media and equipment. We appealed to the government, and it supported us: Local bodies of government were asked to allocate resources as a separate item in support of regional and local or municipal programs for supporting sanitary and epidemiological well-being. These programs focus on different things: In some areas, treatment of drinking water, in others, inspection of food products, in still others, massive preventive vaccination, and so on. We also received permission to use, for the needs of our service, from 50 to 100 percent of fines we impose on officials and legal entities guilty of violating public health and epidemiological regulations. Moreover despite the fact that this is an extremely complex period, and perhaps the not most suitable one, we are nonetheless reorganizing our service in order to make it more responsive to the needs of society. We are establishing special interregional centers--toxicological, chemical and microbiological, which will make it possible to concentrate our modest possibilities and fulfill a large volume of analyses and measurements at a higher level of quality. Had it not been for all of these measures, the epidemic situation in the country would have been worse. Unfortunately, we are practically unable to influence diseases categorized as social diseases--tuberculosis, pediculosis, venereal. As we know, they increase in incidence unavoidably in territories where the economic and social situation is unstable, where ``morality is on the decline.'' As an example the statistics on gonorrhea--a disease that is suffered as a rule by people in their time of development and youth--are only the tip of the iceberg: Many often treat themselves with home remedies, without seeing a doctor, causing the ailment to assume its chronic form and dooming themselves and others to infertility. I can't agree with what is happening today in our country in the area of ``sex education.'' My mind rebels at calling this a civilized development. [Kudinova]What can each person do for him or herself to reduce the risk of catching infectious diseases? [Shestopalov]Save for observing the elementary rules of personal hygiene, there is nothing that I can propose. Wash your hands before eating and after going to the bathroom, don't use perishable food products after their shelf life has expired, don't buy food products, especially meat, from people you don't know. When you buy meat (and other food products as well), do so only after making sure that it had passed veterinary inspection. And of course, diphtheria immunizations are a doubtless requirement. This dangerous infection will remain prominent for a sufficiently longer time. The sole effective defense against it is immunization. Every immunization is mandatorily preceded by an examination by a doctor, it is carried out only with a disposable syringe, and the vaccine satisfies the standards of the World Health Organization fully, such that immunization is absolutely safe to life. Even if a person falls ill due to particular features of his body, he will not die of diphtheria, and he will not suffer complications. Nor should immunizations against tick-borne encephalitis be refused in regions where this is necessary, and at the slightest suspicion of a tick bite a doctor should be seen at once. [Kudinova]Nikolay Vladimirovich, you noted that urban residents suffer more from infectious diseases. There is no doubt that where population density is higher, the frequency of contacts is greater and it is much easier to get infected. But let's clarify this. The medical service has traditionally been more poorly organized in the countryside. Could it be that public health oversight is worse, and that this is what makes the statistics look better? [Shestopalov]Rural inhabitants are better protected against epidemics for objective reasons: After all, they are almost completely oblivious to phenomena such as refugees, vagrants and persons without permanent places of residence. All such people carry lice, with all of the ensuing consequences. And in contrast from the urban way of life, the traditions of the way of life and diet of the rural population have not changed. Such healthy conservatism keeps them safe. [Kudinova]Are you saying that the only way we can overcome the epidemic danger is to stabilize the situation in the country? [Shestopalov]Precisely so, you can never separate it from politics.
