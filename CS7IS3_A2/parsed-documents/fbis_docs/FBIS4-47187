If minimal or average wages in Russia and Ukraine are compared at market rates of exchange, then the difference will be five, or even ten times to the benefit of Russia. Thus Ukrainians, more often than not, highly qualified specialists, searching for work go to Russia. But in Russia the food situation is more difficult, with food prices being four to five times higher than in Ukraine. That is why all who are not lazy buy products in Ukrainian stores and transport them en masse to Russia. They transport them by train, by airplane, by truck, and by passenger cars. The peasants, who earlier usually transported into Russia early vegetables, fruits, and berries into Russia joining in this parcel business in large numbers. Currently they transport whatever they happen to have: potatoes, cabbage, beets, carrots, and home preserved vegetables and fruits. And other items as well. Here is how it works. Tourist bureaus for such "tourism" have converted passenger buses to freight-passenger buses. Eight to ten people jointly rent such a bus, each takes about ten or eleven sacks of vegetables. At Moscow markets potatoes cost not less than 400 rubles per kilogram, and cabbage, carrots, and beets are purchased at 700 rubles per kilogram, most expensive are pickled cucumbers - at two to two and a half thousand per kilogram. After converting prices from rubles to karbovanets, the price is four to five times higher than, say, in Kiev. But the cost of doing such business is not small. For transportation services everyone pays close to one and a half million into the account of the transport enterprise, and half again as much goes directly to the driver. For bus parking, for a place at the bazaar, bribes to the transport inspectors along the way - all these are additional costs. These costs consume over a third of the profits, but even so, in the end it turns out that each "tourist" traded for two million more than if he had sold his goods at home. Now let us consider somewhat what this semi-domestic business means. The fact that produce prices are four times lower does not at all signify that there is an overproduction of foodstuffs and a low production cost but first and foremost is indicative of the low purchasing power of the people. That is, what is being exported is what "I would eat myself - but I need the money." But the money earned in Moscow for the produce, as we can see even from the example of the commercial bus trip, does not come back to the producer. The lion's share is spent on all sorts of taxes. In that case how are the production costs recovered, especially for the production of the produce which is purchased in the stores? It is a good time mention the trillions in subsidies and non repayable credits which are allocated almost directly from the government's budget to the village. Not only foodstuffs are subsidized from the state budget but other goods in wide demand. We amicably scold the government, which cannot contain prices, and which little considers that low prices for goods and services in the final analysis means low wages. Low wages, in turn, contribute to the reduction of the purchasing power and consequently a reduction in production. And until this vicious cycle in broken and until prices for goods and wages (because wages are nothing but the price of labor) do not approach world prices, then both goods and the labor force will be exported out of Ukraine. But these are measures from the arsenal of healing therapy, So far, Ukrainian politicians are experimenting with the arsenal of shock therapy.
