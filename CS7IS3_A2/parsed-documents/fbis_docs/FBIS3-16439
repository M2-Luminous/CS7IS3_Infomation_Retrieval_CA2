Recently, Shakhray took part in a meeting of the intergovernmental Commission for Russian Germans' issues. According to Shakhray, the Russian delegation confirmed to the meeting that Russia was "interested in keeping all Russian Germans in Russia." At his assessment, the number of those leaving Russia for Germany decreased slightly in 1993. At the same time, the number of Germans coming to Russia from Central Asian republics and Kazakhstan was bigger than that of emigrants to Germany. Shakhray pointed out that the only way for the gradual restoration of Russian Germans' statehood was to pass a federal law on the creation of new subjects of the Russian Federation in areas predominantly populated by Germans. He pointed out that the process might take several years. At the same time, Shakhray said the attitude of residents of the Volgograd and Saratov regions located along the Volga River, where a German autonomous region was planned to be created, had become more favorable. These regions used to be a densely German-populated area before 1941. Asked whether the draft power-sharing treaty between the center and the Kaliningrad region (a Russian exclave located between Lithuania and Poland -- IF's note) would be similar to the one between Moscow and Kazan, Shakhray said his ministry had been instructed by the president and the government to prepare a treaty on the issue before April. In Shakhray's opinion, the law on a special status of the Kaliningrad region that Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko had referred to during his trip to the region, "neither ran counter, nor precluded such a power-sharing treaty between the Kaliningrad region and the Russian Federation." Speaking on the parliamentary elections in Tatarstan, Shakhray pointed out that his ministry considered their returns to show the approval or disapproval of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan. In his opinion, Tatars' active participation in the elections (57.2) was evidence of their support for the treaty.
