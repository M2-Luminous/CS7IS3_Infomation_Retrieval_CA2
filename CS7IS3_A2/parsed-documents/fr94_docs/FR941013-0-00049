ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS announces the closure of the fishery for Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) conducted by vessels permitted in the Harpoon Boat category. Closure is necessary because the annual quota for this category has been attained. EFFECTIVE DATE: The closure is effective from 2330 hours local time on October 7, 1994 through December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John D. Kelly, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347 or Raymond E. Baglin at 508&hyph;281&hyph;9140. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations implemented under authority of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (16 U.S.C. 971&hyph;971h) pertaining to harvest of Atlantic tunas by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction appear at 50 CFR part 285. Section 285.22(b) of the regulations provides for an annual quota of 53 metric tons of large medium and giant size class ABT to be harvested from the Regulatory Area by vessels permitted in the Harpoon Boat category. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA) is authorized under ยง285.20(b)(1) to monitor the catch and landing statistics and, on the basis of these statistics, to project a date when the total catch of ABT will equal any quota under ยง285.22. The AA is further authorized under ยง285.20(b)(1) to prohibit fishing for, or retention of, ABT by the category of gear subject to the quotas. Based on landing reports, the AA has determined that the quota of ABT allocated for the Harpoon Boat category for 1994 will be attained by October 7, 1994. Fishing for, retention, possession, or landing of large medium or giant size class ABT by vessels in the Harpoon Boat category must cease at 2330 hours on October 7, 1994. Classification This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 285.20, and is exempt from E.O. 12866. Dated: October 6, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25316 Filed 10&hyph;7&hyph;94; 11:48 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
