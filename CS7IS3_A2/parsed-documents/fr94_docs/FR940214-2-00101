FR940214-2-00101 FR940214-2-00059 Applicants' Representations 1. The Trust is an open-end management investment company that was organized as a business trust under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on October 17, 1991. To date, the Trust consists of four series: Smith Barney Shearson Limited Maturity Treasury Fund, Smith Barney Shearson Limited Maturity Municipals Fund, Smith Barney Shearson Intermediate Maturity California Municipals Fund, and Smith Barney Shearson Intermediate Maturity New York Municipals Fund (the ``Funds''). 2. On March 12, 1993, American Express Company and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Shearson, entered into an asset purchase agreement with Primerica Corporation and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. Inc. (as renamed, Smith Barney Shearson). Under the agreement, American Express sold substantially all of the assets of Shearson and the Asset Management Divisions of Shearson to Smith Barney Shearson and its designated affiliates. Upon the closing of the sale on July 31, 1993, Smith Barney Shearson became the sponsor and distributor of the Trust and Greenwich Street Advisers Division of Mutual Management Corporation, an affiliate of Smith Barney Shearson, replaced Shearson Lehman Advisors as the Trust's investment adviser. 3. Prior to the sale transaction, investment companies sponsored by Shearson, including the Trust, received orders of exemption from various provisions of the Act. At the request of Shearson and Smith Barney, the Commission's Division of Investment Management informed Shearson and Smith Barney that the Division would not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action against them if the Funds operate under the terms of a prior order until the earlier of (a) the date the prior order is renewed by the Commission pursuant to a renewal order specifying Smith Barney and its subsidiaries or affiliates as applicants or (b) June 8, 1994. 1 This application is being filed pursuant to that no-action letter to continue and renew an order that permitted the Trust to assess a CDSC on redemptions of the Trust's shares (the ``Income Trust Order''). 2 1 See Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. (pub. avail. June 8, 1993). 2 Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 18565 (Feb. 24, 1992) (notice) and 18623 (Mar. 23, 1992) (order). 4. Applicants further request that any relief granted extend to Smith Barney Shearson and any future series of the Trust or any other open-end investment company for which Smith Barney Shearson, or any entity controlled by, or under common control with Smith Barney Shearson, serves as investment adviser or principal underwriter that issues shares that are identical in all material respects to those described in the application. 5. Under the Income Trust Order, the Trust (a) offers shares subject to a maximum sales charge upon purchase of 1.25% (the ``Upfront Charge'') that is reduced on purchases of $50,000 or more; (b) has instituted a shareholder servicing plan in accordance with rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act; and (c) assesses a 1% CDSC on certain redemptions of shares made within one year of their purchase. Under the amended order, the CDSC would continue to be imposed on that portion of a redemption that causes the current value of Fund shares to fall below the total dollar amount of payments for the purchase of those shares (less any applicable Upfront Charge) made by the shareholder during the preceding year. 6. No CDSC would be imposed to the extent that the net asset value of the shares redeemed does not exceed (a) the current net asset value of shares purchased more than one year prior to the redemption (``Old Shares Value''), plus (b) the current net asset value of shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distribution (``Reinvestment Shares Value''), plus (c) increases in the net asset value of the shares above purchase payments (less any applicable Upfront Charge) made during the preceding year (``Appreciation Value''). 7. In effecting a particular redemption request of shares made by a shareholder, the Trust would continue first to redeem an amount that represents Appreciation Value. The Trust next would redeem an amount that represents Reinvestment Shares Value, and then an amount that represents Old Shares Value. The amount by which a redemption exceeds the total of Appreciation Value, Reinvestment Shares Value, and Old Shares Value would be subject to the CDSC. 8. In no event would the maximum amount of the CDSC assessed upon the redemption of shares plus the amount of any Upfront Charge paid with respect to the shares exceed the maximum sales charge that could have been imposed at the time the shares were purchased under Article III, section 26(d) of the Rules of Fair Practice adopted by the National Association of Securities Dealers, of which Smith Barney Shearson is a member.
