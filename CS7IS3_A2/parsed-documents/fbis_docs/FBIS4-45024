Till now, the new group has limited its activity to the East Singbhum district of Bihar, stretching from Chandil Dam to Bahragora. The area has a population of about 1.5 million with a vast majority of landless tribals. The immediate plan is to use the base at East Singbhum as a springboard to extend its activities to the entire Jharkhand belt, in stages, to ensure that, in the future, the JBP can challenge the other two major groups, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha [JMM] (Shibu Soren) and the JMM (Mandi), on the strength of its mass base. While Mr Babloo Murmu is general secretary of the JBP, most of its other leaders had been associated with the JMM (Soren) or the JMM (Mandi). According to information received in Calcutta, the JBP has given an impassioned call for "Save Dhalbhumgarh", in an obvious attempt to use the sentiments of the local inhabitants in its favour. The campaign is against all kinds of pollution -- environmental, political, linguistic and cultural. For this, the party is using folk mediums, like jhumoor dances, and plays, to reach the people. Causes dear to tribal life, like deforestation, are being taken up, to ensure that the campaign embraces all aspects of tribal life and culture. The immediate take-off point of the agitation, when it started about a year ago, was the environmental issue. Agitations were periodically held in protest against the pollution of the Subarnarekha river by the public sector company, Hindusthan Copper. Public protests were subsequently organized by the JBP against the World Bank-aided Subarnarekha project. They protested against the displacement of the local inhabitants for the project. The moderate success of the agitations has now emboldened the JBP to guide the campaign against economic exploitation of the tribals in the mineral-rich East Singbhum. It has taken up other causes on behalf of the tribals. It protested against the widespread destruction of the forest at Dalma, Lakhaisari and Paora. This had disturbed the traditional abode of elephants and had forced them to come to the plains of West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. The JBP is opposing the State Government's efforts to construct irrigation canals in the tribal belt and, particularly, the onslaught on traditional occupations of the tribals. This is forcing them to leave their homes and take up jobs for daily wages. With the two major Jharkhand groups busy crossing swords and, seemingly, falling to the machinations of established parties, the JBP campaign is said to be gradually gaining ground among the people. There is cause for comfort for the JBP because of what they term "active support being received from a majority of non-tribals as well".
