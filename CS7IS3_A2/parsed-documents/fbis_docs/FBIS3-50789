FBIS3-50789 "drlat005_g_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-005 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Jan 1994 CENTRAL AMERICA Guatemala Defense Minister on Mexican Crisis, Deployment Along Border PA0601225494 Guatemala City Teleonce Television in Spanish 0400 GMT 6 Jan 94 PA0601225494 Guatemala City Teleonce Television Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [From the "Telepress" newscast] [Text] Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez has said he thinks the Guatemalan peace dialogue will not be altered by the situation in Mexico's state of Chiapas. [Begin recording] [Enriquez] If reports originating in Mexico and others produced here in Guatemala confirm the participation of the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity], there will undoubtedly be some repercussions in the peace talks. [Reporter] Do you know whether those who were arrested have links to the URNG [words indistinct]? [Enriquez] We do not have any specific information yet. We know there were arrests; as you know, newspapers on the morning of 5 January reported that. We do not have any official reports. As soon as we have official information, including names, we will let you know. As of now, all I know is what I read in the newspapers. Perhaps on the afternoon of 6 January we will have more concrete and official reports. At that time it is possible that the Foreign Ministry will release information to you; if not, I will do so as soon as information is available to me. At this time, the information we have we learned from the newspapers. [Reporter] News dispatches from Mexico say the Guatemalan Army has reinforced the border. Is this true? [Enriquez] We have not bolstered security along the border. On the morning of 5 January I told you that the Guatemalan Army's largest military presence had already been the one along the Mexican border. We have not increased it. If security there is reinforced, it is because three subversive groups are still present there -- the ORPA [Revolutionary Organization of the People in Arms], the EGP [Poor People's Guerrilla Army], and the FAR [Rebel Armed Forces]. This is the border where we have stationed the most units. [end recording]
