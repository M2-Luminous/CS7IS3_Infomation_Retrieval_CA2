Daxie Island is located in the northeastern part of Beilun District, Ningbo city, east China's Zhejiang Province. Around 40 kilometers from downtown Ningbo, it occupies an area of 30.89 square kilometers. The Chinese State Council last March granted approval to the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) to develop land on Daxie Island and to apply policies covering economic and technological development zones. CITIC hosted a briefing on the development of the island here this morning with some 60 participants from various foreign firms and companies in Beijing attending. Speaking at the briefing, a CITIC official in charge of the program said that in the first three years between 1994 to 1996, the island development will be focused on infrastructure facilities, such as construction of water and electric power facilities, telecommunications, highways and bridges, so as to form a better investment environment for future prospects. According to the official, the development of the island has become a "melting pot" of various companies in the world. So far, companies from the United States, Britain, Japan, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands as well as from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan have been to the island where they discussed possible cooperation projects with the Chinese side. Some have signed cooperative contracts and memorandums of understanding with CITIC. Wei Fuhai, chairman of the board of CITIC Daxie Company, said that the island enjoys geographical advantages, favorable natural conditions and good surroundings, and its exploitation is significant to the development of the Shanghai Pudong Development Zone, the Chang Jiang river delta and the regions along the river.
