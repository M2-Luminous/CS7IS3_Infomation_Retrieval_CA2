Representatives of narcotics businesses, who used to smuggle vast amounts of narcotics, opposed this step. Making the controls tougher also caused discontent among the Ossetian separatists. An IBERIA correspondent was told at the headquarters of the Georgian peacekeeping troops deployed in Tskhinvali that the Ossetian population of Tskhinvali had held a rally where they demanded that the Russian border troops be moved from the northern border of the so-called South Ossetia because the presence of the troops there means demarcating the state border between Russia and Georgia.
