FBIS4-40001 "drsov113_f_94016" FBIS-SOV-94-113 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 National Affairs Democratic Association States Pledge Support Democratic Association States Pledge Support LD1006114294 Kiev UNIAN in Ukrainian 1950 GMT 9 Jun 94 LD1006114294 Kiev UNIAN Ukrainian BFN [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- At a news conference by leaders of the "Ukraine" democratic association on 9 June, Dmytro Pavlychko, elected as the association's chairman on 1 June, stated that at present the forces of the "right" had their candidates in 73 of the 113 constituencies where the elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine are to be held on 24 July, all of whom will be granted the association's material and moral support. He admitted that to do this will be difficult as the national democrats have been accused by the "leftists" in the course of the pre-election campaign of causing the country-wide economic crisis and the impoverishment of the people, and a similar situation might recur. Dmytro Pavlychko underlined that he only agreed to take charge of the association after the People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh, NRU] pledged it had no intention of seceding from the bloc. Dmytro Pavlychko, Oleksandr Lavrynovych (people's deputy, Rukh), Pavlo Movchan (people's deputy, "Statehood" grouping), Volodymyr Klymchuk (chairman, Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine), and others who took part in the news conference emphasized that to the national democrats, today "the issue of primary importance is parliamentary elections, rather than that of the presidential election in Ukraine," as the forces of the "right" oppose a presidential election altogether. As for supporting a particular candidacy, it was stated that so far, the national democrats lack a common point of view and it is likely that they will continue to lack one in the period before 26 June [presidential election date]. In Oleksandr Lavrynovych's words, the decision to support a particular candidacy will be made by NRU regional branches. Dmytro Pavlychko told the news conference that as the result of analyzing the candidates' pre-election platforms, there is no candidacy among those nominated that would satisfy the forces of the "right" entirely. "By way of politically dreaming," in Dmytro Pavlychko's words, the current situation is optimal: that is, Leonid Kravchuk is president and all his opponents in the pre-election contest, except for Leonid Kuchma, are members of the government. It was stated at the news conference that the "Ukraine" democratic association will seek the agreement of Ivan Plyushch, Volodymyr Lanovyy, Valeriy Babych, and Petro Talanchuk to withdraw their candidacies in favor of Leonid Kravchuk, as "it is Kravchuk alone who can hold out against Kuchma" on the condition that all democratic forces unite. It was announced at the news conference that Levko Lukyanenko [former head of the association] left the leadership of the association "for personal reasons" and he will not stand in the elections on 24 July. Mykhayo Horyn [chairman of the Ukrainian Republican Party, URP] added that Levko Lukyanenko would pursue a political career in the URP.
