Explain All Assumptions Several comments suggested that the Agency break out the category ``Other Activities'' in the economic analysis that comprised about 70% of the Agency program costs. Response: The economic analysis for the proposed rule has been extensively reviewed and updated to reflect the program costs associated with EPA's proficiency programs as they are currently operating. All of the pertinent program activities and analytical assumptions have been provided in the appendices B and C of the Economic Impact Analysis of the radon Proficiency Program User Fee Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November 17, 1993. 3. Consider All Inputs of Costs to Industry Several comments suggested that the Agency did not consider other costs of doing business such as travel to test chambers, lost business due to training, and travel to training. Other comments indicated that the economic analysis for the proposed rule did not consider the issue of duplication of fees and multiple State certifications. Comments also suggested that the RMP program fees in the proposed rule were not comparable to other State certification fees. These comments suggested that the Agency consider certification costs for termite inspectors, home inspectors, etc. Response: EPA did not do a detailed analysis of other compliance costs faced by firms in the radon industry because of the wide variability of those costs and the difficulties in fully documenting these costs. The Agency does recognize that its fees are not the only compliance costs a radon firm may incur. This was a key consideration in EPA's decision to promulgate fees lower that those in the proposed rule and to pursue a staged approach to recovering its operating costs. Appendix A, ``State Certification Programs,'' of the Economic Impact Analysis for the Radon Proficiency Program User Fee Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November 17, 1993 provides a list of States that currently require the payment of radon user fees. Fee levels in this final rule are comparable to those charged by States. 4. Economic Analysis Should Reflect Current Program and Costs Several comments suggested that the assumptions used for the economic analysis were based on a program that was significantly changed by the time the proposed rule was published. These comments indicated that the analysis should reflect the current program costs and participation rates. Comments suggested that this will significantly change the estimated amount of drop out in participation. Response: The Agency has updated the fees in this final rule to reflect the current structure of the radon proficiency programs, as well as the current participation rates and program costs. These programmatic updates are outlined in the economic analysis. 5. Analysis Should Reflect More Than One Year of Costs Comments suggested that the first year fees do not reflect the real costs that could be imposed on participants in the second and subsequent years. A comment offered the scenario that after the first year, participant fees would have to more than triple to support full cost recovery in the face of declining participation. Response: While the Agency does anticipate that some firms will not participate in EPA's voluntary proficiency programs as a result of the imposition of user fees, this drop off will also reduce the costs the Agency is seeking to recover. By adopting a staged approach to full cost recovery, EPA believes that the industry will have sufficient time to adjust to the user fees and the impacts in future years are expected to be minimal. Furthermore, the Agency is always evaluating ways in which it can reduce the cost of operating its proficiency programs. D. Non-Fee Related Comments The Agency received a number of comments relative to the overall operation of EPA's proficiency programs. These comments were generally unrelated to the issue of fees. Many of the comments suggested improvements to the programs' structure and operation. Other comments addressed the relationship between Federal and State quality assurance programs and the adequacy of EPA's public information activities as they affect consumer demand for radon testing and mitigation. The Agency will consider these comments as it continues to make improvements in its proficiency programs and other radon-related programs.
