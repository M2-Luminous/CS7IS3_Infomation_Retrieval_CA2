I admit that this question which has been asked of me (and I think not just me) outside the republic puzzles me. Indeed, do we think about peace? Or have we fully reconciled ourselves to our continued existence under absolutely absurd conditions caused by war in the habitual belief that nothing depends on us and that the war will be over only when the powers that be wish it? In the latter case, which is the closest to the truth we must acknowledge that, sad as it might be, Ashot Bleyan alone is the one who proposes his concept for achieving peace. We may brand him with infamy and call him a traitor all we want, but this does not change the crux of the matter: In the greater scheme of things, no alternative to Bleyan's approach has been proposed. More precisely, the continuation of the war is subconsciously expected--a war that has never done anything good for any nation. We do have enough common sense or sense of dignity to angrily reject Bleyan's ideas, but unfortunately so far we have lacked the courage and honesty to ourselves needed to publicly acknowledge that he is right on one score: We need peace. What price peace--this is another issue, perhaps the principal one for us. ...I am fully aware of how slippery and delicate the topic is. At present it is not a very accepted practice to talk about peace because it is conjectured that it may be achieved in one way only: by surrendering Karabakh to Azerbaijan. I will venture to state that this is the easiest path toward peace; something else is considerably more difficult: to try and break out of the captivity of stereotypes which dictate to us this alternative to the war only, and to try taking a different view of the situation. Bleyan is not at all to blame for proposing this way out--no, he has a right to do so, just like any other citizen. His fault, and our woe, is that he has discredited and profaned the idea of pacifism to such a degree that he has simply turned the people off to it. Indeed, such an unacceptable "new path" was proposed that it was absolutely clear from the very beginning: The people would never go for it. Burying in oblivion the historic past, the thing that actually makes Armenians who they are, in the name of physical survival--could something more shameful have been offered to the people? The calculation was accurate: Bleyan became a bugaboo, but at the same time the thought became deeply embedded in the minds of the people that only Karabakh may be the price of peace, and therefore nothing else remains but to continue the war. Our stereotypes have indeed struck powerful and deep roots. The conviction that the continuation or discontinuation of the war does not depend on us is one of the stereotypes. It is difficult to counter this in any way: The interests of strong powers indeed intertwine in our region, and as always we are mere cogs in this mighty machine. The thought that a small nation depends wholly and entirely on the whims of large nations and has few ways to possibly influence its own fate has been powerfully established in our consciousness for a long time. Therefore, we do not have a choice: We must just ask to be taken under the wing of the least cruel patron and throw ourselves on his mercy. Actually, this is precisely what we have been doing over at least the last few centuries. I think I do not have to explain what we got as a result: the year 1915 and Aydat. However, if everything is so simple and nothing depends on us, why do we reject "Bleyanovism" so angrily? After all, it is clear that if it is up to the strong powers to solve the problem, for now they are not inclined to agree to the redrawing of existing borders. This is point one. Second, such a passive position would be more or less acceptable if carnage were not going on over there, in Karabakh, in which Armenians, too, are cannon fodder. We think that only one conclusion is possible. If we are unable to stop the war because someone needs it today, could we try pursuing a policy under which peace in our region will be more advantageous for this "someone?" So far we have been playing the role of mere gladiators, making no attempts to be of any interest to others outside of this role--outside of the war. This is worth trying because too much is on the line for us. I repeat that to this end we should abandon traditional approaches, reject the historical inertia of hemming ourselves in, and take a fresh view of the situation and our role in it. It is no secret that the array of forces in the region hinges to a tremendous degree on Russia's presence or absence from it. A glance at the historical past easily convinces us that the policy of Russia in Transcaucasia and its mechanism have always been quite integral, and all manner of deviations in various periods of time have been merely different phases of this whole policy. The traditional attitude of Armenians toward Russia is that toward our savior from the Turks. This is hard to deny; however, it is equally hard to unambiguously maintain that the very arrival of Russia in the region will by itself bring happiness to the Armenian people. This shines through with absolute clarity in the situation that has now emerged on account of Karabakh. If we dispense with everything extraneous, with the smokescreen of hollow discourse and meaningless documents, the main point will take shape: Russia is seeking to introduce its armed forces into the region. Such is the price for stopping bloodshed to which we agree, at least outwardly. We agree in the secret hope that Azerbaijan will refuse yet again. We agree, although deep down we understand that quite possibly this augurs nothing good for us. In other words, we choose the lesser evil. But is it the lesser? I will specify right away that pro-Russian or pro-Western orientation is not at issue. At issue is the revision of the existing practice of mutual relations with both our neighbors in the region and external forces. So far, such practice has boiled down to two extremes: either throwing ourselves on the mercy of the neighbor in order to physically survive, or striking a deal with external forces in order to fight our neighbors with assistance from these forces. As history shows, both extremes have resulted in disasters. A way out is found in creating a harmonious mechanism for mutual relations with all which would rule out the necessity of selling out to someone solely in order to survive. This is extremely difficult; however, by all signs there is no other way. Otherwise, we have to either agree with Bleyan or--as is being done at present--go with the flow while being clearly aware that this may be very well fraught with a recurrence of the tragedy from the beginning of this century. Is this cruel? However, history clearly indicates what the tactic of political flirtation has done to Armenia. Besides, that same history teaches us that it is better to perceive and overestimate the danger than underestimate it. We cannot allow the mourning procession on 24 April toward the memorial commemorating the dead to become the only result of the 1915 tragedy for us, after all. Naturally, all political concepts presuppose certain givens, a foundation from which we need to proceed. To stop being a nation which is continuously sacrificed we must be of a certain value as far as our activities are concerned for both our immediate neighbors and external forces, and make sure that they reckon with us instead of accomplishing their tasks with our blood. We cannot be the bet of just one force; we must seek many bets on us. In this case we would not be needed solely for war. In this case we would embark on a path toward peace because we would become a component of the policies of several forces at once rather than the policy of one force. If we agree to get away from the carnage by way of bringing in Russian troops, we will cease to be a factor of any consequence in the region because this task will already have been solved, and further on we will be used to achieve other goals. Therefore, the conclusion is that the further away from us Russia is, the more it will support us. The less of Russia there is in the region, the more interest Russia will have in Armenia. As it withdraws from this region, Russia is compelled to have a force here which is an extension of its force. Russia's coming would mean that in this sense we would no longer exist for Russia. Israel's struggle against American presence in the Near East is a classical example. Plainly speaking, when your master is not present in your region, you become his representative there; when your master appears, you just disappear. The essence of the mechanism is simple: to fight the force thanks to which you exist. A paradox? This may be so, but what has the orthodox way of thinking and actions accomplished for us to date? As I see it, the flexibility and correctness of a policy are found in behaving adequately in each specific situation, adhering to one tested concept. In our case, each of Russia's moves in the region changes the array of forces in it and necessitates an adequate response. After all, it may very well happen that in one situation one's interests and the interests of a traditionally opposed neighbor may coincide. Of course, there is nothing new about this: One uses the contradictions of other parties to one's own benefit in the event the interests of one of these sides coincides with one's own interests. Applying this well-known theoretical consideration to the situation existing at present, we get the following: Azerbaijan resists the introduction of Russian troops to the region; this, shall we say, does not hold the promise of special dividends for Armenia, either. Why not become an ally of Azerbaijan on this issue? We thus become a policy component, and therefore are of interest to both sides. Consequently they will not strive to subjugate, use, or destroy us. However, this is the case on only one issue; on all others we oppose Azerbaijan together with the powerful force we represent in the region. This may seem to be merely yet another look at the array of forces in the region which does not at all guarantee us peace. However, first, nobody is in a position to guarantee peace on an issue so complex. Besides, if the statement that war is an extension of politics is correct, it is all the more logical to consider peace to be an extension of politics. Finally, we can hardly deny the fact that the policy we have been pursuing has not resulted in any particular success toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict to date. Moreover, against the background of interminable negotiations and statements about "dedication to a peaceful resolution of the conflict" the flames of war are fanned ever stronger, claiming still new lives. Indeed, stopping the war does not depend on us alone. However, we must be interested in peace more than anyone else; that is, we must increase the peaceful component of our card as far as possible. EDITORIAL NOTE: Laying no claim at all to covering the entire range of issues related to this important problem, to say nothing of possessing the ultimate truth, we would like to invite for discussion all those who have something to say on this point. Anyone who cares about the fate of the Motherland and its people cannot help pondering what we are going to bequeath to our children on this land--the eternal necessity of purely physical survival or an opportunity to live lives worthy of people and build a new Armenia?
