[Kukan] Despite the short time in office, the new government is being strongly criticized by Meciar's opposition for allegedly being too willing to meet the Czech side halfway. I have participated in a meeting of the Customs Union Council, and I can only say that the treaty we concluded is a reasonable compromise. I believe that we will be able to find compromise solutions when solving other, more serious problems. It is very easy to bang the door when we have a dispute [allusion to Meciar's behavior]. However, the situation that follows may become a problem. In the election campaign, there certainly will be politicians who will try to show that we are making concessions to Prague. It is important for the current government Cabinet to have clean hands and a clear conscience and to show that it has never gambled with or bargained for Slovak interests. [Minarik] A month ago, you became minister in the new Slovak Government. What are the priorities in the relations between Slovakia and the Czech Republic, in your opinion? [Kukan] I do no like to speak about certain priorities because, in relations between the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic, there should be as few controversial points as possible. Of course, we are interested in having as few disputes as possible because we should make use of the good things that united us in the past. In the world, we have gained respect for our civilized separation, and I am not sure whether we have presented this fact correctly at home. Certainly, it would be nice if we finally solved all of the problems linked to the division of the property of the former federation and closed the difficult chapter in our mutual relations. The property division is always the most difficult thing after a divorce. Here, we have a divorce of two countries that have been living together for several decades. You always need two sides to preserve good relations. This government is sincerely interested in good relations with the Czech Republic, as much as it is interested in the protection of the Slovak interests. I personally believe that it is possible. This does not have to be against the spirit of neighborly cooperation. [Minarik] What about relations with Hungary, which have been a very sensitive issue in the Slovak Republic's foreign policy? Budapest was positive about the first steps of Moravcik's government, but.... [Kukan] We really want the Slovak-Hungarian relations to be calm and reasonable, so that we might be able to discuss anything anytime. I believe there are certain problems that we will be able to sort out in the short period of time our government has available. However, this will require a sober, realistic, and reasonable attitude on the Hungarian side, too. We are not succumbing to the illusion that we will be able to very quickly sort out the problems there are between us. Moreover, in Hungary, parliamentary elections are to be held soon, in less than a month. Public opinion polls have shown that the government may change after the elections. We want to proceed in the same way, independently of who is in power in Budapest or Bratislava. Without hesitating too much, we have proposed a meeting on the readmission treaty, the temporary economic regime on the Danube, and other issues. [Minarik] You were called on to assume the position of foreign minister when you were the Slovak Republic's ambassador to the UN in New York. How have your colleagues accepted this fact? [Kukan] I was quite surprised when Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik phoned me with the proposal. However, I suspected that this could happen when the prime minister said, immediately after he had been appointed, that a professional diplomat should become foreign minister. I will be sincere: I liked it in New York; I felt like a fish in fresh water. You have situations in your life where it is impossible to say no to an offer. I have spent all my life in service abroad--30 years in the diplomatic service, and now I have a unique opportunity to look at the thing from a different angle. Despite the fact that I have been appointed to this function for the period of six months--that is, until the election in the fall--I consider it to be the culmination of my professional career as a diplomat. As regards my colleagues, they certainly were surprised to a certain extent. My Czech colleague Karel Kovanda was the first to congratulate me, even before I confirmed my decision to the prime minister. In the UN, this was not such a surprise. It is not unusual that some of the ambassadors become foreign ministers. [Minarik] It was Knazko's Alliance of Democrats that proposed you for the position of foreign minister. What do you have in common with it? [Kukan] I am not a member of the Alliance of Democrats or of any other party. According to the coalition agreement, every member has the right to propose the agreed-upon number of candidates to the government. They proposed me. [Minarik] How does the United States, where you lived for four years, view Slovakia? What improves and what damages Slovakia's image? [Kukan] The ordinary American does not know much about Slovakia. He can learn about Slovakia from the media when they report dramatic events. There does not have to be bloodshed, but it is always an event that is worth noticing. The reports usually have a negative rather than a positive flavor. This should not be regarded as bad intentions but as characteristic of many media sources. With the access to information they have, it is quite normal that they would notice the statements and steps of our politicians who are not the usual and the best ones. Not all of us realize that everything we do at home is being carefully watched abroad and that, logically, this has certain effects. This is why a well-considered domestic policy is the best foreign policy. I have found myself in humorous situations quite often. For example, Americans asked me whether they should travel to Bratislava or to some other place in Slovakia and whether the situation was safe there. Many confuse us with the former Yugoslavia. This is why we have to explain the very basic things about ourselves during various meetings and lectures.... [Minarik] What is Slovakia's attitude toward the plan of French Prime Minister Balladur, according to which the change of borders could become the subject of talks between countries? [Kukan] We must understand the Balladur plan in the wide context. I am not going to say it in a diplomatic way, but, at the beginning, this plan contained unacceptable conditions for Slovakia. For Slovakia, it is unacceptable to link the question of minorities to the change of borders. If we speak about stability in Europe, we cannot ignore the fact that stability does not depend exclusively on the status of ethnic minorities, but also on political, economic, and security links and matters. Since it first appeared, the idea of the Balladur plan has undergone certain development. The text of the pertinent treaty is still the subject of negotiations. We are aware of the fact that this is a matter for the European Twelve to discuss. I believe that the authors of the plan will accept some of our views. I believe that the resulting document will be acceptable for all, and there will be no losers and no winners.
