FR940425-2-00066 FR940425-2-00048 1. ASPH represents the 27 accredited schools of public health in the United States. These schools represent the primary educational system that trains personnel to operate the Nation's public health agencies, and to administer disease prevention and health promotion programs. ASPH has the institutional knowledge of the needs of both the schools of public health and the public health agencies. 2. ASPH's principal purpose is to promote and improve the education and training of professional public health personnel. The ASPH is the only organization that can comprehensively affect the development and implementation of improved curricula for teaching public health workers in all 27 accredited schools of public health and provide experiences to students and faculty in the environment of public health organizations. 3. ASPH has provided the critical framework for the schools of public health and the practitioners of public health in Federal, State and local governments to cooperate and share their experience and expertise, and to enable the theoretical and practical perspectives of public health to be blended into comprehensive curricula for teaching health administration, health promotion, health protection, preventive health service delivery, and health research methods to future public health workers. These interchanges have assured consistent approaches to the preparation of public health workers and their performance in controlling today's major health problems. 4. ASPH is uniquely positioned to consult with practitioners of public health because students and faculty often assist public health agencies with problem resolution and work efforts. The ASPH's access to both practitioners and academicians provides a unique opportunity to achieve the purpose of this cooperative agreement. 5. ASPH provides the structure and experience for instituting comprehensive public health education programs and implementing programs that strengthen the public health system by preparing public health workers.
