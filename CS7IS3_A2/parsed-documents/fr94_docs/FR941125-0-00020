FR941125-0-00020 FR941125-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 38 CFR Part 3 RIN 2900&hyph;AG44 Disability Due to Impaired Hearing AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the Department of Veterans Affairs adjudication regulations regarding the definition of disability due to impaired hearing to clarify that it merely sets forth the base criteria for determining the point at which impaired hearing is considered a disability. This document does not constitute a substantive change to the regulation. DATES: This amendment is effective December 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Don England, Chief, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Ave., NW, Washington, DC, 20420, (202) 273&hyph;7212. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The amendment made by this document was published as a proposal in the Federal Register of September 16, 1993, 58 FR 48483&hyph;4. Interested persons were invited to submit comments on or before October 18, 1993. We received one comment from Disabled American Veterans. The commenter agreed that this change ought to be made but stated that this rulemaking presents VA with an opportunity to reexamine the criteria for determining the point at which hearing loss is a disability and suggested that VA adopt a different formula. We appreciate the commenter's interest in this issue. The suggestion, however, is clearly beyond the scope of this rulemaking. The information in the proposed rule still provides a basis for this final rule. Accordingly, the proposed rule is adopted without change. The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of section 603 and 604.
