In this connection, Wang Maolin, secretary of the provincial party committee, wrote a few days ago to Cai Lulun, president of the Hunan provincial branch of the People's Bank of China, to express his full appreciation of the performance of the banking sector. The banking sector of Hunan province was faced with an unprecedentedly difficult situation early last year, as the amount of deposits was decreasing drastically, loans were being reduced, and a lot of problems persisted, such as arbitrary fund-raising, interbank loan lending in violation of regulations, and unreasonable interest rates. The provincial branch of the People's Bank adopted a series of resolute and effective measures to further intensify macroeconomic regulation and control, and comprehensively straighten out financial order, thus promptly alleviating the shortage of credit funds. By the end of last year, banking institutions in the province registered a net increase of 12.5 billion yuan in the amount of deposits of general categories, a record increase in the province. While the amount of deposits was increasing, the amount of loans extended also increased, with the combination of loan categories optimized. By the end of last year, the balance of loans of all categories lent by banking institutions in the province totaled 95.5 billion yuan. The newly granted loans basically went to key financing projects. As far as the procurement of agricultural and sideline products is concerned, not only those IOU's left over from the previous year were paid off, but no more IOU's were issued last year. Meanwhile, the issue of delay in payment of postal orders which had caused much trouble for a while was basically solved. Last year, the proportion of actually granted loans to the total loan amount applied for to finance key projects was the highest, as compared with the figures in previous years. Ninety percent of the loans granted to the industrial sector were used to support large- and medium-sized enterprises. While banking services were improved, financial order was also gradually improved in the province. In the latter half of last year, more than 2.6 billion yuan was recovered as return of loans that had been granted in violation of regulations; branches of the People's Bank at all levels in the province investigated and handled 52 cases of violation of the interest rate policy, and 632 cases of violation of financial discipline regarding account settlement. Meanwhile, branches of the People's Bank, other specialized banks, and insurance companies carried out a consolidation operation to conscientiously rectify companies that they had established and operated on their own.
