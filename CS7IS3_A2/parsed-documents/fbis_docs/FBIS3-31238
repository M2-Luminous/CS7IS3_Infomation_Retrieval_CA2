Numerous journalists' questions referred to the current situation in the Srpska republic after the latest NATO threats. [passage omitted] The ultimatum is a direct consequence of the Sarajevo massacre. An international investigative commission has been set up. Asked by a reporter whether the Serbs will insist that the investigation be fully completed by the ultimatum deadline and whether the operation of withdrawing Serb artillery will be canceled if the investigation ends up with some positive results for the Serb side, and whether the international community will turn the spearhead of its ultimatum on to the perpetrators in such a case, Radovan Karadzic replied: [Begin Karadzic recording] I believe that the international community already knows who committed the massacre in Merkale marketplace. It is in our interest to have the investigation carried out as soon as possible and to have the results published as soon as possible. The main reason is that delaying the investigation will result in the loss of evidence; the passage of time blurs any conclusions about the perpetrator of this crime, this act of terrorism. We believe that the Muslim side is doing everything to disguise and conceal the evidence so as to prevent the commission from drawing adequate legal conclusions. This nothwithstanding, even if the fact that it was the Muslims who did it is revealed and announced, NATO and some countries, some NATO member countries, will not change their decision regarding the Serbs. Although they know all too well what the Serbs are doing, that the Serbs favor peace whereas the Muslims opt for war, they have not changed their attitude. [end recording] At today's news conference the president of the Srpska republic also spoke about the UN Security Council's current position and Russia's stance in this context. [Begin Karadzic recording] I believe that the UN Security Council is in a precarious situation, as it is clear that the Serb side is doing its best to bring about peace while the Muslim side is advocating war. There is, however, no willingness within the UN Security Council and the international community to tell the full truth. In this light the position of the UN Security Council is delicate. China's attitude to this issue, though, is to be applauded. I also believe that Russia is getting increasingly aware that the true target of the entire campaign and crisis is Russia rather than Serbia. [end recording]
