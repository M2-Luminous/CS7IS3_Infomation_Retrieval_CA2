FBIS4-13615 "drnes078__a94009" FBIS-NES-94-078-A Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 ANNEX Israel Foreign Ministry Official Criticizes U.S. Administration Foreign Ministry Official Criticizes U.S. Administration TA1804163894 Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew 18 Apr 94 p 6 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY TA1804163894 Tel Aviv MA'ARIV Hebrew BFN [Report by Hemi Shalev] [Text] A senior official in the Jerusalem Foreign Ministry this week sent an extraordinary telegram to the Israeli Embassy in Washington, containing strong criticism of the "hesitant" foreign policy of the U.S. Administration and negative personal comments about senior administration officials. In a comprehensive and secret survey on U.S. foreign policy, Eytan Bentzur, the deputy director general of the Foreign Ministry, in charge of North America and Disarmament Affairs Division, states that "we witness hesitancy with regard to handling foreign policy, with determined positions being adopted in crises areas only." Bentzur states that the U.S. foreign policy "is seen as lacking in vision and determination," according to the order of priorities set by President Clinton. William Perry, the new U.S. defense secretary, is described by Bentzur as a "second-rate appointment who does not conform with the level of the first round of appointments by the administration." As for Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser, Bentzur states: "It has been years since the United States had a leader of the National Security Council who is such an introverted and withdrawn person hesitating to leave his mark on anything." Bentzur also strongly attacks Martin Indyk, National Security Council official in charge of Arab-Israeli affairs, following a briefing Indyk gave to Israeli reporters in Washington this week, in which he expressed fears about Yasir 'Arafat's power. "The briefing was bewildering," Bentzur states, since in addition to expressing concern, Indyk also talked of "the fear and doubt which has seized large sectors of Israel about the chances of the success of the Document of Principles." "The peace team is also giving rise to quite a bit of concern," Bentzur continues. "The vision, the determination, the resolve, and the creativity" manifest under the leadership of the previous secretary of state "is not manifested at this stage of the process."
