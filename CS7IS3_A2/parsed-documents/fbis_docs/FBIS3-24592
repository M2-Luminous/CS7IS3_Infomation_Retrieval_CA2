Sea water, pollutants in suspension, and bottom sediments were studied. Phenols, methyl thiotriazines, cadmium, and copper are mostly in solution, while nickel, chlortriazine, and cationic surfactants are in suspension. Petroleum hydrocarbons, lead, and anionic and nonionogenic surfactants are found in the sea in these forms in comparable quantities. Estimates are given of contamination of bottom sediments with these substances. Herbicides are concentrated in the surface layer. Surface layer concentrations vary widely.
