FR940912-2-00112 FR940912-2-00074 Chemical 18. 2,4-Hexadienal (CAS No. 142&hyph;83&hyph;6) 13-week and 2-year studies via oral gavage in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. The studies planned for 2,4-hexadienal are similar to those outlined above for 2,4-Decadienal. Chemical 19. Dipropylene glycol (CAS No. 25265&hyph;71&hyph;8) 2-year studies via dosed-water in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. Dipropylene glycol is a component of antifreeze, air fresheners/sanitizers and is used as a stabilizer in cosmetics, as a component in polyester, alkyd resins, plastics, as a plasticizer and as a solvent. It is a relatively high production volume chemical with nearly 100 million pounds used in the United States annually. It was found to be of low to moderate toxicity in NTP 13-week studies. Mortality, hepatocellular lesions including atypical foci and an adenoma were seen in rats at the top dose. Findings in mice were limited to increased liver weights. Carcinogenicity studies of a standard design are proposed for dipropylene glycol. Chemical 20. Arsenic trioxide (CAS No. 1327&hyph;53&hyph;3) study plans are being formulated. Arsenic trioxide is a byproduct of copper or lead smelting operations and is used in pesticides, in the manufacture of glass, pharmaceuticals and other industrial chemicals. Arsenic and arsenic compounds have been classified as human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, but the demonstration of the carcinogenicity of arsenic trioxide and other arsenical compounds in rodents has been difficult. Arsenic is a common water contaminant and there is need for information on biomarkers of exposure for low dose risk estimations. For these reasons the program has selected arsenic trioxide for study as part of an initiative to examine human carcinogens which have not adequately been evaluated in rodent studies. Specific study designs are under development. Chemical 21. Tamoxifen (CAS No. 10540&hyph;29&hyph;1)/conjugated estrogens study plans are being formulated. Studies on tamoxifen and conjugated estrogens will be designed to address several issues. Conjugated estrogens are listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as human carcinogens causing endometrial cancer, however these chemicals have never been adequately studied in animals. These chemicals find wide use in human medicine and in skin care preparations. Estrogens are prescribed for prevention of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women and are used as oral contraceptives. Tamoxifen is a mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist known to be effective in the treatment and prevention of estrogen sensitive breast cancer. Tamoxifen also causes endometrial cancer in humans. Studies are being designed to help characterize dose-response relationships and cancer risks for estrogen agonist and antagonists. Chemical 22. MX [3-Chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2-furanone] (CAS No. 77439&hyph;76&hyph;0) study plans are being formulated. MX is a mutagenic byproduct of water and wood pulp chlorination and has been determined to account for about half of the mutagenic potency of finished drinking water. The EPA has Nominated MX for carcinogenicity studies with the expectation that the outcome could influence United States drinking water contaminant standards. Study designs are incomplete. Anyone have relevant information (including ongoing toxicological studies, current or future trends in production and import, use pattern, human exposure levels, environmental occurrence and toxicological data) to share with the NTP on any of these chemicals, should contact Dr. William Eastin within 60 days of the appearance of this announcement. The information provided will be considered by the NTP in designing these studies. Contact may be made by mail to: Dr. William Eastin, NIEHS/NTP, P.O.
