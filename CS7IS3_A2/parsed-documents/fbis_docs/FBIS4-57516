A week before the elections, Leo Gonzalez, a deputy from the Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement, presented a series of documents to the Panamanian foreign ministry allegedly revealing that the Cuban Government had provided support and technical advice to Ernesto Perez' electoral campaign, which will put the PRD at the helm of the nation on 1 September. The foreign ministry reached the conclusion that the documents are a forgery; it therefore closed the investigation and dismissed the information revealed by the deputy. Miguel Martinez, Cuban charge d'affaires in Panama, said he had affirmed from the beginning that the documents were forged and that he was confident that the Panamanian foreign ministry would handle the issue carefully.
