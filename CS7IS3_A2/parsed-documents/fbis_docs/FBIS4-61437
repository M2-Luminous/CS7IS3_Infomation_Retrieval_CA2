It resulted in a statement signed by President of Moldavia [Moldova] Mircea Snegur and Dniester Region leader Igor Smirnov. The document notes that a new sociopolitical situation has now developed, which is an important prerequisite for the successful resolution of this protracted crisis, which has inflicted colossal damage on the economy and claimed many lives. The sides emphasized their exclusive commitment to peaceful means of resolving the conflict based on the existing social, economic, and political realities. A firm intention was expressed to take into consideration the CSCE mission's recommendations, the Russian Federation's views, and the positive experience gained from securing peace settlements in other regions. At the meeting, in which a CSCE mission representative, R.S. Semuel [name as transliterated], and the Russian president's plenipotentiary, Ambassador V. Vasev, took the role of mediators, the sides agreed to begin the process of negotiations immediately and without any preconditions on a whole range of issues of mutual interest. Among the most important of these questions is, of course, that of determining the Dniester Region's legal status as a state. Moreover, the statement noted that it is necessary to remove all barriers preventing the normal utilization of commercial and economic and social and cultural ties, and to ensure their revival and development. The sides agreed on the need for a step-by-step program to create and implement legal state relations and in general to implement mutual agreements. It is hard to overestimate the importance of the document, which has finally come into being after many years' bitter confrontation and after the bloody armed conflict of the summer of 1992. But it is, nevertheless, no accident that one Chisinau newspaper immediately described it as a protocol of intent. Certainly good intent. However, only goodwill, realism, and persistence on the part of politicians can implement it, meeting the keen expectations of people on both sides of the Dniester.
