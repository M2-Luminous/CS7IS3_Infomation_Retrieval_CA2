In the next few years most of the firms set up by CAS will be restructured into share-holding limited companies. Zhou told the academy's annual conference that it was time to fully abandon the old model of the central planned economy. "We should change our structure into a more open and active one that is closely related with the country's economy," he said. Zhou said the "strategic structural adjustment" proposed for the academy would make the most of its tight budget. But it would mean some casualties. The president said researchers who used to rely on government funding would face the unknown--unemployment or the marketplace. "Even though the reform might hurt some, it is an inevitable historical trend and will not follow some people's intention. Only if we keep up with the trend can we greatly reduce the temporary pain." CAS will concentrate funding and personnel on training and commercially oriented research--including a project to train and select people who will lead research into the 21st century as part of its scientific training programme. And in a move away from the large scale scientific building projects of the past, Zhou focussed on the economic development campaigns planned by CAS--efficient use of coal, treatment of South China's red soil, development of the rare-earth industry and information technology. The academy will also establish two modern comprehensive science research centres this year: the Shanghai Life Science Research Centre and the Modern Earth Science Research Centre. "CAS will also select some major topics in mathematics and in nonlinear, environmental, material and information science," the president said. Zhou stated the three strategic missions of CAS--establishing a world class base for scientific research, nurturing a group of talented Chinese scientists and supporting the country's economic development and hi-tech industry. "The goal is to build CAS into a lively institution with an academic department made up of the country's top scientists," Zhou said.
