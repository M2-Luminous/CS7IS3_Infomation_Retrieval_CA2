I've heard that Fujitsu System Integration Laboratories has very close ties to the Self-Defense Force. When I worked at the Technical Research and Development Institute of the Defense Agency, I met a member of the Ground Self Defense Force who had excellent technical knowledge. So after you retired, I was interested upon hearing of your returning to work at this company. Beginning with the unique technologies from Fujitsu, new civilian technologies are introduced in rapid succession and future contributions are anticipated in the modernization of defense systems. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on future trends in today's theme of ``Defense Technology After the Cold War.'' First, this is the end of the Cold War, The Defense of Japan (1992 edition) begins by noting that ``the East-West confrontation spanned over 40 years.'' Looking at the defense chronology at the end of the book, we see Churchill's ``Iron Curtain'' speech in 1946, the North Atlantic Treaty taking effect in August 1948, the signing of the Warsaw Pact in 1955, the unification of Germany in October 1990, and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact Organization (WPO) in March 1991. What in fact was the East-West confrontation? The country as individuals or as a human society must revise its idea about what is the ideology. This is the same as the path taken by Japan since the Meiji Era. We are probably at the point of awaiting the decisions of future historians and cannot ignore this as has been done in the past. Contemporary problems also exist on the periphery. Terashima: Since World War II, the world has not only advanced militarily, but political, social, economic, cultural, scientific, and technical advances are also evident. In addition, I believe various other elements are apparent. As for the military in the East-West confrontation, a mutual endless expansion of military strength continued and competition ensued. This brought about a nuclear stalemate. Moreover, on the Soviet side that was challenged by the Strategic Defense Initiative of the United States, Gorbachev, who recognized the link to collapse if the ruined domestic economy were neglected, advocated a new way of diplomatic thought called perestroika. This drastically altered East-West relationships. The situation at that time was to dismantle WPO and for each NATO country to seriously examine arms reduction. Then, the collapse of the previous world order of two superpowers has immediately lead to the problems of outbreaks of regional low-intensity strife rooted in ethnic and religious problems, refugee and displaced persons problems, United Nations Peace Keeping Operation activities, economic stagnation in other countries, growing unemployment, strong variety of military weapons exports to protect defense industries, anxiety about the outward flow of nuclear technology from the former Soviet Union, North- South problems, and worldwide economic blocs, like GATT. This resembles various illnesses arising when the physical strength of the human body weakens. However, there is no cure, so won't this unstable situation continue for now? Yamashita: It will probably be that way as we enter the 21st century. Terashima: As you have stated, although each country is groping for a new order, a rather long period is needed until this will be established. Yamashita: What are the spin offs, the fruits of the Cold War era, that contributed socially and economically to humanity? Well, first, there are the peaceful uses of nuclear power, communications by artificial satellites, investigations of resources, atmospheric observations, astronomical observations, computer developments, simulators, trainers, lightweight structure materials, large-scale high-speed transport means (large-scale jets), lasers, milliwaves, system engineering techniques come to mind, but interest probably arose unexpectedly. We will probably thoroughly investigate this in the future. Terashima: With different objectives for military affairs, the uses of nuclear energy and space are advances of the science and technology in the 20th century and are considered to be miraculous in the course of human history. However, will the future development of epoch-making science and technology be likely? Or instead, will current technology advance along the lines of becoming faster, smaller, or bigger? Essentially, there are no national borders for technology, but this was not so during the traditional East-West confrontation. Since the speed of the change in the era became the quickness of sharing technology, a variety of technologies in new fields of the future will probably appear. Arms Reduction That Questions the Modernization of Quality Yamashita: Next, I would like to discuss military affairs. First, would you explain the arms reduction plans of the advanced western European countries? Terashima: Every year the Defense Agency releases a defense white paper called Japan's Defense; it has already been published this year. By the time this conversation appears, I believe it will be available at ordinary bookstores. So I urge the readers to purchase and read it. I'll briefly discuss what the white paper describes in detail. As seen in the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II (SALT II) treaty by the United States and the Soviet Union and the taking effect of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), the control of armaments and arms reduction is progressing worldwide; this trend will probably continue in the future. The United States is moving towards the total elimination of peacetime nuclear war arms, except for the portion loaded on airplanes, and will reduce strategic nuclear forces to one-third in the next 10 years. The plan is to reduce the Army which currently numbers 1.77 million people to 1.4 million, the Navy to 413 ships and 12 aircraft carriers, the Air Force to 13.3 combat air corps. However, in this case, maintaining adaptability, maintaining highly skilled soldiers, and supplying and developing technologically superior equipment are important. Attention should be paid to preserving the attitude of not slowing the speed of modernization. In contrast, reflecting the changing domestic situation in Russia, the security guarantee policy is not clear. Although long-term trends in arms reduction and arms preparation are not clear, it's apparent that efforts are being made to curtail the total military force of the Russian army by enacting a law to keep it within 1% of the population (1.5 million people). But a note of caution is a huge Far East Russian Army exists. Certainly, there is a substantive decreasing trend, but qualitative strengthening and modernization trends in the army, navy, and air force are remarkable. Based on the New War Strategic Concept at NATO, a 20% reduction in the military force is expected. With this as the basis, various plans are being designed in each country. China can reduce the military force of its army, however, every year national defense spending is increasing significantly. This current situation is a great deal of effort is being put into the navy and air force in particular. This trend in arms reduction progresses in response to the state of affairs in the national power of each nation. Attention must be paid so that the reduction is not haphazard. Also, the fact that modernization will proceed steadily without lowering quality during the reduction will not be overlooked. Yamashita: Next, will you speak on Japan's defense policy that is affected by new changes in the international situation. If this addressed in the white paper, could you give us an overview? Terashima: Until now, Japan has maintained suitable defensive strength as well as firmly maintaining the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States of America and a defense system to respond to aggression in any situation. As a result, preventing aggression beforehand is the basis of the defense policy. When defensive strength is thought of as fundamental defensive strength, mid-term prevention measures are decided on and the preparations continue each year. With the world having undergone major changes, I feel we should seriously examine whether following the same line of thinking as before is appropriate. The Defense Agency is probably examining the defensive military preparations and national defense for beyond 1996. When I look at the conditions surrounding Japan, I believe we must maintain the concept of ``providing the required minimum defensive force and firmly maintaining the Japan-United States security system.'' Furthermore, policies on international contributions to improve Japan's status should be considered more. Also, even with tight budgets, improving technology to support modernization and providing equipment should not be taken lightly. Yamashita: We well understand that Japan's security system will be maintained in the future and given this base, Japan's defense will provide and maintain equipment. Whether you like it or not, this kind of misleading statement probably exists. Since the arrival of Commodore Perry's ships in 1853, the occupation of the Philippines and Guam by the United States in 1898, and the open door policy towards China in 1899, increased concern about the Pacific Ocean regions of the United States collided with Japan as a rising power that advanced behind the great powers of Western Europe, then came war between Japan and the United States followed by Japan's defeat. After that time, the security of Japan depended on the United States. Undivided attention given to economic recovery and today Japan has reached the position of the second nation behind the United States in GNP. During the Cold War, Japan supported the global war strategy of the United States as one member on Western Europe's side and functioned as a good partner. While spiteful comments like Japan is a country dependent on the United States, the mutually close relationship for over 40 years does not stop at the governmental level. There are close ties in social, economic, and cultural fields. However, the current situation presents an agenda of making adjustments between governments and conditions related to the cultural and social systems of the whole country like the structural barriers capable of developing interference in the internal politics of other countries and major problems. Although it is criticized by western European countries of placing too much emphasis on Asia in the ODA, Japan will continue to work earnestly as a partner of the Western Europe of freedom and capitalism. Caution and skepticism has already arisen in other Asian countries. So without the participation of the United States, Japan cannot establish prospects for security in the Pacific region. Consequently, from the perspective of history, economics, society, politics, and diplomacy, Japan's global partnership with the United States must be preserved. But one point of concern is ``The Strategic Framework for Asia and the Pacific Region'' in the white paper (1991 and 1992 editions). This is in the report presented by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to Congress in April 1990. The fifth item describes the relationship to Japan and the importance of supporting interoperability is extolled in the fourth item. In terms of time, this is just after you assumed the position of chairman of the Joint Staff Council. According to the translation of the fourth item, ``By encouraging maximum procurement from the United States, increasing the back flow of technology, and avoiding as much as possible developing systems that are not supplemented, emphasis is placed on the importance of maintaining the interoperability of weapons.'' People involved in research and development on equipment for the Self Defense Force, planning for modernization and providing higher level operation, the members of this foundation, and readers of this magazine are probably concerned. Therefore, the third topic will move to technology. The problem of equipment is the problem of procurement. This is a major concern of each company that is a corporate member. The Defense Equipment Procurement Meeting and the Defense Production Technology Meeting held by the Equipment Director are in the process of examining this issue. In addition, because the Japan Defense Equipment Industry is enthusiastically performing research, let's skip this. I would like to hear about what would be good to accept concerning the interoperability mentioned earlier. Broad Interoperability Expected Terashima: When Japan and the United States collaborate on strategy, the problem of interoperability is not important from the perspective of the rationalization of the maintenance and operation of a defense system. So all of the equipment should not be the same as that of the US military nor should domestic development and domestic procurement be stopped. The state of affairs in the Japan and the United States differ and the doctrines on warfare differ. The physiques of the troops also differ. As a result, our troops must be provided with equipment suited to them. If products made in the United States serve this need, I believe they can be used. There is the phrase ``technology check'' should be thought of as being linked to checking the promotion of the development of technology and the maintenance of technology that can be boasted about in the world. Strength in technology is useful as bargaining power in negotiations with foreign countries. Interoperability is a widely known concept. The plan for the integration related to interoperation not simply for equipment but for doctrine, education, and training. The one-sided plan for only using equipment from the United States is not possible. Yamashita: Yes, that's true. I agree wholeheartedly, but my concerns or misgivings are not completely dispelled. Hypothetically, agreement is possible, but specifically how is this accomplished. If I don't hear them, I cannot be reassured. Terashima: How will interoperability proceed between Japan and the United States? Well, the next mid-term defense that begins in 1996 will probably take this up. However, this problem is not simply defense, it is closely related to economic problems in Japan and the United States. Moreover, this is a serious problem because the aggressiveness of the United States may be strong. I would like a policy to be decided that stands at the source of defense. Yamashita: This is long in coming. Scholars, critics, and the mass media are busy exchanging a profusion of critiques and editorials that exchange speculations. Unfortunately, for some reason public opinion is formed based on this. Therefore, given the principle of democracy, public opinion influences the government. The Defense Agency is actively performing recent public relations activities. Securitarian, the PR bulletin, has been well received. The amount of information related to national defense is minute compared to the flow through the mass media. Returning to the discussion on technology, Mr. H. F., a military critic, who often criticizes the Self Defense Force, has recently written ``America's technical strategy was embossed in FS-X negotiations. In order to continue to maintain their country's monopolistic position, it must hold down Japan. At the same time, high tech in Japan is integrated into the US's advanced military system production and used as subcontracts. Don't release our country's technology, but take what can be taken. This is America's strategy.'' In the RIPS letter (published 10/15/91 by the Peace and Security Laboratory), presenting the source code of the FS-X continues to be refused. It has also been pointed out that while the United States regulates the outflow of military technology to Japan, technology transfer from Japan is planned. The article Foreign Policy (Spring 1989) from the same journal introduced the following some time ago in a book. It stated, ``The increase in the degree of dependence on the United States for Japan's military technology cannot be avoided in the long term. Nevertheless, I hope Japan's technology can be controlled as much as possible for the security of the United States. In contrast, major restrictions must be added when American military technology is transferred to Japan...Strategic bargaining with Japan will become a major external problem in the future.'' This was an observation of Mr. Ferguson, Science and Technology Adviser during the Bush administration. Even though he does not belong to the current Clinton administration, until this administration's point of view is made public, we can only contemplate what the understanding may be. Although I forgot the source, I saw an article that presented the American view that the FS-X and joint research between Japan and the United States is not essential to the United States, but they have meaning as symbols of future technological cooperation between Japan and the United States. Also in decisions between the governments related to national security, the circumstances that led to joint development of the FS-X and details on the decision are still not clear and are probably matters for 30 years in the future. While people in the government can find out what they need to know, this is not the case for businessman. Major risks are assumed with each strategic business decision. The reason is Japan Inc. (the term used overseas to criticize private and public Japanese organizations) must be in good shape. Although the Hosokawa administration will severe the union between private and public by abolishing various regulations and plan to actively expand domestic demand, and lower the black-ink balance, various problems remain. What do you think will happen in technical cooperation or joint research between Japan and the United States? Efforts to Check the Proliferation of Weapons Terashima: As you stated earlier, from the perspective of checking technology or the effectiveness of technological power as bargaining power, the development Japan's own technology must be continually planned. When you consider that the Japan-United States security system will be closer and the huge expenses in weapons development are accumulating, more importance must be placed in the future on technological cooperation and joint research. However, this does not mean proceeding haphazardly. Japan's stance should be to make a comprehensive decision on independent technological strength and select a theme. The action program of the global partnership at the summit between the heads of Japan and the United States presents specific items for joint research, including the ducted rocket engine. We should see this advance further in the future. Yamashita: The road has opened for providing military technology to the United States because of ``the critical importance of maintaining effective operation of the Japan-U.S. security system in plans for mutual technology exchange with the United States in the defense area,'' ``the adherence to the objectives of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty,'' and ``the instrumental position in peace and security in Japan and the Far East.'' The Diet resolution on upholding the Three Principles on Military Weapons Export will probably be strictly observed in the future, but today after the end of the East-West confrontation, various countries in Western Europe have worked diligently to export weapons without concern about its appearance and are planning to maintain and preserve the defense industry. This stirs up intense strife in underdeveloped countries. The activity of the United Nations' Peacekeeping Operation is to squelch this. Terashima: The proliferation of weapons throughout the world is a very dangerous problem and must be seriously addressed. Shouldn't our country aggressively appeal to the world and not take the passive position because it does not export weapons? Concerning the future of Japan's equipment and technology, I heard that serious discussions took place at two recent meetings proposed by the Equipment Bureau director and I expect them to be reflected in the next term defense. Yamashita: As you stated, nothing else is so anticipated. The North Korean missile that has a range of 1,000 km also camouflages nuclear capabilities and presents a major threat to Japan. According to the newspapers, measures to address this were influenced by the United States. I remember seeing an article where the research results of Japanese industry in early SDI research received high marks in the United States. Indeed, what will it be in the future? Of course, joint research not only produces joint reform and conflicts with the Three Principles of Weapons Export, it is capable of advancing the discussion on the principle of collective self defense. Fundamentally, this is probably a constitutional question. I would like the Constitution to take up expressions whose interpretations are not understood. We have passed scheduled time, so I would like to thank you for taking the time to talk to us.
