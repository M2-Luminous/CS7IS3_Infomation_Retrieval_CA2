ACTION: Final rule; rescission. SUMMARY: 43 CFR Part 406 was written in the 1950's to help carry out the Farm Unit Exchange Act (Act of August 13, 1953, 67 Stat. 556) that provides for the exchange of certain unpatented farm units or private land on a Federal irrigation project, for certain classes of qualified applicants whose lands have been determined, pursuant to a land classification, to be insufficient to support a family, and the amendment of farm units by the addition of contiguous or noncontiguous land on the same project. All farm units that were eligible for exchange have been exchanged, and since the program is no longer active, this regulation is no longer applicable to Reclamation programs, and so it is being removed from the Code of Federal Regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marilyn Rehfeld, Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Division of Supply and Services (D&hyph;7924), PO Box 25007, Building 67, Denver Federal Center, Denver, Colorado 80225&hyph;0007, Tel: 303&hyph;236&hyph;6730. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of the Interior (Department) has determined this document is not a significant rule under Executive Order 12866, and therefore does not require review by the Office of Management and Budget. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Bureau of Reclamation certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. This final rule to rescind 43 CFR part 406 is determined not to have Federalism effects under Executive Order 12612 as it has no direct casual effect on the relative roles of Federal and State Government. This rule does not contain collections of information that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The Department has determined that this document does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The policy of the Department is, whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. A proposed rule was published in the Federal Register, 58 FR 65693, Dec. 16, 1993. Accordingly, interested persons were asked to submit written comments, suggestions or objections regarding its content. No comments were received during the 60-day comment period. The Department has certified to the OMB that this final rule meets the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b) of Executive Order 12778.
