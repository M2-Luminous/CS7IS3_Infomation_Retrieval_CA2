In a SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG interview at the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank Spring Conference in Washington, Waigel said that he was banking on a growth rate of 1.5 percent for Germany as a whole. The U.S. Government has not sought to pressure Germany into lowering its interest rates; U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen knows how to value the independence of the Bundesbank. That aside, the United States has taken account of the fact that interest rates in the FRG are at a historically low level. [De Thier] The FRG does not fare that well in the IMF world economic report. A growth rate of only 0.7 percent is expected for 1994. How can demands for moves to stimulate the economy be reconciled with your plans to consolidate the budget? [Haider] I do not share the IMF's views on the prospects for growth. I am of the opinion that the report does not take sufficient account of the upturn in eastern Germany. The Federal Government believes that this year a growth rate of 1.5 percent can be achieved for Germany as a whole. Favorable interest rates compared with the United States and the downward trend in inflation will further improve the overall situation. The IMF world economic outlook also contains a very positive assessment of our fiscal policy. The Federal Government's medium-term consolidation course is also considered a positive sign. [De Thier] The IMF and the U.S. Government are demanding tougher measures to introduce more flexibility into the labor market. What can be implemented in the medium term in this respect? [Waigel] We already dealt with that exhaustively at the G-7 summit in Detroit. Everybody is in agreement on the need for more flexible labor markets. We need lower wage settlements to prevent production costs from rising. With respect to part-time work, we are well behind internationally, but in the case of support for medium-sized business, we are envied by our partner countries. In the case of greater flexibility, each country must do something by itself. However, we have laid emphasis on some important points with the Federal Government's action program. [De Thier] Despite the latest reductions in key interest rates, your U.S. counterpart has repeatedly said that the Bundesbank has more scope for reducing interest rates further. Did the United States apply more pressure during the G-7 summit? [Waigel] The U.S. Government has not made any more demands on Germany. Treasury Secretary Bentsen knows how to value the independence of the Bundesbank. The U.S. and the other G-7 ministers explicitly welcomed the fact that the Bundesbank has used the scope available to it for interest rate cuts and in the short term, we are two percentage points behind last year's levels. The United States has also taken into account the fact that interest rates in the FRG have almost reached a historically low level and are still below long-term interest rates in the United States. [De Thier] In view of the downward trend in interest rates in the United States and Germany, are you afraid that capital will leave the country? [Waigel] Not at all, because in the end, the interest rate decisions in both countries were made in a way that has not caused tension in the exchange rates. The German mark's exchange rate in relation to the dollar has remained stable. As Germany's balance of payments -- including invisible trade -- deficit is declining, we also expect this stability to remain. [De Thier] It is known that at the IMF, the Federal Government is opposed to issuing new drawing rights to the successor republics to the Soviet Union. How do you view the alternatives, such as the redistribution of the drawing rights that are already available? [Waigel] We are ready to consider all alternatives to issuing new drawing rights. Of course, the IMF must see to it that the new member countries have a chance to participate in all the special drawing rights that are available.
