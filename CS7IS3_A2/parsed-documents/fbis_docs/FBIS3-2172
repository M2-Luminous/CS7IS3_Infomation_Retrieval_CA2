"The economic situation remains complicated this year, and the social and political conditions are quite tough," Yeltsin told an extended government meeting in the Kremlin. He pointed out that the government already has the (reform) program that it adopted last August but it needs to be specified and implemented. "We need a policy oriented towards the future and it is wrong to call for reforms that are too costly and burdensome for people to tolerate," Yeltsin said. The president stressed that the main government action should be to forge an energetic transformation of the economic mechanism and it should shoulder the bulk of the problems as before. He described the privatization program, which started last year, as the major item of the reform package and stressed that it must be completed "as scheduled and without hindrances". "It is necessary, therefore, to create a legal framework and organizational mechanism to attract resources through investments by domestic and foreign businessmen for a technological renewal of production", he said. The president also said that priorities should be given to curbing inflation, taxation, payment and banking system reforms as well as agricultural reforms which included ensuring the rights of private landowners. He went on: "The government is prepared to usher in radical reforms this year into the system of management of state-owned enterprises, or, to be more exact, create it a new, from scratch." The president's statement made clear that the demonopolization of the Russian economy will take time. "This is why preventive measures are particularly important to block the formation of new monopoly structures," he explained. Stressing the need for the effective mechanism of state supervision, Yeltsin said that a draft civil code for Russia and other priority draft bills will be submitted to the State Duma (lower house of parliament) in the near future. "Their promulgation into law will lay a firm legal basis for the market economy and help Russian enterprises establish a firm footing," the president said. Commenting on the coal-mine strikes, Yeltsin said: "It is inadmissible to delay the payment of wages for several months. I am closely watching the developments and the position of the labor unions."
