Bipolar emitter-coupled logic (ECL) were the principal devices used for these purposes in the past, but GaAs technology, with features such as ultra-high-speed operation, low power consumption and high integratability, is steadily replacing bipolar technology in these fields. Advances in GaAs technology in recent years has made possible the mass production of large-scale-integration (LSI) logic devices, and thanks to enhanced mass producability and lower costs, GaAs gate arrays are now less expensive to fabricate than ECL devices, being on a par with bipolar complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (BiCMOS). GaAs technology is becoming generally accepted as a commercial technology for use in manufacturing and consumer industries. GaAs digital LSI technology consists primarily of 0.8�m feature sizes. But work is pushing ahead to further increase the operating speed of these devices, and the ``GG11/12'' series of 0.5�m GaAs gate arrays announced by Fujitsu Ltd. in June, 1993, together with the ``FX'' series of Vitesse 0.6�m gate arrays, are now world technology leaders. Scaling aimed at developing devices with yet faster operating speeds and lower power consumption will continue to advance in future. Expanding Application Fields Up until now, GaAs digital ICs have been more or less limited to integration levels of several hundred gates for use primarily as high-speed ATE (automatic measurement tools), and multiplexers (MUX) and demultiplexers (DEMUX) for 622M-2.4Gb/s telecommunications. However, GaAs arrays with tens of thousands of gates have recently been installed in supercomputers (such as Fujitsu's supercomputer ``VPP-500''). Future applications for these devices are expanding into the fields of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches for the growing market for B-ISDN, LSIs for fiberoptic telecommunications at transmission speeds ranging from 155M-1.5Gb/s, prescalers for mobile communications systems, HDC/memory controllers, high-speed image processing LSI for personal computers (PCs) and engineering workstations (EWS), and LSIs that serve as telecommunication links in local area networks (LANs) used for computer-to-computer communications with everything from mainframe computers to PCs. Because GaAs devices have generally been more expensive to produce, they have been considered applicable only to high-end machines and equipment. But thanks to real mass production fabrication facilities such as Fujitsu's Custom Device plant, coupled with improved yields and characteristic stability, GaAs gate arrays are now on a par with BiCMOS devices price-wise, and are finding applications in more and more familiar machines and equipment. For example, GaAs LSIs are being used in Intel's pentium cache controllers. Table 1 provides a list of specific applications to which GaAs LSIs are being put. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Comparison of GaAs Gate Arrays with Other Technologies 1. CMOS When it comes to actual working gates, CMOS integration has advanced to the point where the maximum number of gates possible is over 150,000 gates, and gate arrays with feature sizes of 0.5�m have been practicalized. And CMOS devices that operate at system speeds of over 100MHz have been commercialized. Cost-performance-wise, GaAs gate arrays can't begin to compete with CMOS devices in applications that require less than 100MHz; this is the CMOS domain, and generally speaking, GaAs applications simply do not exist. In the over 100MHz range, however, even CMOS power consumption cannot be ignored. Figure 2 compares the power consumption of GaAs and CMOS at the basic gate level. Although CMOS power consumption is smaller below 50MHz, over 50MHz, GaAs power consumption becomes smaller than that of CMOS. This is because even though direct coupled field-effect transistor logic (DCFL), the basic circuit in GaAs devices, runs at steady-state current and consumes power even when in a non-operative state, because DCFL feature a low logic swing of roughly 0.6V, the increase in the amount of power consumed by capacitive load drive is negligible. With CMOS, because amplitude swings practically up to the supply voltage, load drive power consumption increases in proportion to the frequency. Capacitive load power consumption (P[.sub]W[/]) can be expressed as follows: P[.sub]W[/] = fcv[.sup]2[/] And when CMOS supply voltage is 3.3V, the power consumption of CMOS compared to that of GaAs is roughly 30-times higher. This difference is expressed as follows: GaAs DCFL : P[.sub]W[/] = fc(0.6)[.sup]2[/] CMOS : P[.sub]W[/] = fc(3.3)[.sup]2[/] Here f is the operating frequency, c is the drive load capacity and v is the logic swing. At the chip level, as shown in Figure 3, GaAs power consumption becomes smaller than CMOS consumption at around 140MHz and above. This indicates that GaAs will have the advantage over CMOS as system operating frequencies continue to rise in future. Figure 2. Comparison of Power Consumption of GaAs and CMOS Basic Gates Figure 3. Comparison of Power Consumption in GaAs and CMOS Chips In the field of new processors such as RISC, the operating speeds of which will increase even further in future, these high-speeds are being dealt with using parallel architectures such as super pipelines and super scalers that become plus or minus 200MHz CMOS clocks. But it is getting harder and harder to get around the intricate circuitry and increasing power consumption. It is becoming increasingly likely that single architecture GaAs technology with its high-speed operation and comparatively low power consumption will find application in these fields as well. 2. ECL ECL devices with tens of thousands of gates have been practicalized. However, circuitry-wise, the ECL approach poses problems when it comes to increasing integration levels. And as power consumption increases in line with higher levels of integration, forced cooling with liquid coolants will become inevitable. Thus, in addition to LSI costs, extra costs will be required for these cooling measures and for power supply capacity. GaAs devices consume only 1/4 to 1/3 of the power consumed by ECL. Therefore, an ECL operating at 1.5W, the limit for natural air cooling, will only have about 1,000 gates, whereas a GaAs gate array operating at this same power level could be equipped with up to 10,000 gates (See Figure 4). Also, the size ratio of a basic ECL gate is roughly 20-times bigger than that of a GaAs device, making the ECL device inferior to the GaAs gate array in terms of degree of integration as well. Figure 4. Comparison of Degree of Integration and Power Consumption Between GaAs and ECL Devices In addition, the fabrication process for ECL devices is more complicated than that for GaAs arrays and CMOS devices. This process promises to become even more complex in future as manufacturers of ECL devices strive to increase operating speeds, and the higher fabrication costs will prove a drawback for ECL. Since GaAs gate arrays consume less power than ECL devices and are on a par with CMOS when it comes to gate size and fabrication processes, from the standpoints of integration and fabrication costs, GaAs arrays are sufficiently competitive with ECL devices. It is felt this will result in a switch to GaAs from ECL in future. 3. GaAs Since GaAs devices are capable of integration levels on a par with CMOS, GaAs gate arrays with 150,000 working gates have already been practicalized. Speed is a trade off with number of gates, but GaAs gate arrays with several tens of thousands of gates will be capable of operating at system speeds of approximately 800MHz. And scaling should make it possible to increase this speed in future. GaAs devices operate at low supply voltage. Fujitsu's GG11 gate array strives to lower power consumption by setting internal supply voltage at 1.2V. Thus, especially when it comes to increasing the level of integration of large-scale systems, GaAs gate arrays offer a plus in that their ability to operate at low supply voltage can reduce power consumption. Gate delay time hardly changes at all when supply voltage ranges between 1-2V (see Figure 5). Therefore, the portable equipment and other fields where advances are being made toward lowering supply voltage are ideal fields for the application of GaAs devices capable of operating on a single 1.2V battery. GaAs devices are also expected to find applications in mobile telecommunications, the market for which is growing steadily.

Fujitsu's GaAs Gate Arrays Figure 5. Supply Voltage, Delay Time and Power Consumption Characteristics of GaAs Gate Arrays With its new GG series, development of which commenced in June 1993, Fujitsu scaled-down gate length to 0.5�m in an attempt to increase operating speed. Figure 6 shows photographs of a 0.5�m GG series 25K-gate chip and packaged device. 1. 0.5�m GG Series Process To suppress the short channel effect, we employed embedded p layer LDD structures for the basic elements, and achieved gate lengths of 0.5�m. Our major tasks were enhancing yield as we increased the degree of integration, and holding down on the dispersion of the threshold voltage in particular. By employing self-aligning technology that uses high-heat resistant tungsten silicide in the gate electrodes we were able to increase the degree of integration and to achieve favorable Schottky characteristics. 2. Mass Production System Fabrication capabilities for GaAs gate arrays have posed a problem in the past, so Fujitsu constructed a dedicated GaAs LSI fabrication line and commenced mass production of these devices in earnest in 1991. This new dedicated GaAs LSI line, the largest of its kind in the world, has been installed at the Fujitsu Custom Device plant in Showa-machi, Nakakyoma-gun (phonetic) near Kofu-shi in Yamanashi Prefecture, and is operating together with other fabrication lines there that have been turning out compound semiconductor products such as optical semiconductor elements and microwave semiconductor elements for some time now. The full-scale commencement of this mass production line has enhanced yield, shortened fabrication time and made possible stable supplies of GaAs LSIs. Figure 6. Photographs of a 0.5�m GG Series Chip and 3. Cost Performance The wafers used to fabricate GaAs LSI are 4-inches in diameter, which is small compared to the 6- to 8-inch wafers used for silicon MOS. The manufacturers of these wafers have already test manufactured 6-inch sizes, and the switch to 6-inch GaAs LSI wafers will be taking place before to long. Unlike silicon, which exists in unlimited amounts, gallium and arsenide are rare materials. At present, stable supplies of these rare materials are being maintained via refining processes, but they are expensive compared to silicon material. Seven masks are used in the fabrication of GaAs LSI using bulk processing techniques. This is about on a par with the number of masks used to fabricate silicon MOS devices, but works out to less than half the masks needed for silicon bipolar devices. Although the cost of GaAs wafers is rather high, since manufacturing costs are equal to those for silicon MOS devices, total costs are not really that much higher. And if we calculate in the improved yields achieved with GaAs LSI, overall costs drop to the level of those for silicon-based BiCMOS. Future GaAs Trends The size of the chip itself makes it nearly impossible to reduce the cost of producing large-scale gate arrays with over 100,000 gates. Large-scale system LSIs aimed at the supercomputer market have high value-added, and are in demand despite their relatively high price tags. However, LSIs aimed at the manufacturing and consumer products markets must fall into the category of high-performance, low-cost devices. In the future, therefore, manufacturers of GaAs LSIs targeting these markets will focus on productive-size series in the under 40,000-gate class. It isn't possible to keep up with applications requiring increasingly complicated, high functions with gate array technology alone. In particular, it will be necessary to provide high-speed, large-capacity random access memory (RAM) for the ATM switches used in B-ISDN so essential for future high-speed, large-capacity data transmission functions, the PLL technology imperative for future telecommunications applications, and high-speed analog technologies such as analog-digital converters (ADC)/digital-analog converters (DAC) and LDD. Steps must urgently be taken to create systems for developing custom ICs and the standard cell technology built-into so-called analog macros. This cannot be handled simply by the high gate integration levels capable with GaAs. It will be these other technologies that determine the extent that GaAs ICs, with their high-speed, low-voltage operation, are utilized in future in the high value-added field of mobile communications. Conclusions GaAs MESFET technology with 0.5�m dimensions has already been practicalized. Scaling will continue in future in an attempt to increase operating speeds yet further, but the short channel effect prevalent in GaAs MESFETs makes scaling down below the 0.5�m level difficult. High electron mobility transistors (HEMT) and other heterojunction devices will have to be introduced to enable scaling to proceed to the 0.35�m level. Technology is now being practicalized that will not only be able to reduce power consumption during standby like CMOS can, but should also make it possible to shave almost a whole digit off the amount of power consumed by CMOS during operation.[.sup]1)[/] This is a complementary-type circuit with a metal-insulator-silicon (MIS) structure that employs heterojunction technology. These technologies should expand applications of GaAs LSIs in mobile communications equipment, which are being designed for ever faster operating speeds and lower power consumption. Bibliography 1.
