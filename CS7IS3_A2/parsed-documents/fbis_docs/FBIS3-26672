Under the Lisbon Protocol signed in May 1992, all the nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan should be transferred to Russia for destruction within seven years. Explaining why Kazakhstan had been going at a slow pace of 12 missiles a year, Zhukeyev told journalists that some of its material requests have not been met. He said that Kazakhstan should own the uranium contained in its nuclear warheads because Kazakhstan accounted for 50 percent of the uranium produced by the former Soviet Union. He added that as the nuclear test site of Semipalatinsk [spelling of name as received] in Kazakhstan has caused harm to more than one million residents in the surrounding areas, Kazakhstan has the right to demand material compensation. However, he told the press that his country remains committed to the Lisbon protocol. He also denied a recent allegation of the Russian newspaper IZVESTIYA that the nuclear weapons in his country are "on the verge of accidents". A total of 104 SS-18 ICBM are deployed on the soil of Kazakhstan. The fuels of these missiles will be burnt in high-temperatured closed furnaces in Kazakhstan, for which the United States will provide technical aid and 75 million U.S. dollars, official sources said.
