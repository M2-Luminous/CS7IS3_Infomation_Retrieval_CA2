A source at the information center of Gamsakhurdia's rebels told Interfax that the conclusion was based on a careful analysis of the situation, but that the truth would be known after several days, for everything depended on whether a reply came from Gamsakhurdia himself, to whom an inquiry had been sent. The source said those who had told Gamsakhurdia's wife Manana about his death had not been to western Georgia for two weeks. The source said the rumors about Gamsakhurdia's suicide had apparently been launched by the Georgian leadership and had three aims: prepare a basis for his planned assassination, deal a mortal blow at the national liberation movement in western Georgia, and force Gamsakhurdia's closer relatives to return to Georgia in order to, by taking them hostage, force him to surrender to the authorities. The source said the plot had had the opposite effect, Gamsakhurdia having received more support.
