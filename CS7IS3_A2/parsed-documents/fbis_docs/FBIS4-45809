Other areas of industry will also be targeted. This will be done through the new Wexford-based Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which will issue a series of detailed licences covering a range of industrial operations from the middle of next month. Although the licensing system will not initially cover the pharmaceutical industry, it is known that Mr Browne is anxious to bring this into place as quickly as possible, particularly because of accidents at Cork plants last summer. Cork Co Council had been asked to review the licence for the Hickson plant at Ringaskiddy, where a major fire took place last year, but has failed to do so. The EPA will now have the job. The new regulations, which come into force on May 16, mean the EPA will be responsible for licensing various operations which have pollution potential. These include chemicals, food and drink, minerals and other materials, energy, wood, paper, textiles and leather, cement and waste. Other activities will be phased into the licensing system and Mr Browne has said that large-scale manufacture of pesticides, pharmaceutical or veterinary products and the incineration of waste will come into the EPA's scope from September 1. Mr Browne said: "I am determined that large-scale, complex and specialised activities should come within the EPA's control as rapidly as possible and I will be keeping a watch on the level of new activity in the various categories and how the system works."
