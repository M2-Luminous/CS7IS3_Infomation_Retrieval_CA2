The addition of water other than that originally present prior to processing will render standard wine ``other than standard.'' Use shall not alter virous character. Spinning cone1 To reduce the ethyl alcohol content of wine and to remove off flavors in wine Use shall not alter vinous character. For standard wine, the same amount of essense must be added back to any lot of wine as was originally removed. ␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ * Ultrafiltration To remove proteinaceous material from wine; to reduce harsh tannic material from white wine produced from white skinned grapes; to remove pink color from blanc de noir wine; to separate red wine into low color and high color wine fractions for blending purposes. Permeable membranes which are selective for molecules greater than 500 and less than 25,000 molecular weight with transmembrane pressures less than 200 psi. Use shall not alter vinuous character. 21 CFR 175.300, 177.1520, 177.1550, 177.1630, 177.2440, 177.2600, and 177.2910. 1This process must be done on distilled spirits plant premises. However, reverse osmosis, under certain limited conditions, may be used on bonded winery premises if ethyl alcohol is only temporarily created within a closed system. (Sec. 201, Pub.
