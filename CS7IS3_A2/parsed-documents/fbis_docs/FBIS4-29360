The move will be welcomed by nonlife insurance companies that are gaining interest in procuring funds. A convertible bond is a bond that can be converted into the shares of a company at a fixed price. Koa Fire and Marine Insurance Co. is seen issuing 30 billion yen in CBs as early as July, while Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co., and Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co. are predicted to follow suit. The ministry has so far restricted the issuance of CBs to prevent nonlife insurance firms from easily raising funds and making investments, the sources said. The CB market has been weak since the burst of the "bubble economy," but it is now showing signs of improvement. Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co. was the last nonlife insurance firm to issue CBs, in July 1989.
