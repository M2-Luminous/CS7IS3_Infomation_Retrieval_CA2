Likewise, it is a sufficient rank and exaltedness for that authority that the Creator, who is praised and exalted, set judgeship in the place following prophethood. Thus He says--may He be exalted [Koran 2:213]: "The people were one nation; then God sent forth the Prophets, good tidings to bear and warning, and He sent down with them the Book with the truth, that He might decide between the people touching their differences." He who is exalted has also said [Koran 38:26]: "David, behold, We have appointed thee a viceroy in the earth; therefore judge between men justly, and follow not caprice." What greater and loftier tribute to the judicial authority could there be than that the Creator should set it in a place of elevation and dignity, so that "Just" became one of the God's Names most beautiful? I should not be overstepping the fact or offending against the truth if I affirmed and averred that the independence of the judicial authority is the sole guarantee that ensures the citizen the justice he seeks, and that through the neutrality and independence of that authority justice is upheld. If affairs of state are managed with justice, the state stands and is upright; but if justice is not maintained in the state, the state endures pains and perishes. Impairment of the judicial authority's independence is impairment of the state's sovereignty that should prevail. This is a true saying for Egypt and for history. I swear that it is free of any admixture of hypocrisy or flattery; for we have no remnant of life left to play the hypocrite with any creature, however mighty his authority and great his respect. We will hold fast to respect for God; on His strength alone we call for help, and to none but Him do our heads and faces bow. It is a true saying that we all must repeat and affirm, that the judicial authority is the country's inviolable honor. All of us, rulers and ruled, therefore have an obligation to bring about its full and unimpeded independence, so that its agents can perform their duty without fear of tyrant's sword, shunning the wealth of a ruler as wealthy as al-Mu'izz and the most tempting of gifts. This will never come to pass except by freeing the [judicial] authority from subordination to any other authority. A state that does not preserve the independence of its judicial authority is a state that refuses to uphold justice and makes coercion, force, and tyranny the way of governing. You will find that such a state has lost its way; and having lost its way, it will not bring dignity to its people, because the dignity of the people comes from the dignity of the judicial authority. There is no good in a nation where the independence of the judiciary is not safeguarded. There is nothing more dangerous for a people's ethics and culture than for the executive authority to interfere in matters of justice or for that authority to impose its tutelage over the judicial authority, so that it impairs the judiciary's independence. The judiciary then becomes subordinate to something else, not to its own conscience. Only the agents of the judiciary, without supervision from any other authority, can administer and uphold justice. We must remember and never forget that when the calamitous massacre of the judiciary took place, it shook the independence of the judiciary. The massacre was really a massacre of the people's rights and freedoms. When the executioners subdued the independence of the judiciary and sent the law on vacation, dens of oppression and power centers arose. Vipers rushed forth to usurp power and assume guardianship over people's livelihoods and resources. They built a spurious empire of Satanic usurpation. They allowed themselves to commit every forbidden act. They froze the people into feudal structures. They created legions of proteges and political adolescents. We must realize and ponder how when the judiciary lost its independence, the people lost their freedom. When the people lost their freedom, proud Egypt lost every war it entered against its enemies. Thus when judicial independence does not exist, it is an enormous wrong against the judiciary itself. Indeed, it is a shameful wrong on the part of whoever impairs that independence. Wrong leads only to wrong; bats multiply in the darkness. Thus there is no room for freedom without the independence of the judiciary: for the citizen's freedom comes from the freedom and independence of his judge. We have already discussed in previous articles how it would be a matter of justice to abolish the Ministry of Justice. That ministry must disappear. Its continued existence is an impairment of the judicial authority's independence. It is the imposition of a hateful tutelage that the executive authority spreads over the judicial authority. The time has come for us to call on President Mubarak for help--he who is calling for the building of an Egypt of justice and purity, that it may be recorded in the pages of his administration's history that there was no tutelage over the judicial authority, no interference by the executive authority in the administration of justice, and no impairment of the judiciary's independence. No to the existence of the Ministry of Justice! Yes--a thousand times yes--to the Higher Judicial Council, the legitimate father of the agents of the judicial authority and to every matter related to justice in Egypt!
