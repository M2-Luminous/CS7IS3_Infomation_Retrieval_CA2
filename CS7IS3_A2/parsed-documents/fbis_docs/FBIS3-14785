An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from reliable unofficial sources that according to preliminary vote counts, the ADP gathered more than 43 percent of votes. In spite of forecasts, an unexpected success was achieved by the bloc of the Socialist Party and the Yedinstvo Intermovement, relying on the support of the Russian-speaking population, which received more than 20 percent of votes. Like the agrarians, this bloc also supports Moldovan independence, a just solution of the Gagauz and Dniester problems, and the strengthening of links with the CIS. Judging by the preliminary election results, in the new Moldovan parliament their opposition will comprise the Popular Christian Democratic Front, supporting unification with Romania, which received approximately 7 percent of votes, and the bloc of the intelligentsia and peasants, led by Aleksandru Mosanu, ex-speaker of the Moldovan parliament, which gathered approximately 13 percent of the votes. In the view of observers, these figures indicate that nationalistically oriented parties have won a major victory in the Moldovan elections. Judging by the preliminary election results, of the 13 parties and movements that took part in the elections, so far only four have managed to pass the 4 percent barrier. The Central Electoral Commission is still summing up the final results of the voting. However, in the view of party representatives, these are unlikely to differ from the preliminary results.
