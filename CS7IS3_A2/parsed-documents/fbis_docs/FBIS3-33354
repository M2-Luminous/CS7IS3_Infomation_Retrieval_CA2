Colonel Edgardo Cuellar, police commander in Meta Department, said that among those released is Jorge Perez, the ruling Liberal Party's candidate for the Chamber of Representatives who was kidnapped last Sunday on a highway in the area. According to the source, the candidate is the bearer of a message from the guerrillas to the Colombian Government in which the guerrillas ratify their support for regional peace dialogues as an instrument for ending the armed conflict in this South American country. Leovigildo Criollo, Perez' campaign coordinator, and Jose Lozano, mayor of Puerto Rico, Meta Department, were also released with Perez. "They treated us well. They only wanted to send a message of peace to the government," Lozano told local media. Also released were city mayors David Delgado of Alejandria and Jaime Alonso Cano of Santo Domingo as well as John Jairo Duque, president of the Santo Domingo Council, all of whom had been kidnapped earlier by members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and were released in San Rafael, Antioquia Department. The Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Board, which groups the two largest rebel groups in the country, began an offensive early this year to sabotage the legislative and presidential elections scheduled for March and May, respectively. As part of this offensive, tens of political party offices have been destroyed and five candidates to parliament and four mayors have been kidnapped in Antioquia, Tolima, Cundinamarca, Arauca, and Meta departments. President Cesar Gaviria's administration announced that in view of the guerrilla offensive, the authorities have redoubled surveillance of the political groups and increased the corps of bodyguards for the various candidates. In addition, it warned that the wave of attacks will not intimidate the population, nor will it suspend the elections in any part of the country.
