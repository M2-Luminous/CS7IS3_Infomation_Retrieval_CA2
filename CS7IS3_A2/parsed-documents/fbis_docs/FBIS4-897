In a press statement the commission, headed by High Court Judge Anastazia Msosa, charged that Malawi Congress Party officials had been seizing or buying voter registration certificates, to be used in presidential and parliamentary elections on May 17. The commission said it had gathered its own evidence that the party had been doing this in nine of Malawi's 24 districts. It said chiefs -- who play an influential role in rural politics -- and MCP officials were the main culprits in snatching voter certificates. "Voters have either been told to surrender their certificates and come to a central location on election day to retrieve them so that everyone votes for the same candidate, or they have simply been taken without promise of return," the commission said. The commission also reported two cases of opposition parties violating the electoral law. It said an official of the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) was apprehended while attempting to seize registration certificates and another official of the Malawi National Democratic Party bought voter certificates to secure the election of presidential candidate Tim Mangwazu. The commission, which has pledged to prosecute violators of the electoral law, said campaign violence and intimidation had been noted in several districts. "Tit-for-tat campaign meeting disruptions resulting in a number of injuries have occurred between the opposition United Democratic Front and the ruling party," the commission said. This was the first time that the commission, set up by parliament had openly accused Banda's party of breaking the electoral law. If convicted, offenders face up to two years imprisonment or a maximum fine of 5,000 kwacha (800 US dollars).
