Brekhov, V.A. Moraru, Moscow Aviation Engineering Institute; UDC 681.324:519.21] [Abstract] A nontraditional dataflow computer architecture whereby the sequence of tasks in the dataflow-controlled computer (EVM UPD) is determined only by the readiness of the relevant data and if resources permit, jobs are executed concurrently and independently, is discussed, and an earlier study is expanded. An evaluation of the dataflow computer performance with changes in the multisequencing factor K in the neighborhood of unity calls for developing a probabilistic model with a random processor loading, i.e., given commensurate data processing durations in the storage blocks and processors. The dependence of the dataflow computer performance on the types of jobs being executed is considered and compared to the performance of a von Neumann series computer. An efficient recurrent procedure is developed for determining the steady-state dataflow computer model probabilities, making it possible to assess the computer performance as a function of the number of processors, storage blocks, their speed of response, work load parameters, throughput, and communication networks. An efficiency analysis demonstrates that as the number of processors increases to ten or higher, the dataflow computer performance is better than that of computer systems with traditional architecture. The specific boundary depends on the algorithmic and architectural parameters of the system under study. Figures 14; references 8: 5 Russian, 3 Western.
