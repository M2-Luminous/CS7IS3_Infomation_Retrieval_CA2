This is not the first time the head of the UN Special Commission has made such a declaration. For some time, Mr. Ekeus has been talking about matters that go beyond the technical aspects of arms, disarmament, and other issues related to weapons of mass destruction. When weapons-related issues were still pending between Iraq and the Special Commission, particularly questions pertaining to ways of implementing relevant UN Security Council resolution, Ekeus and other UN officials emphasized in their statements the need for Iraq to respect the resolutions of the international legitimacy, particularly the UN Security Council resolutions. They used to say the decision to lift the sanctions depends on Iraq's implementation of those resolutions, which they admit to be negative, illegitimate, and unjust. When Iraq declared that it had fully complied with the UN Security Council resolutions and that there is no justification for the continued blockade, they started raising issues which in themselves are considered a circumvention of those resolutions and their objectives. To appease their masters in Washington, it is absolutely clear that sometimes they play with words and sometimes they play for time to prolong the blockade. Therefore, saying that the blockade question depends on the UN Security Council political plans exposes the last pretext in a series of pretexts they have been using throughout the stages of the blockade. This also proves that the matter has nothing to do with Iraq's implementation of UN Security Council resolutions. As Ekeus bluntly put it, the question needs a political decision. Talk about a political decision is no surprise for Iraq. In fact, it perhaps surprises some quarters which (?used to believe) that Iraq's implementation of UN Security Council resolutions means paving the way for lifting the blockade. However, as proved by recent events, the matter is not like that. As Ekeus says, the decision is political rather than technical, as it should be. At any rate, great Iraq has managed to expose all the faces hiding behind false, glimmering slogans. Iraq is now capable of exposing them completely to prove to the entire world that all their words on legitimacy are false.
