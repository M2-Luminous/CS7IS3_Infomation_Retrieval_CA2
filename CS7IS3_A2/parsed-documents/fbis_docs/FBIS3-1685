Qiao made the remarks at a meeting with George Shultz, chairman of the International Council of J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, and other council members here this morning. The council also includes former British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe and former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew. They have been here to attend the 40th session of the council held in Beijing on February 27 and 28. This year, China is taking major steps to reform its systems of tax, finance, investment, planning, foreign exchange and trade, Qiao told the guests. Some reform measures have been phased in and even more measures are being considered and in the drafting stage, Qiao said. China is confident of the realization of its modernization, Qiao said. However, it is fully aware that to achieve this demands strenuous efforts of generations. "We have taken note of the gaps between the workers and peasants, and between regions in the east and west of the country," Qiao said, adding that "we are trying to narrow these gaps." Briefing the guests on the NPC's work, Qiao said that the current NPC and its Standing Committee are committed to promote the construction of the country's democracy and legislation, and to establish an initial legal framework suited to China's socialist market economy. Shultz said the fact that the council chose Beijing as the meeting site was itself a good indication of the strong interest of its members in China.
