Some 70 armed Serbs took over the bridge across the Sara river linking Stara Gradiska in southern Croatia to Bosanska Gradiska in northern Bosnia, Marcotte said. The Nepalese were negotiating with the Serbs and had called for reinforcements from a Jordanian battalion, he added, but referred to the incident as "fairly minor" with no direct incidence on the war in Bosnia. The spokesman was not able to say if the Serbs came from the self-proclaimed Krajina Republic in Croatia or the similar self-declared Serb Republic in Bosnia. But the Croatian Serb news agency ISKRA monitored in Belgrade said the bridge had been seized by a unit of Krajina's "special police." It said the bridge was a "means of UNPROFOR pressure on the Serbian people of Western Slavonia (in north-central Croatia)" and quoted the head of the "special police," Krsto Zekovic, as saying that his men would take over all points on the border between the two self-proclaimed Serbian republics guarded by UN troops.
