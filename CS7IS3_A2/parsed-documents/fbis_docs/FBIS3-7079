The Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), Japan's largest umbrella of trade unions, said the steel, automobile, shipbuilding and heavy machinery, and electrical machinery industries offered wage hikes of between 1.56 percent and 3.3 percent. The level of wage increases to be attained by the four key industries is regarded as a pacesetter for other industries in wage negotiations. Unions of the steel, automobile, and shipbuilding and heavy machinery industries accepted the offer. If the unions accept the offer, the average margin of wage hikes of the major industries will be at the lower half of the 3 percent level, falling below the previous low of 3.5 percent in 1987. At that time, the country's export-driven economy suffered setbacks due to the yen's appreciation brought about by the 1985 Plaza Accord among major industrialized countries to engineer a stronger yen, Labor Ministry officials said. Unions of nine electric power companies accepted a hike of 9,950 yen per month, or 3.05-3.14 percent, down from 12,100 yen last year. Major private railway unions, which threaten to stage a 24-hour strike on Friday, are expected to call off the strike after management offered a hike of 11,400 yen, or 3.94 percent, in negotiations Thursday night. Most unions, pressed to choose between jobs and wage hikes under the recession, are expected to accept the proposals to secure jobs, labor officials said. Five major steelmakers jointly proposed a hike of 1.56 percent, or 4,500 yen per month. The previous year's wage hike was 2.65 percent, or 7,500 yen. The steelmakers are Nippon Steel Corp., NKK Corp., Kawasaki Steel Corp., Sumitomo Metal Industry Ltd., and Kobe Steel Ltd. Nippon Steel was the only one of the five not to skip dividends to shareholders in the 1993 business year ending March 31. Seventeen major electrical machinery firms, meanwhile, proposed raising wages by a uniform 3.05 percent, against the labor demand for a 3.2 percent hike. The firms' unions, which threatened a 12-hour strike from Friday noon, are expected to accept the offer. Among the 17 were Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corp., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Mitsubishi Electric Corp., NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. In the automobile industry, Toyota Motor Corp. proposed a hike of 3.06 percent, or an average 9,200 yen, in monthly wages. Negotiating sessions between management and unions are expected to settle on this level even though the unions have demanded a rise of 5 percent, or 9,600 yen, Toyota officials said. Nissan Motor Co. offered its workers a hike of 2.89 percent, or 8,400 yen. Managements of seven leading shipbuilders proposed increasing wages by a uniform 3.3 percent, or 9,700 yen per month, officials said. Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said that the wage proposals reflected a "wise choice" of both management and labor to place priority on jobs.
