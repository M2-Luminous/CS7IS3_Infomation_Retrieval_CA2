Our province reaped a bumper grain harvest in 1993. The total output of grain and soybean totaled 23 billion kg, the best record in history. As of 20 January this year, we had laid up 3.165 billion kg of grain under state contract purchase, fulfilling 79.9 percent of the contract purchasing task. The annual grain purchase totaled 5.05 billion kg, surpassing the plan by 26 percent. The provincial grain departments have resolutely proceeded from the provincial conditions and grain conditions, reformed the grain purchasing and marketing system, and on the basis of the previous year's reduction of grain purchasing quota and decontrol of grain marketing work, implemented the system of stabilizing the grain purchasing quota and decontrolling the marketing of grain, continued to decontrol grain management and grain prices, effectively alleviated the difficulties of peasants in selling grain, and guaranteed the stability and vitality of urban and rural grain and cereal oil markets. Forty-two prefectures, cities and counties across the province have established grain markets and put them into operation. We have initially formed a grain system with provincial grain wholesale markets as the head, regional markets as the backbone, and city and county primary markets as the basis, and succeeded in reducing deficits and increasing profits. In grain work, this year our province should further deepen the grain purchasing and marketing system; the annual grain purchase should be 7.5 billion kg, and the marketing of grain should be 6 billion kg. Beginning from the time when new grains are put on the market, we should implement the method of guaranteeing the amount of grain under state contract purchase and decontrol its prices and allowing the province to retain 460 million kg of grain under contract purchase, and after the implementation of this method, relatively abolish the cash deposit for the contract purchase of soybean and the coefficient of guaranteeing the amount of grain purchase. The grain purchasing prices will be adjusted according to market demands, and the system of protective prices will be implemented. While doing a good job in grain marketing, all localities should also pay attention to grain export. Beginning this year, in the export of state grain, we will change the system of delivering grain at government fixed prices into the system of exporting grain through agents at negotiation prices. At present, special efforts should be made to seize the opportunity of export grain to Japan, open up the channel of exporting rice, and expand the quota of grain export during border trade. Meanwhile, we should actively promote reform of the property right system, copy the work methods of Mudanjiang city grain bureau and Bayan County grain bureau, and do a good job in reform of the enterprise shareholding system. This year we should guarantee that the deficits of the grain departments will not exceed the contract quota of 730 million yuan, and that no new deficits or default in payments will occur. During the Spring Festival, we should make proper arrangements for the grain, cereal oil, and salt markets in an all-round manner, persist in selling products according to the price tags, and realistically organize the living of people in the disaster areas.
