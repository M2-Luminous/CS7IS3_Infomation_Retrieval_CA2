FBIS4-68547 "jpusr051___94049" FBIS-USR-94-051 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 29 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS Media Court Head Vengerov Interviewed Media Court Head Vengerov Interviewed 944F0666A Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA in Russian No 17, 29 Apr 94 p 9 944F0666A Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Interview with Anatoliy Vengerov, chairman of the Judicial Board on Informational Disputes, conducted by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent: "Power of the Mass Media"] [Text] Anatoliy VENGEROV, chairman of the Judicial Board on Informational Disputes, believes: The informational space of Russia is ever more becoming a battlefield, on which the main problems of its future are decided. In December of 1993, 65-year old professor of law and head of the state and law department at Moscow State Juridical Academy, Anatoliy Borisovich Vengerov, became the chairman of Russia's newly created Judicial Board on Informational Disputes. It was organized in accordance with the presidential edict on the basis of the Arbitration Informational Court. Today the Judicial Board has seven members, three of which are journalists and four--jurists. [Correspondent] What real achievements has the Judicial Board had time to accomplish for society and for the mass media? [Vengerov] In this time, we have issued 11 rulings, all on controversial and very complex problems of current times, associated with major inter-ethnic conflicts, with the recognition of the reliability and objectivity of facts published in the press, and with the most acute political disputes in society. We have also made two announcements. The first--on the newspaper ZAVTRA in connection with the publication by Iona Andronova, "The Secrets of the Kremlin," which consisted of vicious lies directed toward the destabilization of the situation in the country. The second was in regard to your publication, in connection with the situation surrounding "Version No 1." At the same time, we have issued rulings on 50 other various requests and applications. We also had to look into the question of who issues licenses for television broadcasting today and how. The journalists from Arkhangelsk Oblast asked about this, as they were unable to find such an agency in the country. It turned out that there really is no such agency today, and this is a violation of the law. We also received inquiries from Vladivostok, where a journalist was insulted, being refused the right to participate in press conferences. We reviewed the acute situations surrounding the mass media in Orel, Voronezh, Derbent, and Kemerovo. In Kemerovo, on the contrary, the local press went beyond the framework of what was morally acceptable in its publications, and we forced it to write a retraction of its repeated insults addressed at the local administration. Although it is true, instead of a retraction, it poured forth new insults... In short, we are not sitting idle. I would like to stress that most of the cases which we have reviewed concern not capital, but regional publications. Most often it is there that informational disputes arise, and as yet we cannot provide a sufficiently effective mechanism of influence by the Judicial Board, which is located in Moscow, on local disputes. It seems we must create regional judicial boards modelled after our own, for the rapid review of regional informational disputes. [Correspondent] Does it not seem to you that, even without a further increase in judicial boards similar to your own, we already have very many different organizations which are supposedly engaged in protecting free speech? [Vengerov] Without a doubt, the Russian informational space is simply overloaded with them, and free speech itself may perish in the embrace of such defenders. Just look: There is a state inspection on protecting freedom of the press and the mass media under the Roskompechat [RF Committee on the Press], and the Roskompechat itself, and our Judicial Board, and the Administration for Informational Provision under the president, and the Committee on Informational Policy and Communications of the State Duma, and the Federal Service on Television and Radio Broadcasting. Here we must add also the numerous social organizations--the Union of Journalists, the Committee for Protection of the Rights of Journalists, and so on and so forth... [Correspondent] Evidently, this is not an elemental process, when everyone wants to defend glasnost a little bit? It is not a random occurence? [Vengerov] Of course, it is a regularity--a direct reflection of that state of society when the informational space, along with the legal, is ever more becoming the object of very specific skirmishes. I am convinced that the mass media today in Russia is a real and very strong power, a social field on which, perhaps, the very main things in the future of the country are being decided. And very many see this informational field as such--as a field where they must conquer. This explains the emergence of the large number of structures about which we speak. They are really waging a struggle for this field, for influence in the mass media, which is not only an instrument for ensuring power. It can create power, but it can also kill it. Newspapers today have the power to give birth to politicians, and to cast them down. [Correspondent] It seems to me that you are somewhat exaggerating. Such a fateful role is sooner within the power of present-day television. As a rule, the real practicing journalist today gets the opposite impression, that he is being stubbornly ignored both by the authorities and by the people. [Vengerov] No, I know what I am talking about. Television today is merely one of the channels of influence by the fourth power, perhaps the quickest and most widespread. However, sociological studies, including those conducted at our request, show that in the regions, of which Russia consists for the most part, it is the press organs which have the greatest influence. [Correspondent] It is interesting, how do we, the Russian journalists, appear in your eyes today? What are we lacking? What do we have in excess? [Vengerov] A certain portion of the journalists, and alas a considerable one, appear in my eyes to be totally irresponsible people. By irresponsibility I mean primarily a low ethical and political culture. However, I would like to emphasize that this is specifically my perception, and not reality, since any prosecuting or judicial workers most often see the negative side of life. In most of the cases which the Judicial Board reviews, there is a constant discussion of style and form of presentation of material. For example, recently we issued a ruling on the EKSPRESS-GAZETA which is published in Moscow, and whose founder is the newspaper KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (which receives state subsidies, and this is important in this situation), along with the publishing group SEGODNYA. EKSPRESS-GAZETA regularly publishes materials of an entirely inadmissable tone. One may read headlines such as, "Shokhin is Not an Onanist," or a narrative by a former journalist who has recalled a story told to him by Mikhail Poltoranin. One may have varying attitudes toward the latter. One may love him or hate him, but it is entirely inadmissable to publish material talking about how, when he was a young lad, Misha Poltoranin entertained himself with young friends such as himself in his native Altay by casting heavy stones across a raging river, and using the main object of manly pride as a sling shot. Despite the fact that the "Temporary Statute on Provision of Activity of State Duma Deputies" has been publicized, EXPRESS-GAZETA publishes an article where everything is garbled through and through, and where there is a real mockery of the deputy corps. We received an appeal from the Duma apparatus in regard to this publication, and rightly so--they have to defend themselves. Actually, when we studied the newspaper and the given material, we came to the conclusion that its activity surpasses all possible bounds of immorality. The lawyers defending the interests of the publication at our judicial session stated that the newspaper is young and such a presentation of material is a means of struggle for its place on the newspaper market, a method and style of conquering its competitors. Excuse me, but in our opinion this is simply filth. As a result, last week we adopted a decision which is unprecedented even for us: To ask the founder to dismiss the editor-in-chief, Aleksandr Kupriyanov, from his position. [Correspondent] And what if they do not listen to you, leave Kupriyanov in his place and after some time renew the publication of similar texts? [Vengerov] We have the right to present the question of issuing a warning for cessation of publication. I want to direct your attention to the fact that the cases with which we deal, as a rule, cannot be handled by ordinary judicial institutions. Well, can an ordinary court decide, for example, the problem of distributing television time between various parties during the period of the pre-electoral campaign? There is no way that it can. This is not within its competency. Can an ordinary court protect the interests of children against the vulgar attacks which, for example, the newspaper NOVYY VZGLYAD allows itself by publishing sadistic, masochistic and perverse materials? It cannot. It is within its powers to exact moral damages if someone specific has been wronged, to decide a case in someone's specific favor. My idea comes down to the fact that in the new pluralistic informational space, unique state arbitration agencies must emerge, which safeguard the moral interests of society above all. Such is our Judicial Board. [Correspondent] And is it in your power, for instance, to deprive a journal of operation? [Vengerov] Without a doubt, especially if the dispute surrounding its name is associated with state agencies. We have the right to pose the question of rebuke, or of reprimand, or of dismissal of a journalist. Recently we reviewed a very painful case, when a journalist ascribed her ideas and her own words to other persons. We are speaking of a series of publications in IZVESTIYA by Irina Dementyeva regarding the Osetin-Ingush conflict--"War and Peace in Prigorodnyy Rayon." We determined that Dementyeva had ascribed her own, in this case incorrect, judgments to the representatives of the organs of state power, and thereby distorted the real picture, thus evoking additional tension in an already grave conflict. Let us put it this way, we only scolded Dementyeva, but we could have posed the question of her punishment. [Correspondent] How actively do the Judicial Board's decisions get involved in politics? [Vengerov] Yes, we do get involved in politics, except not from a political standpoint, but rather from an ethical one. For example, we dealt with the situation in Nizhniy Novgorod in connection with the elections for mayor which were announced there. Governor Nemtsov himself wrote in the decree on elections that the state agencies cannot speak out on the side of one candidate or another, but then he himself began telling in the mass media about how he could simply have appointed anyone he saw fit as mayor. Without hesitating, we immediately said that Mr. Nemtsov was wrong. We quickly sent our decision by fax to Nizhniy Novgorod--to the editorial offices of the newspapers, to the mayor's office, and the elections were not held. [Correspondent] Have you personally ever engaged in any political activity? [Vengerov] Due to the nature of my character, I cannot participate in politics. [Correspondent] What newspapers do you prefer to read? [Vengerov] I subscribe to very many of them. I try to read the press which reflects different positions and different points of view. [Correspondent] Do you have any favorite newspaper authors? [Vengerov] Yes, I like to read Stanislav Kondrashov in IZVESTIYA. I do not like to see moans and groans of complaint in the newspapers. I prefer a thoughtful analytical style in which the author does not impose his ideas upon the reader, but rather invites him to participate in his reflections.
