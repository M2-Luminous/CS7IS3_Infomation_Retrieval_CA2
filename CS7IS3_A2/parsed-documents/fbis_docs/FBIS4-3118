Chen Xitong recently went to Daxing County to visit the Huangcun satellite city, Liuminying Village of Changziying Township, and Dongdian Village of Qingyundian Town. He asked in detail about their agricultural production, small industrial zones, township enterprises, village and town construction, greening of plain areas, and life of villagers. He also visited enterprises and villagers' homes to talk with cadres and the villagers. Located in plain area, Daxing County has fairly developed township enterprises and better conditions for grain production. When the party branch secretaries of Liuminying and Dongdian Villages reported that they had achieved better economic efficiency with less labor input thanks to operation on as large a scale as possible, Chen Xitong said: In order not to dampen peasants' enthusiasm for grain production, the state should provide support from various fields, and the municipality as well as counties and townships should continue their great support. In addition to this, developed plain areas may operate grain fields on as large a scale as possible in a selective and orderly manner when conditions permit in order to achieve high output, high quality, and high efficiency through expanding the scale and then raise labor productivity, increase income, and stimulate peasants' enthusiasm for grain production. Meanwhile, the large number of laborers laid off may be transferred to the secondary and tertiary industries. He pointed out: In developing agriculture, we should also emphasize accounting and improvement of labor productivity like enterprises do to make sure that growing grain can also make money. On the premise that the collective economy is consolidated and developed, the methods can be diversified. The method of operation on as large a scale as possible may be developed in the form of collective farms. It may also be developed in such a way that grain field management is contracted out to grain growing experts or large grain growing households and regular workers are reduced to the minimum. During busy seasons, temporary workers may be used, who will leave after work is finished. The fewer workers we hire, the better the productivity and comparable efficiency of grain production will be. At a joint venture in Liuminying Village, a metal structure plant, Chen Xitong asked about its production and talked cordially with workers. He said to Wang Yaoping, the county party secretary, and other comrades: Township enterprises should be greatly developed because they represent an extremely important way for rural areas to achieve prosperity. In rural areas, the number of people engaged in grain production should be small so that large numbers of peasants can be diverted from farmland to the secondary and tertiary industries. This is the way to make peasants affluent and lead a fairly comfortable life. As has been proven in practice, the better the township enterprises are developed in townships and villages, the faster their peasants will become affluent. In addition, the position of agriculture as the foundation will be safeguarded, and grain output increased. [passage omitted]
