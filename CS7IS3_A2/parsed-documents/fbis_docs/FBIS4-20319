On-Site Sidelights on Special People's Armed Police Unit Military Training Demonstration"] [Text] This is a stirring scene. This is a never-to-be forgotten moment. On the morning of 19 September 1993, many leading comrades drive cars to the Special Police Academy of the People's Armed Police [PAP] to view a demonstration of PAP military training results. On this occasion, the PAP, a sword that has been hardened for the past 10 years, is undergoing rigorous examination by the party and the people. I At exactly 0900 hours, on command from PAP Chief-of-Staff Wu Shuangzhan [0702 7175 2069], the military training demonstration begins with the national flag raising ceremony. To the rousing strains of "Sing in Praise of the Motherland," played by the PAP band, a contingent of flag escorts in dress uniform and carrying semi-automatic rifles closely accompanies three soldiers bearing flags as they goosestep across the rostrum. The Chinese people are renowned throughout the world as a nation devoted to ceremony. A march-past, the firing of a gun salute, and, the escorting of foreign guests are the three main events making up the PAP salute to the troops and welcoming of the guests. The PAP honor guard enters the grounds to the stirring sound of the military band. "Boom, boom..." Volley after volley of gunfire resounds, directing the eyes of those present to the left front of the exhibition grounds. Gun salute troops from the Eleventh Zhidui [regiment] of the Beijing Zongdui [corps] have now begun the gun salute. This unit was founded in 1984. Since the firing of its first gun salute on 23 March of the same year during the visit to China of Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone, it has successfully completed the firing of 238 gun salutes to welcome guests. Today, the gun salute troops are firing a 21-gun salute, the highest welcoming ceremony for foreign guests, to welcome the arrival of all the leaders. Within the short period of 1 minute 28 seconds, from the beginning to the end of the national anthem, it unerringly fires 21 volleys, each volley being fired simultaneously by four ceremonial guns. As the thunderous sound reverberates across the land, a powerful motorcycle cavalry spreads its wings and soars. At 0915 hours, the national guest escort appears on the exhibition grounds amidst the roar of motorcycles. All that is visible is imposing people's armed police driving white motorcycles to the left and right as they escort the vehicles carrying the foreign guests in a speedy entrance. During the nine years since the founding of this People's Armed Police contingent, which combines security and ceremonial escort functions into one, it has safely escorted heads of state, government leaders, and leaders of political parties in power from 152 nations in outstanding completion of its escort duties. II Volley after volley of rifle fire cracks. At 0929 hours, a dramatic demonstration begins in which Model 81 automatic rifles fire at targets on which Chinese characters face away from the audience. First four sharpshooters from the Special Police School, Wang Zhiwei, Mao Xiaodong, He Liming, and Hu Bo, came to the field. "Pop, pop, pop." With each crisp rifle shot, the words, "politically qualified, militarily accomplished, fine work style, strict discipline, and strong support" pop into view on the target in 20 large resplendent characters. These are Chairman Jiang Zemin's main requirements for building the armed forces. The next item in the dramatic demonstration is on truncheon and shield technique and boxing. These two subjects, which are demonstrated by the Thirteenth Detachment of the Beijing Headquarters Group and the People's Armed Police School, fully show the solid basic skills of People's Armed Police military training. The 20 basic fighting methods and the five offensive and defensive actions that the truncheon and shield contingent, made up of 216 men from the Thirteenth Detachment, demonstrates, shows an attack that sweeps everything before it like a hurricane, and a defense that is like a steel Great Wall. The fisticuffs technique that the 60-man special police personnel collectively demonstrate consists of very powerful battle-tested fighting techniques that the Special Police School has absorbed in the course of training from the essence of Chinese martial arts and the fisticuffs of all countries. They blend offensive and defensive techniques into a whole. Using their fists and feet, the action is determined and lively. A women's performance where no men are allowed. The performance of the Women's Enemy-Capturing Contingent from the Sichuan Headquarters attracts particular attention. In a one-on-one performance of capturing an enemy, young soldier Zhang Ying faces a club wielding young man who is half again as tall as herself Using the fighting skills for making a capture that she learned in regular training, with cunning, she manages to knock the "villain" to the ground in less than three maneuvers. The firing of Model 81 automatic rifles to designated parts of the human body brings the feelings of the spectators to a high pitch. From a distance of 100 meters, Five sharpshooters headed by Di Lin from the special police school aim at the targets, awaiting a command from the commander. "The villain is trying to fight back. Hit him in the forearm." "The villain is still fighting. Hit him in the chest." "....." With each command from the commander, the five sharpshooters fire, each shot hitting the part of the body they are directed to hit. Firing of the machine gun in bursts is a tough part of the contingent's training. Comrades from the military training and research office of the Tianjin Group Command School devoted 3 years study to this problem finally solving it. On the exhibition ground, two machinegunners fire at 15 steel plate targets from a distance of 100 meters. The rifle fire goes "bang, bang, bang,' and within 5 seconds all the targets are hit in 30 places. Immediately, enthusiastic applause breaks out on the exhibition ground. One leading comrade says, "It is not easy. The light machine gun that squads use does not do a good job, but the People's Armed Police troops are good shots!" The light machine gun precision rapid firing that the Anhui Headquarters Group shows opens the spectators' eyes even more. Six people including school police officer Ding Jiatie, each fire 100 rounds at a human chest target from 100 meters. After the firing ends, the range officer presents the target for examination to the leaders on the exhibition grounds. "Target number 1 hit with 100 rounds." "Target number 2 hit with 100 rounds." ... "Good shooting, good shooting." "Beep." With the sound of its horn, a long distance bus drives into a station. Four "criminals" mingle with the passengers and board the bus. As soon as the bus starts to move, the "criminals" suddenly fire their weapons to hijack the bus. The lives and property of the passengers are in serious danger. This is a tactical exercise conducted against a backdrop of real warfare. When our people's armed police detachment patrolling the highway discovers what the "criminals" have done, at once they notify headquarters via walkie-talkie. Immediately, a truck bearing local government license plates, and two Model 130 trucks appeared behind the bus. The officers and men of a Special Police combat company were under orders to remain in the vehicle as they began to subdue the "criminals" and rescue the hostages. The hijacked bus speeds along rapidly, our special police unit personnel in hot pursuit. When the bus reaches a relatively wide spot in the road, the lead truck suddenly overtakes it and brakes suddenly across the road ahead of it. When the bus driver instinctively brakes his vehicle, the two Model 130 trucks speed to the right sight of the bus. The special police detachment personnel leap from under the canvas top, smash some windows in the bus, and rush inside, capturing alive all four of the "criminals" as swiftly as a thunder clap that leaves no time for covering one's ears. All the hostages are released with no injury to any of our special police detachment personnel. No sooner does this intense battle end than the curtain opens on a battle to rescue hostages from a residential area . Seven "criminals" who had stolen a large sum of money, rifles and ammunition hijack a white van, which they are using to flee helter-skelter. Along the way, the van breaks down. To prevent the police from capturing them, the "criminals" place obstacles in the road including the van and lane separators, and set fire to them. Then, they flee to a residential apartment where they seized several people as hostages in the hope of being able to escape. As soon as our special police detachment receives the report, it immediately organizes four combat teams, which approach the apartments separately. Our riot prevention personnel fire a tear gas shell from within the riot prevention armored personnel carrier. The tear gas shell explodes in the room where the "criminals" are hiding, and white smoke gushes forth at once. Our combat team personnel, some of them following the downspout and others using rope, scale the building like geckos, leap into the room, and pin the "criminals" in a corner with firepower, seizing four of them alive. Another two "criminals" flee the building in an effort to escape. Our assault team personnel immediately set loose two watchdogs, which bring the "two criminals" to the ground in the twinkling of an eye. A roar of motors as the iron cavalry soars. The skilled motorcycle driving of the Guangdong Police Headquarters brings the exhibition to a high pitch. Six people's armed police headed by Gao Xueping, drive their iron cavalry motorcycles at high speed across a single plank and soar across a 1.5 meter high platform. "Next is flying across a short bridge. The bridge is 3.5 meters high, 3 meters wide, and 7 meters long. This simulates obstacles that might be set up in search and destroy combat..." After hearing the announcer's briefing, the leading comrades on the rostrum put their binoculars to their eyes to watch this daring performance. "Varoom, varoom." As the detachment members open the throttle, the motorcycles issues an ear-splitting noise. Then, six motorcycles fly toward the cut off bridge at lightening speed. The instant their front wheel hit the cut off bridge, they zoom into the air in an arc, then land safely on another cut off bridge 7 meters distant. Whew! They are like tigers vaulting a ravine or like a rainbow arching through the sky. The leading comrades on the rostrum are overwhelmed by the exceptional skills of the soldiers. They put down their binoculars and applaud warmly.
