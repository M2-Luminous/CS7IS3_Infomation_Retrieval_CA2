From the Ukrainian side, the following took part in the meeting: Yuriy Karasyk, Ukraine's minister of agriculture and foodstuffs; Borys Kyrychenko, chairman of the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs' directorate for foreign economic ties; and Mykola Shkarban, chairman of the Association of Ukrainian Farmers. The experts from the World Bank submitted for consideration a memorandum of a project for the restructuring of Ukraine's agriculture. It defines the structure of a possible guarantee fund for the preliminary financing of agricultural export, develops the structure for the supply of resources for agricultural production, and proposes assistance in creating land registry schemes, etc. According to the project, the granting of technical assistance will begin in September or October. As Mykola Shkarban, chairman of the Association of Ukrainian Farmers, informed a UNIAN correspondent, the World Bank is allocating $20-30 million for the restructuring of Ukraine's agriculture, of which $10 million is for an appraisal of the country's land resources. However, in total the World Bank could, as part of this project, allocate $1.2 billion but this amount will be allocated only on condition that the Ukrainian Government fulfills the following demands: controls emission, reduces the budget deficit to a minimum, and lifts restrictions on exports and creates a single system of hard currency conversion. However, in Mykola Shkarban's words: "Ukraine is not fulfilling these conditions and is not likely to do so in the near future and that is why we will receive only the projected $20-30 million from the World Bank. In addition, the shortage of private regional companies engaged in supplying means for agricultural production (they make up 15 percent of the total while the remainder is carried out by the Ukrahrotekhservis and Ukrahrokhim concerns) significantly hinders the expansion of investment in Ukraine. The amount invested, therefore, depends on expanding the network of such private dealers. [passage omitted]
