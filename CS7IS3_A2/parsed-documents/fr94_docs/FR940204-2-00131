Applicant was liquidated on March 1, 1993, the next business day immediately following the meeting of applicant's shareholders. The final distribution to shareholders was based on the net asset per share on the date of liquidation. All expenses associated with the liquidation were assumed by applicant's adviser. 5. At the time of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor will it partake in, activities other than those associated with the winding up of its affairs. 6.
