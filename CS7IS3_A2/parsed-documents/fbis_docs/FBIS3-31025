The Serbian police raided the building of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] Presidency. There are reports of other raids in Gjakove, Klin, Peje, Podujeve, Vushtrri, and Ferizaj. Let us listen to a telephone report by our correspondent Mehmet Haziri: [Haziri] In a press communique, the Kosova Information Center reports that large police forces have been surrounding the building of the LDK Presidency in Prishtina since 1200 [1100 GMT] today. Meanwhile, groups of policemen raided its others offices and halls. An LDK administration employee, who was in the building with three other people, said that the Serbian police gave no explanations at all about this intervention. The raid lasted over an hour and, as we were informed, the police confiscated many belongings and various reports of this party, the biggest party of Albanians in the former Yugoslav territory. During the last 10 days, police interventions in cultural manifestations and in the seats of political parties have been more frequent. The LDK, as the biggest real and organized force, is the target of the Serbian attacks. Several days ago, the Kosova branch of the so-called Party of Serbian Unity, led by ultranationalist Velko Rasnjatovic Arkan, publicly requested the imprisonment of president of the republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova. This fact clearly testifies to Serbia's stance against the international demand to cool the nationalist fanatics, whose craziness is applied by the police in the field with raids, maltreatments, and arrests of Albanians.
