Top-ranking members of the Excutive, Legislative, and Judicial Branches have decided that a pact of silence is the best solution. Despite this, jurists and legislators believe that the president's behavior during the Carnival parade at dawn on 13 February at the Sambodromo [Carnival parade ground in Rio de Janeiro] could be tried under the Impeachment Law (Law 1079) if there is political willingness to do so. A clear example of this cautiousness is how Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul], the rapporteur of the constitutional revision, reacted. On 14 February, when the newspapers published the pictures of Itamar Franco and the model, Jobim avoided commenting: "I have nothing to say about Carnival, I have to mind the constitutional revision." In private meetings, Jobim, Deputy Sigmaringa Seixas (PSDB-DF) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Federal District] and Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal Party-Para] said that this is no time to apply the law to the letter. The group is supported by the STF [Federal Supreme Court] members, and cabinet members such as Industry and Commerce Minister Elcio Alvares. Jobim, Sigmarigna, Passarinho and Alvares are certain that if a destabilizing atmosphere is created, Franco will be unable to avoid impeachment for having violated Clause 7 of Article 9 of the law. This clause establishes that "behavior in a manner incompatible with the dignity, distinction, and decency of the post" constitutes a crime against probity in administration." Passarinho declined to comment on the issue by stating: "I will not comment on this, not because I am restricted from doing so but because my comments would be harmful to the country." Minister Elcio Alvares, who played an active role in the CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee], which impeached former President Fernando Collor, has also declined to pass any legal judgment on the issue. He said: "During the CPI, I was a senator of the nation, but today I am a member of President Franco's cabinet." Although he admits that the incident, which he personally witnessed at the Sambodromo, was not "irrelevant", he warned: "We need to minimize the incident in order to have some tranquility at the economic level. There is a good saying for all this: `Blame it on Carnival.'" Asked whether the institution of the presidency of the Republic, may just get carried away by the rhythms of Carnival, Alvares said: "Please spare me, because I do not want to be disloyal to President Franco." In a note to the press, the Brazilian Shoes Exporters Association [Associacao Brasileira dos Exportadores de Calcados] (Abaex) has demanded President Itamar Franco tender his resignation within 48 hours, "for lack of decorum." Otherwise "for the sake of the dignity of the fatherland", Abaex will submit an impeachment request to the STF. According to Abaex, Itamar Franco's gesture "debases the nation by ridiculing it before international public opinion."
