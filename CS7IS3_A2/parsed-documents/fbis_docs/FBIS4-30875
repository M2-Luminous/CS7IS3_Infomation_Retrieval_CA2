[PESTI HIRLAP] The SZDSZ finished in second place in both free elections so far. In the last issue of MAGYAR NARANCS [HUNGARIAN ORANGE], socialist political scientist Mihaly Bihari drew the conclusion that no liberal party can win in Hungary. Is there any truth in this? [Peto] I could refute this if the SZDSZ won the elections, but I think this was not the first mistake of Mihaly Bihari. It is not fortunate to come up with such an eternal judgment that a party always finishes second, because it generally does not happen so. [PESTI HIRLAP] Some people assume that the SZDSZ is hesitating to form a coalition because this way an MSZP-Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] government alliance could emerge and these two parties will soon lose value and then the SZDSZ will remain the only marketable political force. [Peto] I have not yet heard about this assumption. On such a basis, one could also consider the possibility of an MSZP- Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] coalition. [PESTI HIRLAP] on the eve of the elections, [trade union chief] Sandor Nagy said that his party thinks in terms of a coalition anyway. If the SZDSZ is not willing to form such a coalition, they will form an alliance with another party. [Peto] Apart from the SZDSZ and the MSZP, there are still four other parliamentary parties. They can also think of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], and the FKGP. I do not want to deal with every possibility separately. [PESTI HIRLAP] In view of the election results, the first half of the runners ends with the MDF. The other three parties are lagging far behind the front runners. [Peto] The MSZP does not need to form an alliance with a big party; they can form a coalition with any small party if any of these parties is willing. [PESTI HIRLAP] The head of the MSZP list already declared that they are thinking in terms of a coalition anyway. However, there is not yet a relevant answer from the head of the SZDSZ list. [Peto] I said to this that if a party does not have a parliamentary majority, we consider it to be necessary; if it has a parliamentary majority, we consider it to be possible. I have nothing to say in addition to this. There is not yet any coalition offer whatsoever at the moment; only the intention for a coalition has been declared so far. No one called upon us with a coalition offer. We cannot initiate anything with our 17-18 percent. [PESTI HIRLAP] Peter Hack said in one of the dailies that he would not take the SZDSZ into a coalition in this political situation. [Peto] He was correct in declaring this. [PESTI HIRLAP] Does that mean that Ivan Peto also thinks so? [Peto] As the SZDSZ chairman, I think that I should not treat the public with my own private opinions. Of course, I have my own private opinion, but the party should form its opinion. I said that in the case of an absolute majority, the chances of a coalition are much smaller -- at least on our part -- than in case there were not such an absolute majority. [PESTI HIRLAP] However, you did not exclude the possibility of a government coalition with the MSZP. [Peto] Nor did Peter Hack. He said that, on his part, he would not support such a proposal.
