Blinov, Candidate of Economic Sciences, Russian Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures: "Support for Entrepreneurship: Helping Those Who Help Themselves"] [Text] For the Russian economy, which is traveling the difficult path of reform, the task of development and support of entrepreneurship, mainly small-scale forms of it in the production sphere, is one of the state's main tasks. Another year has passed--it is time to sum up the results. What have we managed to accomplish here? The editorial staff asked specialists of the GKAP [State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures] of Russia to answer this question. Readers of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN know, of course, that, in keeping with the law "On Competition and Restriction of Monopolistic Activity in Commodity Markets," the Fund for Support of Entrepreneurship and Development of Competition was finally created under the GKAP of Russia. With the irony of fate, the decree of the Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation on its formation came out on 1 April 1993. Now the fund's activity is in the stage of establishment. Among the problems being solved, it is necessary to single out the approval by its supervisory council of the "Temporary Statute on the Procedure for Disbursement of the Monies of the Fund." It has been established that of the projects and programs already submitted to the Fund (for a total of 400 billion rubles [R]) the ones to be submitted for financing in 1993 will be those that meet the following conditions: the fund's credit rate is from 100 to 200 percent; no more than 50 percent of the overall cost of the project is to be financed through the fund; credit is to be repaid within a period of up to 1.5 years; credit funds may not be used to repay debts of enterprises. The rest of the projects are to be included in the budget proposal for 1994. It should be stated that more than 50 regional funds for support of entrepreneurship have been created on the territory of the Russian Federation. Territorial administrations of the GKAP of Russia are included on supervisory councils of the majority of these funds and are the initiators of their creation. The money in the funds ranges from R4 million (in the Penza fund for support of entrepreneurship) to R1 billion (the Nizhniy Novgorod fund for support of entrepreneurship and development of competition). Regional funds in local commodity markets have already rendered significant assistance to small business enterprises, including in the creation of facilities of the infrastructure for the development of entrepreneurship. Thus, Yaroslav Oblast created a Social-Entrepreneurial Center with the participation of the territorial administration of the GKAP of Russia. Its purpose is to render a wide range of services for the development of the region's small business. And one of the center's features is the fact that it operates in direct contact with the Committee on Employment and is called upon to partially solve problems of social rehabilitation of the unemployed in the oblast (including rendering assistance in the organization of their own business). Within the framework of the center, it is intended to create a network of store-incubators, in which it will be possible to carry out several tasks at the same time: on-the-job training of students, training of entrepreneurs in commercial activity, and selling of products of local small enterprises. Another of the innovations of this center is the creation of an incubator--a farmer-run farm based on the rural lyceum for orphan children in Gavrilov-Yamskiy Rayon. It is also intended to open a branch of the center based on enterprises undergoing conversion in Rybinsk. A priority here is the creation of additional jobs in the sphere of production of consumer goods and services, introducing new technologies in the production sites released as a result of conversion. On the basis of "Youth Housing Cooperatives" in Tula Oblast, also with the participation of the local antimonopoly administration, a business incubator has been created in which entrepreneurs receive all the necessary information about how to start their own business and where they can receive help in filling out all the necessary founding documents and a business plan. In Pskov Oblast a training-entrepreneurial center with a business incubator and a technological park has been created on the basis of the Pskov training center. In 1993 about 2,000 specialists in more than 50 occupations were trained here, including about 150 entrepreneur-managers of small enterprises and bookkeepers. Enlisting Dutch specialists, they trained a group of female entrepreneurs. This center is now selecting two groups of students (on a competitive basis) for subsequent employment in entrepreneurial structures. Classes will be conducted by teachers from Holland and Sweden. It is assumed that the Pskov business incubator will render assistance to entrepreneurs in construction, personnel selection, information on consumers of products produced by the small-business enterprises, and other questions. The Far Eastern International Center for Policy in the Area of Small Business was created with the participation of Japanese business circles. A similar center is to be created in the northwestern region. Negotiations are already being conducted with representatives of state and financial structures of Norway, Sweden, and Finland, and administrations of the northwestern oblasts for the creation of an international business park. Interesting work in this area is being done in Moscow on the basis of MGU [Moscow State University]. The construction of an innovative incubator is now being completed. The MGU Science Park is oriented toward support of small science-intensive enterprises and firms working in the area of ecology, biotechnology, laser and optical technologies, and information technologies. As of today, the selective competition has been completed, as a result of which 30 scientific and technical projects and science-intensive firms have become active members of the MGU science park. It is planned to create a large support infrastructure in it, particularly a telecommunications center based on two satellite communications stations that will interact with international communications systems. A "Tekhnopark" has been created, with the main goal of providing for effective development of the large Siberian region in Tomsk Oblast. It is a regional interdepartmental center for new technologies, commerce, and international relations. These are only a few of the examples of organization of support and development of small entrepreneurship in the regions with the participation of the Antimonopoly Committee and its local administrations. Unfortunately, the significance of this work is not yet being matched by the necessary volumes of financing. In this connection, one of the areas of the activity of the GKAP of Russia is the organization of interregional interaction in the sphere of support for entrepreneurship in large economic regions, which makes it possible to utilize objects of the infrastructure and limited financial means more effectively. In our opinion, it is most effective to render priority aid to those regions where the local authorities are already pursuing an active policy for support of entrepreneurship. This is not only justified from the standpoint of the effectiveness of the utilization of federal resources, but it also motivates other regions to develop this work independently.
