FR941121-2-00028 FR941121-2-00021 [Project No. 1651&hyph;013 Wyoming] Swift Creek Power Co.; Notice of Availability of Final Environmental Assessment November 15, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a new minor license for the existing Swift Creek Project, located on the Swift Creek, near the town of Afton, in Lincoln County, Wyoming, and has prepared a final environmental assessment (EA) for the project. In the final EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Copies of the final EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28610 Filed 11&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
