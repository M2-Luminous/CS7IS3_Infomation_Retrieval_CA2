Mr Omar was speaking at a Cape Town press conference where he announced the appointment of advocate and academic Arthur Chaskalson as president of the Constitutional Court. Mr Omar said Mr Justice Corbett's term of office was due to expire at the end of September, but he had accepted an invitation from President Nelson Mandela to stay on until December 31, 1996. The chief justice will chair the newly-appointed Judicial Services Commission [JSC], which will nominate six of the 10 judges of the Constitutional Court. The JSC will also make recommendations on the appointment, tenure, term of office and removal from office of all judges and will advise the national and provincial governments on all matters relating to the judiciary and the administration of justice. Other members of the JSC are: Mr Chaskalson; Natal Judge-President Mr Justice Alan Howard, representing the judges-president; Mr Omar or his nominee; Prof Etienne Mureinik of Wits [University of the Witwatersrand], representing the deans of law faculties at South African universities; Senators Isabella Direko, Ernest Mchunu, Bulelani Ngcuka and Ray Radue; Advocates David Gordon, George Bizos, Kgomotso Moroka and trade unionist John Erentzen. Mr Omar said he was unable to announce the names of two practising advocates and two practising attorneys to serve on the JSC because different nominations had been forwarded by the Association of Law Societies and the General Council of the Bar on the one hand, and the Black Lawyers Association and National Association of Democratic Lawyers on the other. However, negotiations were underway to resolve the matter so that Mr Justice Corbett could convene the first meeting of the JSC.
