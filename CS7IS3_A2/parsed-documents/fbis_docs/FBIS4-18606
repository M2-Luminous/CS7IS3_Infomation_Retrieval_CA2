At any rate, this is how Bill Clinton assesses his duties. It cannot be denied that the president's economic optimism has given a major impetus to the economy for well over a year. Sometimes, however, he also does the job of other experts and strains his abilities. The dramatic price falls on Wall Street are certainly getting under the skin of the average U.S. citizen. To prevent a further collapse of prices, which might endanger economic recovery, Clinton felt compelled to make his view of the situation known. As the President decreed, the long-term interest rates are "lower than during the preceding recession." But then he posed like a real interest rate guru: "Nevertheless, I believe that interest rates are too high. I think they will come down again." The stock exchange has "overreacted." The most important thing is "to get through it now." This will be managed "if everyone keeps calm and the markets find a way out of it themselves." For: "We basically have a very solid economy." Thus, why are the markets nervous? The President cannot understand it: "A lot of investments go to the economy, there is no inflation, and we are creating new jobs." One could examine the President's statements one by one. The markets will have to decide whether the interest rates are again too high. However, the decisive thing will be that the investors adhere to Clinton's appeal in view of such facts.
