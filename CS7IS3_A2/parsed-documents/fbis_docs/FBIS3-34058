The various attitudes to the meeting depended on where one stood. Generally the Arab media welcomed and supported the meeting, regarding it as an incomparable achievement in the development of Syrian-U.S. ties, the issues under discussions, and the Syrian- Zionist negotiations. It is clear that the Geneva meeting laid the foundations of better ties between the United States and Syria. Their interest in promoting bilateral ties was clearly demonstrated by the instructions given to the two countries' foreign ministers to handle unresolved issues between them in a detailed and open manner, as Clinton put it. Syria's regional role in a political settlement was recognized, in Clinton's own words. Clinton said: There will be no comprehensive peace in the Middle East unless he (Hafiz al-Asad) is willing to assume a leading role. The Syrians maintained that they elicited an acknowledgement, spelled out by Clinton, of certain points that had been disputed for some time. These included the following: The Americans committed themselves to a "full peace plan" based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and on the land-for-peace principle, which practically means accepting the Syrian viewpoint on the negotiations. The Syrians are seeking to draw up an agreement that would enable them to avoid normalization entailing diplomatic, trade, and cultural ties. They have bolstered their position by pointing to several examples, including the failure of a similar agreement with Egypt--the Egyptian regime failed to fulfill its normalization commitments despite numerous attempts because the Egyptian public was strongly against normalization. The Syrians also explained that their country's special situation cannot tolerate normalization. The speech that President al-Asad made in Geneva included a clear remark about this: "Hundreds of thousands have sacrificed their lives to defend the homeland and uphold its rights. There's hardly a house in Syria that did not offer a martyr who fell in the defense of the Arab nation and its rights." It was as if al-Asad was saying a river of blood exists in Syria, in addition to the Euphrates, over which one cannot easily jump. If the Syrians succeed in their effort to draw up a new formula for a solution with the Zionist entity, we will have two types of settlements in the region: one that opens the doors wide for all forms of relations and alliances and another that ends the state of war but keeps all doors closed. This latter type will allow many regional countries to adopt the Syrian concept of a political settlement. Meanwhile, the Zionists and Americans are trying to open all Arab doors to all forms of normalization. To the Zionist entity normalization is a primary condition and on its basis the "Camp David" accord, the "Gaza-Jericho" agreement, the draft agreement with the Jordanians, and the 17 May Accord [of 1983 with Lebanon, later abrogated] were concluded. The ongoing negotiations with many Arab countries presuppose acceptance of the Zionist entity's concept of a settlement. Acting according to the Syrian concept of a settlement will damage, even if relatively, the Zionist plans in the region and relations with some Arab countries and will delay some of the normalization plans for years to come. This might lay the basis for developments and events that do not serve the U.S.-Zionist hegemony plan. It also explains the U.S. and Zionist insistence on normalization. This became evident in the speech that former U.S. President Bush delivered at the Madrid conference, when he stressed that the U.S. concept of a settlement is based on diplomatic, economic, cultural, media, tourism, and development relations. The enemy's prime minister followed him in stressing this concept. This explains the relatively cool reaction in Palestine to the Geneva summit and the Israelis' demand to hear the Syrian president's unequivocal support for normalization. The word "peace" voiced by the Syrian president in Geneva is not enough. This means (despite the strong optimism about the possibility of reaching quick results from the negotiations) that it is difficult to accept the Syrian concept of a settlement despite the tottering of the "Gaza-Jericho" agreement and the dependence of the Jordanian and Lebanese signatures on the Syrian one. Yet, according to observers' expectations, these rounds of negotiations should result in a solution to the problem. Lebanon is the major absentee, despite the utterances of joy and delight expressed by officials through the media. The U.S. President, who was keen not to leave the mistaken impression of being against President al-Asad, who agreed with his concept of "peace" and "Lebanon's future," did not want to touch on many issues. He made it clear in his speech that Lebanon has no place in the U.S. Administration's thinking. Overall U.S. practices and the way it is handling the Middle East problem and the negotiations indicate that this is the case. President al-Asad's reference to Resolution 425 does not change the picture at all. This is another stigma added to the Lebanese regime's black record. This regime appears to have undertaken the task of going down with the same speed that the resistance in Lebanon is rising. The brighter the resistance and the mujahidin become and the more they light the nation's path, the more the regime gets immersed in the darkened dens of vice, as if this regime's men without hesitation yielded to the power of the Jews and their masters who are imposing their hegemony on many ruling regimes in the world. They have accepted this new master as their god to pray to and entreat. They are accompanied in this by a vociferous media that is in control of the masses and is bewitching many to the extent that one starts to believe that apostasy is going to live forever and that Islam, the resistance men, and all the honest people are on their way out. We would like here to recall the firm and decisive divine pledge that was mentioned in the Holy Koran and the Prophet's traditions, which emphasizes that the battle between Muslims and Jews is continuing, that there is no peace and no conciliation [la salam wa la sulh] with them, that the charters and treaties will not live, and that the mujahidin will enter (the temple, as they entered it before, and to visit with destruction all that fell into their power) [Koranic verse].
