Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), told reporters the cabinet "must submit itself to criticism." But Ouchi said "the minus point is not so large" as to justify talk of whether or not the prime minister should take political responsibility," a term used to imply resignation. Management and Coordination Agency Director General Koshiro Ishida, who heads Komeito, said discussions were insufficient before deciding the tax plan. Ishida indicated he does not support a proposal to use the 7 percent "National Welfare Tax" solely for welfare, saying that it is difficult to limit its use because revenues from the proposed tax are large. He said welfare concerns every aspect of national life from medical treatment to pensions and housing. Science and Technology Agency Director General Satsuki Eda told a news conference that now is the time to tackle the problem of how to boost the national economy but cautioned against seeking a solution on tax reform in a hasty manner. Eda, leader of a minor political party, the United Social Democratic Party (USDP), declined to comment on reports that some party members have called for Eda's resignation as a cabinet member. Eda said, "the prime minister's proposal is crudely put as a decision but is worth considering." Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said he will take the blame for a major political crisis that stemmed from Hosokawa's tax reform plan announcement. Hata said the Finance Ministry only helped the coalition work out the new tax plan. In an early Thursday morning news conference, Hosokawa announced a decision to cut 6 trillion yen in taxes. As a revenue source, the prime minister proposed scrapping the present 3 percent consumption tax and instead imposing a 7 percent "National Welfare Tax" in April 1997. Hosokawa's announcement angered the Social Democratic Party, the largest of the seven parties in the coalition, which threatened to quit the alliance, throwing the political world into turmoil. On Friday, leaders of the coalition parties announced they would renounce the tax plan to avert a possible collapse of the Hosokawa cabinet.
