FBIS4-3033 "drchi074_v_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-074 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 TAIWAN Further on Incident Further on Incident HK1704052294 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA SUNDAY MORNING POST in English 17 Apr 94 p 1, 6 HK1704052294 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA SUNDAY MORNING POST English BFN [Text] A Taiwanese Government source, quoting intelligence reports, claimed yesterday that 24 Taiwanese tourists who died in a mysterious boat fire on the mainland last month were in fact murdered by a group of renegade Chinese soldiers. The source said People's Liberation Army troops, armed with flame-throwers, robbed and burned to death the tourists and eight Chinese crew while the boat was touring Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang province on March 31. Mainland authorities discovered the murders the next day but covered them up and ordered the loot to be returned because "the impact of the incident could be far-reaching", the source claimed, quoting intelligence he described as "authoritative". The deaths have seriously strained uneasy relations between Taiwan and China, bitter rivals since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949. Relatives of the victims have accused Beijing of covering up what they alleged to be mass murder. They raised several questionable points, including why the victims did not jump ship when the fire began and were instead huddled in the small cabin below. Relatives visiting the death scene last week to recover victims' remains said the authorities restricted their movements. They said officials had also insisted the remains be cremated in China instead of being taken to Taiwan. China acknowledged the blaze might have been caused by "saboteurs". It pledged that the culprits would be severely punished after Taiwanese leaders called Chinese authorities "bandits ... trampling on human lives". In Beijing, officials from the State Council and the ministries of foreign affairs and defence could not be reached for comment on the new allegations. Taiwan will suspend all group tours to China from May I and has declared 11 scenic spots, including Qiandao Lake and Lhasa in Tibet, high-risk areas for travel. About 10,000 Taiwanese have already backed out of tours to China, with about 450 group tours already canceled at a cost of US$11.4 million (HK$88 million) to Taiwanese travel agents. Chinese officials estimate that more than one million Taiwanese travellers last year pumped at least $589 million into China's economy. The island has also suspended subsidised cultural and educational exchanges with China, and the Economics Ministry has recommended putting on hold applications for new or additional investment in China and expansion of imports from the mainland. China has urged authorities in Taiwan to "handle the matter in a rational and cool-minded manner so as to avoid a setback in relations". Meanwhile, Chinese President Jiang Zemin appealed for increased ties with Taiwan and the restoration of direct air post and maritime links, major Chinese newspapers said yesterday. "The reunification of China is a historic mission, the will of the people and irreversible," Mr Jiang was quoted by the papers as saying at the end of a five-day meeting of the State Council. Beijing has given assurances the fire was purely accidental and repeatedly said it was no reason for a deterioration of relations between the two sides. During the meeting, Premier Li Peng called for Taiwanese business to invest in China even as many were announcing the cancellation of projects in protest of the boat fire. Despite an 18-year-old modernisation drive, the PLA, which encompasses all three armed services, operates largely above the law, analysts say. Hong Kong maritime officials say many Chinese smuggling syndicates operate with the navy's tacit consent. They say PLA coastal patrols often raid ships and seize their cargos on the pretext of curbing smuggling. Military officers have been seen driving righthand-drive cars, which cannot be legally registered in China and are presumed to have been stolen in Hong Kong.
