Tao Siju said: After the second plenum of the CPC Central Discipline Inspection Commission last August, the Ministry of Public Security and the public security organs in all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities carried out the anticorruption struggle. Leading cadres at and above the section level and directors and political commissars of the county and city (district) public security bureaus first examined and rectified their own behavior and further enhanced their consciousness in preventing and resisting corruption and exercising self-discipline. Discipline was strictly enforced, and a number of lawbreaking and discipline-violating cases were seriously handled. The misconduct of some local public security organs in coastal areas -- such as getting involved in smuggling and shielding smuggling activities -- was effectively checked. Irregular charges and fees were basically stopped. Initial results were achieved in dealing with the problem of running profit-making enterprises and doing business. Such malpractices as partially enforcing the law, bending the law for the benefit of relatives or friends, and replacing prison terms with fines was brought under control. Tao Siju pointed out: In the anticorruption struggle, the public security organs should grasp the key points in light of their own characteristics and should concentrate their efforts on eliminating such malpractices as bending the law for the benefit of relatives or friends or for selfish gain, extorting confessions by torture, and seeking illegal gains by abusing powers for issuing certificates, licenses, and right of abode in cities. The anticorruption struggle should focus on eliminating such misconduct, and stern action should be taken. A number of serious lawbreaking and discipline-violating cases involving leading organs, leading cadres, and police officers should be thorough investigated and properly handled. Tao Siju stressed: The public security organs must exercise more effective leadership over the anticorruption struggle, must explicitly fix the responsibilities for leading cadres and leading organs so that they will actually exercise effective supervision over their immediate subordinates from the Ministry of Public Security on down. Leading cadres in the public security organs should have a stronger sense of management and should strictly manage the police rank and file. If any problem occurs in a public security organ, disciplinary action should not only be taken against those involved, but also against those in charge. Public security organs at all levels must continue to conduct education on the principle of serving the people wholeheartedly, on the mass line, and on the legal system for all personnel. At the same time, the relevant rules and regulations should be improved, and supervisory mechanisms should be perfected. Tao Siju finally required that the discipline inspection and supervisory departments and various functional departments of the public security organs perform their functions more effectively, coordinate their work in exercising comprehensive control, and jointly advance the anticorruption struggle in the public security organs.
