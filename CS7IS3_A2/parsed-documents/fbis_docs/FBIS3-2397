The Premier, Li Peng, shortly afterwards ordered a State Council inspection team to visit the scene of three separate incidents in Yichang county, where an immediate injection of funds was promised to resolve the problem, a Yichang city official said. But Beijing may be concerned that the provincial and local governments have orchestrated or turned a blind eye to the protests in order to draw the central government's attention to the plight of the displaced people, most of whom have received little or no compensation and remain in temporary housing. A mass propaganda rally will run for three days from Sunday in Yichang city. The Hubei Governor, Jia Zhijie, will officiate and hopes this will attract national press coverage. Lu Youmei, the president of the State Council's China Three Gorges Development Corporation in Beijing, has been persuaded to give a speech at the rally. A former vice-minister of water conservancy and of energy resources, Lu is expected to pledge Beijing's "all-round support" to solve the resettlement problem. Details of the new year resettlement flare-ups are scant, but it is understood that resistance to resettlement has been most acute among the elderly, whose job opportunities in new areas are poor and who are worried the 90 renminbi (about HK$80) per month promised to resettled pensioners may not materialise. "The protests were quite superficial, but Beijing took notice of them," one official said. Sources in Yichang said the freezing weather in January exacerbated discontent among more than 5,000 residents who had been left in flimsy temporary housing because of slow progress at new housing sites in Zigui and Xingshan counties. "In fact, not a single family has moved into new permanent housing, because of slow progress and a lack of funds," one official said. Most of the 5,000 Yichang settlers were promised they would spend the Spring Festival in new houses far superior to what they left behind. Misuse of compensation funds earmarked for residents has intensified resentment. Compensation commitments for each family range from a few thousand to as much as RMB 80,000, depending on the size and condition of the housing that will be lost, which has also stirred a great many charges of unequal treatment. Yichang's government had initially agreed only to offer subsidies of RMB 20,000 to RMB 30,000 to residents, leaving some without enough funds to build new homes. "The living conditions of these people have deteriorated very rapidly because the expected support from Beijing has not materialised," one official said. Following the protests, Beijing agreed to bolster the RMB 44m set aside by the provincial and local governments for the proper resettlement of the 5,000 people. It also promised to speed up approval of privileged policies similar to those in special economic zones to draw foreign investment into the public facilities and cheap housing sectors. "Foreign interest in resettlement projects has been minimal, but we realise this is part of the `all-round support' needed if we are to avoid future disturbances," an official said. The situation has rekindled memories of communist China's resettlement efforts of the past, which Beijing admits have left 3 million people in dire straits since 1949. About 100,000 people in Hubei province and 950,000 people in Sichuan province will be moved by the year 2000 to make way for the dam. An additional 10,000 Yichang residents should be resettled in the next few years. [passage omitted]
