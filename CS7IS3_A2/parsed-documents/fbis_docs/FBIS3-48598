This came up during additional talks between the Indonesian and Malaysian delegations in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. Indonesia had hoped that the two countries would agree on some principles to serve as a basis for the next round of talks. According to Indonesian chief delegate Izhar Ibrahim, the Indonesian Government reiterated its position on the ownership of Sipadan and Ligitan in 1992 through a memorandum and supporting documents, such as a territorial map. Malaysia has yet to respond, however. Meanwhile, Malaysian chief delegate Ahmad Kamil Jaafar said the two countries would be able to settle the matter amicably.
