Former Philippine Constabulary Lieutenant Colonel Billy Bibit, said RAM-YOU members are making rounds inside the various military camps but stressed that they were just visiting former classmates. According to Bibit, his group should not be denied access in visiting classmates and friends still in the military service. "We are visiting our friends. What do they want, that we don't visit our friends anymore; isn't it normal for us to go and visit them because we also used to be in the AFP?" Bibit asked. "If they've failed in their mission (to unify the AFP), they shouldn't point a finger at anyone. They can't use us as their "whipping boys," he added. [passage omitted] Bibit said unifying the AFP is a difficult undertaking, and it was the primary objective of the RAM (formerly called the Reform the AFP Movement) after the 1986 civilian backed military uprising which toppled President Marcos from power. "But after three or four months, the RAM backslided because of patronage system," Bibit said. Bibit disclosed that military officials have already identified the patronage system as contributing factor in the growing discontent in the military ranks, but only failed to neutralize them. "They know what they are supposed to do but nobody dares to for fear of their own security, or let us say, you are not popular if you do not have proteges," Bibit said. One of the advantages in the patronage system, according to Bibit, is having better opportunities for schooling abroad, promotion and good assignments.
