China's constitution guarantees its citizens every democratic right and it is "utterly unreasonable and totally irresponsible for the so-called human rights report ... to turn a blind eye to that fact," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a weekly press briefing. The U.S. report, published February 1, said that while China had made limited progress on human rights last year, it had still engaged in extrajudicial killings, torture and other abuses. The report aimed to "distort, criticise and attack the domestic situation in China," Wu said, adding that the United States has no right "to make irresponsible remarks" about the internal affairs of China or any other country. The publication of the U.S. report came as China and the United States are continuing negtiations on renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status, which Washington has made conditional on significant progress in human rights.
