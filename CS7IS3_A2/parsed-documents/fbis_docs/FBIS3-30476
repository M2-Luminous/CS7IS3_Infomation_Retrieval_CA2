The president said he had made this decision so that a new and stable government could be formed as soon as possible. On the other hand, the elections should be as cheap as possible, with as many people attending as possible. He also said he had to take several other aspects into consideration; for example, that the day of elections should not clash with the graduation ceremonies in secondary schools and that it should not be a working day. In his speech, the president called the cleanness of the elections important because, as he said, the second ballot was perhaps even more important than the first one in a new democracy.
