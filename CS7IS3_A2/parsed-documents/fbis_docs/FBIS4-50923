"It was a year in which the powers in the West... [ellipses as received] seemed to be suffering from a serious attack of strategic arthritis," the London-headquartered International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in "Stragetic Survey 1993-1994", its review of the major strategic developments and trends of the past year. "This affliction meant that few great risks were taken, or enduring commitments made, to address large strategic issues." The IISS, an independent body with members in over 90 countries, said the U.S. appeared to want a guarantee of its security policy and took an approach of "no risk insurance" to peacekeeping. "By the end of the year the U.S. would insist on no open-ended commitments, assurance of victory without casualties, and an exit strategy," it said. "These are awesome guarantees to ask for in today's uncertain world." "Overall... [ellipses as received] it was clear that passage from the organized, if undesirable, certainties of the Cold-War era to a perhaps sounder system will take longer than many initially thought. One major problem is the reluctance of global and regional powers to provide the necessary lead." The survey said the U.S. President Bill Clinton had been preoccupied with domestic concerns and "blowing a very uncertain foreign policy trumpet". The survey concluded that "effective strategic action requires a judicious combination of conservatism and risk: Addressing the issues that arise out of the recent turmoil will require more of the latter, and less of the former." The IISS said Russia's use of the term "near abroad" to describe other former Soviet States had "particularly dangerous implications". It said Russia did not wish to revive the Soviet Empire because it was unable to bear the responsibilities and costs. However, "It wishes to assure that these states act only with Russian interests and desires in mind. If need be, it will meddle in their business, even militarily, to ensure this outcome," the IISS said.
