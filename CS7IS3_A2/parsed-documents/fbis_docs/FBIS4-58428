No new maps were prepared because there was no time to prepare prints of the maps agreed on. A dispute emerged over the size of Jericho and whether it is a city or an area. An agreement was reached that the size of Jericho is 61.5 square km and that the 20 additional square km can be added to the Jericho area when the matter is discussed again in three months. President 'Arafat rejected this idea. He wants Jericho's size to be discussed in three months without prior specification of the area that can be added. Another dispute emerged concerning a 13-km stretch of land on Gaza's coast that has an Israeli settlement. An agreement was reached that the matter will be discussed again in three months and that the Palestinians have the right to engage in any activity in that area in the meantime. Responsible Palestinian sources say that future talks on this matter may lead to the removal of the entire settlement.
