It believes that this crime is a new link in the chain of Israel's daily acts of aggression against our people in occupied Palestine and south Lebanon. The movement's leadership stresses that the pattern of mass murders is uniquely perfected and practiced by Israel, and what happened a few days ago at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and today in Sayyidat al-Najat Church are the best proof of this. Today's abominable crime, which Israel is using along with its other daily aggressive acts against the south to show that Lebanon is unstable and insecure, will only increase the Lebanese people's determination to cling tighter to the state and its institutions and increase their unity and solidarity in the face of any aggression against Lebanon. While expressing solemn grief over the martyrs and the wounded in today's incident, the movement extends condolences to all Lebanese and emphasizes its solidarity with and participation in the mourning scheduled to be observed tomorrow by the Lebanese state. The movement prays to God Almighty to have mercy on the deceased, grant speedy recovery to the wounded, and continued peace and national unity to Lebanon.
