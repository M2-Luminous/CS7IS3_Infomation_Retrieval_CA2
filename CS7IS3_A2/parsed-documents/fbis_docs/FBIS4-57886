He spoke to the ECO news enterprise and several Latin American reporters on the Haitian situation. [Begin recording] [Guevara] I would like your opinion on the international community's stance regarding Haiti. [Jonassaint] The international community acts this way because it has been misinformed on what has taken place in Haiti. I believe the international community now has precise information and that it will change its opinion in the not-too-distant future. I occupy this post in response to an article in my country's Constitution, which provides that, in the case of a vacancy, the president of the Appeals Court shall become president. [Guevara] What is your opinion on a possible multilateral or unilateral military invasion? [Jonassaint] Haiti cannot fight the international community; Haiti does not have the atomic bomb. It is impossible. Haiti could be reduced to ashes in a matter of minutes, but we know that your country, Mexico, has always rejected any sort of military intervention against other states. Mexico has always opposed such intervention in other sovereign states. [Guevara] What about the possibility? [Jonassaint] I do not know. They can do whatever they like, but I doubt it. Haiti has its protectors. [words indistinct] extremely difficult. [Guevara] What will happen in the next few days? [Jonassaint] Only God knows; I am not a fortune teller. [end recording] Emile Jonassaint, who was born in 1913 and is 81 years old, is perhaps a faithful representative of that 18th century black elite -- the old Haitian oligarchy -- where the mixture of ancestral popular rites and their very own interpretation of constitutionality are clear examples of the enormous contradictions that seem more noticeable in this Caribbean country.
