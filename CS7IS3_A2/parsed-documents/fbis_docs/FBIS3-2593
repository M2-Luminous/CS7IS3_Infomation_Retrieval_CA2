Many members launched fierce verbal attacks on the agriculture and education issues and on fighting corruption and promoting clean government. Getting worked up, one member blurted out: "What the CPC is saying is idle talk." CPPCC members have more complaints about the issue of fighting corruption and promoting clean government. A member said: In his report to the preparatory meeting of the CPPCC on anticorruption work launched last August, Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, said that the central authorities had investigated and dealt with eight major cases. This fully shows the determination of the central authorities to fight corruption. However, this member suggested that the central authorities should persist in fighting and stamping out corruption. Especially as the current methods of offering and taking bribes are being renewed all the time and when there is neither a third party present nor a receipt written in the course of handing over and taking bribe money, it is difficult to investigate and deal with such cases. Moreover, since corruption is widespread in economic departments, it is even more necessary to sternly stamp out corruption there.
