Nedzad Leko reports. [Begin recording] [Leko] Prime Minister Silajdzic said the following in talks with the UNHCR delegation: [Silajdzic] We mostly discussed repatriation -- that is, the return of refugees. The government considers this to be a priority and very difficult task, particularly in view of the fact that we do not have defined borders because of the situation with the aggressor. The borders of the (?Serbian) cantons have not been defined because it is now impossible to define them. [sentence as heard] We [words indistinct] on territories that are under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina legitimate authorities and the areas now controlled by the Croatian Defense Council [HVO]. We can attempt to do something in these areas, beginning with the easier cases, meaning those cases where people can return home -- that is, they have a place to return to, but because of transportation or [words indistinct] or owing to problems with possible conflicts they actually cannot go home. Therefore, we need to facilitate their return home to the extent that this is possible. However, we need to have a general plan because all these issues are mutually very intertwined, this is an entire network of problems. If we do not come up with such a plan, we will be unable to carry out this task. I repeat that this is a priority task, a very complicated and difficult job. [Leko] After the talks, (Nicholas Morris), Sadako Ogata's special envoy, made the following statement for correspondents. [(Morris), in English with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian] The best solution to any problem of refugees and displaced persons is voluntary repatriation, which means making it possible for them to return to their homes in a safe and dignified way. The UNHCR wishes to work closely with the Bosnian Government in order to help carry this out. We value that we were able to discuss this today with the prime minister. As you know, several problems exist, but I believe they can be solved so everyone who wishes to do so is given the chance of returning [home] as soon as possible. The UNHCR will offer its help to the Bosnian Government in returning people to their homes. [Leko] In response to a question pertaining to the humanitarian situation in Gorazde, (Morris) said: [(Morris)] At the moment, our convoys have no access to Gorazde. The last convoy entered Gorazde on 22 March. In the past three days we have distributed the last food reserves that we had [words indistinct]. This food might last another four to five days. We have the possibility of again delivering food from the air. This is unsatisfactory, but it is the only possible solution. However, owing to the configuration of the terrain around Gorazde, the conflicts would have to stop. The organization of medical evacuation of victims of the latest fighting in Gorazde is an additional problem. At the same time, the delivery of medicine to Gorazde is another problem. [Leko] Reporters wanted to know when the air bridge and humanitarian aid convoys would be restored. [(Morris)] As far as the air bridge in concerned, we do not know the answer to that, but we suppose that if no great problems arise today, we hope that the air bridge will be reintroduced. As far as the suspension of convoys that pass through the territory under the control of the Bosnian Serbs, we hope that they will be restored tomorrow or the day after. Access to Gorazde is out of our hands. That will have to be decided by a political solution of the problem. [end recording]
