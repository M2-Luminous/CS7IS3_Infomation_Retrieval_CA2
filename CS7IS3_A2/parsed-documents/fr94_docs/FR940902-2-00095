FR940902-2-00095 FR940902-2-00046 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,000] Nike, Inc., Beaverton, OR; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration By an application dated August 5, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on July 15, 1994 and published in the Federal Register on July 28, 1994 (59 FR 38494). Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: (1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous; (2) if it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously considered; or (3) if in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration of the decision. The findings show that the headquarters for Nike, Inc., is in Beaverton, Oregon. The Beaverton workers are engaged in marketing services, administrative functions, retail servicing and research and development. The investigation findings show that Nike does not produce products directly but contracts with non-affiliated firms for the production of athletic and casual footwear, apparel and sports accessories. The Department's denial was based on the fact that the Beaverton workers do not produce an article within the meaning of Section 223 of the Trade Act. The Department has consistently determined that the performance of services does not constitute the production of an article as required by Section 222 of the Trade Act, and this determination has been upheld in the U.S. Court of Appeals. Only in very limited instances are marketing and other support workers certified for trade adjustment assistance (TAA), namely the worker separations must be caused by a reduced demand for their services from a parent or controlling firm or subdivision whose workers produce an article and who are currently under a certification for TAA. These conditions were not met for the workers at Nike, Inc., in Beaverton, Oregon. Conclusion After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly, the application is denied. Signed at Washington, DC, this 22nd day of August 1994. James D. Van Erden, Administrator, Office of Work-Based Learning.
