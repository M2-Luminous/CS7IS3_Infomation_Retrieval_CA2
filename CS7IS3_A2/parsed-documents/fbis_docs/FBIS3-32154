He said very little and was hardly ever seen in public. On the day the plan was announced in Brasilia, he sat discreetly in a side chair at the large table that had been set up on the platform in the press conference room at the Ministry of Finance. The first journalist in line at the microphone opened the question period. What Arida had tried to conceal was then revealed. The other members of the economic team and the officials seated at the table looked in his direction for the response. Rather awkwardly, he began to answer and became the central figure during practically the entire press conference. At age 41, Persio Arida is, for the second time in his life, a key player on an economic team that is involved in a stabilization plan. The first time was during the Cruzado Plan. Still professorial, he displays more enthusiasm when he talks about the theoretical concept of the plan than about its practical application. He thinks it is too early to unveil mysteries such as, for example, whether the exchange rate between the new currency and the dollar will be a fixed rate. But he left no doubt on one point: the plan will cause losses, mainly for those who have something to gain from inflation. There is only one trick to guaranteeing this kind of plan: "political coalition." He also explains why he is staying in Rio, as president of the BNDES, rather than going to Brasilia. "Privatization is an integral part of any stabilization process." [O GLOBO] The inflation rate is rising, the money supply is expanding, the Central Bank is having trouble selling bonds, and everyone thinks the minister will step down in April. Is this a good time for an economic plan? [Persio Arida] Indeed the inflation rate has risen, but this must be attributed to a farm products price shock. But government paper is not being rejected; the NTN [National Treasury Notes] auctions prove this. As for the monetary expansion, it is a mistake that we must market bonds to shrink the monetary base. Building up reserves will produce practically the same effect. [O GLOBO] So this is a good time? [Persio Arida] A good time is when the public finances are in order. Now, therefore, is not really a good time. Unless the budget and the fiscal adjustment are approved, the right moment will not be created. That is what is most important. Furthermore, a stabilization plan announced during a "supply shock" will run into trouble. The third feature of a good time is the existence of a consensus in the minds of the public and the government about the imperatives of the stabilization. Stabilization does not come about because of an act by the finance minster. Any stabilization involves a net gain for society, but it always involves losses. [O GLOBO] How does the apprehension about Minister Fernando Henrique's candidacy affect that coalition? [Persio Arida] I would rather comment in greater depth on the political coalition. Stabilization involves far-reaching changes in the way the economy functions. It is not something that is applied topically. A technically well-designed program that does not have the backing of the public has a good chance of failure. That is why the question of the right moment, aside from the fiscal requisite, depends essentially on magic--in the sense that it charms, enchants, and so wins the support of society. [O GLOBO] You mentioned losses. Are they digestible? [Persio Arida] Every program has its costs. Since the identified losers have a stronger lobby than the scattered winners, the political balance is unquestionably difficult to maintain. [O GLOBO] The initial version of the plan called for a slow, voluntary transition to the new currency. But no economist believes it is possible to eliminate a 40 percent [monthly] inflation rate this way. [Persio Arida] The fact that contracting in URV's [Real Value Unit] is voluntary does not mean a drop in the inflation rate will not cause losses. We have had high inflation rates for more than two decades. We must assume that this inflation has deep roots. I would be the last to say that everyone will win. [O GLOBO] And do you think this country is mature enough to understand this clearly? [Persio Arida] My assessment is that our society is maturing.... [O GLOBO] Maturing? [Persio Arida] It is a process, it really is. Most of our problems were inherited from the decade of the 70's, the era of big nationalizations and regimentation of the economy. The State was the driving force of the Brazilian capitalist system; it had a fantastic power to choose the losers and the winners. That led to a series of imbalances. [O GLOBO] When you ask a businessman if he believes the plan will turn out well, he answers that he is rooting for it. The fans are as irrational as those at a soccer game, but the public is not convinced that the plan can turn out well. What are the actual chances that the plan will work? [Persio Arida] There are lots of fans, but plenty of caution. Some of the doubts result from the fact that stabilization in Brazil is truly difficult to achieve. We have said, simplistically, that Brazil has one currency for the rich and another one for the poor. But it reflects what is happening. An appreciable portion of our population has no bank accounts and, if they do, they cannot invest. That part of the population is the big beneficiary of a decline in the inflation rate. For those who are indexed, a 40 percent inflation rate is not so serious. "Serious" is what it is for the great majority of Brazilians. But it is interesting to note that all attempts at stabilization in Brazil have had popular support. [O GLOBO] The popularity ratings of a finance minister usually go up in the same proportion as inflation declines. Imagine what would happen to a minister who is already popular when the inflation rate is at 40 percent.... [Persio Arida] Stabilization is a difficult process. It demands an ability to resist very strong pressures--pressure not only from the general public, but from the lobbies. Some lobbies are rooting for the plan, provided the adjustments are made by others, not by them. The budget issue is an example of this. Everyone wants to cut someone else's spending. Stabilization demands a determined government. [O GLOBO] Does the government have any appetite for going against special interests? [Persio Arida] That is one of its biggest tests: being able to cut, and to defend the cuts in Congress. [O GLOBO] The Congress does not want to bear the burden of the chaos that would follow the rejection of the budget, but it will certainly try to debate certain points. What points are non-negotiable? [Persio Arida] We are talking about balancing the budget. Therefore, there is a quantitative restriction. We cannot depart from our zero goal. We have to be careful, because it is not only the zero goal that is important; the quality of the result matters, too. The budget has always involved estimates. If we overestimate the expected revenue, we will have a budget that will look balanced, but may not be so in the long run. In other words, depending on how it is done, one zero is not the same as another zero. Negotiation is part of any democratic process. [O GLOBO] In a recent interview, you said that the more time spent in the process of adopting the new index mechanism, the better. However, Minister Fernando Henrique has said just the opposite. [Persio Arida] With inflation at 40 percent, of course the faster the process moves, the better. That is what I want to see, too. The more rapidly the parts come together, the better. [O GLOBO] But if it goes too quickly, might it not produce a hyperinflation in terms of the real cruzeiro? [Persio Arida] We would like to see this recontracting in URV's translate into a real and permanent equilibrium. If we set deadlines, that will lead to ill-conceived transactions. Reducing the average period of indexation makes the index more volatile, both upward and downward. That is why it is a step that can only be taken when conditions are favorable. If we start from the hypothesis that the fiscal adjustment will be delayed and will not be approved, the tendency will be to stretch out the indexation. [O GLOBO] Do you believe we are vulnerable to a risk of hyperinflation? [Persio Arida] The classic definition of hyperinflation is an inflation rate above 50 percent. That definition comes from Philip Cagan, and is based on the inflationary processes that preceded World War II, when the financial system was not as technologically sophisticated as it is today. Those were processes that entered into spontaneous combustion. Once the process got started, people took their money out of the banks and tried to buy more things. The more they bought, the higher prices rose and the worse things got for those who had not yet bought. Our experience at the end of the Sarney administration was different from classic hyperinflation. The economy was still functioning, more or less. [O GLOBO] Even so, isn't the approval of the fiscal adjustment a race against time? [Persio Arida] No question. The sooner it passes, the better. [O GLOBO] If it is passed, will this country get the URV the following month? [Persio Arida] The URV is a complex mechanism--the details are still being discussed within the administration. The basic concept was developed within a principle of flexibility. The stabilization process is like a game of chess. In that sense, no matter how well a good player can anticipate some of the moves, there is always the imponderable. That is why it is important that the mechanism be flexible enough to open up a range of possibilities. [O GLOBO] Let us anticipate just one move: will the exchange rate between the new currency and the dollar be a fixed rate? [Persio Arida] That question of the exchange rate has been framed as the biggest doubt about what will happen in the third phase. [O GLOBO] In the Cavallo phase of the Brazilian plan? [Persio Arida] You said that; I didn't. Any discussion of the third phase would be premature at present. I am not trying to evade the question, but there is something wrong with the Brazilian monetary system today. There needs to be an institutional change in this area. In Argentina, they established a fixed rule, an automatic rule. In Brazil, changes often require changes in laws. [O GLOBO] How will it be possible to privatize 34 companies this year, as planned, if only one has been privatized in the four months since you took office? [Persio Arida] The privatization process has a long gestation period. We will not be starting from zero in all 34 companies; many have already been appraised. Of course there are problems. It is easier to sell off a steel mill than an electric power company, which involves a public utility concession. [O GLOBO] Even if it is technically possible, is there the political will to privatize 34 companies in the final year of an administration? [Persio Arida] Privatization is an integral part of any stabilization process. It is a contradiction in terms to pursue a stabilization program without making progress in privatization. The state still has a regulatory and indicative role. The electric utility sector in the United States is completely private, but it is also completely regulated. Having state ownership is extremely costly. Look at the question from the standpoint of the public debt. On the one hand, the Treasury has properties; on the other, it has very high debt service costs. It reminds one of a man who owns a huge tract of land and is paying astronomical carrying charges, but will not sell a single piece of his property. [O GLOBO] It would be wonderful if the administration, as a whole, believed that, wouldn't it? [Persio Arida] That is a process of maturation. It goes slowly. Our culture had always been a culture of the paternalistic state. [O GLOBO] Talking about the paternalistic state, what is the new role of the BNDES? [Persio Arida] I am convinced that if the state resumes its growth at an accelerated pace, the bottlenecks in the infrastructure will show up very dramatically. These are projects that mature over a long time and are complicated to put together. They are projects for which the backing of a development bank is very important. The problem is that all these projects are under the control of the State. Given the State's financial crisis, guaranteeing a return on those investments is a very different task, depending on whether they are undertaken by the public sector or by the private sector. The process is intimately tied to the privatization of those same services; otherwise, the money gets lost in the web of reciprocal debits of the public sector. [O GLOBO] But the BNDES has lost so much by lending to the private sector.... [Persio Arida] We are working very, very hard to recover the sums owed us. If you look at the renegotiated credits, you will find the bulk of them are in the public sector. The BNDES does not make subsidized loans to anyone. Those days are over. Subsidies and forgiveness of debts no longer exist here. [O GLOBO] Do you think BNDES employees are too highly paid? [Persio Arida] Concepts of equity have been distorted in public administration. There are all kinds of inequalities: between branches of government, within the Executive Branch, and within the state enterprises. Salaries in the state enterprises are not too high in comparison with those in private enterprise, but they are ridiculously higher than those in the direct government administration. The entire direct administration earns very little. We need fewer civil servants, and higher salaries. Public officials should be well paid.
