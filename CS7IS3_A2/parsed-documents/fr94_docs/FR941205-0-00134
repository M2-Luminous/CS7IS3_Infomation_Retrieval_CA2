FR941205-0-00134 FR941205-0-00027 EPA cautions users to carefully evaluate the performance of a method when using it for samples other than compliance monitoring samples or for contaminants not regulated under the SDWA. For example, EDB and DBCP appear in the scope of EPA Methods 504.1, 502.2, 524.2 and 551. However, Methods 502.2 and 524.2 are not approved for compliance analyses, because they do not have the sensitivity to measure compliance with the EDB and DBCP MCLs. Methods Approval Process_Several commenters believe that the process of proposing and approving methods or method modifications will always be too slow to accommodate the technical and certification needs of the laboratory community. To solve this problem, commenters asked EPA to specify performance criteria in drinking water rules, or in the approved methods. The purpose of this would be to allow laboratories to use any analytical method, provided it met the mandatory criteria. EPA agrees that the present methods approval system is slow. To solve this problem, EPA and other organizations are seeking to consolidate methods across regulatory programs and media, and to write generic method performance criteria (EPA, 1994g). A performance-based method system, as suggested by commenters, might be part of the final solution. There are two groups working on this problem. The groups are the Intergovernmental Task Force on Monitoring, and EPA's Environmental Monitoring Management Council. A recommendation of these groups may be for EPA to propose a new method approval and method-writing protocol. The protocol would be designed to expedite approval of drinking water method modifications while maintaining the degree of control needed to ensure effective enforcement of drinking water regulations. Field and Test Kits_Two commenters noted an omission in the rule text in the 1993 proposal that appears to eliminate an important option. This option allows States to approve use of DPD colorimetric test kits for measurement of chlorine residuals. EPA did not intend to eliminate this option, and agrees the wording in the 1993 proposal (58 FR 65631) may be misleading. Today's rule clearly allows use of the DPD kits, provided the State also approves use of the kits. This option is specified at 40 CFR 141.74(a)(2). A commenter asked EPA to approve field kits for pH, and methods for continuous monitoring of pH and residual chlorine. EPA does not need to approve field methods for pH because currently, analysis with an approved pH method may be conducted in the field or in the laboratory. Regarding continuous monitoring methods, in today's rule, EPA provides criteria for continuous monitoring of chlorine residuals (40 CFR 141.74(a)(2)). Since EPA does not require continuous pH monitoring, EPA does not approve or disapprove methods for continuous measurement of pH. Turbidity_A commenter asked that turbidity measurements, which are specified in the drinking water regulations, be waived if no particulate or cloudiness is visible to the analyst. The present requirement is that turbidity be measured in all samples, and that digestion be performed if the turbidity is one NTU or greater. EPA cannot waive turbidity measurements on samples that appear to be clear, because samples with turbidity of up to three NTU can appear clear to the unaided eye. Corrosivity_One commenter noted the proposed rule made no reference to updating the methods for corrosivity in 40 CFR 141.42(c). These methods were published in 1980 and 1982 (45 FR 57346, August 27, 1980 and 47 FR 10999, March 12, 1982). In the Lead and Copper Rule (56 FR 26460, June 7, 1991), EPA agreed that corrosion control strategies could be developed or evaluated by measuring alkalinity and other parameters (56 FR 26489 and 26496). However, the Lead and Copper Rule did not update or specify use of the methods in 40 CFR 141.42(c). Instead, more current methods were specified in 40 CFR 141.89(a) (56 FR 26509&hyph;26510). In today's rule, EPA eliminates possible confusion between the requirements in 40 CFR 141.89 and 141.42 by removing subparagraphs 40 CFR 141.42(a)&hyph;(c).
