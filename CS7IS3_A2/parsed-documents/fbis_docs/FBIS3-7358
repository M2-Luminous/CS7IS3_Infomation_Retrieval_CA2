Korea"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, March 27 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today comments on the ever more intensified interference in and suppression of the press by the "Security Planning Board" (SPB) [Agency for National Security and Planning -- "NSP"] in South Korea. The "SPB" not only strictly bans the press from reporting about the mounting struggle on South Korean people against the flunkeyist treacheries of the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique and its confrontational row against the North, their anti-American and anti-fascist struggle for democracy and their anti-war and anti-nuke struggle but also manipulates the subsidized media to mislead public opinion over the "nuclear issue of the North", the news analyst of the paper says, and continues: The tightened control on the press by the Kim Yong-sam group through the "SPB" is unthinkable apart from the crisis of the "civilian government". What the puppets pursue in suppressing the press is to bar it from digging up and opening to the public their anti-national crimes and curb the anti-"government" action of the people. It is a symptom of the end of the "civilian government" to try to maintain the treacherous rule by blindfolding the people and stuffing their ears and mouths through the suppression of the press. The further the puppets intensify their anti-DPRK smear campaign and suppression of the people and the press through the "Security Planning Board", the fiercer the struggle of the people grows against the "civilian" dictatorship.
