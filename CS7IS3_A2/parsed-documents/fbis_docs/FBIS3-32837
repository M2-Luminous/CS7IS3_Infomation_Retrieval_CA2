But that cannot be considered an infallible forecast. In truth, it will all depend on who succeeds Fujimori in the government. Obviously, if a leader from the so-called "maximalist" opposition takes office in 1995, he will immediately endeavor to revoke the new Magna Carta, going back to the one of 1979. No chief of state, either "aprista" [of the APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]], or "acciopupulista" [of the AP [Popular Action Party]], or of the classic Marxist left, or of Mario Vargas Llosa's movement, will coexist with the 1993 Constitution. That is sure. Things change, however, if the winner of the elections to be held 15 months from now comes from one of the less radical organizations. What is more, if he is a "pepecista" [PPC [Popular Christian Party]] who is not enrolled in the ranks of self-exiled Alberto Borea, he will most probably accept the text of the Constitution approved by the referendum of 31 October last, even though he will try to introduce some amendments. The same goes for possible independent candidates like Carlos Bolona or Ricardo Belmont, any member of Renovation and, of course, Fujimori's possible dauphins in the event the president decides not to seek reelection. Moreover, Javier Perez de Cuellar has accepted the validity of the Constitution promulgated yesterday, although with reservations on unicameralism and the death penalty--which we share--and on immediate reelection. In his case, of course, everything will depend on the terms of whatever agreement he may have reached with the conglomerate that catapults him into the presidency, in the hypothetical case that this were to happen.... So, the chances that the 1993 Constitution will outlast Fujimori's tenure are greater than that they will not. Those whose opposition to its survival is inflexible are the country's political minority. The rest accept its validity, in varying degrees, with reservations ranging from total intangibility of its text to the inclusion of substantial amendments in it. The hypothesis that the new Fundamental Law will meet the same fate as Leguia's last Constitution, which was thrown out the window together with him, is, in the final analysis, rather remote. Particularly, if the new Constitution demonstrates, in terms of effective performance on the road between now and July 1995, that it is better than the preceding ones. Or that public opinion thinks that it is. The measuring stick will be the performance of the government, particularly in terms of the relations among its branches, and how well the unicameral Congress works. If it passes this efficiency test, a return to the past and its 1979 Constitution will be difficult, not to say impossible.
