By the end of last year, Tarim had produced an accumulated total of 3.23 million tonnes of crude oil. At present, the daily output of crude oil in Tarim has reached 6,000 tonnes, and the annual output of crude oil of this year is expected to be 2.1 million tonnes. Since oil prospecting and exploitation began in Tarim five years ago, the reserves of nine oil and gas fields, including Lunnan, Donghetang, Gatamu, Mulake, Jiefangqudong, Tazhongsi, Momai No 7, Hongqigou, and Tiergen, have been verified. Thirty-four industrial oil- and gas-bearing structures and 17 high-yielding oil and gas wells and points have been discovered. This has fulfilled the state plan for ensuring reserves for the 5-million-tonne production capacity during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. A series of major breakthroughs with strategic significance have also been made while prospecting in the region. The discovery of the Tazhong 1-billion-tonne grade oil field with Tazhong No 4 as the main body in 1992 and the important discovery of the No 6 anticline of the No 10 structure in the northern slope zone of the Tazhong low swell in 1993 have unfolded the broad prospects for the discovery of large oil field group in the Tazhong area. In the Tazhong area, in addition to continued discoveries in the Lunnan and Donghetang Oil Fields, the general analysis on several structures of the Luntai broken swell has led to the discovery of four oil- and gas-bearing structures in the Momai No 7, the Yaha, and the Hongqi structures. A number of high-yielding oil and gas wells have been drilled. All this fully shows the gratifying prospects for the discovery of large oil and gas fields in the Tarim Basin. Taking part in the prospecting and development of the Tarim Oil Field are over 10,000 people from the well-drilling teams in the six major oil fields in Huabei, Central Plain, Daqing, Sichuan, Shengli, and Xinjiang.
