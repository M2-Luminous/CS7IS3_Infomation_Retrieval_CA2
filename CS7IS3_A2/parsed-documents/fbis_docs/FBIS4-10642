Perhaps no one can be more precise and objective in his analysis of those rather tense 2,200 km of border where, as he says, "Anything can happen at any time." President Rafael Caldera appointed Marquez minister of state. Among the duties assigned to him was handling Venezuelan border issues. About one week after assuming this position he said that negotiations with Colombia are one of the present possibilities. Because of this remark, untranationalist Venezuelan groups demanded the dismissal of Marquez, a representative of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) in the government. Marquez is a man who is committed to his people and to the humble. He fights for them 24 hours a day. Once he looked forward with patience for several years for the precise moment to escape from the jail where he was held prisoner by guerrillas. Today this old "subversive" says that in Colombia the guerrillas have no political objective and that they have violated their promise not to attack Venezuela. In his two-room office there are three desks and four employees. (He is the fourth employee.) The office is decorated with a vivid poster which says that Minister of State Marquez spoke with an EL TIEMPO representative and said things which were not very comforting. [Gamboa] Your appointment as minister of state, with a special assignment to border issues, is interpreted as a clear sign that President Rafael Caldera has a real interest in resolving existing problems with Colombia. Could this mean, perhaps, that the possibility of a solution is now at hand? [Marquez] Yes, undoubtedly. The desire of President Caldera, demonstrated throughout his life, is to have harmonious relations with Colombia. That has been his constant purpose. It was he who brought Venezuela into the Andean Pact. Furthermore, during the election campaign he said that the border question would have priority and he is keeping this promise. His desire and will are aimed at that objective. Among my duties are not only matters along the 2,200 km of the tense border with Colombia but all questions along the entire border, which involve Brazil, Guayana, and the Caribbean. Venezuela should no longer be so active in world affairs but rather should concentrate on its immediate surroundings. [Gamboa] Then what do you need to resolve those problems along what you call the tense border with Colombia? [Marquez] There is a series of new and very grave situations. About a week ago I visited the Tachira area and other border zones. I should emphasize my conclusion that there is a total and permanent absence of the authority of the Colombian Government in the border area. This situation causes many problems: the activities of the guerrillas, narcotics traffickers, common criminals, automobile thieves, and illegal immigrants. These are disturbing situations. They are new, but there are other, old problems which have become worse. [Gamboa] There is a tendency to believe that a "greater Colombian presence" means a greater military presence. Do you agree with this view? [Marquez] It would be a military and a government presence. The fact is that there is no Colombian Government presence in the border area, and Venezuela suffers the consequences of this serious situation. I have been saying for many months, not just now, what I said in October 1993 in Bogota, that there is no Colombian Government presence there. And the Colombian Government should understand this situation and something which is much more serious: relations between the two countries are involved. This is a reality. I predicted what could happen with Venezuela if corrective action were not taken. [Gamboa] And did this happen? [Marquez] It went beyond all of my predictions. After my visit to the border my prediction did not become a reality because the situation is much, very much more serious because of the kidnappings and murders which take place on Venezuelan territory, because of the nonpayment for guerrilla "cattle," and because of the extortion which increases every day. [Gamboa] What are the consequences of this situation which, in your view, went beyond your predictions? [Marquez] A process is taking place which is contrary to the desired objective of economic and social development in the border area. Disinvestment is taking place. Land and other kinds of property are being abandoned, and property owners are moving to other areas. And this is a harsh blow against all of the progress made in terms of integration, although this is a subject for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the committees on border affairs and on negotiations we have raised this situation with the Colombian representatives. They are aware that there are only three alternatives. We have discussed this at the negotiating table. Either there will be an armed conflict, or we will live in a state of permanent tension, or we will negotiate. There is no other alternative. Everything else is a version of these three solutions. Of course, I am an advocate of negotiations. [Gamboa] Because you said that, some people asked for your dismissal only one week after you took this position. What will they say now? [Marquez] This is a free country, and we already know the position of those groups. It annoys them that I am a supporter of negotiations. [Gamboa] Are you suggesting that those groups support another kind of solution--armed confrontation, for example? [Marquez] I am not suggesting anything. I only say that it irritates them that I am in favor of negotiations. [Gamboa] But do you not believe that by insisting so much, over the long term those groups could achieve their objectives? [Marquez] That will depend on me and on what I do. [Gamboa] And could not the greater Colombian military presence which Venezuela is calling for heat up the frontier area even more and cause armed conflict between the two countries? [Marquez] Not necessarily, because our activities could be coordinated. Meetings have been held between the military commands and the security organizations of the two countries. Agreements are urgently needed for precise coordination, because the escalation of guerrilla and criminal activity are generating honest feelings which could be exploited. The burden of what Venezuela receives from Colombia is too much. This is a highly negative burden which keeps the whole country worked up. It is bringing us to certain limits. The situation has already gone from bad to worse. There is real distress, irritation, and fear, and the Venezuelan people feel they are victims of aggression, because the country, in fact, is a victim of aggression. And as Venezuelan Minister of the Interior Ramon Escovar Salom said, the entire country has to react to an act of aggression of which it is the victim. And it is aggression in the sense that the Colombian Government is contributing to it by its acts of omission. It is aggression by all of the elements opposing us. Even one of them would be serious. Altogether, the total of all of them is very serious. [Gamboa] Perhaps Venezuela has had to look at this situation because, with proper control, illegal immigrants would not come into Venezuela, the criminals would not come, and stolen automobiles would not leave the country. [Marquez] Yes, but that is the least of it, because those are phenomena outside our control. The fact that the guerrillas have moved from the cold country to the warmer areas is not a matter for Venezuela to decide. They cannot attack Venezuela and, above all, they cannot attack people who support border development. In the view of Pompeyo Marquez the Colombian guerrillas have no political objective. [Gamboa] What do you think of the view that the guerrillas are seeking, as part of their political objective, to provoke a clash between the two countries so that they can benefit from the division between them? [Marquez] That would be criminal, because a guerrilla war or an armed clash between Colombia and Venezuela--may it never happen!--would be suicide for both countries. It would be a horror, a catastrophe, an act of madness. [Gamboa] But is this possible? [Marquez] I have the feeling that the guerrillas would like to internationalize the problem. And this is a subject to be handled by the two ministries of foreign affairs, the two governments, or the two presidents. The guerrillas know that the Latin American community will not permit, for any reason, an armed clash between Colombia and Venezuela. [Gamboa] According to your analysis, it could be thought that the delimitation of our marine and submarine boundaries could soon and for a temporary period be left in the background. Do you share this view? [Marquez] Not only moved to the background but to a less important position. Today the key problem is that of aggression in many areas. We have to resolve this matter first. A popular song says that, "Saturday comes before Sunday." For the moment it is Saturday and a serious, very serious Saturday. I was truly worried when I returned from my trip to the border. There is no peace there, and peace is wanted immediately. [Gamboa] Is it right to think that the people's patience is wearing thin to an extent which makes the situation dangerous? [Marquez] Patience no longer exists. It has been worn out. And now I take advantage of this opportunity to repeat: the Colombians who support friendship with Venezuela and the Venezuelans who support friendship with Colombia--we should be very worried. There is a generalized climate of violence in which anything can happen, and that is what we must avoid. [Gamboa] How would you summarize the situation? [Marquez] It is a somber and harsh reality. It is very harsh, very dangerous, and it could have unpredictable consequences. Anything could happen at any time.
