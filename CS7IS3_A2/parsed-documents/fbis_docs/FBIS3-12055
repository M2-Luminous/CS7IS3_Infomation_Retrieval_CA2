Breakdowns in the generating units of the Talla Piedra and Regla power plants in Havana City, the East Havana power plant in Santa Cruz del Norte, as well as the Maximo [words indistinct] fuel supply to the Diez de Octubre Power Plant in Camaguey caused the elevated deficits that affected the early morning hours of Saturday and Sunday. The Electric Union told us they will return to the regular schedule in each province once the generating level has been recovered.
