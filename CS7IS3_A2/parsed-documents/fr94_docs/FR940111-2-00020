FR940111-2-00020 FR940111-2-00010 Future Use of the Naval Oil Shale Reserves Numbers 1 and 2; Meeting AGENCY: Office of Fossil Energy, DOE. ACTION: Notice of meeting. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy plans to evaluate options for future use of Naval Oil Shale Reserves Numbers 1 and 2, including options for development of the conventional oil and natural gas resources that may be contained within these Reserves. Reserve Number 1 occupies 41,000 acres in Garfield County, Colorado, and Reserve Number 2 occupies 90,000 acres in Carbon and Uintah Counties, Utah. Approximately 40 percent of the Utah Reserve is included within the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. Two open hearings are planned to provide opportunity for public comment on possible, future uses for these properties. DATES and ADDRESSES: The meeting will be held on January 25, in Salt Lake City, Utah, the Airport Holiday Inn, 1&hyph;4 p.m.; and on January 27, in Denver, Colorado, Red Lion Inn, Quebec Ave., 1&hyph;4 p.m.. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary V. Latham, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves, 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585, Ph: (202) 586&hyph;0475, FAX: (202) 586&hyph;4446. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Naval Oil Shale Reserves Numbers 1 and 2 originally were set aside by Congress to furnish the Navy with a supply of fuel in the event of a national emergency. Naval Oil Shale Reserve No. 1 is estimated to have more than 18 billion barrels of oil in place, with approximately 2.5 billion barrels of oil recoverable from shale rated at 30 gallons or more per ton. Naval Oil Shale Reserve No. 2 is estimated to have almost 4 billion barrels of shale oil in place. No estimate of recoverable shale oil has been made. The Department of Energy has no current plans to develop the oil shale resources of either Reserve No. 1 or Reserve No. 2. The Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves' Strategic Plan recognizes that although development of shale oil has been deferred, the potential for conventional oil and gas resources within the Naval Oil Shale Reserves properties must be assessed and plans formulated to develop these resources in the near to mid-term. Based upon current and past production from oil and gas fields located in the vicinities of the Naval Oil Shale Reserves, the potential for recovery of substantial quantities of oil and natural gas from within the Reserves' boundaries is quite high. Options for development of these resources includes partnerships with industry (lease or farmout), Federal development, or simply deferring development, maintaining all or a portion of the properties as wilderness areas. Attendance at each of the two scheduled hearings will be limited to sixty persons. Oral and/or written presentations are invited. Oral presentations will be limited to five minutes each. Dated: January 4, 1994. Jack S. Siegel, Acting Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;644 Filed 1&hyph;10&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
