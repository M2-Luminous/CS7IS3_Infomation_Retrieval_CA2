All files and documents were also destroyed in the fire, which took several hours to put out. Markus Beisicht, party chairman and Cologne city council representative, estimated that material damage amounts to well over 50,000 German marks. By midday, no letter admitting responsibility had been received. However, it is assumed that the perpetrators came from left-wing anarchists, because of several calls in Cologne by an "Antifascist Alliance" for the "destruction of the temporary offices." In Beisicht's view, the attack means the work of the party will be completely paralyzed for the next few weeks. The German League, nonetheless, will take part in the Cologne local government elections as planned.
