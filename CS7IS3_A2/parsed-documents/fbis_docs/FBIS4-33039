He added that one factor of interest to French investors is the process of economic stabilization that Peru has experienced for approximately two years. Dufourcq said: "My country recognizes that the government of President Alberto Fujimori is carrying out a courageous policy, which often has social consequences, but we are convinced that Peru is on the right path." He then noted that in the mining field, French investors are gathering information on the gold mines in the Peruvian mountain range with a view to investment in the very near future, and that some contracts for oil exploitation had already been signed with the government. Regarding tourism, Dufourcq said he is aware that an important French group is studying the possibility of investing in the construction of a hotel infrastructure in our country. He added: "Peru has a richness and diversity in its natural environment as do very few countries in the world, and therefore has all the necessary conditions for developing tourism." He also noted that France, as Peru's top creditor, is fulfilling a very important role in the process of renegotiating the Peruvian foreign debt. He added: "This cooperation effort is part of the financing we provide for social development projects, especially in running water and sewer systems in the poor districts of Lima, in Cusco, and in the northern part of the country." Dufourcq made these comments after visiting schools in the provinces of Jaen (Cajamarca) and Utcubamba (Amazonas) with President Alberto Fujimori.
