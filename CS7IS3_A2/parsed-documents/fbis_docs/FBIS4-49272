The 128-kilometer highway runs from Yingjiang County in southwest China's Yunnan Province to Bhamo city in the northern frontier region of Myanmar. The construction of the highway started in November 1991. It connects the noted Yunnan-Myanmar highway in Yunnan Province and links up with the Stilwell Highway in Myanmar (the Stilwell Highway was named after Joseph Stilwell, a late U.S. general). The section of the highway in Myanmar's territory is 56 kilometers. With the approval of the Myanmar government, Chinese road builders joined in the construction of a 28.8-kilometer part of the highway on the Myanmar side. The highway is built along the ancient commercial path which stretched from Yunnan to Myanmar, India and Pakistan. Sources said that the opening of the highway will promote the development of border trade between China and Myanmar and will serve as a short cut for trade between China and Southeast Asian and southern Asian countries.
