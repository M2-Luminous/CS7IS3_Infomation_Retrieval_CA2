The policy of the Yeltsin regime in the sphere of trade in Russian arms and military equipment has caused colossal political and economic damage to the long-term state interests of the Russian Federation. Beginning in 1990 in Russia there has been a sharp reduction of export deliveries of arms and military equipment. By now military and technical cooperation with almost 30 foreign countries has been cut back or halted. In 1992, $2.3 billion worth of military products were sent abroad or one-third the amount in 1991. In 1993 a total of about $2 billion worth of high-technology military products were exported. While in 1993 the share of the United States in the exports of arms and military equipment to developing countries reached 57 percent, Russia's share decreased to 5.5 percent! The incompetence of the ruling "Demothieves" is striking! For example, $5.4 billion worth of military products were ordered in 1992 from Russian enterprises of the military-industrial complex for export. This order was approved by Russian Federation Government Decree No. 171-11, of 17 March 1992, signed by Ye. Gaydar. Domestic plants manufactured $3.1 billion worth of arms and military equipment but only $1.1 billion worth was actually delivered abroad. And so in recent years, because of the lack of sales of military products manufactured for export under unsubstantiated orders, the lost advantage exceeded $2.6 billion, which in October 1993 amounted to more than R3 trillion. But, in that same 1993, the Russian Ministry of Finance was unable to find financial resources to cover the debt to Russian peasants for delivery to the state of 9.2 million tonnes of wheat valued at more the R800 billion, for the construction of housing for military servicemen at R600 billion, for the development of the fuel and energy complex, or for solving other socioeconomic problems. 2. It says in the president's 18 November 1993 edict: "In order to provide for a state monopoly on exports and imports of arms and military equipment to the Russian Federation, Oboroneksport, Spetsvneshtekhnika, and the GUSK [Main Administration of Special Contracts] shall be withdrawn from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and merged into the Rosvooruzheniye company and placed under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation Government." Thus public opinion in the country was told that a) the regime had reacted to the critical problem of exporting arms; b) it had "discovered" the main cause of this problem--the lack of unity of specialized exporters; and c) it had solved this problem by creating a consolidated state corporation. But the real essence of the 18 November 1993 edict lay elsewhere. The sale of arms for export has always meant large amounts of commission in foreign currency for lobbyists and middlemen. Therefore various political groups in the regime have always carefully made sure that access to this feeding trough corresponded to the existing balance of forces at the very "top." For example, when Burbulis was especially close to B. Yeltsin he was given the opportunity to control arms exports through a specially created system of deputy ministers. The decline of Gennadiy Eduardovich led to a situation where new people appeared among the leaders of the specialized exporters. In the view of the top bureaucracy, in November 1993 after the turbulent events of the preceding 10 months the time had come for another redistribution in front of the "trough" of military exports. 3. On 9 November 1993 the leader of the president's administration, S. Filatov, sent document No. ACh-5631 to O. Soskovets. Filatov wrote: "In my opinion, the question of military and technological cooperation between Russia and foreign countries requires a special review." What does he have in mind here when Yeltsin's 18 November special edict had already been signed? Actually, in this document Filatov proposes that the government in conjunction with the administration share the "pie" of arms exports, that they act jointly against common "enemies," and that they outline certain rules of the game on this field under the new conditions. The document addressed to Soskovets lists a number of organizations and dozens of names (from the deputy prime minister on down to the chief of the ministry department) who would be "scapegoats" (among them were Gaydar, Khizha, Karaoglanov, Deynekin, B. Fedorov, etc.). The selection was broad, which provided an opportunity for Filatov to bargain with Soskovets regarding whom to protect and how. It says in the document: "Certain high officials from a number of ministries and the Russian Federation Government were drawn in to these illegal actions. In essence the commercial structures were 'fed' at the expense of state funds." Concrete examples follow after that. Soskovets might not like certain cases on this list (he had to consult with Chernomyrdin). Well, Filatov was prepared to be flexible! On page 8 comes the conclusion: "All this indicates a lack of proper control on the part of the Russian Government over the implementation of its own state decisions--over arms trade." On page 9 there is an even more radical proposal: "To send the materials of the inspection for consideration and the adoption of measures to the Russian Federation procurator general." Naturally, the latter was an obvious bluff: The most important law of the bureaucracy is to avoid public scandals in its midst. 4. Ultimately the process of forming the Rosvooruzheniye state company was an attempt at some kind of compromise among the various groups. From the present "demi-establishment": V. Shumeyko (he okayed the edict on the creation of Rosvooruzheniye), O. Soskovets (he approved the edict on behalf of the government), and V. Chernomyrdin (he approved the company's charter)--these are the ones who immediately made their interests known. Moreover, the extremely busy First Deputy Prime Minister Soskovets assumed the post of chairman of the KVTS (Interdepartmental Commission on Military and Technical Cooperation, which is directly in charge of Rosvooruzheniye). A. Korzhakov, the chief of B. Yeltsin's personal guard, also announced his claims: He was given control over "observance of state interests" in the activity of the Rosvooruzheniye state committee. S. Filatov, whose relations with Korzhakov were not very good, got Ye. Shaposhnikov appointed as the president's representative on the Rosvooruzheniye state committee. And Rosvooruzheniye itself was headed by General Ye. Samoylov--one of Shumeyko and Grachev's men. The following fact provides a fuller picture of the balance of various groups. For the sake of "foreign currency funds expenditure control" Rosvooruzheniye was to conduct its activity through authorized banks. Even Vneshtorgbank of the Russian Federation, which handles two-thirds of the operations for government agreements, was not included among these privileged banks. And the ones that were authorized were Menatep, Most-Bank, Intermed, and the Moscow National Bank. Anyone who is aware of the group whose interests are reflected by these commercial banks can guess who is receiving the most from the business of exporting arms. The intrigue (or affair) with arms exports continues at the very top. Against the background of the degradation of high-technology branches of the military-industrial complex, one can understand why the "Demothieves" hate Stalin!
