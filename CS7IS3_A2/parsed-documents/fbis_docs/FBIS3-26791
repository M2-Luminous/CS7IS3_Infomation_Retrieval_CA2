His remarks came at a Security Council meeting which the Russian Federation, Bosnia and Hercegovina and Pakistan requested to convene to discuss the situation in the former Yugoslav republic. "In view of the fact that previous ceasefire agreements and other agreements between the parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the past have frequently broken down," Vorontsov said, "it is obviously extremely important for the Security Council to back up its demands by a proper decision" for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo. "We believe that it is essential to time and again spell out our support for the negotiating procedure in order to reach a settlement to the Bosnian conflict as a whole," he said. Stating that it is now very important to urge all three parties to the conflict to reach a compromise, the ambassador said "we will continue to cooperate with the European Union and the United States in an attempt to find a peaceful settlement. On February 5, a mortar shell explosion in an open market in Sarajevo killed 68 civilians and wounding 197, worsening the situation in the Bosnian capital, which had been besieged by Bosnian Serbs for 22 months. Last Wednesday, NATO agreed to a request by UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to use air-strike to silent heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo.
