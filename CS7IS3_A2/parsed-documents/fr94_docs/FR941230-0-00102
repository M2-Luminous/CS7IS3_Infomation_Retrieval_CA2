FR941230-0-00102 FR941230-0-00019 • New Rule 311(c) of Regulation S&hyph;T. Under the amended rules, insurance companies that file information included in their annual statements provided to state insurance regulators ( i.e. , Schedules O and P) 68 as exhibits to their Forms 10&hyph;K will be allowed to file such documents in paper under cover of Form SE because of difficulties in translating them into a format compatible with EDGAR. 69 68 See Item 601(b)(28) of Regulations S&hyph;K and ␣␣ S&hyph;B [17 CFR 229.601(b)(28) and 228.601(b)(28), respectively]. 69 Since April 1993, the staff, via delegated authority, has granted requests for continuing hardship exemptions (Rule 202 of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.202]) for this type of document for a period of one year. Hardship exemptions no longer need be obtained with respect to these documents. • Rule 311(d) of Regulation S&hyph;T. The revisions also codify the staff's interpretation that a Financial Data Schedule is not among those exhibits to Form N&hyph;SAR that an investment company may submit in paper under cover of Form SE. • Rules 901(a) and 902(a) of Regulation S&hyph;T. As proposed, a note has been added to Rules 901 and 902 of Regulation S&hyph;T to make it clear that registrants become subject to mandated electronic filing upon their phase-in date and all subsequent filings must be made electronically, even filings made with respect to transactions that commenced prior to, and are in process, at the time a registrant is phased in. 70 The note to Rule 902(a) also clarifies the limited exception for definitive filings by investment companies under Securities Act Rule 497. 70 Of course, under Rule 101(a)(1)(iii) of Regulation S&hyph;T, a registrant may file its Form ␣␣ 10&hyph;K or Form 10&hyph;KSB in paper if it is the first document filed with the Commission on or following its phase-in date. • Rule 901(c)(4) of Regulation S&hyph;T. A note has been added to Rule 901 of Regulation S&hyph;T explaining that while entities subject to mandated electronic filing generally may choose to electronically file Schedules 13D 71 and 13G 72 with respect to a paper filer, domestic electronic filers are restricted from doing so with respect to foreign private issuers because EDGAR currently requires an Internal Revenue Service tax identification number to be inserted for the subject company as a prerequisite to acceptance of the filing. It is anticipated that the EDGAR system will be modified in the future to process such filings, but until that time, they should be filed in paper. 73 71 17 CFR 240.13d&hyph;101. 72 17 CFR 240.13d&hyph;102. 73 Questions relating to electronic filing of Schedules 13D or 13G with respect to foreign private issuers should be directed to Sylvia J. Reis, Assistant Director, CF&hyph;EDGAR Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, at (202) 942&hyph;2940.
