A burst of imports averaging 18.9 percent more than the previous year mainly eroded the gains from financial and non-trade dealings with the rest of the world, according to the Bangko Sentral report. Despite this negative turn of events, the Bangko Sentral managed to beef up the gross international reserves (GIR) to $5.6 billion thus boosting its capability to meet another surge of importations this year, the report said. Much of these dollar reserves came from foreign investments proceeds exceeding $2 billion. A sizable portion of these foreign funds had been placed -- in the stock market and the high-yield, zero-risk government securities. Last minute inflows of foreign loans, likewise, augmented the GIR which peaked at $6.7 billion in April, the report said. Among these are the $480 million final tranche of a financial sector adjustment loan from the World Bank, with Japan's Export-Import Bank and Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) as co-financiers. The Bangko Sentral also availed itself of $1.1 billion in short-term loans using its gold holdings and securities as collateral, to meet local dollar demand and discourage speculations. These borrowings caused the foreign debt stock to pile up to $34.4 billion as of end-August, from $30.9 billion in 1992, the report said. The debt stock picture, however, "remained well within acceptable international norms" considering that indicators point to the country's sound capability to service its foreign obligations, the report said. The debt service ratio, for instance, reached 18.1 percent, meaning annual payments for loan principal and interest rates equalled that amount of dollar earned, according to the report. That would be within the ideal ratio of 20 percent. Singson said in the report that Bangko Sentral's operations were marked by the following: -- The financial restructuring of the defunct Central Bank, giving rise to the Bangko Sentral as a well-capitalized monetary agency; -- Lifting of restrictions on dollar trade as part of the continuing deregulation of the foreign exchange sector to attract new investments; -- A two percentage point reduction in the reserve requirements to ease banks' cost of handling money, and bring about a lower interest rate; -- A sharp reduction in the loan rediscounting rate for exporters, from 12.8 percent in March to 9.4 percent, coupled with an increase in the loan fund to P10 billion [Philippine pesos].
