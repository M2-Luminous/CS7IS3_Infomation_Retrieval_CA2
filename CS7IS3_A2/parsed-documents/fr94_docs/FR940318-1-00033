ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: EPA proposes approval of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Wyoming to achieve attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM 10 ). The SIP was submitted by the State of Wyoming to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area PM 10 SIP for the City of Sheridan, Wyoming. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing by April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to: Douglas M. Skie, Chief, Air Programs Branch, (8ART&hyph;AP), Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2466. Copies of the State's submittal and other information are available for inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, Air Programs Branch, 999 18th Street, 6th floor, South Tower, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2466; and Air Quality Division, Department of Environmental Quality, Herschler Building, 4th floor, 122 West 25th Street, Cheyenne, Wyoming, 82002 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sara Summers, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, Air Programs Branch, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado, 80202&hyph;2466, (303) 293&hyph;0966. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Sheridan, Wyoming area was designated nonattainment for PM 10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 1 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991); and 40 CFR 81.351 (specifying PM 10 nonattainment designation for the Sheridan area). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas are set out in part D, subparts 1 and 4, of Title I of the Act. 2 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Public Law No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399. References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (``the Act''). The Clean Air Act is codified, as amended, in the U.S. Code at 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq. 2 Subpart 1 contains provisions applicable to nonattainment areas generally and Subpart 4 contains provisions specifically applicable to PM 10 nonattainment areas. At times, Subpart 1 and Subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted to clarify the relationship among these provisions in the ``General Preamble'' and, as appropriate, in today's notice and supporting information. The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of Title I advanced in this proposal and the supporting rationale. In this action on the Wyoming moderate PM 10 SIP for Sheridan, EPA is proposing to apply its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Thus, EPA will consider any timely submitted comments before taking final action on this proposal. Those States containing initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas (those areas designated nonattainment by operation of law under section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991:
