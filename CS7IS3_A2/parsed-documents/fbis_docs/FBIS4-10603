Alfonsin said that those who are asking him to resign "are looking at things from the viewpoint of the electoral strategy," stressing that "we must have the greatness to think of political objectives that will benefit the nation and democracy as a whole." Alfonsin said that the Radical Civic Union's (UCR) worst results occurred in those districts "where we had to face internal and general elections at the same time." Alfonsin commented particularly against the positions of Fernando de la Rua in the federal capital and Sergio Montiel in Entre Rios. During an exclusive interview with NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS yesterday, the UCR president announced that he will submit a report on his activities to the party executive board at a national meeting on 6 May, adding that he will not remain at the head of the party "a single minute longer" if a majority of members reject his arguments. The former president warned about preparations for "a campaign" to distort the constitutional reform program agreed upon in the Olivos Pact, adding that the campaign is probably supported by "the right." Alfonsin said that he "would deeply regret it" if Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez (Grand Front) joined the campaign against the pact. The complete text of the interview follows: [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] The UCR lost 1.8 million votes if we compare the results of this election with the results of the October 1993 election. This means a greater than 10 percent drop. The party ended in third place in the federal capital, Mendoza, and Buenos Aires Province, and in fourth place in suburban areas. Is this an electoral catastrophe? [Alfonsin] We would have been forced to accept that it was a catastrophe if it had been a normal election. But this was not a typical election. Obviously our performance was very bad in the federal capital, Buenos Aires Province, and in some districts where the party had great problems. We had general elections and at the same time internal elections. The UCR never faced a similar situation before. The election was not a typical one also because only institutional policies were at stake, and voters could punish governments without risking their stability. We paid a very high price for our efforts to consolidate the political peace, and consequently, democracy in Argentina. We not only had internal problems, but all other parties turned against us, seeking to win more votes. What really hurt me was the attempt to find hidden intentions in a position that was disinterested and totally patriotic, an attempt to present our efforts as something dirty or tarnished with some hidden interest. In any case, I think it is very good that no single party will have a majority on its own at the Constituent Assembly. We have more than 70 convention delegates, and that is an important force. I do not see it as a catastrophe, but as a very special circumstance. We knew beforehand that we would be sacrificed in this election. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] You speak about internal elections. Do you think people inside the UCR worked for a UCR defeat? [Alfonsin] Absolutely. A case in point is the federal capital, without a doubt. A similar thing happened in Entre Rios. In Buenos Aires Province there was more apathy. Some misguided statements were made before the elections. But the situation here is very different. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] A possible interpretation of the results is that there were many more votes against the Olivos Pact than expected. Why do you think this happened? [Alfonsin] First of all, I think our society has cannibalistic instincts. I was constantly criticized because, according to some people, I was "a questioning machine." These people said I made a staunch opposition. When I talked with the government, the same people who criticize me for my opposition criticize me furiously for doing just the opposite. But it is a fact that many of the arguments against the agreement originated in the UCR, and were discussed during our internal election. May I remind you that surveys conducted in December indicated that the pact had the support of 80 percent of the population. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Federico Storani and Juan Manuel Casella have said that had they been responsible for the UCR electoral strategy, they would have resigned. [Alfonsin] The fact that they see the pact as an electoral strategy is their problem. We have seen in it a higher political objective for Argentine democracy. You need greatness to see things from this viewpoint. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] All those people who tried to prevent your return to the party presidency are now demanding a reorganization, resignations, and early internal elections. What will you do about it? [Alfonsin] I will present a report to the National Committee for later consideration by the party plenum. Obviously, if the report is not accepted I could not remain in the presidency a single minute longer. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] You mean you will accept criticism if it comes from the party organization, but not if it comes from the press. [Alfonsin] Exactly. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] What arguments will you use in your report? [Alfonsin] The main argument is that we had to rescue the Republic's peace. The second argument is that we have changed a proposal that was designed solely to admit reelection for one that will permit us to strengthen our democratic institutions. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Deputy "Chacho" Alvarez invited you "to reverse your decision" on the Olivos Pact. [Alfonsin] Look here. I can see the preparations for a very strong campaign to distort the agreement on constitutional reform. I would very much regret it if Deputy Alvarez joins that campaign. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] What would that campaign seek? [Alfonsin] I think there are some items that the right does not like at all, such as the limitations imposed on the president. I think there are people who would prefer to continue to have needed and urgent decrees issued in some areas. I think they would also object to the idea of a cabinet chief. I can feel the campaign unleashing. I do not know if I am wrong, but I can see it coming. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] What do you think of Alvarez' invitation not to fulfill your part of the pact? [Alfonsin] I think it is absurd. We have signed an agreement and approved a law on those proposals. On the other hand, the Group of Basic Coincidences is precisely the guarantee for preventing the government from deviating and voting on a reform aimed solely at permitting the presidential reelection. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Do you still have the idea of calling for all progressive sectors to join efforts in the 1995 presidential election? Do you not think that your party's internal elections will complicate the matter once again? [Alfonsin] I think you are right, particularly if some people continue maintaining the same positions. They have already done a lot of damage, and they might try to continue doing it in 1995. They are not concerned. Perhaps they are only thinking in 1999. We will try to get party organizations to give their opinions on those matters, and then we will continue ahead. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Excuse me, sir, but the party organizations have already twice given their opinions with respect to the reform. [Alfonsin] You are right. Perhaps they learned the lesson. We have lost a percentage of votes because of their position. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Do you think the government lost support? [Alfonsin] Without a doubt. The effects of certain social situations and the consequence of some economic policies were felt in this election. If policies are not amended, the opposition will inexorably increase. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Can the UCR compete? [Alfonsin] I am sure it can, if we adopt the appropriate strategies. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] It is unavoidable that we speak about candidacies. Eduardo Angeloz seems to have been favored by the election. [Alfonsin] That is correct. Angeloz appears to occupy the best position. That is all I can say. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Can the division of the opposition favor the ruling party? [Alfonsin] I could not anticipate that. Our strategy attempts to prevent divisions among the group of progressive organizations. [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] This is the fifth consecutive election that the UCR has lost. Some people say that you are a "hardheaded Galician" who cannot accept fact. [Alfonsin] Well, we lost many successive elections by large percentages in the past, but we were able to come back. I think our worst performance was in 1962, but in 1963 we were winning again. We are in good shape to win. Even in this election. Had we presented ourselves united, we would have obtained excellent results.
