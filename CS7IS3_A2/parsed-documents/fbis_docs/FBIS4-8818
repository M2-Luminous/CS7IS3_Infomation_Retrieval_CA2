"It was not I who said that the Romanians are Italian Gypsies, but a friend of mine in Bulgaria. I do not know what Romania is, but I intend to go there. There are certain actions of Romania against Moldova, which is a Russian land. Romania has to eliminate its territorial problems. You have problems with Moldova, Bulgaria, and Hungary and you have no army, which is very bad for you. We want to have our own sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, that is in the former socialist area, including Poland and Budapest," Vladimir Zhirinovskiy told us. "Iliescu was friends with Ceausescu. For you, Nicolae Ceausescu was very good, people loved him, and you were happy with the old regime," the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia added, basing his affirmations on movies he has seen. The Russian leader also said that "Iliescu is exactly like Gorbachev" and that he is expecting an invitation to visit Romania.
