In an arrival statement, he said that 'Arafat will arrive in Cairo during the weekend to discuss with President Mubarak the latest developments in the peace process. He will also meet with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown, who will visit Egypt to discuss the U.S. role in supporting Palestinian establishments in Gaza and Jericho. Sha'th said that he briefed president 'Arafat and the PLO Executive Committee members on the progress in the Taba negotiations. He received instructions from the Palestinian leadership regarding the next round of talks that will begin tomorrow morning. He said that during tomorrow's round the two sides will complete discussions of transferring the civil powers and we hope that this week we will discuss the crossing points and the size of the Jericho area. He expressed his hope that the Israeli side will show more flexibility in view of the timetable for withdrawal. Discussing the summit meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and its effect on the Palestinian-Israeli track, Dr. Sha'th said that this meeting was met with satisfaction because it represents U.S. recognition of the importance of a comprehensive solution. He stressed that the success of this summit will lead Syria to return to the peace process under the title of complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights and Syrian sovereignty over them. He noted that this is important to the peace process for two reasons: first, Syria's return to the peace process will lead to Lebanon's and Jordan's return as well, making the peace process comprehensive, and second this reasserts that the implementation of Security Council Resolution No. 242 means withdrawal from all the occupied territories.
