This ensued after the prime minister did not accept the proposal of the deputy prime minister regarding, above all, a clear outline of the division of prerogatives within the government. Marek Borowski, justifying his decision, said that the so-called Deputy Finance Stefan Kawalec affair ought to be seen in a wider context, which is made up of many statements by the prime minister. In the view of Marek Borowski, they undermine his activity as deputy prime minister. Marek Borowski viewed the statements of the prime minister as a particular vote of no confidence. We still do not know if Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak has accepted Marek Borowski's resignation.
