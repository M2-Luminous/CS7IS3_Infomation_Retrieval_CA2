Slyusarev: "The Members of Ukraine's Officers' Union Have Something To Think About"] [Text] What has the Officers' Trade Union Organization achieved over the period of its existence? 1. Transferred approximately 1,000 officers serving outside Ukraine, those whom Ukraine's Ministry of Defense did not want to accept (General Ihnatenko) into Ukraine's Armed Forces. 2. Forced K. Morozov's Defense Ministry to provide us with 12 Il-76 aircraft for transferring 500 officers, members of their families, and household effects from Azerbaijan to Ukraine, as well as automobiles for transporting their belongings from airports to their residences in Ukraine. 3. Forced the government of the defense minister of Azerbaijan to pay increased monetary compensation for the living quarters rented in Azerbaijan by members of the organization at the rate of 5,000 Russian rubles [R] per one square meter of total area and not R3,000 per one square meters of useful area. In comparison with other servicemen, members of the organization obtained an additional R250,000-300,000 in September 1992 prices. 4. By the organization's actions and with the help of the Supreme Council, forced K. Morozov's Defense Ministry to cancel Order No. 194 on introducing the notorious contract system for the continuation of service in Ukraine's Armed Forces. 5. In March 1993, won the court case against the Darnytsya housing office as a result of which an apartment in Kiev became the property of Captain Yermakov and his family. The court took the side of the trade union, even though, in accordance with the law, Yermakov had not been entitled to that apartment because neither he nor the members of his family were registered in that apartment. It was the serviceman's father who had lived there before he died. The organization maintained the empty apartment for five months until Yermakov was transferred from the Transbaykal region to Ukraine's Armed Forces. 6. In August 1993, won the court case against Major General Gvozdev, chief of the Air Defense Academy, who demanded the eviction of the family of Lieutenant Colonel Avramenko, a graduate of the academy, from the official apartment and for that reason ordered not to issue a payment book to him. Avramenko and his family continue to live in the same apartment and the payment book is in his pocket. 7. In October 1993, forced the Council of People's Deputies of Bila Tserkva to put an end to the procrastination and allocate plots of land for building to the housing construction society "Hayok" -- our cell in Bila Tserkva. The chairman of the local council, Shulypa, resolved this question positively. 8. Protected member of the organization Major of the Guard Lalak from being dismissed into the reserve before reaching the length of service entitling him to benefits, despite the fact that two assessment commissions in the regiment and the division unanimously decided that it was "expedient to dismiss him into the reserve." The organization conducted explanatory work with the command, and the latter adopted the only correct decision -- to allow him to continue his service. 9. Forced head of the Zaliznychnyy District Military Committee to renounce its illegal action -- an attempt to dismiss member of the organization Major Melnykov into the reserve without providing him with housing. An additional session on legal training sufficed. 10. Instituted court proceedings against Defense Minister Colonel General K. Morozov in order to protect the honor and dignity of the Trade Union of Ukrainian Servicemen and its right to existence. However, after Morozov was dismissed from his post, the Independent Trade Union of Ukrainian Servicemen dropped the case. All of the above is quite sufficient to prove that the Independent Trade Union of Ukrainian Servicemen, which unites within its ranks the most conscious, best organized, and honored Ukrainian officers, is the only organization of servicemen capable of protecting its members and contributing to the honor, dignity, and significance of officers, as well as making our army one of the most advanced armies in the world. What can the Ukrainian Officers' Union say to this to justify itself?
