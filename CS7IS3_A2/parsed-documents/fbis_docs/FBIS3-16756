He is doing this by checking his plans against the opinions of regional leaders. The meeting between the head of state and Kuban Governor Nikolay Yegorov lasted several hours. The latter admitted that he was pleasantly surprised by the president's knowledge of the state of affairs in Krasnodar Kray. That is why problems relating to the Kuban's economy and social and cultural spheres were discussed without any preamble. The subject of the head of state's special concern was the development of the agrarian sector. The president focused attention on the need for more careful preparation and organized conduct of spring field work, and approved the measures being adopted by the kray leadership in this sphere. Programs drawn up in the kray for the development of industry, construction, culture, the social sphere, and the fight against organized crime, and approaches to strengthening Russia's land and maritime borders with the Transcaucasus states and to the stationing of forces re-stationed in Kuban from nearby and more distant foreign countries, also met with Yeltsin's support. The president agreed with the proposals made by the head of the kray administration aimed at solving questions of interethnic relations, and he approved of the governor's intention to introduce a visa system for crossing the borders of Krasnodar Kray. B. Yeltsin advised Yegorov to present the relevant proposals to the federal authorities.
