As compared with August 1993, investments have dropped to one-tenth of the previous amount, from $115.7 million to $13.8 million. In December the share of foreign capital in the capital stock of SP [joint ventures] constituted 30-40 percent, as compared with 80 percent in July. In the opinion of certain Western businessmen, the reason for this decline was not only the instability of the political situation and the imperfect nature of legislation, but also the unexpected reorganizations in the agencies of administration. The edict entitled "The Restructuring of the Federal Agencies of Administration," which was signed in January 1994, essentially eliminates the only agency that used to carry out a more or less consistent investment policy. In accordance with the president's order, the Russian Agency for International Cooperation and Development (RAMSIR) is transferred to the jurisdiction of MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] "with transformation into a state enterprise." Thus, the work of improving the state registry of enterprises is indefinitely postponed. No one knows which department will engage in the registration of the major investment agreements or who will guarantee the work of the Commission on Humanitarian Assistance to Russia, under the RF government. Currently the government is working on the drafts of edicts entitled "Procedure for State Registration of Enterprises and Physical Entities Engaging in Entrepreneurial Activity" and "Encouraging the Attracting of Foreign Investments Into the Priority Branches of the National Economy." The president's administration is preparing a federal investment plan for 1994. However, if the tendency to "dissipate the functions" of one department among several others is preserved, one would scarcely expect those legislative drafts to be effective. In the opinion of V. Korolev, deputy chairman of RAMSIR, the actual elimination of the agency will result in the further drop in investments. Potential investors once again will encounter complete confusion when one ministry will engage in providing informational support, another ministry will engage in the registration of enterprises, and a third one will engage in export-import problems.
