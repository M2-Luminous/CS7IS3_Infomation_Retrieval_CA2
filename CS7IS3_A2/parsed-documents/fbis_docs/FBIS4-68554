Shakhnazarov: "A Suggestion to All: National Support for the National Newspaper"] [Text] I received the last issue of the newspaper SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA on Tuesday, 29 March 1994. As I learned, the newspaper is not being published because of the indebtedness of the editorial office for printing services and paper. But perhaps we readers can help. Let us calculate. The newspaper's circulation is reaching 470,000 copies and in all probability a good half of these are direct subscribers--that is 235,000 people. I am firmly convinced that if the editorial office were to appeal through the mass media to the subscribers at this critical point IF ONLY FOR R1,000 EACH, this would amount to: 235,000 X R1,000 = R235 million. It would already be possible to retire some of the debts. ...Because if I do not receive my SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA it is tantamount to cutting off my oxygen supply. On 12 APRIL 1994, at such a critical time for the newspaper I decided to go directly to the editorial offices and contribute R5,000 to the fund to help the newspaper. [Signed] A. Shakhnazarov Odintsovskiy Rayon p/o Staryy Gorodok Moscow Oblast We invite every subscriber and every reader of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA to contribute no less than R1,000-R2,000 to the fund to aid the newspaper. This will help it to come out regularly. Thank you for your help, friends!
