The communique from the talks does not say much except that the coalition wants to sit out its full parliamentary term. But how? What was decided? [Pawlak] The confusion was largely the result of automatic processes. There was no tension among the politicians, but people on the outside thought there was a major problem. This might be just my own private view, but I think that if less publicity had been given to this business, the outcome might have been different. [POLITYKA] Might Deputy Prime Minister Borowski have kept his job? [Pawlak] Quite possibly. In politics one has to watch one's actions. I am frequently accused of being too quiet and having poor relations with the media, but I think that sometimes it is safer to be quiet than to say one word too much. Our partners simply do not have an easy way out. The Middle East accord might never have happened if the talks had not taken place in Norway, far from journalists. [POLITYKA] But we still do not know why you fired Deputy Minister Kawalec in such a way. [Pawlak] We discussed this matter with the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] when the coalition was formed, so it cannot have come as a surprise. What happened was this. I sent Deputy Prime Minister Borowski his notice to quit. He refused to accept it, so I delivered it personally. I fail to see what this has to do with later events. Later, Borowski's dismissal was given such prominent media treatment that it was difficult to shut one's eyes and pretend nothing had happened. I decided that the best thing to do was to explain everything and put the whole issue behind me. The decision to dismiss Mr. Borowski was not an easy and pleasant one either for Mr. Borowski or for me. But that is how things are in politics. Sometimes, one is on one side of the barricade, and sometimes on the other. The most important thing is to have cooperation. [POLITYKA] You did not expect Kawalec's dismissal to cause such an avalanche? [Pawlak] No. I think the significance of the matter has been exaggerated. But I do not shun responsibility. I realize it might be the result of my own actions, but I think that each political group should ask itself whether such an end result really had to come about. [POLITYKA] Not just Deputy Prime Minister Borowski, but also the SLD wanted to tidy up the rules governing cooperation with the the coalition, the functioning of the Council of Ministers, personnel policy, and a curb on the powers of the chief of the Office of the Council of Ministers. [Pawlak] I have never heard that the powers of the chief of the Office of the Council of Ministers should be curbed. [POLITYKA] But we have. The SLD has spoken out loudly about it. [Pawlak] Be that as it may, but we have never discussed this at the coalition forum. You see what happens when people gossip in public? Misunderstandings occur. [POLITYKA] We understand that other postulates have been presented to you. So what have you decided? [Pawlak] I think the communique presents quite clearly the compromise that was reached. Basically, we decided that government issues would be discussed and resolved at government level, and coalition issues at coalition level. There must be a clear distinction between the government and the coalition. As far as the functioning of the government is concerned, I realize that there are many discrepancies. Soon after I became prime minister we entered a difficult period, for we had to work out a budget, after which the Sejm Committee debates started. This prevented me from taking a closer look at administrative procedures and the entire administrative system. Our administration may function far more efficiently if it tidies itself up. A central office or ministry, and even a provincial office, sometimes functions according to its own principles. Some operations are common to all administrative units, such as book-keeping, organization, and communications, but often there is no comparison between the way one office performs them and the way another does. Such problems occur in every office, and yet the administration must be functional. [POLITYKA] But let us return to the crisis and the solving thereof. Are we to understand that the SLD has accepted your personnel policy, for example your changes to governor posts? Aleksander Kwasniewski has accused you of nepotism. [Pawlak] That is not true. There are just as many Polish Peasant Party [PSL] governors as there are SLD governors. [POLITYKA] No. Almost every single governor belongs to the PSL. [Pawlak] As fare as deputy governors are concerned, there is a difference. Deputy goverors are appointed by the prime minister, but at the governors' recommendation. So I have no influence on whether a candidate for deputy governor belongs to the PSL or SLD. [POLITYKA] So PSL people are not hungry for posts? We thought they were. [Pawlak] There was a time when we never discussed posts. It was one of the coalition partners who announced the need to replace a few governors and deputy ministers. You did not know that. In the United States, nobody objects when a new president comes into office and the entire administration is replaced top to bottom. No one talks about nepotism. [POLITYKA] We believe that today in Poland, the policy is to adopt any kind of system, as long as it works. Right now everything is geared toward a certain political model. [Pawlak] No, we are not pursuing a personnel policy that is geared toward any political model. Some old employees have remained, and others have left. During this time of change, it is important not to create the impression that we are writing off people immediately because of their party membership or political convictions. That way, we would lose qualified people. But there are changes, there have to be. If we want politics to undergo at least a slight change, then we must replace some personnel. [POLITYKA] You said that government issues should be kept distinct from coalition issues. But such a distinction is impossible. The government has been formed by a specific coalition, and the government's operation is governed by the coalition pact. Is this pact still in force? [Pawlak] In every coalition, key issues should be governed by agreements. However, the members of the government should have freedom of action. When we talk of a violation of agreements, am I the only one who violates them? I am not going to tell you about all the surprise moves that have taken me unawares, because that is an internal government matter. These matters must be set in order, there is no doubt about that. [POLITYKA] The sequence of events was as follows: First there was a personnel dispute, the SLD turned it into a dispute concerning authority, and you interpreted this as a political dispute concerning differences in the assessment of economic policy. How differently from each other do the SLD and PSL view economic policy? [Pawlak] Differences occur not just between the parties that form the coalition. They also occur within a particular party, in the SLD and in the PSL. But the general path of reform pursued since 1989 is not being questioned by anyone. We are all committed to democracy and a free market. The problem is what kind of solutions we apply, what kind of economic processes we set in motion, and how we handle privatization. And last but not least, the speed of these changes is also significant. [POLITYKA] Differences between parties are rather hazy, we find it hard to accept that there are no strong groups that question the basic path of reforms. There is no doubt that in the eyes of the West, Marek Borowski and the SLD have become the main guarantors of continuing the reforms. [Pawlak] You are thinking in socialist terms. You make it sound as if this party is guaranteeing the chosen path of the reforms. This reminds us of the past when, in addition, this guarantee was enshrined in the Constitution. By the way, I remember people saying in September and October that democracy and the market changes might be in danger if the SLD and PSL won the elections. But when I was in Brussels, I had the impression that my interlocutors were not so much interested in my party affiliation as in my policies and actions. In Brussels they were not interested in noble declarations that we want to join NATO as quickly as possible. They were interested in the practical measures that we were implementing in order to reach that objective. For the West and for out own society, effective solutions are the best guarantees, and no single person or party has exclusivbe rights to them. We must also be flexible and revise our opinions from time to time. One could have taken an easier path and drawn up a better budget, better from the point of view of accountancy, a budget with secure income and low expenditure. But would the economy and the population have withstood it? If we say that there is a general and firm desire to build a market economy and democratic system, we have to know that there are other paths that lead to this goal. [POLITYKA] So, along what path do you and your government want to lead us? [Pawlak] First, we have to establish what our main problems are, and there is no doubt that such problems are the drop in production and the sky-high increase in unemployment. Last year we experienced economic growth. In order to continue it this year, given society's present standards of living, we must on the one hand concentrate on expanding the domestic market, and on the other hand increase exports of our products. We have been experiencing an increasing trade deficit in recent years. Poland, a poor country, has become an exporter of capital. This problem requires very precise actions, which is why from the very beginning my government has been laying emphasis not just on security, but on economic issues, and saying all the time how important it is to have a trade balance. The accords that we have concluded with the European Union contain an imbalance in our favor, but in financial practice the situation is quite the opposite, because various non-tariff barriers are being applied. We propose concrete solutions to revive the domestic market. It is true that budget requirements necessitate an increase in taxation, but we are increasing the tax on private incomes, and not on the profits of firms. We have also introduced a system of concessions for investment. I am not saying this system is perfect and that everyone will reap benefits from it, but those with profitable enterprises can allocate income for investment purposes. One can also take a look at the solutions applied in other countries. The general principle of buying Polish goods before other goods is not recognized by our media, and yet that would be the best way to help our economy. Of course, our Polish products do not always match our wishes, but prosperous countries also promote their own products. Therefore we have undertaken concrete activity to point the economic processes in a slightly different direction. We have not made a 180-degree turn, there is no need to do so, but nevertheless we are clearly altering the method of implementing the reforms. [POLITYKA] I think most people, including opposition politicians, will agree with what you have just said, but in your last television interview you said that the budget must be made more socially friendly, and people think that that means increasing consumption. [Pawlak] Surely investment projects and the creation of new jobs are socially friendly activities? I repeat, one can restrict oneself to activities that provide an easy budget. But the point is not to have a budget that is easy for the accountants to manage, but to have one that provides social and economic effects. [POLITYKA] One can have a budget that is financially easy, and one can have a budget that is politically easy. A financially easy budget is usually politically difficult. The present budget has not been badly received, but people have the impression that you and some of the parties oppose it, and that you would prefer a politically easier budget. [Pawlak] It is difficult for me to explain away people's impressions. As I said, there are even differences inside each party. But when a budget is drawn up and certain financial proportions are proposed, the final version is never the only correct one. The present draft budget was drawn up at the end of December, so there are going to be adjustments to it. But its basic financial proportions will not be touched. The Sejm committees have indicated the possibility of changes in spending, and it has transpired that last year's budget deficit was less than expected. So changes are possible. Not major ones, but important all the same. [POLITYKA] So a socially friendly budget does not mean greater spending on social benefits, pensions, and subsidies? [Pawlak] Of course it does, but it means more than just that. [POLITYKA] Today you are facing a picket of miners outside your offices, and a great Solidarity strike. Do you not feel that the state should abandon its role as entrepreneur? [Pawlak] That is our aim. We want the chairmen of enterprise management boards to decide how their enterprises should be managed, because these are people who concentrate on economic matters. Some old habits have to be eliminated, such as the habit of writing to the prime minister when there is a problem about an enterprise's functioning, instead of solving the problem at management level or provincial level. But generally speaking, it is far easier to say we want a free market and democracy than to bring these things about in practice. One really needs a lot of ideas to dispense with old habits. But I think there is a chance of success. For example, in neglected areas, we can introduce modern technology immediately. If the Poles could not get used to the industrial age because the idea of working on an assembly line and producing the same piece of equipment for eight hours was alien to them, they will certainly have to do so now that we are in a difficult situation, with a recession in Poland and the West, and we have to seek new ideas and solutions everywhere. Every country and society is struggling to achieve a good position. We still have to learn how to play this game, and to play it together with others. In Poland, the situation is still similar to that of two farmers, one of whom has one cow, and the other has five, and the farmer with only one cow, instead of praying for another four cows, prays that four cows belonging to the other farmer will drop dead. This is part of our mentality, and it is worth pondering over this.
