His official visit to Germany has ended. Our correspondents report on the last day of the trip: [Begin recording] [Kondratyev] The German mass media are today using more complimentary than critical language about the results of the Russian president's talks in Bonn and the chancellor's home region. The last day of the visit, just as the previous day, began with political discussions. Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister and chairman of the FDP [Free Democratic Party], part of the ruling coalition, arrived for a joint luncheon with Yeltsin at Petersberg, where the guest is staying. It is Kinkel's Foreign Ministry that will have to implement the chancellor's promises to Yeltsin, on Russian membership of GATT and a number of European Union organizations, full membership of G-7, and signing of a separate protocol on Russia's special status in NATO's Partnership for Peace. Russia, for its part, supports the FRG's efforts to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Kinkel told us after the talks that the two sides also discussed the role Russia and Germany could play in a Bosnian peace settlement. Kinkel, who is taking part in the work of the joint commission on return of art treasures, was not very happy about Russia's inflexibility over the return of works of art captured during World War II. Fearing charges of unpatriotic behavior, our country is not even prepared at the moment to honor its promise to hand over the Gotha Library, which is chiefly of significance to Germans. [Kondratyev, addressing Yeltsin] Boris Nikolayevich, how do you evaluate the results of your talks with the German leaders? [Yeltsin] All the issues that we had planned to discuss were discussed. We have not lost out on a single question. [Kondratyev] From Bonn Yeltsin flew to Stuttgart, which he first visited in 1991. No doubt the warm reception that he received then made such an impact on the president that he decided to visit his friends in Baden-Wuerttemberg again. From Stuttgart, Boris Yeltsin will return to Moscow. He has reason to be satisfied with his meetings on German soil. Germany, as was repeatedly stressed during the visit, is Russia's main partner on the European continent. [end recording]
