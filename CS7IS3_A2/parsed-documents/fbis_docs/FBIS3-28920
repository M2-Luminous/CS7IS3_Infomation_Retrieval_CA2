Hosokawa made the remarks at a meeting of government and ruling coalition parties after he and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed during a summit meeting in Washington on Friday to reach on accord on a new trade framework, officials said. Hosokawa was quoted as saying it is "not favorable" for Japan's 50 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. to continue and the situation "must be improved." He said it is imperative for both the private sector and the government to make appropriate efforts.
