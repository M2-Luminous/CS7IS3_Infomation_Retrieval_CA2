FBIS3-47873 "dreas014__a94017" FBIS-EAS-94-014-A Document Type:Daily Report 21 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Government Publishes Notes of Construction Talks OW2101104994 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database in Japanese 21 Jan 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2101104994 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [From Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 21 January Morning Edition] [Text] The government released the text of notes exchanged between the Japanese and U.S. Governments on the bilateral construction talks. It says that to monitor the extent of foreign companies' participation in the Japanese construction market, 10 items in six areas will be adopted as criteria. The government believes that this criteria "will not develop into numerical targets" (according to Shigeo Mochizuki, administrative vice minister of construction). These notes were exchanged on 19 January between Takakazu Kuriyama, ambassador to the United States, and Ronald Brown, U.S. commerce secretary. Other criteria cited includes the construction project clients' assessment of efforts by foreign companies to win bids, and the number of registered foreign companies. Regular bilateral consultations will be held once a year beginning April 1995, when the government's "action program" for reform of the bidding system will be fully implemented, to make comprehensive assessments until the end of 1999. With regard to the criteria, the Construction Ministry maintains that: "These are for the purpose of assessing progress made so far objectively; the United States had not even demanded setting numerical targets." The government takes a similar position in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks; it rejects setting numerical targets. It asserts that "negotiations should not be on a bilateral basis, but should be done at GATT" (according to a Foreign Ministry source). However, the U.S. construction industry and Congress are still calling for setting a market share target. Depending on the number of contracts U.S. companies can win from now on, frictions may rekindle in the areas of design and consultancy, where U.S. companies have a strong desire to make inroads into the market.
