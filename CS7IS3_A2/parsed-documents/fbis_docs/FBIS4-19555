Luc.": "Dalla Chiesa: `Rete a Loser'"] [Excerpt] Milan -- The decision was announced last night, to general incredulity and stupor, at the movement's meeting in Bruzzano, on the northern fringes of Milan. Nando Dalla Chiesa is leaving the Rete, the party he founded jointly in January 1991 with Orlando, Novelli, Galasso and others, and for which he was a deputy from April 1992 to 27 March of this year. He turned down Novelli's suggestion that he run in the European elections. He failed to win reelection in the general election, but will remain on the city council while returning to university. Dalla Chiesa explained to journalists: "My disagreement is political, a radical choice, but there is no bitterness." He no longer identifies with the plans of [Rete Secretary] Leoluca Orlando and the Rete's national committee to break up the movement and without delay move toward building the Democratic Party. He objects: "It is a lame project for a defeated, one-legged left, a kind of extended Democratic Party of the Left [PDS]. On the contrary, the Left should stand on two legs: the red flag and the movements for civil society." Hence his rejection of the Rete "as a bridge between the People's Party and the PDS, and of the policy of remaining mere shrubs in the shadow of oak tree [PDS symbol]." Anyone contemplating this path "has not learned the lesson of the elections." Leoluca Orlando, the Rete's national coordinator, reacted uncontroversially: "We will go forward, irrespective of obstacles and difficulties, to give real answers to real questions, free from attempts at hegemony, and free from the constraints of ideology and political machinations."
