In such circumstances, China's oil industry continues to maintain a stable growth momentum. In 1993, production of crude oil and natural gas exceeded planned targets laid down by the state: Crude oil output reached 139.2 million tonnes, or increased by 1.04 million tonnes over the previous year, and this marked the largest increase in output over one year. Natural gas output reached 15.4 cubic meters, an increase of 200 million cubic meters over the previous year, which were 101.2 percent and 101.3 percent respectively of the state's planned targets. At present, various oil fields in the east of the country are still experiencing a period of difficult development, the average comprehensive water content stands above 79 percent, and the annual fall in output is about 21 million tonnes. On the one hand, the China National Petroleum Corporation will continue to adopt advanced technology, will pay attention to the reasonable adjustment of exploitation, and try by every possible means to lower the overall rate of decrease and the natural rate of decrease. On the other hand, through the in-depth implementation of the Regulations on Enterprise Reform, it will adjust the production contract policy for the last three years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period so that reform may promote further the development of production. Since last year, promoted by reforms, various oil fields have made efforts to increase oil output by overcoming difficulties. Oil fields in the east have actively carried out measures to "stabilize output through water control." Last year, Daqing Oil Field produced 55.9 million tonnes of crude oil, and increased output by 244,000 tonnes over the previous year. It has stabilized its output at a level above 50 million tonnes for 18 consecutive years. Oil fields in the west also increased crude oil output by 1.739 million tonnes, although there was a shortage of transport facilities. In 1993, the oil and gas prospecting situation of our country's onshore petroleum industry also maintained a rising trend. Geological oil and gas reserves discovered and verified exceeded planned state targets by 22 percent and 44 percent respectively. Total discovered reserves continued to increase.
