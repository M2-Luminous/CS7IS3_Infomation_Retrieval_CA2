FR940607-0-00002 FR940607-0-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 591 RIN 3206&hyph;AF59 Separate Maintenance Allowance for Duty at Johnston Island AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management is adopting as final the interim regulations authorizing payment of a separate maintenance allowance to Federal civilian employees assigned to Johnston Island, a nonforeign post of duty dedicated to chemical weapon storage and disposal facilities. A separate maintenance allowance assists an employee in meeting some of the additional expenses of maintaining a spouse and/or dependents elsewhere who would normally reside with the employee. The final regulations provide for determining which employees are eligible for the separate maintenance allowance, which relatives qualify as dependents, the method of payment, and the payment amounts. EFFECTIVE DATE: The final regulations are effective on July 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roger M. Knadle, (202) 606&hyph;2858. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published an interim rule on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51565). The 30-day public comment period ended on November 3, 1993. No comments were received on the interim rule; therefore, OPM is adopting as final the interim rule implementing section 1092 of Public Law 102&hyph;190, December 5, 1991 (the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993). Section 1092 amended chapter 59 of title 5, United States Code, by adding section 5942a to provide a separate maintenance allowance to assist an employee assigned to Johnston Island to meet the additional expenses of maintaining a spouse and/or dependents elsewhere who would normally reside with the employee. On November 16, 1992, this regulatory authority was delegated to OPM by Executive Order 12822. The final regulations provide procedures and rules under which the head of the agency may determine eligibility for a separate maintenance allowance and the appropriate payment amount. The regulations define: (1) Dependents, (2) the annual rate to be paid to an employee according to the number of his or her dependents, (3) the method of payment, and (4) the responsibilities of the agencies and OPM. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities since they apply only to Federal agencies and employees. List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 591 Government employees, Travel and transportation expenses, Wages. U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Lorraine A. Green, Deputy Director. Accordingly, the interim rule adding subpart D to 5 CFR part 591, published at 58 FR 51565 on October 4, 1993, is adopted as a final rule without change.
