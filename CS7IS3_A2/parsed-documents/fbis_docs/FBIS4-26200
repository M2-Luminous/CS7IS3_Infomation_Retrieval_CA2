The guidelines will be interpreted and turned into regulations by local authorities. The aim is to prevent the violation of business ethics and disorder on the market, according to the State Planning Commission. Excessive profits do not reflect the true relation between supply and demand, he said. There is not yet enough competition to guarantee proper pricing and the commission is drafting a document designed to help create a fair market and protect consumers in the meantime, said Hong Feng, vice-director of the Department of Market and Price with the commission. The department is currently working on the document which will be approved and issued by the State Council in the form of a decree. But the decree will not set the prices of all commodities, said Hong. The government will see to it that profits obtained by businesses do not exceed "a reasonable range based on average social cost of manufactured goods or services, he said. [no ending quotation mark as received] It was up to the localities to work out specific regulations to decide what that range should be in the light of local conditions. Shanghai spearheaded this mission in April by issuing "the Temporary Code against Price Cheating and Excessive Profits," which is believed to have informed the drafting of the national decree. Hong admitted that it is difficult to define what was "illegal profiteering" because it could not be decided simply by fixing specific profit margins. High-profits alone do not indicate profiteering, he said. If high-profits are obtained by reducing production costs and introducing new technical methods, it would be normal and should be encouraged, he said. Profit margins must be in line with general price standards and the balance between supply and demand in any given commodity market, the vice-director noted.
