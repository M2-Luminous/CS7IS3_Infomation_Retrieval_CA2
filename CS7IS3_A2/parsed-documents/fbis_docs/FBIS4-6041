As soon as Kim was inaugurated as the first civilian president in more than three decades last year, he officially placed the April 19 uprising in its proper historical context, calling it "a revolution." Kim has not only issued orders to "sanctify" the tombs of those felled by the bullets of policemen during the student-led uprising, but also became the first president to visit the Suyuri cemetery and pay his respects to the dead. President Kim's particular feeling for the revolution is not unrelated to the government's plans to host commemorative activities with bereaved family members and other groups associated with the event, sources said. Government preparations come as the ruling Democratic Liberal Party and the main opposition Democratic Party are locked in debate over which side boasts more members who played an active role in the uprising. "What the students aimed for on April 19, 1960, was precisely the democratization of the country," President Kim said. It was a popular uprising against corruption and injustice and intended to realize a just and clean society, Kim said. Kim placed his civilian government "on the extension" of the April 19 revolution and vowed to develop its spirit, according to the presidential office at Chongwadae. President Kim has visited the cemetery on April 19 every year except in 1981 and 1982, when he was under house arrest. Time and again, Kim has emphasized that historical evaluations of the April 19 uprising must be revised since the administrations of former Army generals that followed have tried only "to beautify" the military coup on May 16, 1961. The April 19 uprising toppled the Lee government but, taking advantage of the ensuing political chaos, Gen. Pak Chong-hui and his associates in the military grabbed power a year later. Since the student uprising have been belittled under the Pak government and its successors with dubious legitimacy, President Kim believes his administration must help correct inaccuracies about the uprising and preserve its historical significance. Under a presidential order, Seoul City started last October to double the size of the Suyuri cemetery and build a commemorative building there costing 15 billion won. The renovation work is expected to be completed on April 19, 1995. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang will attend a ceremony sponsored by the government. Smaller ceremonies on the provincial and municipal levels and other commemorative events are scheduled. President Kim, the heads of the two other branches of government and some 500 dignitaries are expected to pay their respects at the cemetery.
