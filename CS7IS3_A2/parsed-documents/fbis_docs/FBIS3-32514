The alleged objective of this pirate office is to hamper the operations of the existing Senate institution. According to a note signed by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, steps already taken could at last lead to a denouement to the crisis ravaging Haiti. The Senate Office invites the country's institutions and the entire Haitian people not to let themselves be led into any adventurist maneuvers, which can only plunge the country even further into the abyss and delay the process of setting up a new government, returning to constitutional and democratic order, lifting the embargo, and having the country move toward progress once and for all. The Senate Office takes this opportunity to announce to the nation that a parliamentary delegation has gone abroad. The delegation will meet with representatives of the United Nations, the OAS, and the governments of the United States, Canada, France, and Venezuela to explore ways and means of getting out of the crisis quickly. The communique adds: Furthermore, the Senate Office has decided, pending the decision of the assembled Senate, to suspend Senator Ebrane Cadet, Senate Office first secretary, who has destroyed his reputation vis-a-vis the population through his undisciplined and dangerous behavior toward the institution. The Office of the Senate of the Republic firmly believes that the results of the multiple steps being taken abroad by the parliamentary delegation should calm apprehensions and fulfill everyone's expectations. This note is signed: Firmin Jean-Louis, senator of the Republic, president.
