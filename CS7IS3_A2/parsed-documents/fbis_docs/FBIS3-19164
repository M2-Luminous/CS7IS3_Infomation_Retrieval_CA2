Mr. Arsenis will arrive in Cyprus on Wednesday [16 March] for talks with the Cyprus Government. Our correspondent Andreas Stilianou has the following report: [Begin recording] [Stilianou] In a statement to a current affairs program on Athens ET-1 Television Network, Mr. Arsenis pointed out that Greece's role as a guarantor power in Cyprus gives it direct responsibility for the island's defense. Mr. Arsenis reiterated that any intensification of the Turkish threat in Cyprus would be a casus belli for Greece, and added: [Arsenis] When you have two Hellenic countries--Greece and Cyprus--which believe, and they are right, that there is a common threat against them, Turkish expansionism, it follows that these two countries should coordinate their national defense plans. The unified defense area....[sentence unfinished as received] [Stilianou] Mr. Arsenis further noted that a unified defense area means that Greece and Cyprus are discussing their defense and coordinating their plans so that they can be more efficient. Responding to a question, Mr. Arsenis said that he did not get the impression that there were reservations about the joint Greek-Cypriot decisions. He said: Many countries questioned the move and it was necessary for us to clarify our goal. Mr. Arsenis concluded: [Arsenis] From the moment it becomes crystal clear that as far as we are concerned the issue is coordination of defensive plans to deter a common threat, then the matter has been explained sufficiently.
