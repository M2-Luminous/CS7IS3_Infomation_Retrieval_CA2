FR941107-2-00066 FR941107-2-00025 3. Mistakes in Rate Filing Procedures (MIRF) a. General. (1) Carriers discovering a mistake(s) before bid closing time can correct such mistake(s) by submission of a new tender prior to closing. The last tender received before closing governs. Identification of a rate error(s) in a bid submission after opening may be initiated by either HQMTMC or in writing by the carrier. After opening, carriers may either withdraw or seek to correct rate error(s). (2) Correction is allowed for clerical error(s) where the intended rate is obvious from the bid submission itself, as in the case of misplaced decimal. (3) Correction is allow in other cases (except in the case of a downward correction which would displace a low bidder) only if the carrier proves the mistake and the rate actually intended by providing HQMTMC (MTOP-T-N) clear and convincing written evidence. If the evidence supports the existence of the mistake, but not the rate actually intended, the carrier will be permitted to withdraw its tender (or MTMC will reject it). Carriers must submit evidence to arrive HQMTMC (MTOP-T-N) within a reasonable time after notification by MTMC of a suspected mistake. (4) Where a downward correction would displace a low bidder, it is permitted only if the mistake and the intended rate can be determined from the solicitation and the tender itself. (b) Evidence. The following evidence must, at a minimum, be submitted by the carrier when the carrier seeks to correct a mistake in rate other than a clerical error(s): (1) Original source documents pertinent to the error, including, but not limited to, working papers, spread sheets, transcription sheets, adding machine tapes, tariffs, cost data sheets, memorandum for records, written procedural guidance on determining rate levels, internal rate printouts, and other such papers which will provide a clear audit trail for tracing the mistake. (2) Other documents deemed by the carrier to be relevant to error validation can also be used as evidence. (3) To protect their interests, carriers are encouraged to retain original source data until it is certain that no further use for it exists. 4. Rate Errors Rate regression mistakes may be considered for relief under the MIRF procedure. Correction of rate regression mistakes cannot affect other rates already in normal regression. Two examples of correctable rate regression mistakes are shown below: BILLING CODE 3710&hyph;08&hyph;M E:GRAPHICSEN07NO94.004 BILLING CODE 3710&hyph;08&hyph;C The error in the above example is the underlined rate which is not in proper rate regression for the higher minimum weight. It can be corrected without affecting the regression for the mileage groups. If the carrier intended a different rate, the carrier may seek correction under the MIRF procedure, provided that the intended rate itself falls within normal regression. BILLING CODE 3710&hyph;08&hyph;M E:GRAPHICSEN07NO94.005 BILLING CODE 3710&hyph;08&hyph;C The error in the above example is the underlined rate which is not in proper rate regression for the distance. It can be correct without affecting the regression for the minimum weight groups. Kenneth L. Denton, Army Federal Register Liaison Officer.
