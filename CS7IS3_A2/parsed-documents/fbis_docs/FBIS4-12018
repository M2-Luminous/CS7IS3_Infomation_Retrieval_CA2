The paper, which speaks for the Arab Socialist Ba'th party, says in an article today that the Al Sa'ud family has spent billions of dollars to conspire against nationalist and pan-Arab revolutions in more than one Arab country, following instructions from and through direct coordination with their American masters and allies. The paper adds: In view of their upbringing and the role of imperialism in the establishment of their state and constant support for it, the Al Sa'ud rulers find nothing abnormal in their submissiveness to the West and the United States. Referring to yesterday's address by Sa'ud al-Faysal, the Al Sa'ud family's foreign minister, at the meeting of the foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC], the paper says that this agent, expressing his family's black hatred against Iraq, has deemed it too much for some Gulf states to adopt a stand that is in line with pan-Arab sentiments or to call for lifting the unjust blockade imposed on the people of Iraq. The paper adds: In his address, agent Sa'ud al-Faysal denounces with extreme stupidity Iraq's efforts and contacts aimed at developing a world public opinion in support of its fair cause. The paper explains that this agent minister was so shameless as to accuse Iraq of working to split the unity of the Gulf states against Iraq, which stood like a lofty mountain and whose children offered rivers of blood to defend the Gulf itself. The paper stresses that what Sa'ud al-Faysal said was directly ordered by his American masters. Thus, he is only playing the role of a minor agent echoing the voice of his masters and acting like a lowly follower. The paper says that this stand is a continuation of the Al Sa'ud family's treasonous role which they started in Hafar al-Batin when they made available all requirements of the 30-state aggression against Iraq. The paper stresses that the progress in the stands of some sisterly Arab Gulf states was not a coincidence, but was the outcome of a total conviction of the importance of Iraq and its role in maintaining the Gulf unity and security, and because they have come to realize that the blockade imposed on Iraq has gone beyond all international and legitimate justifications. Concluding its article, AL-THAWRAH says that the aim of the Al Sa'ud family's allegations is to keep the Arab Gulf states under the threat of the imperialist hammer, represented by this family, and to urge the continuation of the blockade, which will inevitably come to an end because of the rising number of good people in the world and the unrelenting steadfastness of the people of Iraq.
