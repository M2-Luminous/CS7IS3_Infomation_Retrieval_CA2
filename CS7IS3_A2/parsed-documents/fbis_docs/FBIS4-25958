At a press conference held today by the Information Office of the State Council, Ye said that the new automobile industry policy especially encourages enterprise annexation and auto parts production. He said that after 40 years' development, China's auto industry had made great achievements. But with the progress of China's drive to reform and open to the world, and the country's fast economic development, the auto industry had been increasingly suffering from a number of defects, he said, adding that the main ones include the decentralized layout of factories, small scale of production, low technological level, and repeated imports of foreign technology. He said that in the coming few years China will restructure the layout of the auto industry, try to establish a number of trans-provincial auto centers with reasonable output capability, through market competition. By the year 2000, some three auto-making giants will be set up, he disclosed. To raise the overall level of China's auto industry, he said, China will pay great attention to the production of auto parts, especially key parts for cars. Foreign businessmen are welcome to cooperate with China in this field, and preferential policies will be provided for auto parts producers. Sources from the Ministry of Machinery Industry said that China has already selected more than 20 key parts for cars to enjoy the government's special support, including preferential policies and policy-oriented loans. China also encourages auto parts enterprises to introduce foreign technology and funds, in a bid to promote their product level and development capability. The auto industry is one of China's industries with the fastest development speed. In the past few years it maintained an annual average increase of over 20 percent. Last year China produced a total of 1.34 million automobiles, and this year's output is predicted to exceed the figure.
