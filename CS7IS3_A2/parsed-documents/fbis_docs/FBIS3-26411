Clinton said in his radio address today that his budget includes spending cuts in 300 programs, the outright elimination of 115 programs and a reduction of more than 100,000 federal workers. Seven of 14 cabinet departments will get less money than in last year's budget, the President said. Clinton is to unveil 1.5 trillion dollars budget Monday while in Houston, Texas. A barrage of budget briefings by top administration officials are also scheduled for Monday in Washington. Clinton used most of the radio address to talk about the need to continue to create jobs for U.S. workers. Clinton said in his first State of the Union address on January 25 that the U.S. private-sector produced 1.6 million jobs, more than the total in the previous four years, but added that many Americans are still looking for work while wage stagnation exists for a lot of employees. The U.S. Labor Department announced Friday that the January jobless rate was 6.7 percent as against 6.4 percent in December, 1993.
