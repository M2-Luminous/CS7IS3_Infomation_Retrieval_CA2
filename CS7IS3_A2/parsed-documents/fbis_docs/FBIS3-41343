The last day of his visit was very important, as the Neighbors Agreement that was signed will increase and strengthen Colombia-Peruvian relations. Both presidents spoke out in favor of the defense of participative democracy in the hemisphere. The presidents visited the [word indistinct] neighborhood, one of the most poverty stricken in this capital. [passage omitted] Subsequently, President Alberto Fujimori visited Congress where he met with Senate President Jorge Ramon Elias, who invited him to sign the book of illustrious guests. [passage indistinct] In the afternoon, the closing ceremony was held at the ministers' council room with the participation of state ministers, congressmen, and businessmen. On this occasion President Cesar Gaviria and President Alberto Fujimori signed the document organizing the Neighbors' Commission and Peruvian-Colombian integration. Immediately after, the joint declaration signed by the presidents was read. The document contains 15 points of which the main ones are: Make official the conversations between the military commands to strengthen both nations' security; stimulate direct investment and the flow of capital; and step up agreements to wipe out drug production, trafficking, and abuse. In the drug struggle, Peru and Colombia will develop specific initiatives with consumer nations. The presidents reiterated their rejection of terrorism and agreed on prompt implementation of bilateral measures to wipe out this scourge. To conclude, during a news conference, President Fujimori added that there will be greater exchange of information with Colombia in the struggle against drugs, the goal of which is to attack top drug traffickers. With regard to trade, he noted there is interest on the part of Colombian businessmen to invest in the Peruvian fishing sector. Here is what President Fujimori said: [Begin Fujimori recording] Obviously, in the drug trafficking activity there are relations between groups who operate in Peru and Colombia. The arrest of the El Vaticano [Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera] is the best evidence of the results of this cooperation. We must continue on this road. Of course, there must be greater exchange of information; there must be extensive reciprocal cooperation in the investigations, in the sharing of experiences in the struggle against terrorism and drug trafficking that each country has gained in these past years. In my opinion, in this manner we could speed up somewhat the results against these social scourges. On this matter, I believe there is a great deal one can learn from past experiences, a great deal. Peru, for example has had specific experiences in its struggle against terrorism; its efficiency has been highly considered worldwide. This is an experience that we will gladly exchange with Colombia's experience where other mechanisms have also been used. [end recording]
