Makhonko (Experimental Meteorology Institute, NPO [scientific production association] ``Tayfun''); received June 9,1993; UDC 614.876:551.510.72] [Abstract] The article presents results of calculation of the dose load of plutonium isotopes and [.sup]242[/]Cm measured at the town of Baryshevka (145 km southeast of the Chernobyl AES and 45 km east of Kiev), Obninsk (107 km southwest of Moscow) and the central part of Moscow. Data for Kiev were not used because observations there only began on May 9. The highest concentration of radioactive products was observed in April and early May 1986. In Baryshevka the radiation dose has shaped by May 1, but in Obninsk and Moscow it kept rising in May and by June 1 it had doubled in Obninsk and tripled in Moscow. The main radiation dose is received by bone surfaces it is approximately four times higher than the dose received via lungs and liver and ten times higher than the dose received by bone marrow. Based on the obtained data the number of people that will develop cancer and the probability of cancer risk in Baryshevka, Obninsk and Moscow were calculated. Also calculated was the effective equivalent radiation dose due to inhalation of the sum of plutonium isotopes and [.sup]242[/]Cm for various population groups in Baryshevka. The calculated doses are approximate estimates from above, i.e. actual effective equivalent doses shall not exceed the calculated values. Figures 2, tables 3, references 6: 5 Russian, 1 Western.
