According to him, Pyongyang's actions "contain a potential of direct threat to Russia's security." This concerns its statements on pulling out from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the IAEA (true, no official documents have been submitted yet) as well as the North Korean specialists' recent "reloading" of their nuclear reactors, which, experts believe, makes their inspection virtually impossible. The minister said yesterday in the State Duma that the emergence of a nuclear state in a "zone of tension," such as the Korean Peninsula, and also in immediate proximity to our borders, directly affects Russian interests. The situation is complicated by the fact that the majority of "threshold" states (i.e., those that are practically ready to produce nuclear weapons) are located close to Russian Federation borders. So far, Andrey Kozyrev said, they do not announce their nuclear status, and it is important that "none of them should openly defy the nonproliferation regime." "A precedent would be impermissible," he stressed. According to the minister, we already have a neighbor comparable in its nuclear-space potential to the "superpowers" (presumably India -- P. Zh.). One of the last resorts to influence North Korea, Kozyrev said, are sanctions, and if "the DPRK goes to the end in withdrawing from the nonproliferation regime, then the international community will simply have nothing left to do" but apply them. Talking about the position of China (which has so far objected to sanctions), the minister noted that the PRC unequivocally favors a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and here "our positions coincide," although "there are nuances about the details." At the same time, Andrey Kozyrev stated, Russia continues to insist on an international conference on the DPRK. Therefore there is no question about an immediate imposition of sanctions so far. Especially considering that, according to Kozyrev, "signs for a hopeful turn of events seem to be emerging." The Russian minister was advised about them by his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher, who was briefed by Jimmy Carter upon the latter's return from the DPRK.
