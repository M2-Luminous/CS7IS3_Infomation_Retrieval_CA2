They also got their instructions from there. What do you think of these confessions? [Al-Mutawakkil] With regard to reports of Yemen's connection with events inside Egypt, we have often pointed out that Yemen will never become a stage for anti-Egyptian activity. We have contacted the Egyptian Government to emphasize this. We are willing to ban the entry of Egyptians or other nationals who have been convicted of such crimes or have any links with them. We are willing to increase coordination with Egypt on this. We have said that we will welcome any Egyptian delegation sent to Yemen to examine reports of the existence of training camps. We will give the Egyptian security services the opportunity to ascertain the facts for themselves. [Musa] Some parties are planning meticulously for these organizations. They enter no country under their real names, something that worries all the concerned security services. In Yemen, they use noms de guerre and are trained inside apartments, not at outdoor camps. [Al-Mutawakkil] Nothing like this has been uncovered. No camps and no such individuals were found. We have coordinated efforts with the Egyptian Interior Ministry and are willing to receive Egyptian security officials. We will examine what information they have and cooperate with them for the good of our two countries. The relevant departments are kept informed of our contracts with Egyptian teachers. We will deport any individuals staying in Yemen as workers if they are accused of anything. [Musa] Suppose the Egyptian security services can prove that some terrorists are still inside Yemen, will they be handed over to Egypt for trial? [Al-Mutawakkil] Extradition of individuals is governed by pertinent agreements. There are no such agreements between our two countries. But we will adopt the necessary measures to prevent our country from becoming a center for such activities. [Musa] Is there no intention of concluding new agreements to govern this issue, which is vital to our countries' stability? [Al-Mutawakkil] I discussed ways of exchanging visits and data with Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi on the sidelines of the Arab interior ministers conference in Tunis last week. The aim is to control the movement of suspect individuals. [Musa] When these individuals arrive from Afghanistan, training is carried out inside apartments in Yemen. What is your comment on these reports? [Al-Mutawakkil] Yes, there were such reports. We asked the Egyptian security authorities to specify where these apartments are and give us information on them in addition to photographs of the individuals suspected of such crimes. Our aim is to coordinate the work of the security forces in our two countries and to be of assistance. [Musa] Yemen has recently been the scene of a series of explosions and assassination attempts carried out by groups of the al-Jihad Organization "The Returnees from Afghanistan." How did the security service identify the culprits and unravel the circumstances of various cases? [Al-Mutawakkil] Our information indicated that the Yemenis, who had travelled to Afghanistan, established an organization known as "al-Jihad." This organization is financed by businessman Usamah Bin-Ladin. Investigations involving the defendants in Aden, Lahij, Hadhramaut, and Sanaa showed that they are responsible for the terrorist operations against the hotels and for the assassination attempts against personalities. The investigations have also proven that the perpetrators do belong to the al-Jihad Organization and receive instructions from one side. We are currently taking the necessary measures to refer them to court. [Musa] How many will be charged? [Al-Mutawakkil] Some 96 terrorists will stand trial. Some 36 are in prison and the other 60 are fugitives. [Musa] Do you intend to amend your laws to confront terrorist crimes, which are alien to your society? [Al-Mutawakkil] I have submitted a draft for a new law to confront terrorism and carrying arms, because Yemeni law allows people to carry arms. This is a serious phenomenon and it's one of the factors behind the wave of violence and terrorism. The Yemeni citizen can carry licensed arms. He can also own arms without a license. [Musa] How many weapons have been seized through your ministry? [Al-Mutawakkil] We can only seize unlicensed weapons when they are found in large quantities. In the most recent case, we seized 100 automatic rifles and machine guns. But personal weapons are allowed by law. [Musa] The Yemeni security service has thwarted several attempts to smuggle weapons. What are the details of these attempts? [Al-Mutawakkil] We have indeed thwarted many attempts to smuggle weapons through coastal borders. We have a good market for arms trade. The arms are being sold publicly. We can only curb this dreadful trade through new laws, which will be issued. We aborted an attempt to unload an arms shipment from a foreign ship heading from the north to the south. [Musa] Your Excellency, we know you are pursuing defendant Usamah Bin-Ladin for his involvement in the terrorist operations in your country. What are the latest developments in his case? [Al-Mutawakkil] We have asked Interpol to hunt down Bin-Ladin and other fugitives and bring them to Yemen on charges of involvement in various explosions. [Musa] Do you have any proof of foreign financing? [Al-Mutawakkil] We are still looking for all the main sources financing terrorism, although all the signs are that Usamah Bin- Ladin is the principal financier. [In a note at the bottom of the report, AL-AHRAM states the following: "Note: A ranking Yemeni source has revealed that the investigation and information confirm that Usamah Bin-Ladin has earmarked huge funds to finance the activities of terrorist trends in some Arab countries, particularly Egypt, Tunis, Algeria, and Yemen. These funds amount to well over .5 billion pounds. He is also allocating between $30,000 and $50,000 for any operation carried out in these countries."]
