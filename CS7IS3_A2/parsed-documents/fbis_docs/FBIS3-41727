Just in the last 8 months 995 persons caught this disease in the capital, at the same time that there were only 424 patients in all of last year. Nor are the statistics of deaths due to this disease encouraging--this year 56 persons died of diphtheria, which is more than double last year's ``record.'' By the way, diphtheria is now ``mowing'' adults primarily. This is associated with a drop in the population's immune defense. The fact is that immunizations against this disease are effective for not more than 10 years. After this time, they must be repeated; otherwise there is no avoiding the disease. However, our people now shy away from this one word ``immunization''--they fear catching something more serious.
