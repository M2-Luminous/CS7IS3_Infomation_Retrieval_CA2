According to Shevardnadze, the president of a great neighboring friendly state is coming to independent Georgia, and anyone who thinks differently is divorced from real politics and real life. "We will not allow anyone to wreck this visit," the Georgian leader stressed. The worried tone of Shevardnadze's statement is understandable -- both the parliamentary and nonparliamentary opposition are taking a negative view of the visit and of Russia in general, primarily owing to Moscow's stance during the Abkhazian war. However, most of Georgia's inhabitants do see Russia as the sole guarantor of a stabilization of the extremely grave economic and political situation within Georgia itself. There is an extremely simple explanation for this rapid metamorphosis in Georgian public thinking: The people have been enraged by poverty and rampant banditry. Hopelessness and lack of confidence in the future are making Joe Public look for a miracle. And Boris Yeltsin must appear as a miracle worker to a Georgian audience. The reason for Yeltsin's visit to Georgia is to sign the long-awaited treaty on friendship and cooperation between the two countries. Georgia has already signed similar treaties with all its closest neighbors. The delay in signing the Russian-Georgian treaty is due primarily to the war in Abkhazia, during which, in Tbilisi's opinion, Russia has espoused an extremely equivocal position by generally backing the separatists. But Shevardnadze and his immediate entourage always tried to attribute this to the fact that a powerful war party was at work within the Russian political establishment. The reference being to the former Supreme Soviet and the former vice president [Rutskoy], who once promised to muster aircraft and bomb Tbilisi. Since they quit the political arena, people here have begun to think that the situation is propitious for Georgia. A key question in the coming Russian-Georgian meeting will undoubtedly be the settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia. And the Georgian side's main irreducible demand is for the refugees, of whom there are over 200,000, to be brought back. In accordance with the talks held in Geneva, the first group of refugees is to return to Abkhazia 10 February. In the main they are residents of the border Galskiy Rayon. Abkhazian leaders have voiced their opinion of Yeltsin's upcoming visit to Tbilisi. Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, one of Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba's closest comrades in arms, said that this visit means that Russia is giving Georgia carte blanche for military revenge. Dzhindzholiya gave assurances that the Russians have given the Georgian Army a large quantity of military hardware, including modern ground-attack aircraft and fighters. In the opinion of the Abkhazians, the delay in deploying Russian Armed Forces under UN auspices in the conflict zone is also an alarming factor. "Abkhazia has never trusted the United Nations, and now Russia too is losing our trust," Dzhindzholiya stressed. The question of Georgia's joining the ruble zone will undoubtedly be broached during the talks in Tbilisi. At any rate the official press and television have long been preparing the public for this step. Strictly speaking, this propaganda softening-up process is directed not so much at ordinary mortals, who amid the soaring inflation of the local coupon have long been prepared for their government to take these steps, but at the political opposition, which sees this as a loss of independence. "Understandably, if it joins the ruble zone Georgia will be unable to implement its own finance and credit policy and will be entirely dependent on the Russian Central Bank. Also understandably, Russia can have no economic grounds for allowing a country with such a ravaged economy as Georgia into its currency zone. So, the idea is purely political and pursues a single objective -- to restore the former empire in one way or another," Revaz Shavishvili, chairman of the Georgian monitoring agency [kontrolnaya palata], said. The shadow of the broken Soviet Union is increasingly alarming Georgian oppositionists. That is precisely the light in which the opposition views the Georgian leader's moves toward rapprochement. The Georgian leader responds to the opposition's attacks with his customary confidence, but not without a dash of populism. Shevardnadze feels fairly confident since former Georgian president Zviad Gamsakhurdia quit the scene once and for all. He is aware that he has the outward support of a population exhausted by economic and political adversities for the policy of close rapprochement with Russia. In response to the countless accusations that he is promoting the revival of the empire in a new form, Shevardnadze said that his policy of rapprochement with Russia is designed to ensure that the empire is never reborn. Only political aesthetes can assess the novelty of these statements in Georgia today and, since they are few and far between, Shevardnadze is simply taken on trust. Meanwhile preparations are well and truly under way in the Georgian capital to receive the eminent visitor. The "Green" party has decided to clear the garbage that has accumulated over several alarming months from the city's central streets. The police are temporarily removing the concrete slabs along the highway from the airport, and real Georgian wines and cognacs are being taken to the state dacha where the Russian president will be staying.
