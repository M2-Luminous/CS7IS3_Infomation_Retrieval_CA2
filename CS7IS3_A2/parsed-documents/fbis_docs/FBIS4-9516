The government described last year as successful. "It was the first time that a growth of labor productivity could be registered--by 3.1 percent--and the foreign currency reserves reached their maximum in the history of our state--$6 billion," Lux emphasized. The government acknowledged the Czech National Bank report on the balance of payments and monetary development for 1993. "The debt of the Czech Republic increased by $1.8 billion to $8.7 billion, 76 percent of which are long-term obligations. Overall, we are creditors, but a great part of our claims is difficult to collect," Lux commented.
