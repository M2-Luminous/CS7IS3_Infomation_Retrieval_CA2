Not Because They Are Innocent, But for the Sake of National Concord"] [Text] The Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] faction has decided to support a draft resolution on amnesty which is to be discussed in today's session of the Duma. As PRES leaders noted at a faction conference, this draft envisions in particular amnesty for convicts and defendants under article 79 of the Penal Code -- "organization of mass disturbances," and if it is adopted, the ringleaders of the October rebellion will be set free. "But our faction will vote in favor, explaining that this is not recognition of their innocence but an act of national conciliation, and we say that after leaving prison, the organizers of the October disorders must not start everything all over again," Sergey Shakhray said. True, the PRES leader admitted that there are no guarantees that when Rutskoy and Khasbulatov are released, unrest will not begin again. Moreover, Shakhray said that this course of events is "very, very likely." His faction colleague Sergey Stankevich recalled that convicted under Article 79 were also those who organized riots in penal colonies or took hostages, outlining in this connection the "nice" prospects for Russia in the event that such "a humane action of total amnesty is undertaken." Yet the doubts of Sergey Shakhray's comrades were dispelled by his "right-hand man," Konstantin Zatulin, who said, "If we do not support the draft, we shall be accused of being enemies of the people, seeking to keep Khasbulatov and Rutskoy in prison forever...." Furthermore Mr. Zatulin, saying that "part of the blame" for the October riots lies on the executive branch, assured that the ex-speaker and the ex-vice president "must not be amnestied but completely rehabilitated in their rights, based on investigation results." Therefore that part of the PRES representing Konstantin Zatulin's followers will apparently support the Communist Party, the Agrarian Party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and the Yavlinskiy bloc, which are planning to set up "a deputies commission to investigate the 3-4 October events," which issue will also be discussed in the Duma today. To "emphasize the faction's commitment to the principles of national conciliation" the PRES members agreed on voting day to circulate a corresponding "clarification document" in the Duma." "Maybe Baburin and others will vote in favor simply because they want to see Khasbulatov and Rutskoy at large, but we shall vote for this for other motives," Sergey Stankevich summed up the PRES' position.
