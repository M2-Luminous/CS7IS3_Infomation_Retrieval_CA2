Meeting with visiting Australian Governor-General Bill Hayden at the state guesthouse here this afternoon, Jiang said since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1972, bilateral relations have developed in an all-round way. As two big influential countries in the Asian and Pacific region, the Chinese president said, China and Australia are shouldering important responsibilities for safeguarding regional security and stability and promoting regional economic cooperation and prosperity. "We should set our eyes on the whole world and the 21st century, not just on the two countries," he stressed. He said the future of the world is bright, as countries with different social systems can live in peace and harmony as long as they handle state-to-state relations on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence. He said that the bilateral trade and economic cooperation between China and Australia hold out broad prospects. Last year, he said, the volume of trade between the two countries hit an all-time high and Australia is one of the countries with the largest share of investment in China. Hayden expressed his appreciation of the remarkable achievements that China has made in the economic field. He said these achievements have brought about benefits to the ordinary Chinese people. Hayden said that over the past few years, Australia-China relations had grown smoothly and high-ranking officials of the two countries exchanged visits frequently. The development of bilateral friendly ties and cooperation conforms to the interests of the two countries, he said. Prior to their talks, Jiang presided over a welcoming ceremony for Hayden and Mrs. Hayden and their party in front of the Great Hall of the People.
