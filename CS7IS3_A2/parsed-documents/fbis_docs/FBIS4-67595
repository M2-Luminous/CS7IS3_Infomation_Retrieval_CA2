The SPD's government program quite intentionally focuses on work, social security, and economics. Why is it that you allow the ecological component to be shortchanged? Lafontaine: Ecological modernization is a pivotal reform project as far as we are concerned. Work, social security, and ecological renewal are not contradictions by any means. We wish to combine work and the ecology and make it clear that ecological renewal will result in more jobs and that it is a social task our society must deal with, because intolerable ecological conditions cannot be permitted to exist from a social point of view. Loelhoeffel: But the Greens and the environmental groups are saying that the draft program does not contain very much solid language aside from some general declarations of intent. They doubt that the SPD is serious about new initiatives on the environment. There even are critical voices from inside the SPD itself. Lafontaine: From the point of view of the Greens I can understand that criticism. They are a political party in competition with us and they would like to cast doubt on our credibility on ecological issues. What is more, they do not want to come out as they did in the last Bundestag election when they failed to gain any seats. By now the voters have a very good idea of where the SPD stands on environmental issues. We already stated in the last Bundestag election campaign that an SPD government would take decisive steps aimed at ecological renewal which would be markedly different from the practices of the Kohl government. One of the central projects still is an ecological tax reform. Loelhoeffel: The draft program merely refers in general terms to an energy tax, however. Michael Mueller, the spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group, and others deplore the lack of a clear statement on higher mineral oil taxes for example. One cannot leave the transportation sector out of the equation. After all, it accounts for about 25 percent of energy consumption. Lafontaine: Unfortunately both the public and large segments of the political parties still do not understand what ecological tax reform is all about. It is not designed to provide funds for this or that project; it is not a way of making people pay more taxes but a way of setting new price signals. The principal idea behind this reform is to place less of a load on work and to raise taxes on the consumption of energy and materials harmful to the environment. This will create incentives to use less energy and to put new products on the market which conform to environmental standards. Those who do the right thing by the environment will be rewarded. Employees will have more money in their pockets because income taxes or other payroll deductions imposed by law will be cut. Loelhoeffel: Why put the blame on the public rather than admit weak points in selling the program? Lafontaine: I have seen 100 headlines which read "fuel taxes to rise." But I have not seen a single headline referring to the ecological tax reform which said "deep income tax cuts" or "cuts in payroll deductions." Not a one. The media almost always focus on the seemingly negative aspects, and those that are positive are suppressed. And that does harm to this important reform project. Loelhoeffel: But it is difficult to understand your project, if one cannot gauge its consequences. Lafontaine: The consequences are that there is less strain on the environment and that the working population is relieved of unnecessary burdens--and that creates more jobs. Employees get to keep more of what they earn and can decide on their own what they wish to spend and consume. That needs to be understood because we need to obtain the approval of the public for this ecological tax reform. Better environmental policy can only succeed and the proposed lessening of the strain on the environment can only be achieved if the majority of the voters is for it. Unfortunately a good many environmentalists fail to see the connection. Those who would like to see the price of one liter of gasoline raised to 5 marks [DM] may salve their conscience. They may even gain the support of a number of delegates to a party congress. But they make it impossible to win a majority of the voters over to their position. Loelhoeffel: Just the same, we would like to hear some real numbers. Who will have to pay how much when? Lafontaine: It would be both irresponsible and unwise from the point of view of economics to decide on scope and timing without taking the economic situation into account. For instance, the decisions reached would depend on whether the automobile industry were doing well or doing poorly. Many other factors would also play a role. That applies to all decisions which have economic and social consequences. Loelhoeffel: What other factors contribute to the SPD's credibility with regard to environmental protection? Lafontaine: The second important point in addition to ecological tax reform is that we believe the production of electric power from nuclear reactors is untenable and therefore wish gradually to relinquish that option. In talks I have had with the environmental groups I got the feeling that this particular demand for which many protest demonstrations were held over the years has been all but checked off because it has long since been included in all the wish lists. Real progress in the nuclear energy field alone provides an ecological justification for a change of government in Bonn. The third point I would like to mention is the restructuring of research policy which needs to be focused on the environment. We have to build a bridge into the solar age, i.e. all technologies which conserve energy, lessen the strain on the environment, and develop renewable forms of energy, including the use of solar and wind energy, must be supported in entirely different ways from now on. Loelhoeffel: The current version of the SPD government program puts the ecological tax reform off to the time "European Union [EU]-wide regulations" have been adopted. That sounds like procrastinating a solution and shifting responsibilities. What is it that the SPD can and will push through? Lafontaine: We have a first draft in hand. It goes without saying that we will not wait until every EU country has understood the need for ecological tax reforms. I am in full agreement with Rudolf Scharping on that point. Let me remind you of the debate on the catalytic converter and lead-free gasoline. If we had waited then until all the EC countries availed themselves of that technology, it would have been introduced on a Europewide scale at a much later date. We took the lead and the result was that the technology spread all over Europe. As a consequence, new jobs were created here in Germany as well. Loelhoeffel: Is there a need to change, clarify or augment other passages of the ecology segment of the present draft? Do you yourself think more forceful language is needed? Lafontaine: There is a debate on speed limits. The present draft states that we must have speed limits that are ecologically suitable and contextually meaningful. There is a specific reference to the need for a 30-kilometer speed limit in residential areas. Independent of the debate on speed limits as such our principal aim is to make progress on the introduction of new environmental technologies. The most important item on the agenda are automobiles that conserve gas by using two to three liters per 100 kilometers. Loelhoeffel: Are you giving any thought to dictating fuel consumption limits to the automobile industry? Or how else do you propose to bring about the development of more efficient and ecologically friendly engines? Lafontaine: I am opposed to more regulations, and that goes for the ecology as well. The main thing is to cut down on energy consumption. That, after all, is the political goal. The political establishment should exercise restraint with regard to setting exact technical standards on specific environmental targets. That should be left to the technicians and to competition. That is why I am in favor of restricting ourselves to achieving the goal of lower consumption. And that is where the price signal comes in which we are putting up with the ecological tax reform.
