Its anxiety was not allayed even by the minister's reassuring interview on Ostankino TV. The right is triumphant: Didn't we warn you about Russia's true face? The papers are filled with near-panic headlines and politicians are trading claims about "Russian imperialism" and "Russian expansionism." An official Lithuanian Foreign Ministry statement expressed Lithuania's rejection of the "near neighbours" concept and concern at what it regards as unwarranted accusations of violations of human rights and of the rights of ethnic minorities in the Baltic countries (what has Lithuania done?) and Russia's reluctance to abandon the practice of exerting military pressure on these countries. [passage omitted] The anti-Russian mood has increased with the adoption of a steely tone by Moscow diplomats concerned about the future of the Russian-speaking population. Unfortunately, often it is the local Russians who come off worst because Moscow only mentions them when addressing lofty diplomatic matters. [Mlechin report] The most unfortunate thing for Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is not the fact that his speech at the conference of ambassadors in the republics of the former USSR was not interpreted in the way he would have liked. It is the fact that no one actually doubted that the Russian minister was now capable of threatening neighboring states. Two years or even one year ago diplomats would have decided that there had been some kind of mistake and would have sought clarification. But this time they believed it. The political complexion of the Baltic politicians is well known: Most of them are their own people, who have no love for Russia and expect nothing good to come out of it. At the same time they dream of getting rid of the hundreds of thousands of Russians who have ended up in the Baltic area in one way or another since 1940. They are just waiting for an excuse to shout: "Save us from Moscow!" If the new tough-talking approach by Russian diplomacy is a calculated step, how does Russia benefit? Does it frighten the Baltric countries? That is not difficult. But why try to frighten them? In the hope of making them more amenable? Of changing the policy vis-a-vis the Russian minority? Of keeping Russian forces and bases on their territory? Of making them abandon the idea of joining NATO? It is easier to achieve the opposite. "If Kozyrev is switching to a policy of threats, then the only salvation from that kind of Russia is behind NATO bayonets" -- that was the conclusion in Riga, Vilnius, and Tallinn, and possibly in other capitals as well. How will this conclusion affect the position of Russians in the Baltic republics? Any indiscreet word by Moscow is interpreted as a direct threat, and hostility toward the Russian minority increases. Andrey Kozyrev was better placed than anyone else to foresee this reaction. Once former Vice President Rutskoy and other state-control dinosaurs [supergosudarstvenniki] were calling for strong pressure to be brought to bear on those republics where the Russian minority does not feel comfortable. At the time Kozyrev said: The position of the Russian minority can only be improved by getting on with the states in which Russians live. You will not improve their lives by threats and force, let alone military force. Russians in the Baltic countries can do without being feared and hated. Has Minister Kozyrev changed his tune? Why? Has the reality of diplomatic practice scuttled his idealism? Or is the minister caught up in domestic political games now that he is a deputy as well? I asked the minister whether he himself felt that he was gravitating more toward domestic politics? The minister totally rejected this suggestion. But there is already talk of "early Kozyrev" and "late Kozyrev," with less and less in common between them. Even the minister's vocabulary has changed, and he now insists that he was the first to say that all the neighboring foreign countries are a sphere of Russian interests. Of course, on the one hand, only inveterate dogmatists never change. On the other hand, U-turns in politics are called a change of course. If Minister Kozyrev thinks that in this way he will be able to satisfy those who have not acknowledged the disintegration of the USSR and the transformation of the union republics into autonomous states, he is profoundly mistaken. As far as those forces and parties are concerned, he has still betrayed national interests. The point is not that, by abandoning the "early Kozyrev" principle, the minister risks losing the sympathies of those who have always supported him. Presidential support is sufficient for the minister to keep his post. The problem is that the Baltic countries and East and Central Europe are becoming a zone of anti-Russian activity. And it is the task of diplomats not to cause friction between the country and its neighbors, but to make them friends. The "early Kozyrev" managed this.
