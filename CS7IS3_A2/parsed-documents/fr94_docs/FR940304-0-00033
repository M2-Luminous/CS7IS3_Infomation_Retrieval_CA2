ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule implements certain provisions of section 1842(p) of the Social Security Act regarding diagnosis codes on physician bills. Under this final rule, each bill or request for payment for a service furnished by a physician under Medicare Part B must include appropriate diagnostic coding for the diagnosis or the symptoms of the illness or injury for which the Medicare beneficiary received care. DATES: Effective date: This final rule is effective April 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Pat Brooks, R.R.A. (410) 966&hyph;5318. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Medical services are furnished to Medicare beneficiaries by providers, suppliers, physicians, and other specified practitioners. Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act) defines the term physician. Under section 1861(r) of the Act, the term physician, subject to limitations concerning the scope of practice by each State and other provisions of title XVIII of the Act, means a doctor of_(1) Medicine or osteopathy; (2) Dental surgery or dental medicine; (3) Podiatry; (4) Optometry; or (5) Chiropractic. Under provisions of section 1848(g)(4) of the Act, as added by section 6102(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;239), effective for services furnished on or after September 1, 1990, each physician must submit a standard claim form (HCFA&hyph;1500) directly to the Medicare carrier on behalf of the beneficiary, regardless of whether the physician provided the services on an assignment-related basis. (Under Medicare Part B, a physician may bill the patient directly for the physician's services, thus requiring the beneficiary to seek reimbursement from Medicare. Alternatively, under section 1842(b)(3)(B) of the Act, when a physician furnishes services on an assignment-related basis, the physician bills Medicare directly in exchange for the physician's agreement to accept the Medicare approved amount as payment in full. (Rules concerning assignment of claims are found at §§424.55, 424.56 and 424.70 et seq. ) The HCFA&hyph;1500, which is also used by most third-party payers, including Medicaid and other Federal government health insurance programs, is, in effect, an itemized bill. Before September 1, 1990, if a physician was not paid directly by Medicare for physician services, the physician either billed the Medicare beneficiary directly or billed another third-party payer. The beneficiary then sought payment from Medicare for expenses incurred in obtaining covered physician's services by submitting a Patient's Request for Medicare Payment (HCFA&hyph;1490 S) to the carrier. This form directs the beneficiary to attach itemized bills from his or her physician to the form. In limited cases, as provided under section 1842(b)(6)(B) of the Act and 42 CFR part 424 when a third party made payment to the physician, the third party sought reimbursement from Medicare for this payment by submitting a Request for Medicare Payment by Organizations which Qualify to Receive Payment for Paid Bills (HCFA&hyph;1490 U). We required the physician to fill out Part II of this form, which was similar to an itemized bill. Previously, each bill or request for payment for physician services furnished to a Medicare beneficiary had to include, among other information, a narrative description of the diagnosis or the nature of the illness or injury for which the beneficiary received care. Although prior to April 1, 1989 there was no requirement for diagnostic coding (that is, a description of the diagnosis or the nature of the illness or injury in a numeric code), many physicians routinely provided this information. In addition, all physicians provided a narrative description of procedures, medical services, and supplies that were furnished to a beneficiary. II. Legislation Requiring Diagnostic Coding Section 202(g) of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;360), enacted July 1, 1988, added paragraph (p) to section 1842 of the Act. Under the provisions of section 1842(p)(1) of the Act, each bill or request for payment for physician services under Medicare Part B must include the appropriate diagnostic code ``as established by the Secretary'' for each item or service for which the Medicare beneficiary received treatment.
