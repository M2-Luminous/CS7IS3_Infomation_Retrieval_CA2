FR940317-1-00096 FR940317-1-00013 (1) Reconsideration. An original approval or settlement authority may reconsider the denial of or final offer on a claim under the FTCA upon request of the claimant, the claimant's authorized agent, or the claimant's legal representative. (2) Settlement correction. An original approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct his or her action on a claim that was previously settled in whole or in part (even where a settlement agreement has been executed) when an error contrary to the mutual understanding of the parties is discovered in the original action (e.g., a claim is settled for $15,000 but the settlement agreement was typed to read $1500 and the error is not discovered until the file is being prepared for payment). If appropriate, a corrected payment will be made. The approval or settlement authority will reopen his or her action on a claim when he or she has reason to believe that a settlement was obtained by means of fraud by the claimant (or claimant's authorized agent or legal representative) and, if substantiated, will correct his or her action. The basis for any correction of an action will be stated in a memorandum which will be included in the file. (b) A successor approval or settlement authority. (1) Reconsideration. A successor approval or settlement authority may reconsider the denial of or final offer in a claim under the FTCA upon request of the claimant, the claimant's authorized agent, or the claimant's legal representative, only on the basis of fraud, substantial new evidence, errors in calculation or mistake (misinterpretation) of law. (2) Settlement correction. A successor approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct a predecessor's action on a claim which was previously settled in whole or in part for the same reasons as an original authority, as stated above. (c) All requests for reconsideration of a denial or final offer by a command claims service or area claims office in which full relief is not granted will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS for action, with any additional investigative material and legal analysis generated by the request. (d) A request for reconsideration should indicate fully the legal or factual basis asserted as grounds for relief. Following completion of any investigation or other action deemed necessary for an informed disposition of the request, the approval or settlement authority will reconsider the claim and attempt to settle it by granting such relief as may appear warranted. When further settlement efforts appear unwarranted, the entire file with a memorandum of opinion will be referred through claims channels as outlined in §536.31. If a higher claims authority is unable to grant the relief requested, he or she will forward the claim with the recommendation to the Commander, USARCS, and inform the claimant of such reference. (e) A request for reconsideration must be filed prior to the commencement of suit and prior to the expiration of the 6-month period provided in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b). Upon timely filing, the appropriate authority will have 6 months from the date of filing in which to make a final disposition of the request, and the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) will not accrue until 6 months after the filing of the request. The action on the request will be effected as set forth in §536.77(i). (f) Action upon a request for reconsideration by the appropriate authority (either affirming the prior action or granting full or partial relief) constitutes final administrative disposition of a claim. No further requests for reconsideration will be allowed except on the basis of fraud. Attempted further requests for reconsideration on other grounds will not toll the 6-month period provided in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b).
