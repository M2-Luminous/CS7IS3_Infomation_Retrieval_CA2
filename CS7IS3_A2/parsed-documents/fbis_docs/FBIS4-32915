The reason for increasing the purchase operation is that Argentina is interested in having inexpensive spare parts. If Argentina purchased spare parts on the international market, they would be more costly. This has been confirmed by Defense Ministry sources who reported the existence of a letter Defense Minister Oscar Camilion sent to U.S. Ambassador James Cheek. [passage omitted]
