Jeffrey Garten, U.S. under secretary of commerce, who represents the U.S. Government, wants to meet with top executives of major auto manufacturers like Toyota Motor Corporation while in Japan, in order to talk directly with the industry on the question of buying U.S.-made parts--the question on which government-level talks are making no headway. The Japanese Government, on the other hand, wants to reaffirm its position of not adopting any plans on procuring U.S.-made parts for 1995 and thereafter. Meanwhile, in the area of construction, while the deadline for the U.S. Government deciding whether to retaliate against Japan or not is drawing near to 20 January, informal working-level talks have started in Tokyo, and the Japanese Government will make final efforts to prevent eventual retaliation. Under Secretary Garten will meet with Japanese Government officials like Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice minister for international trade and industry, in the formal talks, but has also asked to meet with people like Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor, and Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda Motor Company. He claims the primary purpose of the meeting is to hear auto industry views, but it is possible he will personally ask the industry to expand the purchase of U.S.-made products. Specifically, the United States is hopeful that Japan's plan of buying "about $19 billion in 1994" will be continued into 1995 and thereafter. On the contrary, the Japanese Government is poised to reject continued setting of such a purchase plan in the vice ministerial-level meeting. Even on the question of setting objective criteria as a way of measuring the extent of market liberalization, the government will persist in the position: "Criteria that can lead to agreeing on targets cannot be accepted" (to quote an official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry). In fact, Under Secretary of State Spero, who is one of the U.S. officials in charge of the framework talks, arrived before Under Secretary of Commerce Garten; and during her 10-12 January stay, is due to meet with people from political and business circles like Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan [Keidanren], as well as Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hatoyama. In the meetings, she is expected to urge facilitation of the framework talks, while calling for prompt action to stimulate the economy. Some people interpret this position of U.S. officials wanting to deal directly with Japanese industry, as a "revelation of mistrust in Japanese bureaucrats," and government offices like the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance are becoming alarmed. One goal in the economic framework talks is to enable the Japan-U.S. summit--to be held in Washington on 11 February--to announce an agreement on the three top priority areas of automobiles and auto parts, insurance, and government procurements. Both the Japanese and U.S. Governments agree that "by all means, we must come to a successful conclusion" (to quote an official of the Foreign Ministry), but, so far, not much progress has been made even though only one month is left before the summit.
