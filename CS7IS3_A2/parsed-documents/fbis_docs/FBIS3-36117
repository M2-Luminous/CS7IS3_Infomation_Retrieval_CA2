The premier was pleased to note that Estonia made a breakthrough at the forum. "Estonia was all the time spoken about as a real partner," he said. Laar said at a press conference today that economies in transition became the focus of attention at the Davos forum. "The participants arrived at the conclusion that the transition of many states from a planned economy to a market economy makes also developed countries undergo major changes," he claimed. The premier said the forum attached great importance to free trade and opening of borders as the best ways to develop world economy. "The protectionist attitude is considered the greatest danger to world economy," he noted. Laar said a high-level Russian delegation arrived in Davos to convince Western businessmen and politicians that economic reforms continue in Russia. "I gathered they didn't succeed very well in this," he said. The Estonian premier had several bilateral and three-way meetings in Davos. He was pleasantly surprised by the Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasir 'Arafat's high regard for Estonia. Laar met in Davos with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. The two agreed in principle to conclude as soon as possible a free-trade agreement between the two countries. The Estonian premier met also with his Swedish and Finnish counterparts, Carl Bildt and Esko Aho. Laar said he and Bildt had a thorough discussion of the situation in Paldiski. "Sweden is prepared to assist Estonia in cleaning up the environment in that town," he said.
