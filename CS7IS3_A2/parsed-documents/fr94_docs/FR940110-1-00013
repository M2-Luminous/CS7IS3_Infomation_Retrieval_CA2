FR940110-1-00013 FR940110-1-00001 (f) The level of cost-share assistance as provided in §701.110, in effect for practices in all years of a long-term agreement shall be the level in effect at the beginning year of the agreement. The rate of cost-share assistance for payment purposes for such practice shall be based on the average cost of performing the practice at the time the practice is performed. (g) A long-term agreement may be canceled for failure to fully comply with the terms of the agreement if, after consulting with the Soil Conservation District or comparable district board or if none exists with a representative of the SCS, the State or COC determines that the seriousness of the irregularities warrant such action. If the agreement is canceled, the parties to the agreement are jointly and severally responsible for refunding all cost shares paid and will forfeit all rights to further payments under the agreement. In such a case, no other refund or forfeiture provisions of these regulations apply. (h) A long-term agreement may be revised according to instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator by mutual agreement between the parties to the agreement and the COC based on approved changes in the CPO's for the farm or ranch. (i) An otherwise eligible person who acquires control of land under an approved agreement may elect to become a successor in interest under such agreement. (j) An agreement will be terminated with respect to land for which loss of control has occurred and where the person acquiring control of such land elects not to become a successor in interest under the agreement. If the loss of control is for reasons beyond the control of the parties to the agreement, the COC will determine whether any cost-share assistance previously paid shall be refunded; however, in no event shall the refund be greater than would be required in cases where loss of control is voluntary. If the loss of control is voluntary on the part of the signatories to the agreement, the signatories will be jointly and severally responsible for refunding all cost shares paid and will forfeit all rights to further payments, with respect to the land for which control is lost. However, a refund will not be required for cost shares where the COC or the STC determine, after consulting with a representative of the SCS, that failure to perform the remaining practices in the agreement will not impair the effectiveness of the practices which have been performed and that the completed practices have provided conservation benefits consistent with the cost shares which have been paid. (k) An agreement may be terminated by the COC, after considering the recommendation of the Soil Conservation District or comparable district board or if none exists with a representative of the SCS if such action is in the public interest. The COC will determine the amount of cost shares previously paid that shall be refunded. (l) An agreement may be terminated by the COC upon the written request of the participant to a long-term agreement where no cost-share assistance has been paid for any of the scheduled practices and where the participant does not intend to perform any of the scheduled practices. §701.114 Replacement, enlargement, or restoration. The establishment or installation of a practice, for the purposes of the program shall be deemed to include the replacement, enlargement, or restoration of a practice for which cost-share assistance has been allowed if the practice has served its normal lifespan or if all of the following conditions exist: (a) Replacement, enlargement, or restoration of the practice is needed to solve the related conservation or environmental problem. (b) The failure of the original practice was not due to the lack of proper maintenance by the current operator. (c) The COC believes that the replacement, enlargement, or restoration of the practice merits consideration to an equal extent with other practices. (d) The replacement, enlargement, or restoration of the practice is not being performed because the producer has increased his operation to where these measures are needed to solve the increased conservation or environmental problem. §701.115 Pooling agreements. Eligible persons in any local area may agree in writing with the approval of the COC to perform designated practices which will solve a mutual conservation, pollution, or other environmental problem on the land of the participants. For purposes of eligibility for cost-share assistance, practices carried out under such an approved written agreement shall be regarded as having been carried out on the land of the persons who performed the practices. §701.116 Special provisions for low-income farmers and ranchers. (a) Except as otherwise provided in §701.110(c), the COC may approve in the case of low-income farmers and ranchers as defined in this section a level of cost-share assistance of up to eighty (80) percent of the average cost of performing practices. (b) A low-income farmer or rancher is one who as determined by the COC is a small producer whose livelihood is largely dependent on the farm or ranch and whose prospective income and financial resources for the current year are such that the low-income farmer or rancher could not reasonably be expected to perform needed conservation practices at levels of cost-share assistance applicable to other persons in the county. §701.117 Maximum cost-share assistance limitation. For each program year, the total amount which may be received by any person under this subpart for approved practices shall not exceed $3,500 except that: (a) The total amount received for approved practices, including those carried out under pooling agreements, shall not exceed $10,000; and (b) The total amount received under an ACP long-term agreement (LTA) shall not exceed the annual payment limitation ($3,500) multiplied by the number of years remaining in the LTA. The payment limitation in effect after the first year of LTA or after an LTA payment has been made shall be equal to the lessor of the following: (1) The number of years remaining in the LTA times the annual payment limitation; or
