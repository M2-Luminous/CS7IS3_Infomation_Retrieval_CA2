The Liberal Democratic Party [LDS], the Democratic Party, the Greens-Ecologically Social Party, and the Socialist Party are thus supposed to form the new LDS--the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia. The new party, which, after unification, will possess 30 seats in parliament, which is one-third of all deputies, will continue to be led by Dr. Janez Drnovsek. He particularly emphasized the importance of continued cooperation with the Christian Democrats this morning. We have reports by Bojan Veselinovic, Sandi Frelih, and Gojko Brvar from the separate party congresses in Bled this morning: [Begin recording] [Veselinovic] The morning congress of the Liberal Democrats was opened by party president Dr. Janez Drnovsek, who said that foreign countries are following the events in our country with interest and added that the reputation of the present LDS is growing gradually but steadily. Faced with the choice of whether to continue building on teh party's autonomy and risk another showdown with the newly emerged party or to link itself with the Eco-Greens, the Socialists, and the Democrats, we have decided in favor of unification, Drnovsek said. Unification, he said, does not mean a change in the composition of the present coalition. Drnovsek particularly stressed the need for the new LDS to cooperate with the Christian Democrats to ensure the stability of the political scene. Relations will be good with the two remaining government parties until program differences occur, Drnovsek said. The afternoon unification congress is supposed to elect: Drnovsek as the president of the new LDS, [Dimitrij] Rupel as the president [as heard]; 60 members of the party council, which will be formed proportionally on the basis of the results of the last general elections; [Igor] Bavcar, [Vika] Potocnik, [Viktor] Zakelj, and [Peter] Tancig for vice presidents; and [Gregor] Golobic as secretary general. They will subsequently agree as to who will coordinate the work of the clubs of deputies of the three merging parties in the parliament. The afternoon congress is also supposed to decide about the amendment to the proposed documents, with which, bearing in mind various material situations in the merging parties, secretaries general of these parties would guarantee with their personal assets the settlement of any possible party debts. Let us also report that the new LDS will have 30 seats in parliament, which is two seats less than it would have had if the current Democratic deputies [Tone] Persak and [Danica] Simsic were have supported unification.
