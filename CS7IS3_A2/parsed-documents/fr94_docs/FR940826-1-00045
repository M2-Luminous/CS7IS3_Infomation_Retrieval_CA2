FR940826-1-00045 FR940826-1-00008 The percentages calculated above, and HCFA's determination of what is substantial is explained below. If a facility had 200 patients and all the patients dialyzed twice a week, then the facility would be losing 200 billable treatments a week or 33.3 percent. This calculation is as follows: 200 patients×3 times a week=600 treatments a week; 200 patients×2 times a week=400 treatments a week; Lost treatments=200 treatments a week. Lost treatments total treatments=percentage of lost treatments (200 600=33.3 percent). To arrive at a reasonable determination of substantial, we concluded that slightly less than half a facility's treatments would have to be furnished to patients who dialyze less frequently than three times a week. This calculation is as follows: 200 patients×3 times a week=600 treatments a week; 100 patients×2 times a week=200 treatments a week; 100 patients×3 times a week=300 treatments a week; Total treatments furnished=500 treatments a week. Lost treatments=100 treatments (100 600=16.67 percent). We propose to require that, in order to document that it furnishes a substantial number of dialysis treatments at a frequency less than three times per week, a facility submit the following information. The facility must submit a list of patients who received outpatient dialysis treatments for the latest historical cost report that is being filed with the request. The list must indicate_ •Whether the patients are permanent, transient or temporary; •The medically prescribed frequency of dialysis; and •The number of dialysis treatments that each patient received on a weekly and yearly basis and an explanation of any discrepancy between that calculation and the number of treatments reported on the facility's cost report. The facility must also submit a list of patients used to project treatments. The list must indicate_ •Whether the patients are permanent, transient or temporary; •The medically prescribed frequency of dialysis; •The number of dialysis treatments that each patient is projected to receive on a weekly and yearly basis, an explanation of any discrepancy between that calculation and the number of treatments reported on the facility's projected cost report, and an explanation for any change between prior actual and projected data. In order for HCFA to determine if the facility meets the 15 percent requirement discussed above, the following information must be submitted: •A schedule showing the number of treatments to be furnished twice a week and the number of treatments that would have been furnished if each beneficiary were dialyzed three times a week, including a computation of the facility's projected cost per treatment using projected treatments based on the twice a week calculation and the three times a week calculation. •A schedule showing the computation of the percentage decrease in the number of treatments, which must be at least 15 percent to be deemed substantial for approval of an exception. Section 413.194␣Appeals Existing §413.170(h) would be redesignated as §413.194. In new §413.194, in addition to coding and editorial changes, we would make clear that exhaustion of administrative remedies is a prerequisite for judicial review. Section 413.196␣Notification of Changes in Rate-Setting Methodologies and Payment Rates Existing §413.170(i) would be redesignated as §413.196 with only coding and editorial changes. Section 413.198␣Recordkeeping and Cost Reporting Requirements for Outpatient Maintenance Dialysis Existing §413.174 would be redesignated as §413.198. Section 413.200␣Payment of Independent Organ Procurement Organizations and Histocompatibility Laboratories Existing §413.178 would be redesignated as §413.200. In new §413.200(b), we would revise the definition of ``Freestanding.'' We would provide that an organ procurement organization (OPO) or a histocompatibility laboratory is freestanding unless it_
