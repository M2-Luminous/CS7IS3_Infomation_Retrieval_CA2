FR940404-2-00127 FR940404-2-00084 14. In the future, PLACA and PMLIC each may assess a transfer charge under the Contracts. For instance, prior to the maturity date, a $25 charge under the Contracts may be assessed for the thirteenth and each subsequent transfer request made by the Contract owner during a single Contract year. Applicants represent that the transfer charge, if assessed, will be deducted in reliance upon Rule 26a&hyph;1 of the 1940 Act, and that such charge represents reimbursement for administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life of the Contract. 15. A contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') of up to 6% of the amount withdrawn is assessed on certain full surrenders or partial withdrawals of Contract account value during the first six Contract years. The CDSC is designed to cover expenses relating to the sales of the Contracts, including commissions to registered representatives and other promotional expenses. The aggregate CDSCs are guaranteed never to exceed 8.5% of the premium payments. During the first Contract year, any amounts surrendered or withdrawn are subject to the CDSC. After the first Contract year, the portion of the first and second withdrawals in a Contract year equal to 10% or less of the Contract account value as of the beginning of the Contract year is not subject to the sales charge. 16. Neither PLACA nor PMLIC anticipates that the CDSCs will generate sufficient revenues to pay the cost of distributing the Contracts. If these charges are insufficient to cover PLACA's or PMLIC's expenses, the deficiency will be met from each company's general account assets, which may include amounts derived from the charge for mortality and expense risks discussed below. 17. PLACA will deduct the aggregate premium taxes paid on behalf of a particular Contract either: (i) From premiums as they are received; or (ii) From the Contract proceeds upon (A) a withdrawal from or full surrender of a Contract, or (B) application of the proceeds to a payment option. Premium taxes currently range up to 3.5%. For Contracts issued by PMLIC to Maine residents, an aggregate premium tax of 2% of premiums paid will be deducted from Contract proceeds upon (i) a withdrawal from or full surrender of a Contract, or (ii) Application of the proceeds to a payment option. For Contracts issued by PMLIC to New York residents, any premium tax assessed will be 2% of any amounts surrendered, withdrawn, paid as a death benefit, or applied to a payment option. 18. PLACA and PMLIC each assess a daily charge to compensate it for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts. This charge is equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets in the Account, and applies only prior to and on the maturity date. Of that amount, approximately 0.70% is attributable to mortality risk, and approximately 0.55% is attributable to expense risk. PLACA and PMLIC each guarantee that the mortality and expense risk charge will never exceed 1.25%. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover PLACA's or PMLIC's actual costs and assumed risks, the loss will fall on PLACA and PMLIC. Conversely, if the charge is more than sufficient to cover costs, any excess will be profit to either PLACA or PMLIC. PLACA and PMLIC each currently anticipate a profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. 19. The mortality risks borne by PLACA and PMLIC arise from their respective contractual obligations to make annuity payments (determined in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the Contract), regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual annuitant may live. This undertaking assures that neither an annuitant's own longevity, nor an improvement in general life expectancy, will adversely affect the monthly annuity payments that the payee will receive under the Contract. PLACA and PMLIC each assume the risk that its actual administrative costs will exceed the amount recovered through the Contract administrative charges. 20. PLACA and PMLIC each also incur a risk in connection with the death benefit guarantee. There is no extra charge for this guarantee. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) thereof to the extent necessary to permit the assessment of a daily charge for mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. 2. Applicants represent that the terms of the class relief requested with respect to any future Contracts funded by the PLACA Account, by the PMLIC Account, or other separate accounts established by PLACA or PMLIC are consistent with the standards enumerated in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Without the requested relief, PLACA and PMLIC each would have to request and obtain exemptive relief for each new separate account it establishes to fund any future Contracts. Such additional requests for exemptive relief would present no issues under the 1940 Act that have not already been addressed in this application. 3. The Applicants represent that the requested class relief is appropriate in the public interest because it would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need for PLACA and PMLIC to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing their administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of their resources. The delay and expense involved in having to seek exemptive relief repeatedly would impair each company's ability to effectively take advantage of business opportunities that arise. 4. The Applicants represent that, for the same reasons, the requested relief is consistent with the purposes of the 1940 Act and the protection of investors. If PLACA and PMLIC each were required to seek exemptive relief repeatedly with respect to the same issues addressed in this application, investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection thereby. Indeed, they might be disadvantaged as a result of each company's increased overhead expenses.
