Hryb: 'Russia Needs Belarus, Just as Belarus Needs Russia'"] [Text] Not long ago Mecheslav Hryb, recently a lieutenant general of militia, was elected the new head of parliament in Belarus. He is interviewed by Lyudmila Novikova, deputy editor in chief of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY. [Novikova] Mecheslav Ivanovich, was it a surprise to you when you were elected chairman of the Supreme Soviet. [Hryb] I did not want this. [Novikova] Why? [Hryb] Because I know the situation in the economy, politics, etc. Here one has to accept not congratulations but condolences. I simply fulfilled the will of the president, who committed me not to remove my candidacy. [Novikova] How do you assess the present political and economic situation in the republic? [Hryb] It is very complicated. In a political sense, because the fight for power became acute before the presidential elections. Between parties, between groups, and even between individual personalities. Only a cohesive, united, and governable republic can come out of the crisis. It is not governable today. Therefore, I am setting the task of organizing governability as a priority. The economic situation in Belarus is also extremely complicated. The volume of production is falling, and individual enterprises are shutting down because they do not have the money to buy energy resources and raw materials to organize production. This is on the one hand. On the other hand, more than 30 percent of enterprises are coming to a stop because they do not have products for sale. After all, the CIS countries are our sales market, first and foremost, Russia. [Novikova] Western products are cheaper and of a higher quality, and this is what is bought. The market is the market. [Hryb] The problem is that today Russia demands $74 from us for 1,000 cubic meters of gas. But it sells it for $17 to its own consumers. All of this goes into the cost of the commodity. Plus customs duties of up to 30 percent. And when our product reaches the Russian market, even if it is of a better quality, it is not competitive in price. [Novikova] What are you doing about this? [Hryb] As chairman of the Supreme Soviet, in accordance with the old constitution, I am the highest official, but I actually do not have any rights. Everything has to be coordinated by the Supreme Soviet, and it does the ratifying. But the main thing is that we are trying as fast as possible to conclude an economic union with Russia. [Novikova] That is, join the ruble zone once again? [Hryb] Let us analyze the nuances. An economic union with Russia is the first step, joining the ruble zone is the second step. By joining the ruble zone we would be able to buy energy resources at the same price as Russia. The most reasonable variant would be to buy at world prices. I am confident that Russia will not be able to keep prices lower than world prices on its own domestic market also. We need these prices today. We are suffocating without them. Then, the removal of customs barriers is also advantageous for Russia. I think that there are opponents to this agreement in both Russia and our country. But Russia is interested in Belarus to no less a degree. We also have our advantages. In the final analysis, we are a corridor for communications with Europe. For gas and oil pipelines. For air defense, which we are conducting for the Russian Federation. There are also other military installations that are located on our territory in which Russia is interested. If everything is calculated sensibly and soberly, both sides have interests. And, secondly, this can be an excellent example for other states. [Novikova] That is, you are again for the Union? [Hryb] I am for an economic union. We have disrupted all facets of cooperation, and we should somehow unite them through the economy. Then the people will decide. [Novikova] You will agree that there can be no economic union without a political one. [Hryb] Why not? Why is Europe living in an economic union? Take the three Slavic states: Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. We have everything, and if we unite economically, we are practically independent. [Novikova] But the republics have fought so long and persistently for independence. [Hryb] Everything must have its time and place. No one is encroaching on our sovereignty. The Supreme Soviet is inclined to very active cooperation with Russia. And the population as well. But there are also other interpretations. For example, the statements of the leader of the People's Front, Poznyak, about Russian terrorism in Soviet Belarus and about new borders. But we do not accept him. The position of war and confrontation is not our position. All kinds of things happened in history. [Novikova] Mecheslav Ivanovich, you are a lawyer. How do you assess the last action of our Duma concerning amnesty? [Hryb] That is its business. It was able to adopt this law. [Novikova] Would you adopt such a law? [Hryb] Fortunately, we do not have such hostages, and there are practically no political prisoners to this day. We tried to find an accord, and we succeeded in hearing out the other side. [Novikova] But you also recently had crowded rallies... [Hryb] Two thousand people from the million and a half population of Minsk came out during the agitation and propaganda that was conducted for months on Independence Square. It was a total failure. People are sick of it. And issues should not be resolved at rallies. [Novikova] Have you met with Yeltsin? [Hryb] I have not met him in the position of chairman of the Supreme Soviet. I only received congratulations from him, and I thanked him. We had a very good conversation. [Novikova] Do you have normal relations with Kebich? [Hryb] They are normal. I do not know what kind of relations he had with Shushkevich. Today, Shushkevich comes out on the rostrum and says that he bears no grudges. But tomorrow they appear once again. That is, they appeared overnight. Then there are none again. Kebich and I have the same position with respect to orientation toward the East and development of relations with the West. He is engaged in his work, and I, in mine. We regard each other respectfully. We exchange telephone calls, if it is necessary. [Novikova] Mecheslav Ivanovich, nonetheless, what is your main objective now; after all, no matter what happens, you are the head of state. What are you working on? [Hryb] We are now working on adoption of the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus. To date 152 articles have been passed by an absolute majority. It remains to adopt the constitution in its entirety and a law on the process for putting it into effect. Then we can begin elections of the first president. [Novikova] Do you think this will help us get out of the crisis? There is a president in many republics. [Hryb] This is not the problem. When it comes to a president, it is possible to identify negative cases, and it is also possible to find positive cases. I think, nonetheless, that there are more positive cases in the world than negative ones. But a bad or good president will depend on whom the people elect. [Novikova] Will you file your candidacy for president? [Hryb] I do not have time for this now. [Novikova] Whom do you see as president of Belarus? [Hryb] It is better that I not name anyone, there are too many candidates. [Novikova] What do you think, is the appearance of a second Kirsan Ilyumzhinov among us possible? Of the same age, the same ambitions, and the same social position. [Hryb] Everything is possible in life. There are also rich people in Belarus.
