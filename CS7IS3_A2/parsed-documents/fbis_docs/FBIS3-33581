The debate in our organization was characterized by epithets, mutual disparagement, and too many subjective attacks. I have also declined invitations to the legitimate gatherings of various groups and refused to sign their equally legitimate documents. I have decided today to break my self-imposed public silence. I am doing so for a sound reason: so that all Sandinists, the people of Nicaragua, and perhaps those who know me outside the country can become familiar with my position. While not wishing to be immodest, I harbor the secret hope that my position is shared by most rank-and-file Sandinists, whether organized in party bodies or not, by countless mid-level officials, whether long-time or not, and even by our brothers who have quite rightly already taken a definite stand on the internal problems of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], which are reflected publicly in the disagreements between Daniel and Sergio. I am not frightened by the democracy that has been developing in the FSLN because we all wanted it and were involved in it. I am not frightened by the lawful and legitimate meetings of various groups of Sandinists, whether they receive press coverage or not. I am not frightened by the disagreements within our party. They enrich us. They are a fact. We must acknowledge it. A Poorly Handled Controversy I am concerned, however, about how this dispute is being handled. I think that the poor handling of this controversy in a young and poorly administered (understood) internal democracy could lead to a split in the FSLN. Those who would like to eliminate us, even physically, and our political adversaries are fomenting division in our ranks. They go back and forth with gossip between Sandinists, telling one and all. Some of our brothers and, at times, some of our media echo this gossip, thus adding fuel to the fire, which our adversaries stoke. Some brothers who have quite justifiably made a clear-cut commitment to one or another position do not always do the best job of conveying what is discussed at these meetings, whether they are official, unofficial, or even among Sandinist congressmen, to the National Directorate, to the rank and file, and to the mass media. At this point in the discussion I have the impression that a few brothers who are coming together with legitimate excitement and enthusiasm around the various schools of thought concerning the "Program, Principles, and Bylaws" that the FSLN ought to have in the immediate future (which are the outcome of a dynamic discussion that has not always been sound and is at times far from ethical) have wound up describing the position of others with stereotypes and even in black-and-white terms. I think that there are brothers in the two factions who are already almost seeing things in black and white and losing their objectivity. I am concerned that emotion and passion seem at times to outweigh calm analysis and caution. When a public political debate lapses into denunciations, generally by those who disagree, and into the stigmatizing of the other, it not only causes confusion in the various bodies of organized or unorganized Sandinism but also helps to divide our organization in the most naive way (I choose not to think that the intentions are evil). Struggling for Unity I have friends and brothers on both sides and I have been listening to them all carefully and respectfully. There is some truth to what they both say. I feel, think, see, sense, hear, and observe that there is some truth to both positions. My position right now, acknowledging that each side possesses some of the truth, is that we should discuss what is best in each in a more mature, ethical manner and that at the May Congress we should extract the truth of Sandinism, which is part of the country's truth, from all of these bits of truth and, in an exemplary fashion for Nicaragua and the world that will be watching us, put together a single program and set of bylaws. At that same Congress we should then select the best men and women to guide the crystallization of our integrated truth so that later, in 1995, we can begin to seek out, either by ourselves or with other parties if appropriate, the brothers and sisters who are best suited to be our candidates in the 1995 elections. In conclusion, I would like to point out a few things: 1. I think that along with discussing our internal problems we ought to see to it that the government, the IMF, and the World Bank do not condemn us to a return to the Stone Age with their cruel economic policies that are causing so much suffering and destabilization and that are introducing elements of anarchy into Nicaraguan society. 2. Today I am also sending a private letter to the National Directorate, expressing these same concerns. 3. Besides wanting to do something for Leon, Nicaragua, and the FSLN, I am, like any professional, trying to advance in my career as an attorney so that I can provide for my family's future, inasmuch as I will not seek reelection as a deputy or to run for mayor, nor do I seek any leadership post in our organization. Although some comrades do not realize this clearly, I am simply trying to do what we did in 1976 or 1977, when on Kilambe Hill, 1,750 meters above sea level, cold and hungry, Camilo Ortega and I struggled from the two factions to which we belonged to unite the FSLN and defeat the dictatorship. Camilo and I made our little contribution to that heroic feat. My father and three brothers who died in the struggle against the dictatorship, the thousands of Nicaraguans who fell before and after we took power, our accomplishments (some important ones still survive), and the accomplishments to come demand of me and demand of us all that we fight for party unity. If this letter succeeds in making a little contribution in this direction, I think that it will have achieved its goal.
