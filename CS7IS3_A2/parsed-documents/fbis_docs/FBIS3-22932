Castellanos, a division general who was held hostage by the guerrillas since 2 January, one day after the armed Indian revolt in the State of Chiapas was released in the town of Guadalupe Tepeyac of Chiapas at 1605 (2205 GMT). The local Azteca television station transmitted this afternoon the arrival of Castellanos, 66, accompanied by armed guerrilla youths, at the site where he was awaited by Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho, the mediator, and Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, as well as hundreds of national and foreign journalists. The town of Guadalupe Tepeyac, a zone where, according to the guerrillas, the Mexican Army was unable to enter during the armed conflict, is located in a vast mountain region 200 km from the city of San Cristobal from where a caravan of journalists left early Tuesday to cover the event. The former Chiapas governor's release, announced on Monday by Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho, is considered as the last step prior to the start of a peace dialogue between the EZLN and the government, the date and place of which might be announced in the coming hours. The guerrillas announced Tuesday that as of Thursday they will stop collecting the war tax "in the locations where it has been implemented" in the State of Chiapas, as "an additional action to create an appropriate climate" for the dialogue with the participation of EZLN leaders, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho, and Monsignor Samuel Ruiz. Gen. Castellanos, who governed Chiapas from 1982 to 1988, was kidnapped by the rebels at his Nuevo Momon Ranch in the municipality of Las Margaritas, one of the principal guerrilla-infested regions. Accused by the rebels of owning large land estates and of being responsible for "diverse crimes" against Indians, the 66-year-old former governor was tried by the ELN and sentenced to life and to carry out forced labor in an Indian community. Several days later, however, the guerrillas decided to acquit him "so that he could bear the shame of being pardoned" by those who were victims of the repression when he was governor. In statements to Mexican newsmen who interviewed him in late January "somewhere" in the mountains of Chiapas, Castellanos said he had been treated well and asked the government to guarantee that after it engages in the dialogue with the rebels, "a witch hunt" will not be unleashed in that southern state.
