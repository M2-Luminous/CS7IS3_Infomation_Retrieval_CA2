How will the Slovak side react? [Kanis] Naturally, we have to look at all of the aspects of this request. It is necessary to weigh the material and financial aspects and also, of course, the possibilities for the human resources the Slovak Army has at its disposal. However, from the preliminary discussions the members of the delegation have had among themselves, it is clear that it would be possible to comply with the request--on condition that the UN payments would not be delayed, as is the case now, by a year, but would be made immediately or, possibly, with a slight delay. In this case, we could overcome the problem of this department's tight budget.
