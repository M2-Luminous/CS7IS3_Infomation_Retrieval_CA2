This came in the president's message today to the people of Asyut during a popular celebration to mark the governorate's annual festival in Markaz Manfalut, Asyut. Awqaf Minister Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub read the message on the president's behalf. President Mubarak emphasized that society's peace and stability is a national issue, the responsibility for which falls on each citizen--on both the majority and opposition, and primarily on the political institutions and organizations, and the popular, professional, and trade associations. He stressed that Egypt belongs to all Egyptians, pro-government and opposition alike, and that sustaining its safety and peace is the responsibility of all its sons. Egypt is above all and bigger than all, he said. Reviewing the economic reform march, the president said that we are about to reap the fruits of that reform. The masses of the great Egyptian people provided real support to guarantee the success of that reform, he said. Mubarak affirmed that the future is promising and calls for optimism and hope to overcome many of the crises our great people have withstood and to make up for the sacrifices they had to make to put the homeland on the right course. Touching on the current phase the country is going through, the president said that the success of the human, economic, and political development march, along which we have gone far, depends on a cohesive national front and a stable and secure society. He stressed a number of general principles considered crucial to ensuring the success of the Egyptian march. These principles emphasize that society's security and stability is a national issue and that the Egyptian political system's strength lies in its effort to expand democracy without disturbing the criteria that distinguish democracy from anarchy. They also emphasize that serving the masses can only be done through serious and sincere work and by giving public interest priority over all else, that social peace is the safety valve for the national march, and that terrorism is an open war against Egypt and its people that seeks to waste the country's resources and ruin its accomplishments. The president stressed that Egypt has preserved and will continue to preserve and guard the moderate Islamic culture and heritage. Advocates of violence should know that all they will harvest by indulging in their action is disgrace and social isolation, he said.
