What is actually hiding behind this? Here is a military-political commentary by Slavoljub Susic: [Susic] It took the hawks from the world's power centers and influential media more than 10 days to speak up for the umpteenth time in order to protect the interests of the Bosnian Muslims, who rushed into yet another offensive against the Srpska republic. Their initial silence is better understood if one takes into account the already well-known stand of U.S. officials that it would be wrong to deny Muslims the right to fight when they are stronger, when they have more weapons, and when they are scoring military successes. Of course, whenever their proteges overestimate their own forces and get their fingers burned, the Serbs are accused of responding to the allegedly sporadic provocations with disproportionate ferocity. This recently happened near Gorazde. However, had the Security Council's Resolutions 824 and 836 on the setting up and protection of the safe havens been consistently implemented, the Muslim forces would have not had the opportunity to launch attacks on the Serbian positions from these zones before UN eyes. Participants in the closed sessions of the Security Council concluded more than once that the protected zones, including that of Gorazde, were being abused: that they were being used for training, regrouping, and recruitment of troops, which are then used to attack Serbs. This is also confirmed by the report of the UN Secretariat presented at this week's marathon session of the Security Council, which states, among other things, that there is well-founded suspicion that the Serbian attack on Gorazde was provoked by Muslim military forces in Srebrenica. Nevertheless, this did not sway the belligerent head of U.S. diplomacy, Christopher, from insisting on a swift dispatch of peace troops to Gorazde so that his country could have a good argument for launching an initiative on air strikes on Serbs if they, as he said, obstruct the deployment of the Blue Helmets. Defense Minister William Perry had to thoroughly explain his statement that the United States will not wage a war in Bosnia because of Gorazde. Those who advocate the punishment of Bosnian Serbs with air strikes according to the already prepared Sarajevo recipe were not satisfied with the explanation of General Shalikashvili, head of the U.S. Armed Forces Joint Chiefs of Staff, either, namely that Gorazde is not Sarajevo. It is interesting, but not surprising, that French Defense Minister Leotard does not agree with Gen. Shalikashvili's cautious statement. He wants UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] to decide whether or not it needs NATO's support, and claims that air strikes on Serb positions would technically be feasible, if only the political will existed for it. Of course, one should not be surprised by the fact that the United States is again generously offering its air force when one knows that the United States does not have troops on the hostile terrain of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the combat regions. It plans to send them there only once a stable agreement on peace is reached. In the search for an answer as to the purpose of a new cannonade of accusations, threats, and pressure on only one side in the ethnic civil war, we find that this could be a kind of ground artillery preparation for U.S. envoy Redman's efforts in Sarajevo and Pale. As we have learned, the aim of his latest mission is to finally obtain the Muslims' minimum territorial demands and establish the maximum territorial concessions that the Serbs are prepared to make for the newly created Muslim-Croatian Federation, prior to a new stage in the realization of the coordinated U.S.-Russian initiative for settling the crisis in Bosnia. If this is indeed the case, then what is the purpose of Clinton's National Security Adviser Anthony Lake's threats that the United States should let the Serbs know that the price of their intransigence is very high. We believe that he too will one day be able to conclude with regret that U.S. policy has failed because it proceeded from erroneous assumptions, as was concluded by Clarke Clifford, former adviser to several U.S. Presidents and Pentagon during the Vietnam war.
