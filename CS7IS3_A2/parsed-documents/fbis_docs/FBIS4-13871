According to the source, 'Adil Siyam, slain leader of the al-Jihad terrorist group, personally supervised the initiation of the group's new members. The latter, the source revealed, underwent a 30-day period of brainwashing, during which each new member was locked in a room and could not leave it until the initiation process was over. The initiation was geared toward bolstering the members' ability to sustain psychological and physical pressure. Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Alim, an accomplice of the slain terrorist, told investigators that Siyam's death is a terrible blow to the group. Siyam was the group's mastermind and the man who held all the strings. The group's members obeyed his orders blindly. One of Siyam's instructions was that members should commit suicide rather than be captured by the police, 'Abd-al-'Alim said. According to the same source, police success in cracking the terrorist ring came after prolonged monitoring of foreign cash transfers received by local terrorist leaders. The State Security Intelligence Service has been keeping tabs on checks involving considerable dollar and sterling payments to the terrorists. A vicious plot against Egypt is being hatched abroad, the source said. He added that certain countries are responsible for the terrorist operations taking place here. We have conclusive evidence about this foreign involvement through the confessions of the defendants and the documents seized by the security organs. Confessions by members of al-Jihad groups shed light on terrorist plans. The terrorists prepared cells in the Bilbays area in which they planned to hold any individuals they may abduct in order to force the government to release imprisoned terrorist leaders. Police have inspected the location of these cells in Bilbays' farmland. The terrorists also confessed that they planned to rob [al-satw 'ala] a number of key installations, disguised in police uniforms that were found in their possession. Investigation into the case is continuing under the supervision of Public Attorneys Raja' al-'Arabi and 'Abd-al-Sami' Sharaf-al-Din.
