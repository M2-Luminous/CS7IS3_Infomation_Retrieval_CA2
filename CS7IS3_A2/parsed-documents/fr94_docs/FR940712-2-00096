Relating to Specialist Participation in the After-Hours Trading Facility in Portfolio Depositary Receipts and Investment Trust Securities Based on Stock Indexes July 5, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 notice is hereby given that on April 21, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The filing requested: (1) Permanent approval of the After-Hours Trading (``AHT'') Facility; and (2) approval on a pilot basis for specialists in investment trust securities based on stock indexes to participate in the AHT Facility. The Commission approved the portion of the filing that requested permanent approval of the AHT Facility in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33993. 3 On August 3, 1993, the Exchange amended the filing to request that specialists in Portfolio Depository Receipts (``PDRs'') also be permitted to participate in the AHT Facility. 4 On July 5, 1994, the Exchange amended the proposed rule change to eliminate the migration of limit orders for PDRs and investment trust securities from the specialist's limit order book to the AHT Facility. 5 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments from interested persons on specialist participation in the AHT Facility in Portfolio Depository Receipts and investment trust securities based on Stock Indexes. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1994). 3 As originally filed, File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;15 requested permanent approval of Amex's pilot After-Hours Trading facility. On January 4, 1994, the Amex amended the filing to request a three-month extension of the pilot until April 30, 1994. On May 2, 1994, the Commission granted permanent approval to that portion of File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;15 concerning the Amex's After-Hours Trading facility, not including the specialist participation request. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33993 (May 2, 1994), 59 FR 23902 (May 9, 1994). 4 See letter from William Floyd-Jones, Jr., Assistant General Counsel, Amex, to Diana Luka-Hopson, SEC, dated August 3, 1993. 5 See letter from William Floyd-Jones, Jr., Assistant General Counsel, Amex, to Sandra Sciole, Special Counsel, SEC, dated July 1, 1994. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange proposes to permit specialists in Portfolio Depositary Receipts and investment trust securities to participate in the Exchange's After-Hours Trading (``AHT'') facility for a one year pilot period. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The Exchange requests Commission approval for specialists in Portfolio Depositary Receipts (``PDRs'') and investment trust securities listed pursuant to Section 118B of the Exchange's Listing Guidelines 6 to participate in the AHT facility to ``clean-up'' order imbalances in the AHT facility by entering an order for the specialist's account. For example, if there were single sided orders to buy 10,000 and sell 20,000 SPDRs immediately prior to the 5:00 p.m. close of the AHT facility, the specialist would be permitted under the Exchange's proposed rule amendments to enter an order for its account to buy up to 10,000 SPDRs in order to eliminate the sell side order imbalance. 6 The Exchange currently lists one Portfolio Depositary Receipt, viz ., Standard and Poor's Depositary Receipts (``SPDRs''); and two investment trust securities pursuant to Section 118B of the Exchange's Listing Guidelines: LOR Index Trust SuperUnits and LOR Money Market SuperUnits. The Exchange also seeks Commission approval for specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities to participate in a coupled closing price order so long as the other side of the order is not for an account in which a member or member organization has a direct or indirect interest. For example, under the Exchange's proposal, the specialist in SPDRs would be permitted to agree prior to the 4:15 close of the regular trading session for such securities to take the other side of a customer order to buy or sell SPDRs for execution in the AHT facility as a closing price coupled order. Such a capability would conform the trading of PDRs and investment trust securities to the practices of the ``basket'' market for equities where it is customary for a dealer to agree prior to the close of the regular trading session to take the contra side of a customer basket order and the closing index value. Specialists on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') currently are permitted to take the contra side of a customer order to buy or sell a particular equity security and enter such order into the NYSE's Off-Hours Trading facility as a closing price coupled order. The Exchange seeks a similar capability for specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities to conform the trading of these listed instruments to the practices of the basket market.
