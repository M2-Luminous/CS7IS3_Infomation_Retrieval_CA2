Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to President Yasir 'Arafat, and General Amnon Shahaq, Israel's deputy chief of staff, led the talks that are trying to find a formula for the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. MENA learned that the Security Committee was divided into two subcommittees. The first subcommittee is examining some details on the size of the Palestinian police force, the number of vehicles it will be using, and the nature of its tasks in Gaza and Jericho. The other subcommittee is discussing the issue of Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails. Muhammad Dahlan, Palestinian security official in Gaza, and David Agmon, deputy security chief of the West Bank, head this subcommittee. Dr. Sha'th last night met a delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] operating in Israel and the occupied territories and reviewed with them a list of the Palestinian detainees. An ICRC official said that he handed Dr. Sha'th a list of the Palestinian detainees and discussed with him humanitarian issues concerning the detainees. The official declined to divulge the number of Palestinian detainees. Meanwhile, the Civilian Affairs Committee met for one hour today to continue discussing issues pertaining to electricity, historical sites, civil registration, and other unresolved issues. Lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi said after the meeting that the committee reviewed what has already been agreed upon, namely the transfer of the electricity authority, civil registration, postal services, and public works to the Palestinians. He explained that issuing a postage stamp for local and international use will be left for the two leaderships in Tunis and Jerusalem to agree on. Al-Tarifi added that progress has been made and the talks were conducted in a very positive atmosphere. He said communications, land registry, water resources, and historical sites will be discussed at the next round of talks, for which preparations were made during today's meeting. The Security Committee is expected to end its meeting this afternoon. It will reconvene in Taba next Monday.
