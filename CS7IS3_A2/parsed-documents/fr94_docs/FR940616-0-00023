FR940616-0-00023 FR940616-0-00007 In the introductory paragraph, Indiana has deleted the word ``each'' and added the word ``any'' in its place. With this change, Indiana has clarified that ``affected area'' means any one or more of the specified examples at subsection 6 (1) through (7). The Director finds that the proposed change is substantively identical to the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 701.5 concerning the definition of ``affected area.'' The Director notes that the Indiana definition of ``affected area'' continues to be the subject of a required program amendment codified at 30 CFR 914.16(n) (see 58 FR 43260, August 16, 1993). 2. 310 IAC 12&hyph;0.5&hyph;53␣Ground Cover The term ground cover is defined to mean the area of ground which is covered by the combined aerial parts of vegetation and the litter that is produced naturally onsite, expressed as percentage of the total area of measurement. At least 95 percent of the species present must be species listed in the revegetation plan. The first sentence of the proposed definition is substantively identical to the Federal definition of ``ground cover'' at 30 CFR 701.5. Indiana added the second sentence to establish a standard guideline for all to follow. The Director finds that the second sentence is not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations. 3. 310 IAC 12&hyph;0.5&hyph;139␣Valid Existing Rights (VER) Indiana has proposed the following language for the definition of VER: (a) Valid existing rights means, for the purposes of 310 IAC 12&hyph;1&hyph;1, 310 IAC 12&hyph;2&hyph;1, and 310 IAC 12&hyph;2&hyph;5 the following: (1) Except for haul roads: (A) Those property rights in existence on August 3, 1977, that were created by a legally binding conveyance, lease, deed, contract, or other document which authorized the applicant to conduct surface coal mining operations; and (B) The person proposing to conduct surface coal mining operations on such lands: (i) Had been validly issued or exercised good faith effort to obtain, on or before August 3, 1977, all state and federal permits necessary to conduct operations on those lands; (ii) Can demonstrate to the director that the coal is both needed for and immediately adjacent to, an ongoing surface mining operation for which all permits were obtained prior to August 3, 1977; or (iii) Can demonstrate that the operation was in existence or operation at the time an area became protected under IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;14&hyph;1 or at the time of the coming into existence, within the prohibited distance of a structure, road, cemetery, or other activity listed in IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;14&hyph;1. (2) For haul roads:
