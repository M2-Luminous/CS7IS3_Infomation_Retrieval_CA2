FR941121-0-00059 FR941121-0-00008 III. Administrative Requirements A. Docket The docket for this regulatory action is A&hyph;93&hyph;08. The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to, or otherwise considered by, EPA in the development of this rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are: (1) To allow interested parties a means to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking process, and (2) To serve as the record in case of judicial review. The docket is available for public inspection at the EPA's Air Docket, which is listed under the ADDRESSES section of this document. B. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, 10/04/93), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affect a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligation of recipients thereof; (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the ``Executive Order.'' It has been determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that the specialty permits rule and the amendments to the Early Reductions Rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities. The EPA estimates that this rule will have no direct economic impact on any business entities for two reasons. First, the Early Reductions Program is a voluntary program, an alternate means of complying with otherwise applicable standards forthcoming under section 112(d) of the Act. Generally, companies would participate in the program if they thought their compliance costs would be less than those associated with meeting otherwise applicable standards. Costs could be less because the 90 (95) percent reduction threshold to qualify for an extension likely will be lower than the reduction required by applicable section 112(d) standards. Moreover, the Early Reductions Rule provides owners or operators considerable flexibility to average qualifying reductions among participating emissions units. Second, the specialty permits program rulemaking simply adapts for earlier use the intended mechanism for eventually delineating and enforcing all Act requirements at individual facilities, namely the title V permit. Sources not electing to participate in the Early Reductions Program would have to obtain title V permits anyway when comprehensive title V. Therefore, this rulemaking does not add any additional requirements to participants. The impacts from the requirements of title V were considered in the promulgated part 70 rule for State comprehensive programs (57 FR 32250). Moreover, the proposed change to the Early Reductions Rule would have no economic effect on any large or small business entities. D. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this rule have been approved by the OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and has been assigned the OMB control no. 2060&hyph;0276. An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by the EPA (ICR No. 1650.01), and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch (PM&hyph;223Y), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460, or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. This collection of information is estimated to have a public reporting burden averaging 554 hours per respondent for one-time burden items and 43 hours per respondent annually for recurring burden items. This includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2136); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''
