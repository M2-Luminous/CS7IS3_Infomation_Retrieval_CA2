The committee of experts was appointed three years ago at the government's request to plan greater Jerusalem. When two of its members were asked what the viability of the plan was in the wake of the signing of the Declaration of Principles for self-government, they replied that the issue is not their concern and that they had studied the metropolitan problems from an expert's point of view. Arnon Yequti'eli, head of the Meretz faction in Jerusalem Municipality, believes that the plan is part of the municipality's almost racist pettiness by constantly taking into account the numerical relationship between the Palestinian and Israeli populations. There are currently some 1.2 million inhabitants in the area. The committee of experts recommends a series of moves to change the current demographic relationship from 55 percent Palestinians and 45 percent Jews, to 52 percent Palestinians and 48 percent Jews by 2010. Jerusalem Municipality tends in principle to be for adopting the recommendations, with minor additions and changes, and hopes to convince the government to embrace them. Two of the committee leaders, who presented the findings to Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert this week, believe that if a series of moves to build in and expand greater Jerusalem -- especially in the areas annexed after 1967 -- are not taken quickly, Jerusalem is likely to become "a dead-end city" with Palestinian building closing in on the city from the south, north, and east, and blocking its ability to expand. The two, Shemaryahu Kohen, formerly head of the Jerusalem District in the Construction and Housing Ministry, and Professor Adam Mazur, maintain that Jerusalem will wither both in the urban and economic fields if large areas within the metropolitan area are not designated territorial reserves set aside for the town's expansion. In order to achieve that aim, the two said, the committee recommends expanding Ma'ale Adumim in the direction of Jerusalem, linking it up territorially with Pisgat Ze'ev, linking Giv'at Ze'ev to the Ramot neighborhood, and expanding the 'Etzyon Bloc in the direction of the town of Betar and the 'Adulam region. The coordinator of the steering committee is Yisra'el Kimche, of the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Research, and its members include Jerusalem Municipal Engineer Elino'ar Brocci, Yohanatan Golani of the Interior Ministry, Sofia Lidor of the Construction and Housing Ministry, and Mikha'el Tirkin of the Israel Lands Authority. The team proposes creating "joint Jewish-Arab zones" along Highway 45, between Modi'in and 'Atarot, where economic projects will be set up. One of the team's guidelines is that political or other boundaries should not block the setting up of "a single voting area" for the population of greater Jerusalem. In a letter of response sent to Olmert, Meretz faction leader Yequti'eli said that since 1967 "successive Israeli Governments and Jerusalem Municipality have been conducting a clear policy of expelling Palestinians from Jerusalem, either through mass confiscations of land or the destruction of hundreds of houses. The only approved project, the al-Nusaybah housing project, was also implemented because of the need to house people expelled from the Old City after the 1967 war and the evacuation of the square in front of the Western Wall. "At first `we fought' over the relationship between Jews and Arabs in the city of Jerusalem, and when that was decided, we began to take stock of the numbers of Jews and Arabs in East Jerusalem and the territories annexed to it. We have now reached a clear Jewish majority there too. In fact, so much so that the Palestinians from Jerusalem -- tens of thousands of them -- have been pushed out of town and have gone to live in al-Ram, al-'Ayzariyah, and other places. The latest stock taking is over the numerical relationship in the greater Jerusalem area. There is no significance -- and should be none -- to a numerical relationship between Jerusalem and the Palestinian towns and villages, such as Bethlehem and Ramallah, which are due to come under Palestinian autonomy and the future Palestinian state anyway," Yequti'eli wrote.
