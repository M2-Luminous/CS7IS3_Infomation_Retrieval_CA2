Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman commented on the subject when asked about certain proposals submitted in a letter by the U.S. ambassador to Ankara regarding plans to save the oil pipeline. Ataman recalled that various contacts were held with the Iraqi authorities and the coalition partners of the Gulf War with the aim of rescuing the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline. Stressing that everyone agrees that it is necessary to save this important pipeline, Ataman described this as a positive development. We see that all the sides have begun exerting efforts to this end, Ataman remarked, adding: During a visit to our ministry yesterday, the U.S. ambassador confirmed that his government also concedes this necessity. At this stage, he did not make any proposals on the subject or submit any letters. The permanent members of the UN Security Council have actually begun exchanging views on the subject. We will continue our consultations in London, Moscow, Paris, and Washington in the coming days. Ataman declared that from the beginning, Turkey's aim remains rescuing the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline in harmony with the UN system.
