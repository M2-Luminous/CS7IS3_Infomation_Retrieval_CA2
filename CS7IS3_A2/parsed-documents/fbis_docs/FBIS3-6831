The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is simply making "noise" and trying to "lighten its load," Ito said at a regular press meeting. He was reacting to recent moves by the Trade Ministry calling for relaxation of automotive import procedures. Japan sets detailed and stringent standards on car mechanisms, especially concerning emissions and safety, and requires inspection of every unit. Approvals called "type certificates" are issued for volume imports of individual models. The Transport Ministry, which is responsible for enforcing the procedures, assumes the attitude that accusations by Japan's trade partners that the system constitutes a trade barrier derive from a lack of information. As part of an effort to ease such criticism, the ministry sent officials to Detroit earlier this month to explain their position and provide information. The Trade Ministry, however, has criticized the system itself as having problems, such as a long time required to get through the entire import process.
