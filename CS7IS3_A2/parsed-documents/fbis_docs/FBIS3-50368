As is well known, he had met his host, President Lech Walesa, at the recent summit of the Visegrad Four heads of state with the U.S. President, where the two presidents agreed that the present visit should become a landmark in relations between the two countries. I will not betray any state secret when I say there is an outright deficit in the two countries' knowledge of one another and, in particular, in the development of economic and commercial contacts, which have registered a rapid decrease in recent years. Therefore, it was to be expected that precisely these topics would figure uppermost on the agenda of the talks in Warsaw. But, wonder of wonders, neither the minister of economy nor the minister of foreign affairs is in the delegation accompanying the Slovak president. The minister of the environment is the only government member who was given the green light [to accompany the president]. I am not suggesting that cooperation in this unquestionably important area need not be discussed. The crux of the matter seems to lie in something else, however. Somebody is doing everything he can for the head of state not to grow taller than he is and for the head of state not to be able to ascribe to himself the credit for something that, in the view of the latter, somehow does not belong to him. This already open hostility endangers the vital interests of our state because it can be expected that such behavior will not go unnoticed by the other side and will boomerang against us and, apparently, will be repaid with interest. Because the chiefs of government departments who could give an impetus to Slovak-Polish relations were not allowed to go to Warsaw, it must be assumed that the government had far more important problems to deal with at its meeting yesterday.
