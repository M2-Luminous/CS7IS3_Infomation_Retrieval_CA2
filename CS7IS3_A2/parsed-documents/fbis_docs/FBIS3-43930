During a special HCR session at the People's Palace, which was attended by 368 members, 223 voted for the decision while 80 voted against and 60 abstained. As we can see, the political will expressed during the negotiations has finally prevailed and each participant has expressed his accord in line with his own views, sometimes with different words or different procedures. The main thing, however, is that the people have now understood and that the entire political class is driven by a single ideal, that of putting an end to dual Republican institutions, which is a happy prelude to fair and free elections.
