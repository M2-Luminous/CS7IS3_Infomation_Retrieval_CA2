"If blood is spilled in the Crimea, we will not be able to talk about conducting any kind of reforms," he emphasized. Mr. Hrach addressed a proposal to Yuriy Meshkov, the president of the autonomy, to begin talks and consultations with Ukraine's leadership. Incidentally, 69 out of 73 deputies (there are 98 deputies in Crimea's Supreme Council) voted to renew the Constitution of Crimea in its 1992 form. The group of Crimean Tatars (14 persons) refused to take part in the voting. The statement by the Crimean Supreme Council's press center, which was disseminated today, says that the inclusion of this issue on the session's agenda had been done "at the will of the people of Crimea."
