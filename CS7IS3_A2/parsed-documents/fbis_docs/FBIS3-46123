Vice Governor Wen Shizhen gave a summing-up speech on seizing the opportunity, greeting the challenge, developing reform, and pushing the whole province's economy to a new stage. Wen Shizhen said: Big reform will bring big emancipation and development of the productive forces. Under the situation in which difficulty and opportunity have coexisted, the key to successfully carrying out economic work lies in our mental state, good or bad. If we can maintain a sober mind, enhance the sense of urgency and responsibility, turn pressure into motivation, strengthen spirit, and advance despite difficulties, we will surely be able to seize the new opportunity, greet new challenges, and realize new development. Wen Shizhen touched on the following views on pushing our province's economy to a new level this year: Conscientiously carry out reform of the financial and tax system, actively broaden sources of income and reduce expenditure, and do a good job in financial and taxation work; rationally determine the base figures of revenue and expenditure, and make good arrangements for 1994 financial budget; fully understand the major significance in reform of the tax system, turn pressure into motivation, and actively cultivate new tax sources; concentrate efforts on raising the economic efficiency of enterprises, and while paying attention to large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, exert efforts to develop tertiary industry and township enterprises; and actively guide enterprises to expand foreign export trade, and raise the level of creating foreign exchange. Wen Shizhen pointed out: This year is crucial to our province's reform and development. Particularly, the state has successively issued a series of major reform measures within a very short period of time. To guarantee the real implementation of these reform plans in our province, we should change work style, make earnest efforts to do practical things, work creatively, advocate the practice of handling official work on the spot, promote the habit of conducting investigations and studies, care for the living of the people, pay attention to solving difficult problems and hot topics in society, and guarantee the smooth implementation of the state's all sorts of major reform measures. Governor Yu Qifeng and Vice Governors Guo Tingbiao and Gao Guozhu attended the conference on 21 January.
