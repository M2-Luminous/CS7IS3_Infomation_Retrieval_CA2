The talks focused on the forthcoming visit of Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus to the Russian Federation which is expected next Monday and Tuesday [4 and 5 April]. In an interview with CTK Petricek said an agreement on investment protection was ready for signing. He said Prague and Moscow should now discuss possibilities for bringing the current drop in their mutual trade to a halt, including lifting trade barriers. Regarding Russian debts towards the Czech Republic Rudlovcak told CTK that Russia was now in a difficult payment situation and considered supplies of Russian goods a basic mechanism for repaying its debts. Rudlovcak said the Czech Republic would agree with such a solution providing it was regulated in a special agreement. Under favorable conditions such a document could be drafted by the end of May, he added. Rudlovcak said that during Klaus's expected visit to Moscow the principles for such an agreement might be discussed. After the breakup of the Czechoslovak Federation its claims against the former Soviet Union were divided between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in a two-to-one ratio. The claims worth three billion USD ensuing from state loans and trade deficit passed to the Czech Republic. Direct claims of Czech enterprises against Russian consumers worth about 380 million dollars make up an independent part of former Soviet and currently Russian debt to the Czech Republic.
