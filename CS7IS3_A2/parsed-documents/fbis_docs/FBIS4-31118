The demonstration planned for today has been canceled because, through the mediation of the president of the Republic, the trade union came to an agreement with the State Property Management Corporation [AVRT], the owner of the Hungarian Power Plants Trust [MVMT], we learned from Antal Schalkhammer, president of the Interior Ministry Employees Trade Union [BDSZ]. The BDSZ planned a protest because the Bakony Power Plant Corporation decided not to receive, as of April, the monthly 5,500 metric tons of coal for the power plant which they contracted for with the Dudar Coal Mine because the demand on the Inota Power Plant decreased by half. After the contract was unilaterally terminated, the mine became insolvent; this, in turn, endangered the jobs of 340 miners. Furthermore, the situation of mining companies that were left out of the power plant-coal mine integration program established through an agreement between the government and the trade union in January became impossible. "The affected mines, the BDSZ, and the AVRT agreed yesterday that with the help of independent experts they would prepare a joint analysis of the possibilities for financing mines," Antal Schalkhammer told NEPSZABADSAG. He added: In this way it will become possible for mines not included in the integration program to avoid being closed down. In the next two months, the experts will scrutinize the situation of the mines. Until then, the AVRT will help so that the miners can be paid. Furthermore, the property management corporation introduced a motion that requests submitted by mines to the Labor Ministry for personnel power management assistance be evaluated quicker. "Because the jobs of several thousand people are on the line, as a last resort I appealed to President Arpad Goncz," the BDSZ chairman said. "Without the president's mediation, yesterday's agreement could not have been concluded," he declared.
