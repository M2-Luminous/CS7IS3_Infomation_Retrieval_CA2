This draft law -- On State Social Security Guarantees for the Russian Federation President -- which, according to Duma Deputy Chairman Mikhail Mityukov, originated within the Legislation Committee, was however assessed by this committee members as untimely. The committee session also examined another draft law of similar content: On State Guarantees to Top Officials. Both bills were "promoted" at the Duma Council session by deputy speaker Mikhail Mityukov who nonetheless denied authorship. At the same time, Mityukov believes that such a law has a right to exist because at the present moment, according to him, the president's salary is approximately 400,000 rubles, that is, below the deputies'. The draft establishes it at a level of triple a ministerial salary. Vladimir Isakov, chairman of the Legislation Committee, assessed the bill as a possible provocation. In his opinion, a wide discussion of the "juridically absolutely illiterate document" can lead to the Duma's being charged with trying to bring Boris Yeltsin's retirement closer (the draft envisions the president's pension at 80 percent of his monthly monetary allowance). To avoid a scandal, the committee, after considering the drafts, decided to wait and watch the reaction of factions and parliamentary committees. The committee's decision may have also been influenced by the fact that the anonymous law was supposed to take effect from 1 April 1994.
