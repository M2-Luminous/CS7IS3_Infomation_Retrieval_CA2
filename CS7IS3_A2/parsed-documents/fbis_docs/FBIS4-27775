The objective of the meeting is to discuss measures for coping with growing international tension over the North Korean issue. The North Korean situation has worsened since the UN Security Council's presidential statement urging North Korea's early acceptance of inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- made in response to the nation's attempt to hastily replace fuel rods used in its nuclear facilities. The council was established in 1986 under the then Nakasone cabinet to reinforce the crisis management capability of the nation. The council is chaired by the (administrative) deputy chief cabinet secretary, and members include directors of the Foreign Ministry's International Information Bureau, the Defense Agency's Defense Policy Bureau, the National Police Agency's Security Bureau, the Cabinet Information Research Office, and the Cabinet Security Affairs Office, as well as the deputy director general of the Public Security Investigation Agency.
