The Belarusian authorities, which have created a powerful propaganda apparatus based on the republic publications which depend on them, are now trying to dictate their will to foreign mass media. Representatives of the nomenklatura are expressing, directly from the Supreme Soviet rostrum, their dissatisfaction with the fact that some people's opinions differ from the official line about events and processes occurring in the Republic. Last week Valeriy Tikhinya, former secretary of the Communist Party of Belarus Central Committee and currently one of the leaders of the Belarusian pro-Communist people's movement, stated that certain mass media are covering events occurring in our republic today in a distorted and biased way. This primarily applies to materials published in NARODNAYA GAZETA, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, and IZVESTIYA, and to the Ostankino television channel news.... This type of article, he believes, plays into the hands of right-wing extremist and nationalistic forces, and is aimed at destabilizing the situation in the republic. As always in such cases, there were no specific complaints made against the mass media. They are biased, and that is that. One is amazed by the aplomb used in a speech by a man about whom the ordinary citizens expressed their attitude back in August 1991. At that time, indignation about his behavior was so great that it overflowed into not entirely decorous forms: When Tikhinya left the square outside Government House he had literally been spat upon. His thankless task was continued by Belarusian Parliament Speaker Mechyslaw Hryb. Speaking at the 1 March session, he accused the SVOBODA and IZVESTIYA newspapers of compromising him as an individual and particularly as Supreme Soviet chairman. Hryb assured everyone that the rumors about him are entirely unfounded. At the same time, he not only did not cite any evidence disproving them, but he did not even indicate what exactly he was talking about. Or is it that everything that is written about the speaker by newspapers which are not subordinate to him does not correspond to reality? It is indicative that 20 minutes before giving this speech, Hryb switched off the microphone used by his predecessor Stanislav Shushkevich, accusing him of insulting the people's deputies. What was this about? It was about the fact that the former chairman of the Supreme Soviet dared to remind his colleagues about the promise to hold early parliamentary elections in March 1994. Thus it is not only the journalists' mouths they are trying to close. Such speeches would be the strictly personal affair of the people making them if it were not for two circumstances. First of all, these are people invested with power and called upon to observe certain standards of decency. Second, these statements are periodically alternated with threats to refuse the accreditation of objectionable foreign mass media and, as it happens, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry is dealing with accreditations right now. Meanwhile, behind the scenes in the Supreme Soviet, reports are being actively circulated to the effect that a group of deputies intends to address to the Foreign Ministry a message about the expediency of giving accreditation to IZVESTIYA and the Ostankino Television Broadcasting Company. If this happens, the people's representatives will primarily put themselves in a ridiculous position. But the initiators of the planned message are apparently not too worried about this: To make up for it, no one will get in the way of their reviving a communist state.
