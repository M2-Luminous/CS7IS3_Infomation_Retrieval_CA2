What is your overall opinion of this document? [Boyon] Like most of the other deputies who listened to the prime minister and the defense minister, I was very satisfied overall with the presentation that was made of the white paper. In the present context of budgetary stringency, we were fearing we might end up with a skimpy white paper. We were reassured to see that a certain number of our national defense objectives were confirmed. Having said this, drawing up this document was not the most difficult part of the exercise since its aim was to define a long-term military policy. This must now be translated into real figures. We are now waiting to see how the government will overcome this difficulty. [Patoz] The white paper confirms the need for nuclear deterrence, but it does not deal with the issue of resuming nuclear tests. However, many members of the majority are declaring themselves in favor of resuming such tests. What are your feelings in this respect? [Boyon] As regards the nuclear chapter, the white paper has left us somewhat unsatisfied. Apparently, they attempted to evade a number of questions which, within the cohabitation framework, do not elicit the same response from the government as they do from the president of the Republic. However, we must be aware that we have, on the one hand, the white paper's letter and, on the other, what is implied. Now, these implications are important, and we feel this was confirmed by the prime minister's comments. For my part, I believe it is apparent from everything that was said that the nuclear deterrent is still the basis of our defense. I also believe that the government recognizes that our nuclear arsenal must be modernized to keep pace with the development of new threats. In my view, the government reaffirmed -- even though this is not actually spelt out in the white paper -- the need to resume nuclear testing at the earliest possible date, in order to complete the development of the PALEN test simulation system. All in all, it is true that the white paper does not say much which is new on the nuclear issue but, frankly, we were not expecting it to do so. In fact, we are very much aware that the broad guidelines for the development of our deterrent system will only be set down by the next president. [Patoz] As far as arms policy is concerned, the white paper pronounces itself in favor of basing production on international cooperation. Do you approve of this formula? [Boyon] In my view, the white paper is not saying that France must give up certain programs, but rather, that it cannot do everything on its own. The white paper says that the need to cut back on costs requires cooperative projects to be undertaken, except in the nuclear field, where sharing is not possible. I believe this is the way forward. Any other position would be totally unrealistic. It is not a question of concentrating on a certain type of production, and leaving some other type of production to other countries. We are not saying "we must give up doing this," but rather "we must do this with others." In the final analysis, industrialists will be playing a decisive role in determining how things will be organized. [Patoz] The white paper seems to signal the beginning of a certain rapprochement with NATO. Is this not calling into question one of the great Gaullist principles? [Boyon] Not at all. Both the white paper and the comments made by the prime minister confirm that France will remain outside the integrated military system. If French troops are deployed, wherever they may be deployed, this will only happen following a decision of the French Government. What does constitute more of a novelty -- although, in this respect, the white paper is not so much innovating as it is recording a fact -- is that, whenever NATO engages in operations to maintain or reestablish peace, and if France takes part in them, it is normal for the defense minister to attend any political meetings which aim to define the objectives and the framework of such operations. At present, there is a dividing line between the NATO bodies in which France takes part, and those in which it does not take part. We have simply realized that this dividing line is no longer in the right place, but we are not erasing it. Rather, we are moving it so that the defense minister and the chief of the general staff can take part in discussions whenever this proves necessary. [Patoz] Whereas the RPR is inclined to establish a professional army, the white paper still favors a conscript army. What is your view of the matter? [Boyon] The RPR did not declare itself in favor of a professional army, but rather of professionalizing the army, which is not exactly the same thing. However, the white paper does confirm the principle of conscription, but I do not think the real problem lies here. The problem today is knowing whether we can maintain conscription in an army which must become more professional. In fact, we are being told, on the one hand, that the armed forces will be made smaller and, on the other, that we will have more professionals within them. Therefore, there will be fewer conscripts. The question is therefore the following: Can we manage the national service machinery -- which is very cumbersome -- in such a way as to ensure that the principles of universality and equality are observed, and that the service's civilian sections do not continue to get hold of the best men, leaving the conscripts discarded by the civilian service managers to the armed forces? I am not sure this is possible. The Defense Commisssion will now have to consider the national service issue. In fact, it is apparent that the white paper has proclaimed a principle without first ensuring that the necessary in-depth studies had been conducted on the possibilities of implementing it.
