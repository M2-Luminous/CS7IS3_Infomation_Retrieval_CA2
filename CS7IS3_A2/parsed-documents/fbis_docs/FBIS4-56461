FBIS4-56461 "drlat086_k_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-086 Daily Report 1 May 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina U.S. `Pressure' On Patents Examined U.S. `Pressure' On Patents Examined PY0305202794 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 1809 GMT 1 May 94 PY0305202794 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS Spanish BFN [Special report by Tomas Rodriguez] [Text] The 30 April deadline which the United States had suggested for Argentina to promulgate the law on pharmaceutical patents is now past, and the five committees that are studying the bill are nowhere near issuing a ruling. Argentina has thus been "included" on the list of nations that will be subject to economic punishment. The five Senate committees have already held at least 18 consultative sessions, which they resumed in April. Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella is expected to appear before the committees during the second half of May. The first phase will end a few days later, when Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo appears before the committees. After that, the committees will be in a position to issue a favorable ruling despite the opposition of the Radical Civic Union (UCR) bloc led by Jose Genoud, one of the underwriters of an alternative bill which "is better suited to Argentine interests," as Genoud has repeatedly said. Of the five committees that are looking at the executive branch's bill on patents, three are chaired by UCR senators. This, however, does not guarantee that the UCR will obtain a majority in the final vote, although it is a serious obstacle for the ruling Justicialist Party's desire to deal expeditiously with this matter. The Senate is not the only body that opposes the bill on patents in what is being looked on as undue U.S. interference in the matter. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor's "message," to the effect that Argentina would not be allowed to join NAFTA unless the much-awaited law on patents was approved first, was received in the Chamber of Deputies like a bad odor. Before going into the interests at stake in this sensitive issue, let us take a look at the figures for the huge pharmaceutical market. Argentina consumes $3 billion worth of medicines every year. Argentine pharmaceutical laboratories, which frequently copy formulas, receive $1.6 billion, and the foreign laboratories that own the patents keep the rest. Should the new law on patents be approved, this proportion will probably be reversed, which will significantly increase the price of medicines. At one point, Pablo Challu, chairman of the Argentine Industrial Center of Pharmaceutical Laboratories [CILFA], made the exaggerated assessment that "medicines would go up 300 percent," which prompted a swift rebuttal from government officials who labeled Challu's statement "sheer nonsense." Rafael Flores and Felix Pesce, Justicialist Party deputies for Santa Cruz and Mendoza, lead the group of ruling party deputies who have been criticizing the bill of the executive branch. Pesce said: "We will pass a law that will serve the country's interests," and warned that "we should not play dumb, because there are powerful economic interests at stake.... A multimillion dollar business is involved." Pesce rejected U.S. pressure on the grounds that "our Congress is an independent body which takes its own time to act in keeping with the people's will, which compels us to work for the common good without forsaking our convictions." Rafael Flores said: "We Argentines cannot allow health to be downgraded to the level of mere merchandise, because it is a social asset." UCR Deputy Nicolas Becerra said "the United States must end its double extortion," and recalled that "a similar issue, which President Arturo Illia [1963-66] had to deal with, was the starting point of a tragic phase in Argentina." The Socialists, led by Deputies Alfredo Bravo and Hector Polino, have submitted draft bills rejecting the Bill Clinton administration's interference with Argentina's law on patents, an interference "that we cannot endure silently," they firmly state. The many voices raised in opposition are upsetting the administration, which is stuck in the middle and on the verge of being knocked out by its inability to comply with deadlines and to fulfill commitments as time runs out.
