Surendran: "Gowri's Party Riding on Crest of Popularity"] [Text] Thiruvananthapuram, March 22--The new party, Janadhipatya Samrakshana Samiti (JSS), launched by the expelled Marxist veteran, Mrs K.R. Gowri on Sunday brings in a whiff of fresh air in the caste and communally polluted politics of Kerala. Mrs Gowri had earlier steadfastedly refused the company of many backward castes-minority groups masquerading as political parties in the contemporary political scene here. Her rebuff to Mr Kanshi Ram of the BSP [Bahujan Samaj Party] and the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) of the Ezhavas (OBC [other backward classes]) has obviously disappointed them. Mr Ram who came to meet her with high hopes had his ego greatly deflated when the Marxist woman enlightened him on the need to help all poor people whichever caste or community they might belong to. The first show of strength the JSS displayed at Alapuzha, a coastal town in South Kerala too was impressive. Considering that Mrs Gowri founded a party single handedly within two months of her expulsion from the CPM, the maiden show was attractive. The party constitution provides for grassroots democracy with freedom to express one's opinion freely is provided for. The party has given to itself the task of pursuing Communist ideologies in the demo set up with sincerity. Thrust of the new party policy is purging the politics of corruption. However, the crucial question that bothers political observers is whether the JSS will grow roots in the tangled power politics of Kerala where every caste and community has formed a political party of its own. Mrs Gowri's clarion call to create a new clean political party sounds more like the Communist utopia of the state power withering away gradually. After all, JSS is the 302d political party of the state though hardly 12 of them have representation in the state assembly. More importantly, where will the finance to fight elections come from? The charge that the JSS will end up as another appendage to the Congress soon cannot be dismissed as CPM-spawned slur campaign. Witnesses to the three-day convention of the JSS at Alapuzha last week would not have failed to notice the absence of criticism of the Congress for various ills the country faced. There was on the other hand a pathetic tinge to the CPM-phobia the new party evinced in deciding every major policy of the party. The overriding passion was to ensure that the JSS stand looked diametrically opposite to the CPM stand on major issues. Again, a sizeable number of the delegates at the convention, appeared to have been a one-time Marxist workers or leaders. This, say JSS leaders, cannot be helped. Every party will have some grumblers, gamblers and glam persons. Which is the major constituency of the new party? The JSS would surely claim a part of the CPM cadres belonging to the backward castes. But its prospects of winning over minorities--Christians and Muslims--are rather dim. Christian community accounting for nearly 25 per cent of the population has the Congress(I) and the KLA [expansion not given] Congress wooing them. While the Muslim League, its rival party being floated by Mr Ibrahim Sulaiman Sait and the PDP [expansion not given] of Mr Abdul Nasser Madani are all vying for another 20 per cent of the population. Therefore JSS will find it extremely hard to get new converts to the JSS especially in the north Kerala. Mrs Gowri's refusal to comment on the controversial palmolein deal in which the chief minister, Mr K. Karunakaran, finds himself on a cleft-stick too has engendered the belief that the JSS is leaning heavily on the Congress for its survival. It was in this context that the reason [as published] mischievious comment of Mr Karunakaran that his party would give Mrs Gowri the high position if she chooses to join the Congress is to be viewed. His aims seem to have been two folded: having helped Mrs Gowri to move away from the CPM he now wants to besmire her spotless political image so that she and her party would end up in the UDF [United Democratic Front] camp eventually. A tacit seat understanding with the Congress for the forthcoming panchayat/municipal elections is already being talked about in the political camps.
