Manuel Camacho Solis, special commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, held a news conference this morning. He said peace will not be achieved with sketchy information. Hence, peace will be achieved with a dialogue and, above all, with understanding, he said. He admitted that yesterday and today he received some messages concerning the possibility of holding a dialogue with the members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. However, we have yet to confirm that these messages are from a person who truly represents this armed group, he emphasized. Manuel Camacho Solis also said the following: [Begin Camacho Solis recording] Yesterday and this morning I received one or two messages through certain persons in different parts of the country. The first signs of the possibility of a communication have appeared, but we have a big responsibility. We must cooperate so the tranquillity generated yesterday is used to take a new step toward the achievement of peace. We will not achieve this with poor communications, an error in the dialogue, or without taking into consideration the context of the region and the region's relationship with the rest of Mexico. What do I mean by this? I mean there is an organization, the EZLN -- a political, military, ideological, and united organization. Any error in communication through a false mediator, someone who does not truly represent the EZLN positions could preclude the possibility of really establishing a communication. [end recording] Manuel Camacho Solis said various issues must be taken into consideration in these negotiations, above all the culture and customs of all these persons. In addition, Chiapas is a mosaic of culture, he said; adding that, for example, the word agreement and the word peace do not mean the same -- or do not have the same significance -- for any of the Indian communities in the region. Therefore, the goal must be mainly to achieve harmony. He added that the doors are open for a dialogue but, he emphasized, they are not open for opportunism. The news conference was also attended by San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz. He said Mexico is currently afflicted by an endemic disease and will not be cured by the first dose of medicine. It requires an in-depth treatment which truly takes into consideration what occurs in this universe, rather than only in Chiapas, because Chiapas is not only part of the Mexican territory, Chiapas is also an essential part of the country. He said that backwardness and all the problems that have prevailed must be analyzed point by point and part by part. [passage omitted] A march was scheduled for noon today, organized by various communities in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. We saw many children carrying signs that ask the EZLN to put down their weapons and emphasizing the state wants peace and harmony. Also, a news conference held by representatives of the Mexican Bishops Conference ended a few minutes ago. It was, obviously, attende? by Monsignor [Adolfo] Suarez Rivera, president of the Mexican Bishops Conference, who issued an appeal to the people urging them to open their eyes because Mexico is now a different country. He said the armed conflict in Chiapas has awakened a hidden Mexico. Suarez Rivera emphasized that Mexico must undergo changes in its government structures, its society, and its Catholic Church.
