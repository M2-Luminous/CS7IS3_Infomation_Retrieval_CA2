Market dealers said they had anticipated the surge as the Bank of Japan was seen selling the yen actively for dollars to stem its rise in the reporting month. The foreign reserves include convertible foreign currencies, gold and international monetary fund special drawing rights. The March-end balance hit a record high, breaching a previous high of 100.36 billion dollars posted in April 1989. The official, as usual, declined to comment on details and reasons for the change in the foreign reserves when briefing reporters. Market experts closely follow fluctuations in foreign reserves as evidence of intervention by the Bank of Japan, and dealers said the central bank bought some 3 billion dollars in March to stop the yen's rise. The ministry official said the dollar started the month at 104.70 yen and ended at 102.80 yen, ranging from 102.52 posted on March 30 to 106.58 yen marked on March 24. Japan remained the world's largest holder of foreign reserves for the fifth month in a row, amassing 96.0 billion dollars as of January, the most recent figure comparable with those of other nations. Germany came in second with 85.7 billion dollars, followed by Taiwan with 84.8 billion dollars. The United States posted 74.9 billion dollars in December, the latest available month. Spain marked 42.1 billion dollars in January.
