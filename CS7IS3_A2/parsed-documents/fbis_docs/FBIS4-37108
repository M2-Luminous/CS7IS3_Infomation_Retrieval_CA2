FBIS4-37108 "drnes117_l_94002" FBIS-NES-94-117 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Netanyahu Refuses To Comment Netanyahu Refuses To Comment TA1706062494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0405 GMT 17 Jun 94 TA1706062494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Telephone interview with Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu by Hayim Zissowitz; place not given -- live] [Excerpt] [Zissowitz] We called you this morning to discuss the possible establishment of a coalition by the Likud and Hayim Ramon's faction in the Histadrut labor federation, but we obviously cannot ignore the news of your meeting with Jordan's Crown Prince Hasan in London in May. [Netanyahu] Why not? We definitely can. I have nothing to say about that. [Zissowitz] Did you meet? [Netanyahu] To repeat, I have no intention of getting into a discussion of this issue. I thought you called me to ask me about other things. [Zissowitz] I began by saying that we wanted to discuss other matters with you, but that we could not ignore this piece of news which was first reported last night. I believe you have not categorically denied it. [Netanyahu] I can only tell you one thing: I think the attempt made by certain elements in the last two years to portray the Likud as the enemy of peace -- as opposed to the supporters of peace -- has been futile. After all, it was the Likud that brought about the two big steps: the Camp David accords with Egypt and the Madrid conference on direct peace talks with all our neighbors. The Likud adheres to its concept that the attainment of a genuine peace must be based on security and our ability to protect this peace with arrangements that will prevent its disintegration and its deterioration into a new war. The Likud proved this ability and continues to adhere to this concept, whether it is in the government or in the opposition, and will continue to do so when I am once again in the government. [Zissowitz] Not everybody in the Likud sees eye to eye with you on this issue. Last time when you voiced your support for contacts with Jordan and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's meeting with King Husayn, former Prime Minister Yitzhaq Shamir lashed out at you and asked you on what basis you were making such declarations. [Netanyahu] I will not comment on such speculations and utterances. I can only tell you that Yitzhaq Shamir, just like many other members of the Likud -- its overwhelming majority, if not all of it -- firmly and clearly support the attainment of a peace agreement with Jordan. I have always said this would be one of our objectives. That is why we went to the Madrid conference and why the Likud government conducted negotiations with Jordan. This was and remains our objective. [Zissowitz] Do you still adhere to your declaration about Jordan -- East Palestine [previous three words in English]? [Netanyahu] I have always said and continue to say today that the solution of the question of Eretz Yisra'el and the status of the Palestinian Arabs between us and the Arabs will be found through two, not three, countries. Such a solution will be attained by the Jewish state in western Eretz Yisra'el -- the State of Israel -- and the Arab country with a Palestinian majority located on the eastern part of Mandatory Palestine -- the state of Jordan. We could reach a stable arrangement in negotiations with Jordan and the Palestinian Arabs; not the arrangement which is now disintegrating before our very eyes in Gaza and Jericho, but a different one. Negotiations with these two elements -- the state of Jordan and the Palestinian Arabs -- would enable us to arrive at an autonomy arrangement rather than at a state. [Zissowitz] I suppose you were asked by your interlocutors -- or your interlocutor, if the reported meeting indeed took place -- whether as part of the understandings with Jordan you would be prepared to arrive at a territorial compromise with it, not with the Palestinian Arabs. [Netanyahu] I suggest you do not make any suppositions. To repeat, I will not comment on those reports. I suggest that we stick to what I have just said. [Zissowitz] But would you be prepared in principle? [Netanyahu] I reiterate: It is our position that the territory west of the Jordan River should remain under Israel's sovereignty and our security domination. However, contrary to the situation that has existed since the Six-Day War, we aspire to revert from a military regime to a civilian government, to autonomy for the Arabs and security for the Jews. This concept has not changed. [passage omitted]
