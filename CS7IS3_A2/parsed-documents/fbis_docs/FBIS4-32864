He said that the government is worried about the problem as customs barriers are being eliminated over the entire world, and dumping and subsidies are becoming frequent practices in international trade. "In these cases we need to react immediately, or face the disappearance of some industries," he said. Alvares mentioned the case of the textile industry, which faces competition from Korean products arriving in Brazil with prices 50 percent below domestic prices. "We cannot stop encouraging trade at lower prices," he said, but "we also cannot allow subsidies or dumping practices," he added. According to the minister, Mercosur [Common Market of the South] is particularly important in combating these two unfair trade practices that hurt the free market, as the regional trade bloc strengthens the position of Brazil in international forums such as GATT. The minister also said that the participation of private initiative in the detection of harmful practices in trade is essential. Alvares said that Mercosur is already a real market. Businessmen from the four member countries--Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay--are already identifying potential joint actions and solutions to common problems. He mentioned the initiative of the shoe industry businessmen of Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, who are contacting their Argentine and Uruguayan counterparts to defend themselves from the trade actions of Chinese shoe producers in the international market. The Second Southern Cone Marketing Congress began today with an attendance of 2,500 -- 1,000 more than what was expected by the Parana Marketing and Sales Managers Association (ADVB), which is organizing the congress. The congress will last until 31 May, and among its highlights will be presentations by Alvin Toffler, one of the greatest international marketing specialists, and by Serge Ogranovitch, a Frenchman resident in the United States who is a key player in projects for forming economic blocs. Ogranovitch has counseled Japan and its partners in the consolidation of the Asian trade bloc.
