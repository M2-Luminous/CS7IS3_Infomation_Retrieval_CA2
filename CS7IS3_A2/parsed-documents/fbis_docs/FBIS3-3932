Adequate attention must be paid to this issue. Figures show that in 1993, the total value of imports and exports by foreign-funded enterprises in China was $67.07 billion, a 53.3- percent increase over 1992. Of the total import and export value, all of the economic sectors in China (referring to state-owned, collective, joint-venture, solely foreign-owned, and individual economies) they account for 34.3 percent, while exports by foreign- funded industries increased by almost 8 percentage points over 1992. According to estimates, in 1994, the volume of exports by foreign- funded enterprises will account for 40 percent of the total volume of exports in the country. According to relevant experts, what is noteworthy is that, China's estimated foreign debt in 1993 was $80 billion, $10.7 billion more than in 1992. The debt repayment rate is about 16 percent, and this means it has come closer to the foreign debt warning line generally used by the international community. After the unification of China's exchange rate, when foreign-funded enterprises use foreign exchange to pay principle and interest or remit profits, a new, strong external force will emerge and affect the foreign exchange market. Another thing which worries the relevant departments in China is that the net increase in value of exports by foreign-funded enterprises has already surpassed the net increase in the value of exports by other economic sectors in China (mainly state-owned and collective enterprises). In 1993, the total export value of foreign-funded enterprises was $25.24 billion, a 45.4 percent increase over 1992, and the net increase in value was $7.87 billion, which is 27.5 percent of the country's total export value and an increase of 7 percentage points over 1992. The total value of exports by other economic sectors in China decreased in 1993, whereas for imports, the total value of imports by foreign-funded enterprises also climbed to an important position: accounting for 32.8 percent of the country's total import value in 1992 to 40.2 percent of the country's total import value in 1993, and the net value of imports increased 66.1 percent over 1992, whereas the net value of imports by other economic sectors in China increased by only 1.7 percentage points. In order words, growth in imports and exports in China in 1993 was basically determined and realized by foreign-funded enterprises. In addition, data and figures also show that in 1993, China's unfavorable foreign trade balance also came mainly from unfavorable trade balances among foreign-funded enterprises. In 1993, the unfavorable balance between imports and exports in China was $12.18 billion. This was due to the fact that although other economic sectors in China had a favorable balance between imports and exports of about $4 billion, the unfavorable balance between imports and exports from foreign-funded enterprises was $16.59 billion. The unfavorable balance in foreign-funded enterprises was mainly manifested in the use of equipment and materials for their investments in China, with the amount reaching $16.63 billion. According to a relevant informed source, the rapid increase in the proportion of foreign trade carried out by foreign-funded enterprises in China has caused a decrease in the share of foreign trade held by China's state-owned and collective enterprises, and relevant departments in Beijing worry that this will constitute a threat to China's balance of international income and expenditure to the extent of affecting the country's long-term and stable economic development.
