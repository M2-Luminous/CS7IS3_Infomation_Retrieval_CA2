Not only does the government not agree with the decision, it believes that its effect will be serious. Consumption of substances that create addiction cannot be part of the behavior condoned as part of the free development of personality. Legislators must be given the option to ban and punish this, according to his criteria. The government does not share the court's extremely individualistic interpretation of the Constitution in matters related not only to individual autonomy but also to obligations established in the Constitution, in this case Articles 49 and 95. The government considers it its duty to promote the necessary decisions to fill the void and mistakes that might result from the court's decision. Immediately, using authority derived from laws now in effect, the government will issue decrees to prohibit and to confirm prohibitions on the possession and consumption of drugs and psychotropic and hallucinatory substances in at least the following places and events: public places, places open to the public, schools, and workplaces. Drugs will be banned among minors, pregnant women; drivers of vehicles, ships, or airplanes; those who bear firearms; and those who exercise certain professions, such as doctors and dentists. Likewise, we intend to establish penalties for violations of some of the preceding prohibitions, according to each case and the seriousness of the misdemeanor. The penalties will range from arrest, closure of public places, suspension of flight licenses, cancellation of work contracts, suspension or firing of public workers, deportation of foreigners, cancellation of firearm permits, and the suspension of licenses or professional cards. The government reiterates that topics of such importance must take into account what the people have to say, thus the government calls on all Colombian society--political parties, churches, economic associations, workers, peasants, social and community organizations, the academic community, parents and youths--to present together with the government a draft bill with popular initiative, to call a referendum to modify the Constitution to clearly establish the prevalence of the general interest, the possibility of penalizing citizens for not fulfilling their duties, and clearly stating the legislators' prerogative to ban and prohibit the consumption of drugs and psychotropic substances. In the next few weeks the president will call on representatives of the various mentioned institutions and organizations to form promotional committees and begin the necessary formalities for a popular legislative initiative. Given the reaction in the last few days, the national government is certain that is correctly interpreting the feelings of all Colombians in support of the fight against drug trafficking and preventing youths from Colombia and the rest of the world from falling into the claws of today's most damaging perversity--drug consumption.
