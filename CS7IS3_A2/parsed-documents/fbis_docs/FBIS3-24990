In this connection, the Ministry of Interior, Security, and Territorial Administration has issued the following statement: There has been another criminal act in the Atakora Region. The subprefect of Boukoumbe, Mr. (Francis Hessou Tomlimeli) was kidnapped yesterday near [name indistinct] 27 km from Boukoumbe." The minister of interior, security, and territorial administration is trying to find those responsible for this act. In a statement issued this morning he said this criminal act was the work of some armed bandits. "These armed bandits supposedly belong to a gang of former torturers of the Beninese people. According to the statement, this kidnapping demonstrates clearly that the antidemocratic forces have not disarmed yet. This is a very serious criminal act which the Beninese people and government condemn strongly because they want peace, tolerance, and security which are necessary for the country's economic revival and the consolidation of the democratic process embarked upon since the national conference of the active forces. The Beninese Government warns seriously the perpetrators of this sordid act as well as their accomplices both within and outside the country and who are supporting and assisting them against the consequences of their action and it holds them responsible for the life and safety of the Boukoumbe subprefect. The Beninese Government, therefore, demands the immediate and unconditional release of the subprefect. In any case, the statement went on, the Beninese Government is determined to fight banditry in all its forms and it will take necessary measures to annihilate these bandits who have deliberately chosen to go against the desire of our people."
