FR940622-2-00070 FR940622-2-00054 Drug Enforcement Administration Revised Aggregate Production Quotas for Controlled Substances in Schedules I and II AGENCY: Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Justice. ACTION: Notice of final revised aggregate production quotas for 1994. SUMMARY: This notice establishes revised 1994 aggregate production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). EFFECTIVE DATE: This order is effective on June 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Howard McClain, Jr., Chief, Drug & Chemical Evaluation Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC 20537, telephone: (202) 307&hyph;7183. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 306 of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 826) requires the Attorney General to establish aggregate production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II each year. This responsibility has been delegated to the Administrator of the DEA pursuant to §0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Administrator, in turn, has redelegated this function to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994). On April 13, 1994, a notice of the proposed revised 1994 aggregate production quotas for certain controlled substances in Schedules I and II was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 17568). All interested parties were invited to comment on or object to these proposed aggregate production quotas on or before May 13, 1994. Several companies commented that the revised 1994 aggregate production quotas for amphetamine, codeine (for sale), d-desoxyephedrine, opium, oxycodone (for sale), pentobarbital and secobarbital were insufficient to provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research and industry needs of the United States, for export requirements and for the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks. The DEA has reviewed the involved companies' 1993 year-end inventories, their initial 1994 manufacturing quotas, 1994 export requirements and their actual and projected 1994 sales. Based on this data, the DEA has adjusted the revised 1994 aggregate production quotas for amphetamine, codeine (for sale), d-desoxyephedrine, opium, oxycodone (for sale), pentobarbital and secobarbital to meet the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States. Regarding levorphanol, methylphenidate, phencyclidine and sufentanil, DEA has received updated information from several manufacturers which shows the necessity for adjustments of the revised 1994 aggregate production quotas for these controlled substances. The adjustments will provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States and for the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks. The DEA has adjusted the 1994 revised aggregate production quotas for levorphanol, methylphenidate, phencyclidine and sufentanil accordingly. The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq. The establishment of aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law and by international treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large manufacturers, their impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator has determined that this action does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by §0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994), the Deputy Administrator hereby orders that the 1994 revised aggregate production quotas, expressed in grams of anhydrous acid or base, be established as follows: ␣ 1Basic class 1Established revised 1994 quotas Schedule I: 2,5-Dimethoxyamphetamine 15,510,000 Schedule II: Alfentanil 8,000 Amphetamine 787,000 Codeine (for sale) 61,765,000 d-Desoxyephedrine 22,100 Diphenoxylate 638,000 Levorphanol 8,500 Methylphenidate 7,313,000 Opium 1,242,000 Oxycodone (for sale) 3,853,000 Oxycodone (for conversion) 5,400 Oxymorphone 2,420 Pentobarbital 17,000,000 Phencyclidine 62 Secobarbital 550,000 Sufentanil 897 Dated: June 15, 1994.
