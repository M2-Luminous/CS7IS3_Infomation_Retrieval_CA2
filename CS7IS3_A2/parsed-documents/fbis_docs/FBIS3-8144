Today Ikonomov was received by President Kiro Gligorov to whom he delivered a message by Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev. The message, a reply to a recent letter by Gligorov, emphasizes Bulgaria's principled stand for the promotion of relations with Macedonia. It stresses Bulgaria's desire to develop with its neighbours, including the young Macedonian state, a policy based on mutual understanding and friendship. In a special message to President Zhelev, the Macedonian president had thanked him for the support the Republic of Macedonia received from Bulgaria after Greece had imposed a unilateral economic embargo against it. The exchange of personal messages between the presidents of Bulgaria and Macedonia is an important part of direct contacts between the state leaders of the two neighbouring countries and has a great significance for the regulation of bilateral relations. Political observers here see this fact as evidence of the willingness of Sofia and Skopje to promote cooperation in the difficult situation in the Balkans, leaving behind points of dispute accumulated in the past.
