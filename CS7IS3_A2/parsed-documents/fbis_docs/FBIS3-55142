A man sits among sheets of paper scattered all around the table and shabby couch in a narrow room with a view of a fire-devastated building. He is a close confidant and personal friend of Zhirinovskiy's, one of the founders of the party, the editor of the party bulletin, which has a bizarre name: "Zhirinovskiy's Justice" (and the minister of finances of the party's shadow cabinet. Zhirinovskiy has already proposed to Chernomyrdin, current Russian prime minister, that he take this man into his cabinet and give him the same portfolio.) The man we are talking about is Stanislav Mikhaylovich Zhebrovskiy! A large map of the former Soviet Union hangs on the wall, with white-blue party flags designating the places where Zhirinovskiy won. It is conspicuous that the most convincing victories were deep in the Russian provinces, in smaller industrial townships, in which the political economic giants used to prosper in the communist era, while now most of them are going to rack and ruin or are overwhelmed by losses. The newspapers that support the democratic parties in Russia claim that, like Zhirinovskiy, Zhebrovskiy is of Jewish origin, although he is a greater Russian nationalist. [Vurusic] Mr. Zhebrovskiy, although it seemed that you were the one who won the elections, some papers have reported that in the new parliament, that is in the Federation Council and Duma, the greatest number of seats will be occupied by the pro-Yeltsin Russia's Choice. [Zhebrovsky] It is all nonsense, and the futile expectations of our so-called democrats. These elections were for party lists and individuals. Our party list won the greatest number of votes. And it did so quite convincingly, indeed! The Russian people did not want to vote for the repulsive and detestable Russia's Choice. As far as I know, only 8 percent of the electorate voted for that party list. However, Russia's Choice played a trick on the voters in the case of some lists, representing its candidates as independents. If it had been known that they were the candidates of Russia's Choice, the Russian people would have rejected them with loathing. For our people, it is like waving a red rag in front of a bull when you mention Russia's Choice. I witnessed an incident in Podolsk, when the people almost beat up the Russia's Choice candidate at its campaign rally. That is the real state of affairs. [Vurusic] Foreign policy issues are an important part of your platform. You have put forward some new proposals for settling the crisis in former Yugoslavia, but it seems you support the Serbian side, in fact. [Zhebrovsky] We support the Slav side! [Vurusic] Croats are Slavs, too. [Zhebrovskiy] All right, but you have Muslims there as well. In the region of former Yugoslavia we support the Slav, Christian-Orthodox side in the war, that is the Serbs. We are paying great attention, with a great deal of concern and anxiety indeed, to the way the Muslim ideology is breaking into Europe. They have been trying to conquer Europe for a long time and in various ways. For that reason one has to be extremely cautious. In our opinion, religion plays the most important role in that war. Muslims are the greatest danger to Europe. They are using you to establish their domination. Christianity must not allow that! [Vurusic] Although the official election results have not come in yet, you have already received Vojislav Seselj's telegram from Belgrade congratulating you on your victory, while the representatives of your party also visited him in Belgrade.... [Zhebrovskiy] I have not seen that telegram yet, and there is nothing I can tell you about it. Still, Zhirinovskiy was in Belgrade, and, as far as I know, he did meet Seselj.... [Vurusic] Your party is called a pro-fascist party, and some people claim you are maintaining contact with your European counterparts. You said yourself that you had contacts with Seselj's Radical Party, which is openly pro-fascist.... [Zhebrovskiy] Come on, what kind of fascists are we? You have swallowed the propaganda bait of our so-called democrats, who are nothing but neo-bolsheviks. They are ready to do anything to stay in power. They are in a panic that they might lose it. They have brought such a powerful country as Russia to its knees, and now they are allowing the Americans to exploit it for miserable amounts of money in return. We want to see Russia on its feet again, in all its grandeur and beauty. Therefore they are afraid of us, and are trying to blacken us by calling us fascists, chauvinists, racists, and anti-Semites. They are even ready to trigger a civil war! Do you know how far they are going? They are even lying to our President Boris Yeltsin, and blocking his actions. They are constantly misinforming him, because the television is in their hands, and they prevent anyone telling President Yeltsin what the real state of affairs is. They are now in a terrible panic, because they are afraid of Yeltsin's personally meeting someone who will tell him the truth straight to his face, without reluctance. That man is Zhirinovskiy! [Vurusic] To return to the subject of former Yugoslavia, and your attitude toward the international initiatives to end the war.... [Zhebrovskiy] We are against that war, and I think that Yugoslavia is the first drill-ground where the method of crushing and partitioning a state organized according to the national-territorial principle has been tested. We are against such a state organization. The best way to organize a state is on the territorial principle, not the national principle. Cultural autonomy -- yes, but no state should allow national-territorial autonomy! There cannot exist several states in one state. For instance, we support the idea that in Russia the question of national affiliation should be completely abolished. We do not ask our members about their national affiliation. Foreign journalists are always surprised when we say that we are not able to throw light on the national structure of the Liberal Democratic Party, because we simply do not ask anybody about it. What some people want to see happening on the larger scale, in Russia, is already happening in Yugoslavia, on a smaller scale. We also have Christian and Muslim factors here, and those people want to make them collide. [Vurusic] Still, it seems that you see the greatest danger in the Muslims.... [Zhebrovskiy] Look at what is happening near Russia, on its southern borders. Turkey claims millions of square kilometers of regions which were under Russian jurisdiction for many centuries and which have become independent states by some treacherous miracle. Turkish expansionism wants Azerbaijan, Armenia, the greatest part of our Central Asian regions. Turkish expansionism also involves the region of former Yugoslavia, however, and the bells may soon toll for Bulgaria as well. We think that such a young religion as Islam -- which is radical and impatient -- is the greatest danger. A young religion is just like a young man: ungovernable and assertive. Christianity is like a mature man: wise and restrained. We are divided by 700 years. Just remember early Christianity: wars, crusades, inquisition.... Such things do not exist any more. Therefore the Muslims are sending their followers to wage wars.... [Vurusic] How do you view the Muslim state in Bosnia-Herzegovina today? [Zhebrovskiy] It must not be allowed. Your Muslims are largely assisted by the Arab and other Islamic countries with weapons and oil, while those countries even represent Bosnia-Herzegovina in various international forums. If there were no such and similar aid, there would be far fewer problems in the region, and they would be easily solved. [Vurusic] Quite probably, because there would be nothing the Muslims could fight with. [Zhebrovskiy] It seems as though you did not understand what the Muslims want. I also find the behavior of the West quite incomprehensible. Look what the greatest Western cities are turning into! Mosques are mushrooming in all the cities where the Western Christian culture was conceived. There is the smell of roast mutton everywhere on the streets. Just look at Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam. By the turn of the century the number of Muslims in Paris will have exceeded the number of Frenchmen. Where is this leading? One should look at the future. I ask you: Who will then be considered a foreigner by whom? A Frenchman by an Arab, or an Arab by a Frenchman? The West does not understand what is happening in former Yugoslavia. The Western culture is absolutely different from the Eastern culture. [Vurusic] Then, are you still in favor or the Serbs' retaining the occupied territories in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia? [Zhebrovskiy] The most important thing is that peace is established there, and that blood is no longer shed. In order to accomplish that, however, perhaps one will have to implement some violent measures. It is better to destroy the source of evil now than let it spread and develop. [Vurusic] Who and what do you think is that evil you are talking about? [Zhebrovskiy] I will not discuss the details. It is politics we are discussing now! It is not pursued by giving interviews. It involves lengthy negotiations, compromises, persuasion, interests. We should go for peace, for cooperation. Not all the people are able to understand everything that can happen. And in large part it is already happening in former Yugoslavia. When two cultures meet, the later one starts to feel stronger, or at least capable of imposing itself on the other. If that problem is not settled, the war will last at least another 30 years: You have a lot of mountains there, the peoples are bellicose, and weapons will be coming in. [Vurusic] Are you an anti-Muslim racist, in view of what you have just said? [Zhebrovskiy] Of course I am not! I am just warning of the danger, but I am not calling for a war against them. Besides, until recently I did not even know that our party has many Muslim members. When public opinion started denouncing us, alleging that we are anti-Muslim racists, our Muslim members felt the need to say publicly that it was not true. [Vurusic] In a recent interview for Radio Hamburg, Zhirinovskiy said that there could be another Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, but this time Russia would drop the bombs. How does that fit in with the appeals for peace and cooperation you called for after the elections? [Zhebrovskiy] I was not present when that interview was given, so I am not able to explain what the statement actually means. I have been present during many of Zhirinovskiy's appearances, but I have never heard him say anything like that. However, we first have to see the context in which that statement was made. Perhaps it was taken out of context. Perhaps he was asked what he would do if Japan attacked us. We have to check what was said before and after that statement. Nevertheless, in this case I dare say it is a pure lie. [Vurusic] It is said that your party is sending volunteers to Iraq, to help Saddam Husayn, as well as to Serbia.... [Zhebrovskiy] That is yet another piece of misinformation. No member of ours has ever been sent by our party to volunteer there. [Vurusic] Still, there are Russians fighting on the side of the Serbs.... [Zhebrovskiy] We have never sent anybody there. [Vurusic] Would you send the Russian Army to intervene in former Yugoslavia? [Zhebrovskiy] Zhirinovskiy's statement is clear: Not a single Russian soldier will fight in a foreign country any longer. We shall withdraw our army from all the countries where its troops have been stationed. [Vurusic] How do you assess the fact that most of the Russian soldiers serving with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in Croatia voted for your party? [Zhebrovskiy] They have understood that our party will help to make it possible for them to leave that region as soon as possible. [Vurusic] Does that mean that you will officially demand that Russia withdraw its UNPROFOR troops from Croatia? [Zhebrovskiy] We shall make public our attitude in that respect very soon, and propose it to all the major states in the world. One has to make radical changes in the approach to the Yugoslav crisis. One ought finally to tell the truth about what is happening there! [Vurusic] What is the truth? [Zhebrovskiy] The nationalistic games, plundering of assets, and geopolitical games of Germany, America, and Arabia. Many people will feel quite uncomfortable when we put forward our proposal, both in the East and the West. You can expect our proposal to come soon. Vengerovskiy: When We Won, Panic Broke Out in the World! [Vurusic] I am sitting in the foyer of the office usually occupied by Zhirinovskiy. After his celebratory news conference he took a vacation and left Moscow, refusing interviews and public appearances, and surrendering a part of his unexpected fame to his closest aides and veterans, who are ironically referred to by Moscow's democratic circles as "veterans of Moscow's stinking beer-cellars," an allusion to Munich's beer-cellars from where Adolph Hitler set out into the world of politics. I am waiting to be received by the second most important man of the party, Aleksandr Dmitriyevich Vengerovskiy, head of the party's intelligence-security service, whom Zhirinovskiy intends to propose to President Yeltsin as prime minister of the Russian Government. On the wall behind Vengerovskiy, right above his head, hangs the map of Russia as conceived by Zhirinovskiy: From Finland to Alaska, while the prominent detail on the map is an eagle, holding in his beak a banner reading Freedom and Law, which is, according to Vengerovskiy, the goal of the party's policy. Right at the beginning of the interview he feels it necessary to say that the war in former Yugoslavia is not the most important thing in the world. Russian citizens have many severe problems, and their greatest priority now is to solve them. Besides, he says, he does not conceal his former membership in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and, unlike many other people, he neither kept his membership card hidden nor did he burn it. Therefore the first question is whether he feels sorry that the Soviet Union has ceased to exist. [Vengerovskiy] I feel sorry that Soviet Union disintegrated. We were the only party in Russia that condemned that act. I think that from that moment on Russia has been going downhill, and given our success in the elections, Russia and the Russian people have been given a chance to change the situation. [Vurusic] Do you think that Russia today does not occupy the place it deserves on the international political stage? [Vengerovskiy] Of course I do! What was the Soviet Union before? An important political factor, a superpower, while now it is a giant on its knees. Because of the policy that has been pursued so far Russia has become a state of second-rate importance. In Russia the death rate is higher than the birth rate! We are a state without international borders. Our historical borders are now thousands of kilometers away from Russia, although borders, according to the Helsinki document, are irrevocable. [Vurusic] Do you understand the former Soviet Union as Russia? [Vengerovskiy] And what do you think it was? The Soviet Union was founded on the territory of the Russian Empire, some peoples were given national autonomy, and look now -- they are independent states! Russia has been left without access to sea, without large harbors. We have slid back into medieval Russia. Do you think that is normal? Of course it is not! Therefore we want to restore dignity and esteem to our fatherland, and to make it take the place again that belongs to it in the world. [Vurusic] Does this mean you want the Russia represented by the map above your armchair, including Finland, Poland, and Alaska? [Vengerovskiy] That is Russia in its best and most famous days. We are in favor of having neighborly relations with all countries, but we shall demand the revocation of aid and the privileged status in the sphere of economic relations that was bestowed on those former Soviet republics whose policy we find unsatisfactory. Of course, we shall elaborate the program of aid and privileges for other countries, as well as regulations the disregarding of which might lead to revocation of those privileges. This means that our attitude toward those republics will depend on their behavior. These are normal relations in international foreign policy. [Vurusic] What will your contribution to Russian foreign policy be? [Vengerovskiy] It will be as large as possible! Earlier, Russia's word used to count, its opinion was important, and it was fully taken into account in international relations. We shall do all we can to make things like that again. You see, as soon as we won, journalists from all over the world flocked to Moscow, because panic broke out in the world. That panic means that from now on the world will be paying more attention to Russia's opinion. Let me paraphrase Earnest Hemingway: "When the bell tolls, perhaps it tolls for you!" [Vurusic] I have to ask you a question regarding the war in Yugoslavia, particularly because you support the Serbian side.... [Vengerovskiy] We usually find out what has been happening in former Yugoslavia from our members who have been there. Personally, I have been best informed by the author Edward Lymonov. You know from history that our Slav brothers, Serbs and Montenegrins, have always been close to us! We are bound together historically. We also know that Croats are Slavs as well. But the Serbs are much closer to us, because they are Christian-Orthodox. We have defended them many times. What is happening in former Yugoslavia right now is absolutely abnormal! It is a religious war! Let us say "No!" to all your nation states! We do not want Russia to be founded on the national principle. Let Yugoslavia be founded, as was Russia before, or as the United States is now, on the principle of states [gubernija]. Vsevold Gaplyn: In the Russian Christian-Orthodox Church We Have Monarchists, and Even Communists! [Vurusic] In the last few years, after decades of the Soviet authorities, the Russian Christian Orthodox Church has started to reassume the place it had for many centuries. Many churches were demolished, most of the clergy were expelled, and believers were imprisoned. Even the very top of the Russian Christian Orthodox Church was controlled by the almighty KGB. On the eve of the recent bloody events in the Russian Parliament, the Russian Christian Orthodox Church and its patriarch, Aleksey II, were mediators in the negotiations between the conflicting factions. The mediating mission failed, which, as is said, was taken quite badly among church officials. They even consider that the church has missed a chance to win the political and religious place in Russian society it had at the time of the empire, when Orthodoxy was recognized as the official state religion. Although church officials deny it, the Russian Christian Orthodox Church exerts significant influence on the politics of other Christian Orthodox churches, so that after the outbreak of war in former Yugoslavia, several meetings took place between Pavle, patriarch of the Serbian Christian-Orthodox Church, and Patriarch Aleksey II. In Danilovskiy monastery, which dates from the 13th century and is now the home of the Department of Foreign Church Affairs of the Patriarch of Russian Christian Orthodox Church, we are talking with father Vsevold Gaplyn, head of inter-church cooperation and relations with international organizations. Danilovskiy monastery was nationalized right after the revolution in 1917, and until 1983, when it was given back to the church, it had been a prison for the children of political prisoners. What is the role of the Russian Christian Orthodox Church today, given the changed political conditions? [Gaplyn] The church wants to act in a pacifying way, and our main task is the salvation of human souls. If people are suffering, the church has to protect them and take care of them. If people are living well, and in compliance with the laws of God, then church-state relations will also be good. You are aware of the recent tragic events, caused by the political crisis in society and in the relations between the former parliament and President Yeltsin. In that situation we tried to play a peacekeeping role, and at one moment it appeared to us that our mission would be successful, but unfortunately, human malice and mutual intolerance, as well as destructive and murderous instincts were stronge, and brought about tragic events. Regardless of such an outcome, however, the Russian Christian Orthodox Church will always support peace, and strive for it. Our authority in society is great and indisputable, and for that reason we are becoming a desirable ally of many political forces. The church, however, is above politics, it is above political conflicts. It cannot be otherwise, because the church itself involves monarchists, and even communists. [Vurusic] Regarding the war that is going on in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, many people maintain, even some in Russia, that it is a religious war, because its warring factions are Catholic, Muslim, and Christian Orthodox.... [Gaplyn] As far as I know, the highest officials of the Serbian Christian Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church reject any notion that a religious war is being waged in former Yugoslavia. In their letters and addresses to believers both Cardinal Kuharic and Patriarch Pavle are interceding for peace. We in the Russian Orthodox Church also think that the roots and reasons for that terrible war in former Yugoslavia are of political origin, rather than religious. As for the relations between the Russian and Serbian Orthodox Churches, I have to underline that they are very close and brotherly, because the language of our service is the same. The Russian church completely supports the Serbian church in this war. We are very happy to see that the representatives of the Serbian church are cooperating and making efforts to find the path of peace together with the officials of the Catholic Church in Croatia! [Vurusic] The Serbs often boast about their Orthodox brotherhood with Russians and Russia, considering it their great protector, no matter what they do. Do you think that such boasting might sometimes damage the Russian Orthodox Church's reputation? [Gaplyn] Our relationship with the Serbian people is brotherly. We understand their hopes and expectations. Still, that brotherhood must not be understood as support for conduct that opposes Christian morality and peace efforts. [Vurusic] The Serbian church happens to be in the center of yet another problem. That is the demand that the Macedonian and Montenegrin Orthodox Churches be independent, and have their own patriarch.... [Gaplyn] From the point of view of ordinary Christian Orthodoxy, there is no such thing as an autocephalous Macedonian Orthodox Church! No such thing is recognized by any of the existing orthodox churches in the world. In that point the Russian church supports its Serbian counterpart. I think that the question of the independence of a particular church structure cannot be solved by overthrowing the economic structure of the church, as has happened in Macedonia, or in Ukraine. As for the Montenegrin situation, I see no reason for the Montenegrins to have church independence at all! [Vurusic] A considerable number of orthodox believers live in Croatia, so there are even suggestions that a sort of Croatian orthodox church should be founded. What would be the Russian Orthodox Church's reaction to that? [Gaplyn] I am not familiar with such suggestions. Nevertheless, it would be the following: There are church parishes, and they are administratively connected. Since certain Croatian parishes are economically linked to the Serbian church and Patriarch Pavle, it is logical that the Serbian church's opinion should be taken into account. Only with its permission could a part of its territorial property be given a certain degree of independence. [Vurusic] Do you have any contact with Cardinal Kuharic, and the representatives of the Captol [site of cathedral] in Zagreb? [Gaplyn] No, we do not, but we would like to have contact with Cardinal Kuharic, and the Zagreb Captol, so that we could obtain more information. Some time ago I met the representatives of the Croatian Protestant Church in Barcelona. It was a very instructive and interesting conversation. We found a common language also in our desire to see peace in your country as soon as possible. [Vurusic] What are your relations with the Vatican today? [Gaplyn] Somehow in 1988 and 1989 relations with the Vatican worsened. At that time Catholic evangelism started in Russia, and the missionaries did not always behave properly. As we see it, they did not always act in compliance with our mutual vocation on earth, they did not always behave in accordance with their laws. They did not take account of our Russian pride, our tradition and culture, but just this year it appears that relations with the Vatican have started to improve.
