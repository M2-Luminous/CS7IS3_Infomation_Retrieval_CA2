FR940404-2-00011 FR940404-2-00008 International Trade Administration [C&hyph;357&hyph;803] Leather From Argentina; Termination of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of termination of countervailing duty administrative review. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) has terminated the countervailing duty administrative review of leather from Argentina, initiated on November 27, 1992. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anne S. D'Alauro or Richard Herring, Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 30, 1992, Camara de la Industria Curtidora Argentina (CICA), and its individually named companies, Curtiembres Fonseca, Federico Meiners and CIDEC, requested that the Department conduct an administrative review of the countervailing duty order on leather from Argentina (55 FR 40212; October 2, 1990) for the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. The requesting member companies of CICA exported leather to the United States during the period of review and are, therefore, interested parties pursuant to ยง355.2(i) of the Department's regulations. No other interested party requested the review. On November 27, 1992, the Department initiated the administrative review for that period (55 FR 56318). On February 11, 1993, CICA and its requesting member companies withdrew their request for an administrative review. Since the request for withdrawal was timely in accordance with 19 CFR 355.22(a)(3), and because we have no reason to deny the request, the Department is terminating this review. This notice is published in accordance with 19 CFR 355.22(a)(3). Dated: March 25, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.
