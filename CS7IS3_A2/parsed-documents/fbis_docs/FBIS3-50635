Television Azteca has interviewed Government Secretary General Rafael Gonzalez Lastre, as follows: [Begin recording] [Gonzalez] Thank you for this opportunity to speak on this channel. Yesterday, we took it upon ourselves to inform the people over radio and television. Today, we want to urge everyone and all groups to be prudent. Today, more than ever before, we must act in a serious, professional, and responsible manner. We must not listen to gossip and comments that seek to confuse the people and make them restless. The city of Tuxtla Gutierrez and surrounding areas are protected. There is no possibility at all that this transgressor group will appear here. I have just said there is only one small area in Altamirano municipality where there is some unrest, and something very small is going on in Ocosingo. [Reporter] Do you have any information on former Governor Absalon? [Gonzalez Lastre] Yesterday, it was confirmed to us that General Absalon Castellano Dominguez, the former governor of Chiapas, is being held by these persons. So far, we have no information on his whereabouts, but we fully trust that our Mexican Army will once again fulfill its duty and just as it rescued the Solorzano family in Ocosingo, it will rescue the former governor who also has the honor of belonging to our Mexican Army. [Reporter] Mr. Gonzalez: Have the five envoys of the U.S. Embassy contacted you? [Gonzalez Lastre] Representatives from the French Embassy visited me on Sunday. We learned about the representatives from the U.S. Embassy.... [pauses] but I have not had the opportunity to meet with them directly and personally as I met with the representatives of the French Embassy. I do want to guarantee that the Chiapas State Government is ready to give all the information and cooperation that its fellow countrymen might need. [end recording]
