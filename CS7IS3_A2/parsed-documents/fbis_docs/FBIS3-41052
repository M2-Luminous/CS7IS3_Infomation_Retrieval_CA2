This was a statement made by People's Deputy of Ukraine Serhiy Holovatyy at a news conference held in Kiev. [passage omitted] [Holovatyy] My opinion is that officials from Ukraine's leadership circles have falsified the Ukrainian Supreme Council's resolution of 3 February 1994 [ratifying the START I Treaty]. These actions fall within those provided by the Criminal Code of Ukraine with regard to the crime under the name of falsification when in [civil] service. The matter here is this. The initial version of Paragraph 2 of the draft of this resolution submitted by the Ukrainian president, was as follows: The Government of Ukraine will be instructed to exchange the ratification certificates relating to the START Treaty. During the discussion of this paragraph, I put forward an amendment, the essence of which was as follows: The sentence in the president's draft is to be augmented as follows: And to this end the government will step up its activity to conclude specific international agreements that follow from the reservations in the Supreme Council's resolution on the ratification of the START I Treaty [the resolution in question now is the original one of 18 November 1993]. The second paragraph of the resolution, with my amendment in it, was put to the vote and adopted. However, the official text of the Supreme Council's resolution, printed in government newspapers, offers a different version. It reads as follows: The Government of Ukraine will be instructed to exchange the certificates on the ratification of the START Treaty and will step up its activity to conclude specific international agreements that follow from the reservations in the Ukrainian Supreme Council's resolution on the ratification of the START I Treaty. The words -- to this end -- have been excluded from my amendment. I regard this as a correction that has essentially altered the text of the decision, rather than linguistically correcting or editing it. This is because the three words -- to this end -- and the sentence, or the decision, in Paragraph 2 with these three words, envisage that the sequence of the government's actions relating to the START I will be as follows: First, concluding international agreements that follow from the resolution of 18 November [1993] -- when putting forward this amendment, in particular, I primarily had in mind security guarantees -- and then exchanging the ratification certificates. The falsified text lacks this sequence. The conjunction -- and -- enabled the government to make a statement that Ukraine had lifted all reservations concerning the START I Treaty and, accordingly, security guarantees. So, I cannot interpret the lack of correspondence between the text of the shorthand record and the text of the official document published in the press, as anything other than a crime when in [public] service.
