Executive Committee member Samir Ghawshah said after the meeting that the Committee introduced some amendments to the program that the Palestinian National Authority Council had discussed and approved last night. Ghawshah added that this is an interim program that will be used until general elections are held in the West Bank and Gaza. He declared that the program demonstrates that the National Authority will carry out its tasks through the concerned departments in a spirit of national commitment and will rely on Palestinian experts in various fields. Ghawshah announced that the Palestinian National Authority is committed to all the agreements, treaties, and charters signed by the PLO and that it will seek to implement the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, "the Gaza-Jericho Agreement," as a first step toward the restoration of the Palestinian people's legitimate rights. He said the program approved today emphasizes Palestine's Arabness and the National Authority's desire to nurture close ties with the Arab countries. He noted that the program also stresses the National Authority's adherence to UN resolutions, particularly Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. [Cairo MENA in Arabic at 1810 GMT on 28 May reports: "The Palestinian National Authority Council today appointed Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad a member of the Council and minister of transport and communications. He is the 15th minister named."] [The MENA report continues: "Faysal al-Husayni and Munib al-Masri remain members of the Palestinian National Authority Council, but without portfolios. Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi has refused to be a member of the Council even though 'Arafat offered her the information portfolio. Sari Nusaybah has so far neither accepted nor declined 'Arafat's selection of him as a National Authority Council member. Faysal al-Husayni had formerly announced that he wished to devote his time to the Jerusalem issue and did not want to assume a ministerial post."]
