Quite recently, in 1992, progressive public opinion as a whole rejoiced at the closure of two industrial reactors located in the secret underground complex at Krasnoyarsk-26 that produced weapons-grade plutonium, the substance used to fill nuclear warheads. This event really was something to be pleased about. However, unresolved problems connected with radiochemical production and the territories contaminated by this nuclear production were swept under the carpet; these problems are now making themselves felt with increasing frequency. What is to be done with the accumulated plutonium and radioactive waste? And finally, what is to be done with the thousands of people who forged the nuclear shield? This entire cluster of problems has come to the fore in the closed city of Krasnoyarsk-26. Time Bomb Environmental catastrophe is the natural result of the work carried out by the Krasnoyarsk nuclear scientists. The true scale of the environmental contamination is only now becoming apparent. For almost 30 years liquid radioactive waste from military production has been pumped underground -- into the aquiferous sand and clay strata beneath the ``Severnyy'' installation. Radioactive waste is still being pumped today. According to data published openly in the press, the underground reservoir has received millions of cubic meters of radioactive waste with a total radioactivity level of hundreds of millions of curies. On the basis of its design parameters, this reservoir is now full to capacity. The underground reservoirs are infinitely expandable. Nevertheless, if an additional RT-2 plant is then built to reclaim the spent nuclear fuel, it seems likely that ``Severnyy'' will have to accept tritium. This installation is unique in many ways. In the opinion of specialists, it is the only storage facility in the world that operates a dual system of injection and discharge wells. As radioactive waste is pumped in, underground stratal water is drawn off. These processes deep underground are monitored via a system of observation wells. The site of the installation is also extremely interesting -- it is located in the Yenisey valley (the distance between the river channel and the edge of the installation is 750 meters) on a high terrace (100 meters above the level of water in the river). Experts are extremely skeptical about the impermeability of the screen designed to stop the radioactive waste from moving toward the river. And, generally speaking, ``tongues'' of waste, judging from geological maps of the area, can travel unpredictably large distances. But that is not all. The installation is located in an extremely unfavorable site in geological-tectonic terms. Hydrogeologist A. Goryunov has the following to say: ```Severnyy's' location is unique. The fact is that in zones where there are regional faults, the various elements of the earth's crust are arranged in blocks, so to speak, and this basically cannot ensure safe, long-term storage of nuclear waste. Moreover, world experience demonstrates that in geotectonic conditions such as these, there is an increased risk of seismic activity.... These processes are unpredictable. The installation poses a potential contaminatory threat to the Yenisey and the waters of the Arctic Ocean. Accidents connected with leakage of radioactive waste are possible and could be described as serious and global in their implications.'' Liquid industrial waste is conveyed to the installation via a 15km-long pipeline. According to V. Savelyev, director of the chemical isotope plant, no cases of radioactive waste leaking to the surface have been noted throughout the period the plant has been operating. Meanwhile, last fall a public environmental-technical expert study of the installation began. A preliminary conclusion on the results of the investigation into the radiological condition of the soil along the course of the pipeline has already been prepared within the framework of this study. The results have been described as ``conflicting.'' Your IZVESTIYA correspondent has met with V. Chechetkin, leader of the field investigation and director of the regional center for radioecological studies. According to him, two major areas of radioactive contamination and eight localized spots have been discovered. At the same time, a contaminated sector of the Yenisey floodplain not far from the river bank is causing particular alarm. The streams and gullies located in this region, and also the surface washout, create favorable conditions for the migration of radioisotopes into the general water system. The nature of the contamination leads us to suppose that it may be due to ``seepages'' [prolivy] of liquid radioactive waste. Chechetkin also indicates that the site of the installation on the side adjacent to the village of Bolshoy Balchug is unguarded. There are specially-built wells that anyone can use located at intervals of 100-150 meters. There are also organizations not directly involved in nuclear production located in the vicinity of the pipeline. All these constitute additional risk factors. On the whole, it is obvious to the independent investigators of ``Severnyy'' that it should stop operating. More up-to-date methods should be used to recycle radioactive waste. Yenisey's Nuclear Spoor In a climate of absolute secrecy, the lucid minds of the Soviet defense industry have been destroying the mighty Yenisey for over 30 years. Water from the great river -- the ``hub of Russia'' -- was cleansed of suspended particles and used to cool the radioactive parts of nuclear reactors, after which it was returned to the Yenisey. Recently a number of expeditions have studied the state of the river. Radioactive contamination of the Yenisey floodplain can be traced from the point where waste has been discharged along the course of the river to the Yenisey Gulf; the contamination occurs in patches. Plutonium-238 and -239, cobalt-60, cesium-134 and -137, strontium-90, and other isotopes have all been found in riverbed sediment, algae, sections of river bank washed by floodwater, shoals, sandbars, and islands. Fish containing man-made [tekhnogennyy] radionuclides have been found both downstream of Krasnoyarsk-26 -- at distances of many hundreds of miles -- and upstream, in the vicinity of Greater Krasnoyarsk. The investigators caught one fish which positively ``glowed'' at 580 microcuries per hour. The plutonium content of the soil in some areas of the floodplain is tens of times higher than the total level of contamination. According to data presented by specialists from the Applied Geophysics Institute and the Krasnoyarsk Scientific Center of the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the concentration of plutonium in riverbed sediment and this sort of soil is so large that chance wind-borne transfer of contaminated earth and inhalation of the dust by a human being would be equivalent to the maximum permitted annual intake of plutonium into the human organism. The decades of the Cold War have poisoned this mighty river for a long time to come: Plutonium-239 has a half-life of 24,000 years, and according to scientists, it remains dangerous for 10 times the length of this half-life, that is to say for 240,000 years. It makes no sense to blame anybody for the madness that has occurred. But it is hard to understand why the tradition of secrecy is being maintained to this day. Even now it is unclear how many curies of long-life radionuclides the combine has discharged into the environment. Information about plutonium contamination of the air, soil, and water remains confidential, despite the fact that data has been published in the United States showing how many tonnes of this deadly substance was produced by the combine, despite the fact that Siberian ecologists know these figures, and despite the existence of calculations about the possible amount of plutonium lost during production.... The nuclear scientists are refusing to release essential documents to the ecologists who are currently studying the state of ``Severnyy.'' People should know what conditions they are living in, they are entitled to know where and where not to gather berries, go fishing, and graze cattle. The most dangerous areas should be marked and fenced off. At the very least, we should try to eliminate radioactive contamination from areas along the river bank and close to settlements. But most important of all, research work is currently being carried out and amendments are being made to the project to build the RT-2 plant at Krasnoyarsk-26. It seems that for the Ministry of Atomic Energy and Krasnoyarsk's nuclear scientists, the question of whether or not to go ahead with construction is not even on the agenda. Apart from their natural desire to preserve their cadres, no other arguments are basically being advanced.
