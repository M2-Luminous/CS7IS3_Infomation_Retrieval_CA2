FBIS3-470 "drafr045_c_94028" FBIS-AFR-94-045 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Rights Group Releases February Violence Statistics MB0703180694 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1744 GMT 7 Mar 94 MB0703180694 Johannesburg SAPA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Johannesburg March 7 SAPA -- At least 245 people were killed and 302 people injured or wounded in political violence in South Africa in February in the seventh successive month of decline in such violence, the Human Rights Commission [HRC] said on Monday [7 March]. The HRC said in a report it recorded 361 incidents of politically-motivated violence in February as compared to 509 incidents in January. "The February death toll of 245 is significantly down from the January figure of 328 and reconfirms the strong downward trend in political violence. February recorded the seventh successive month of decline in political violence as measured by death toll," the report said. It said the average daily death toll dipped below nine this month and seemed headed back to the level of six per day which was prevalent at the same time last year. The HRC said 70 of the dead in February were African National Congress [ANC] supporters and 31 supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party. The victims included 12 African National Congress supporters massacred at Masunkazane in Richmond in Natal, and 15 ANC activists massacred at Mahlele in Creighton, also in Natal. The HRC said 20 women, 25 children, nine commuters and six members of the security forces were among those killed in February. It said Natal now firmly occupied the violence centre-stage with 66 per cent of the national toll in February. Nonetheless the provisional figure of 161 deaths in February in Natal was still a little lower than any figure during the past eight months. "Peace initiatives in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region are succeeding in returning violence levels to the manageable proportions of a year ago. The PWV region seems now to be well on its way to being stabilised, but sub regions which are still unsettled are West Rand, Alexandra, Vaal and of course the East Rand which accounted for 62 per cent of PWV deaths in February."
