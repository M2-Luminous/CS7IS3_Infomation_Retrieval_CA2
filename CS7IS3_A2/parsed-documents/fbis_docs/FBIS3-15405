Ten Questions to the 14th Army Commander"] [Text] The person of Lieutenant General Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th Russian Army, has long attracted attention. The year before last, largely thanks to his efforts, the war between Moldova and the Dniester Region was halted. People on the left bank of the Dniester literally idolized Lebed. But now Dniester Region newspapers have started to become full of materials depicting the former hero almost as the main opponent of the unrecognized republic. [Knyazkov] Love is one step away from hatred, is it not, Aleksandr Ivanovich? [Lebed] The situation in the Dniester Region is complex. I would say it is an impasse situation on many counts. The political impasse comes from the participation of representatives of the DMR [Dniester Moldovan Republic] in last October's events in Moscow and the passing of the death sentence on the Ilascu group. It is an open secret that Ilascu is a scoundrel. But the death sentence was passed on him against a background of protests from the United Nations, the CSCE, Amnesty International, Russia, the United States, and Britain. Appeals by the Pope and by Aleksiy II were ignored.... Thus, the political isolation of the unrecognized republic was exacerbated. The economic impasse.... National currencies, at the very least, have been introduced everywhere, and here they have decided to go "their own" way: Onto old Soviet money they have stuck stamps with a picture of Suvorov, and they say that this is a local currency with a certain degree of protection. But in my view this is not money but trash, and even if your pockets are full of it it is not used anywhere but in this region. It is, of course, primarily the ordinary people who suffer as a result. Pensioners receive 14,000 local rubles a month (1,000 Russian rubles are equivalent to 4,500-5,000 "Suvorovs"). For comparison, 1 kg of beef costs 35,000 "local" rubles in the market. In short, the situation in the Republic is serious. [Knyazkov] Why, after all, have your relations with the Tiraspol leadership become aggravated? [Lebed] I would not say that our relations are entirely bad, although you could not call them good either. How can they not be strained if there is one provocation after another in respect of the Army and its commander? On 13-14 January, for example, leaflets were pasted up in the city of Tiraspol calling Lebed "the Judas of the Dniester Region, preparing a military coup." Next, incidentally, the newspaper PRAVDA specified the date of the military coup -- 15 January -- and published a report claiming that leaflets calling for the overthrow of DMR President Smirnov had been pasted up all over Tiraspol. On 15 January I was holding a surgery on personal questions, and I received 62 people. No soldier was sitting there in a bulletproof vest, and they were all engaged according to the combat training plan. I have not contemplated and do not contemplate any military coups, if only because of a number of very simple considerations. The DMR was created by the will of the people who live here on the basis of the decisions of the second congress of deputies at all levels. For me, the will of the people who live here is the supreme form of legitimacy of the adopted decisions. The people have a right to reelect their leaders, but I have nothing to do with this. I am the commander of the 14th Russian Army, I am a Russian general! [Knyazkov] The impression is gained that it is advantageous to someone to remove you from the Dniester Region. [Lebed] You are right. Flexible and soft generals, who are inclined to make total compromises, are convenient for appanage principalities, which is what the DMR is now. I do not count myself as one of these and, naturally, I am unwelcome with some people. [Knyazkov] What about the Army Military Council's 8 February statement, which says that in the event of a large-scale armed provocation in the Dniester Region the Army reserves the right to cool hotheads on both banks of the Dniester? The Moldovan Foreign Ministry viewed that as gross interference in the Republic's internal affairs.... [Lebed] I cannot gainsay Moldova's right to make just such an assessment of the statement by the 14th Army's Military Council. But account must be taken of the fact that I monitor carefully the development of the situation. On the eve of the parliamentary elections in Moldova the situation was tense. I had been seeking and, it seems to me, I found quite a successful way out, if I defused the situation with the help of that statement. [Knyazkov] The fact that, according to your words, passions subsided somewhat on both banks of the Dniester following the statement by the 14th Army's Military Council attests not only to the timeliness of that document but also to a real force whose opinion Chisinau and Tiraspol politicians are obliged to take into account. What kind of a force is this -- your army, Aleksandr Ivanovich? [Lebed] The Army's personnel complement stands at 85.4 percent -- very high for these times. I had been planning over the next four-six weeks to attain a level of 94-96 percent, but we were obliged to suspend the recruitment of contract servicemen owing to a lack of clarity with the military budget. But even what we do have is quite sufficient. Visit a training ground and see for yourself how the guardsmen drive and fire. Last year we took examinations on Russian training grounds, and nobody got less than a "good," although they were operating on unfamiliar terrain. [Knyazkov] From where do the Army's reinforcements come? [Lebed] I recruit only volunteers. There are volunteers from Russia. There are, let us put it this way, local draftees, but it is necessary to understand the situation in respect of them. Some 80,000 Soviet Army pensioners and approximately 17,000 national economic specialists, who at various times, after graduating from corresponding higher educational institutions, were sent here to work and took up permanent residence here, live on the territory of Tiraspol alone. They have children and grandchildren, and the majority of these youths have no wish to go and serve in the Dniester Army, still less the Moldovan Army. Where are they to go? They come to me. Each of the volunteers signs a corresponding document confirming that he considers himself a citizen of Russia and pledges to take an oath to the Russian Army and to obey Russian laws. This document is inserted in his personal file. But I emphasize once again that only volunteers serve in the 14th Army! [Knyazkov] But what idea rallies the Russian servicemen in the Dniester Region? [Lebed] A patriotic, power idea! But the power itself must also meet its defenders halfway. We do not need a great deal, we are undemanding. But a person must serve and feel the power behind him even at a "down-to-earth level." An officer must have an apartment and pay that which enables him to keep his family and not eke out a miserable existence. Then his children will not fall ill, and his wife will not "nag" him -- then he will devote all his strength to service. [Knyazkov] A question in regards to this: How are the social problems of officers discharged to the reserve being resolved in the Army? [Lebed] It cannot be said that everything has been done, but we are tackling housing construction with the utmost intensity. I will not hide the fact that we have scored some successes. Precisely 222 apartments have already been constructed in Rybinsk, Rostov, Smolensk, Kostroma, Lobnya, Zelenograd, Tula, Penza, Voronezh, and Berdsk. Pensioners are actively moving in. If there is prompt funding, then in 1994 we will attain the target of 904 apartments. These will be in the cities of Krasnodar, Novorossiysk, Anapa, Engels, Saratov, Belgorod, and Vyatskiye Polyany. I will not hide the fact that the process is proceeding as planned, and all the contracts have been concluded. They are meeting us halfway, and I am endeavoring not to let them down. The supreme principle in the Army is that not one officer or ensign will be discharged into the reserve until he has received housing. [Knyazkov] How do you see the prospects for the 14th Army today? [Lebed] As is known, the leadership of the Republic of Moldova unequivocally advocates the Army's withdrawal from its territory, but the situation is highly complex. The point is that it is now impossible, in my view, to withdraw the Army. There are very many reasons, starting with the fact that there is still no political solution to the past bloody conflict between Moldova and the Dniester Region -- accordingly, there are no guarantees of peace and stability in this region. The possibility of a relapse into hostilities has not been exhausted -- people are simply afraid. They see the 14th Army as the guarantor of peace and stability, capable of preventing war or, if war is nonetheless unleashed, of halting bloodshed. Therefore, the Army's withdrawal must be preceded by a very long, delicate, and wise political process, which, unfortunately, has not yet begun. But it is possible and necessary to speak of reorganizing the Army. Following the breakup of the unified Union Army, many units of central and district subordination became subordinate to me. Some of them are simply not needed. Therefore, great reorganization awaits the 14th Army. [Knyazkov] To conclude our conversation: What would you like to wish your fellow servicemen and, of course, yourself? [Lebed] There is nothing more terrible than a general who has not fought. Generals who have not fought and particularly, politicians who have not smelled gunpowder, unleash all kinds of conflicts with uncommon ease in the hope of some ephemeral victory. There are quite a few such conflicts on the territory of the former Soviet Union now, but there will be and there can be no victors in them. Armenians have been fighting Azerbaijanis for umpteen years and have thereby set back their development 30 or even 50 years. The Georgians have not defeated and will not defeat the Abkhazians, nor will the Abkhazians defeat the Georgians. These civil wars have no beginning and no end. So I would wish all who have experienced evil in them to be able to restore peace with all their reason and, if necessary, by force. All pretensions to a large-scale civil war must be stopped in a very tough manner. It seems only to the evil and fools that "now we will do a little bit of fighting here, and then all will be well"... a dangerous delusion that is fatal for society.
