[Begin Izetbegovic recording] We have just ended, five minutes ago, a meeting with the European troika: European Union Chairman Papoulias of Greece; Kinkel; and Claes, who was the previous EU chairman. Some other European statesmen were also present, Van den Broek among them. Some 20 of them attended the meeting. We discussed -- I am talking about things that have not been made public today because they happened just now -- we discussed the promotion of peace in Sarajevo, the reconstruction of Sarajevo, the appointment of EU administrators for Mostar and visions regarding the reconstruction of these cities. In all, what could I add to what I said today and what you have already heard? I wish to say that it is very important that the first results of these talks are tangible; they are evident. They have become evident in many parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina where people are no longer being killed and where we had been fighting until recently. Convoys are now passing freely there, lives are no longer being lost in those regions. Life is returning in a way -- a ray of life -- to Mostar, the old part of Vitez. They are perfectly aware of this in Sarajevo. What is important is that the results of this are being felt. That proves this is a real change. This is not what we used to call a change on paper. I believe we have good reason to look to the future with optimism. A significant change has occurred in the balance of forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I do not believe we should take advantage of that to prolong the war, but I think that this increased strength should be used to achieve a just peace. This is our right, it is our right to do this, and this we shall do. Washington was, so to speak, the center of the world today -- not to say that it is not otherwise -- because a large number of statesmen assembled here today to take part in this event. This added weight to this event, which goes to show that we are not the only ones who are directly involved, who are vitally interested, but many other responsible people in the world are also involved who feel that something is changing. Of course, we should all try to contribute to this process as best we can. We, our government, will do all we can in this respect. I cannot help recalling that, unfortunately, people in Maglaj, Bihac, Brcko, and in some other places have sensed relief. Fighting is still going on there, lives are being lost, but it seems that better days are at hand. [end recording]
