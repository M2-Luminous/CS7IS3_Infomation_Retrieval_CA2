FR940523-2-00065 FR940523-2-00040 Patient Selection Criteria for Electrostimulation of Salivary Production in the Treatment of Xerostomia Secondary to Sjogren's Syndrome Prepared by: Martin Erlichman Introduction Electrostimulation has been introduced as a technique for increasing salivary output in the treatment of patients with xerostomia (dry mouth) secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. The procedure uses an electrostimulation device (salivation electrostimulator) to increase salivary production from existing glandular tissue. The device delivers a small electrical stimulus to the mouth via a probe. The electrostimulation device consists of an electric control module, a connecting cord, and a hand-held stimulus probe with two metal electrodes. The device may be battery-powered. Patients with residual salivary tissue in the oral and pharyngeal regions who demonstrate a decrease in the flow rate of saliva are potential candidates for this procedure. Xerostomia may be the result of Sjogren's syndrome, other diseases, medications, or radiation therapy to the head and neck. To determine that the xerostomia has resulted from Sjogren's syndrome, clinicians also confirm the presence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye) and a positive lip biopsy with or without the presence of a connective tissue disease. It is estimated that more than one million people, mostly women, suffer from Sjogren's syndrome in the United States. 1 Xerostomia is usually defined as a symptom that exists when saliva production is less than 0.1 mL/min (or 0.1 g/min). However, the symptom of xerostomia has been reported to appear when normal salivary output declines by approximately 50%, regardless of the starting value. Normal saliva production has been estimated to be 600 mL/24h. 2 Patients with chronic xerostomia complain of a continual feeling of oral dryness and find it difficult to eat dry foods. 3 In addition to the subjective complaints, the patient with salivary gland dysfunction is susceptible to increased dental caries, oral pain, frequent infections, and difficulties in speaking, chewing, and swallowing. 4 Several tests are available for measuring salivary function. According to Fox et al, 5 evaluation of salivary gland function can be assessed by stimulated saliva collection and analysis. The biopsy of the salivary glands, usually obtained from the lower lip, is used to differentiate true Sjogren's syndrome from other forms of salivary gland dysfunction. The approach to the treatment of this condition varies considerably. In some patients, xerostomia may be managed by sipping water frequently. Other patients stimulate salivary flow with sugarless mints or gum. 6 Salivary substitutes such as a carboxymethylcellulose-based artificial saliva have been used by some patients to supplement low quantities of salivary flow. Pharmacologic agents have been introduced to treat the oral dryness of salivary gland dysfunction in patients where unstimulated salivary flow was low or nonexistent but where some functional salivary gland tissue existed. Fox et al 4 reported that pilocarpine was effective for relieving xerostomia by increasing natural salivary function. The production of endogenous saliva is of greatest benefit to the patient both for its convenience and the importance of natural saliva to oral functions. Recently, attempts to increase saliva production have utilized electrical stimulation. Preliminary investigations were reported by Weiss et al 7 in 1986. This report will examine the published literature and other available evidence to evaluate the electrostimulation of salivary production and determine if there are xerostomic patients who would benefit from this procedure. Background Sjogren's syndrome is a chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disease in which the salivary and lacrimal glands undergo progressive destruction by lymphocytes and plasma cells resulting in decreased production of tears and saliva. 8 Sjogren's syndrome is seen predominantly in middle-aged elderly women. 9 Females are involved 10 times more commonly than males. Secondary effects of xerostomia include impairment in the normal movement of lips and tongue, thereby hampering speech, mastication, and swallowing. 10 Additional signs include oral soreness, adherence of food to buccal surfaces, fissuring of the tongue, an altered sense of taste, and a marked increase in dental caries and infection. Soreness and redness of the mucosa are usually the result of candidal infection, which is found in approximately 70% of the Sjogren's syndrome patients. 11 Complaints resulting from dryness of the mouth are varied and often describe the difficulties encountered in trying to eat dry foods without sufficient lubrication. 11 Many subjects require frequent ingestion of liquids. They may resort to carrying water bottles or hard candy. The parotid gland enlarges in many patients secondary to cellular infiltration and ductal obstruction. Usually asymptomatic and self-limited, the enlargement can be recurrent and associated with pain or erythema. Focal infiltrates of lymphocytes are also found in the minor salivary glands of the lower lip. Biopsy provides histologic confirmation and quantification of the degree of infiltration.
