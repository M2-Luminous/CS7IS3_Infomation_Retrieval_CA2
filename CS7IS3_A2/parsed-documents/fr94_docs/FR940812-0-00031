Grantee will comply with property management standards established by 7 CFR Parts 3015 and 3016 for personal property. ``Personal property'' means property of any kind except real property. It may be tangible_having physical existence_or intangible_having no physical existence; such as patents, inventions, and copyrights. ``Nonexpendable personal property'' means tangible personal property having a useful life of more than 1 year and an acquisition cost of $300 or more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of nonexpendable personal property provided that such definition would at least include all tangible personal property as defined above. ``Expendable personal property'' refers to all tangible personal property other than nonexpendable property. When nonexpendable property is acquired by a grantee with project funds, title shall not be taken by the Federal Government but shall be vested in the grantee subject to the following conditions. (a) Right to transfer title. For items of real or nonexpendable personal property having a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more, RDA may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such reservation shall be subject to the following standards: (i) The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant or otherwise made known to the grantee in writing. (ii) RDA shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the project for which it was acquired. If RDA fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the grantee shall apply the standards of paragraph 18. (b) of this exhibit. (iii) When RDA exercises its right to take title, the personal property shall be subject to the provisions for federally owned nonexpendable property discussed in paragraphs 18. (b) and (c) of this exhibit. (iv) When title is transferred either to the Federal Government or to a third party and the grantee is instructed to ship the property elsewhere, the grantee shall be reimbursed by the benefiting Federal agency with an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the grantee's participation in the cost of the original grant project or program to the current fair market value of the property, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred. (b) Use of other nonexpendable personal property for which the grantee has title. (i) The grantee shall use the property in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When it is no longer needed for the original project or program, the grantee shall use the property in connection with its other federally sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:
