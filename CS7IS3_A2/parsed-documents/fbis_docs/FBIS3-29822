The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Today our people are filled with the burning resolve to defend our party politically, ideologically, and with life in the face of any tribulations and storms and to share fate with the party to the end. The meetings to take an oath of loyalty to the great leader [yongdoja] to the end were held in institutions, plants, enterprises, cooperatives, schools, units of the Korean People's Army [KPA] and the Korean People's Security Forces, [word indistinct] in the mountains, television stations, [word indistinct] islands, and even on navigating trade ships. The meetings were attended by the people of all strata throughout the country, including old anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters, who are seniors of our revolution; veterans of the fatherland liberation war; functionaries of the party power organizations and the working people's organizations; workers; farmers; soldiers; intellectuals; and youths and students. Officers and men of the three services of the KPA held a meeting at the face of the native home of the historic Mt. Paektu secret camp. At the meeting, the KPA officers and men deeply expressed the conviction that as long as there is General Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of our revolutionary Armed Forces, the one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary forces will be powerful and ever-victorious. They solemnly pledged to firmly uphold the chuche-oriented revolutionary cause by fulfilling the missions assigned by the country, people, times, and revolution. They chanted slogans, which showed their firm pledge to become a fortress and shield to defend with armed forces our supreme commander, to become rifles and bombs, and to smash any strong enemies in a stroke under the great commander's leadership. Heroic working classes of each district plant and enterprise -- such as Musan coal mining complex, Kim Chaek iron-steel complex, Namhung youth chemical complex, other large-scale extracting bases, metallurgical bases, and large-scale chemical industry bases -- solemnly resolved to uphold Comrade Kim Chong-il, the fate of our nation and incarnation of victory and glory, as the pillar of faith and will for good. Agricultural working people, who are accelerating final preparations for new year's farming with the single resolve to glorify this year marking the 30th anniversary of the publication of the socialist rural theses with bumper crops, took an oath of loyalty on the occasion of the significant February national day. In the meetings held at various cooperatives, including Mangyongdae cooperative, Chongsan cooperative, and Wonhwa cooperative, agricultural working people pledged to firmly uphold the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, to brilliantly implement the party's agriculture-first policy, and to discharge the mission of revolutionary fighters who should glorify the socialist fatherland with grain. Intellectuals across the country, who live and struggle with the glory and pride as our party's eternal companions, loyal defenders, and good advisers, took an oath of loyalty to bring into full bloom the worthwhile life of the revolutionary intellectuals, by more firmly rallying around Comrade Kim Chong-il, father [oboi] and great teacher [widaehan susung] of valuable political life. Youth and students throughout the country, like the young communists who followed Hanbyol during the dawning of the Korean revolution, took an oath of burning loyalty to live a genuine life as the youth vanguards of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and to create miracles and feats in difficult and tough outposts to defend and glorify the socialism of our own style centered on the popular masses, that is, the life and living of our people. The oath of loyalty taken on the historic February holiday is the unprecedented expression of infinite respect and loyalty to the great leader [yongdoja], who provides our people with the most valuable dignity and happiness in the world. The oath of loyalty is also the demonstration of the firm faith and fidelity of the people of all strata and officers and men of the revolutionary Armed Forces to believe and follow Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is the fate and loadstar of our nation, like the God, and to resolutely defend and glorify the socialism of our own style to the end.
