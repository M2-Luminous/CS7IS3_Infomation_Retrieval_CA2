FR941021-1-00041 FR941021-1-00009 To ensure the currency of an ECG, the FAA proposes in §§67.111(e) and 67.211(e) that if a person is required to submit an ECG as part of an application for medical certification, it must be dated no earlier than 60 days before the date of the application it is to accompany and must be performed and transmitted according to acceptable standards and techniques. Of course, there is no requirement to submit an ECG with a current application for medical certification if a previous ECG submitted as a part of an application for medical certification can satisfy any current ECG requirement. Sixty days is a longer period than the 30 days recommended by the AMA Report but represents a reduction from the 90 days now permitted. The agency recognizes that many ECG's are provided by employers or through private physicians other than the AME, and a reasonable period, such as that proposed, is appropriate for the airman's convenience. Finally, the FAA did not propose a baseline ECG be performed for either first- or second-class medical certificate applicants because it had a negative cost analysis and the FAA considers the ECG after age 35 to serve as an adequate baseline ECG. The FAA also proposes to amend the wording of the standard to require that the affected person ``demonstrate an absence of myocardial infarction and other clinically significant abnormality on electrocardiographic examination.'' The FAA will continue to require electrocardiography or other appropriate evaluations for any airman whose medical history or findings suggest it. Blood Pressure The current medical standard pertaining to blood pressure applies only for first-class medical certificates. Depending on the person's age and the scope of the examination accomplished, blood pressures from 140 to 170 mm Hg pressure, systolic, and 88 to 100 mm Hg pressure, diastolic, are permitted. In practice, 170 mm Hg systolic and 100 mm Hg diastolic have been considered the maximum allowable pressures for all applicants for second- and third-class certificates. The ICAO standard provides only that the blood pressure of all airmen be ``within normal limits.'' In addition, §67.13(e)(5) of the FAR provides that, ``if an applicant is at least 40 years of age, he must show a degree of circulatory efficiency that is compatible with the safe operation of aircraft at high altitudes.'' It is rare for an applicant for certification to manifest hypertension (high blood pressure) at the level of the current standard or above. Current and accepted medical practice for several years has reflected knowledge of the adverse effects of even mild elevations of blood pressure and treatment is prescribed for most individuals at levels of blood pressure much lower than the FAA standard for medical certification. If any person is taking medication for hypertension, FAA practice is to consider the condition as coming under the provisions of present §67.13(f)(2), General medical condition, of the FAR. This section directs that the applicant have ``no other organic, functional, or structural disease, defect, or limitation that the Federal Air Surgeon finds makes the applicant unable to safely perform the duties or exercise the privileges of the airman certificate that he holds or for which he is applying; or may be reasonably expected, within 2 years after the finding, to make him unable to perform those duties or exercise those privileges; *␣*␣*'' Certification is conditioned on the findings of a more detailed medical evaluation, including an assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, the presence or absence of disease of ``target'' organs, the degree of blood pressure control, and of the medication itself. The AMA Report recommends that the existing, outmoded standard for blood pressure be replaced. It suggests a sitting blood pressure standard of 150 mm Hg pressure, systolic, and 95 mm Hg pressure, diastolic, for all pilots. It further recommends that the systolic level never exceed 160 mm Hg, regardless of the diastolic blood pressure. The AMA Report notes that its recommendations represent a somewhat less rigid standard for younger airmen and a more rigid standard for older airmen. Less rigid standards for the younger airmen are appropriate in terms of safety. For older airmen the more rigid standards respond to data demonstrating the adverse medical significance of the high level of blood pressure permitted by the current standard.
