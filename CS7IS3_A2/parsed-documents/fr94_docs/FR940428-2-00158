Such discharges shall be limited and monitored by the permittee as specified below: ‚ê£ 1Effluent characteristic 1Discharge limitations other units (specify) 2Avg. monthly 2Max. daily 1Monitoring requirements 2Measurement frequency 2Sample type Flow (see I.A.1.g.)* See Figure 1 Monthly Daily average. Temperature (see I.A.1.g.)* See Figure 1 Monthly 4 grabs, reporting maximum, and averages. Total Residual Chlorine (see I.A.1.j.) Report Quarterly Grab. Non-contact cooling water may be discharged only into Class B, C, SB, and SC waters that have a drainage area larger than ten (10) square miles in accordance with Maine State Law. See Paragraph I.A.1.g. for details for determining if the specific discharge(s) have acceptable dilution and can be covered by the General Permit Program. b. The pH shall not be less than 6.0 standard units nor greater than 8.5 standard units and shall be monitored monthly with 4 grabs, reporting maximum values (see I.A.1.i. below). c.

Definitions: Non-contact cooling water is water used to reduce temperature which does not come into direct contact with any raw material, intermediate product, waste product or finished product. Non-toxic water treatment additives are chemicals used in cooling water system primarily to control corrosion or prevent deposition of scale forming materials which do not exhibit any residual toxic effect on the receiving waters.
