Congress president Vinicio Villar Anleu said De Leon failed to ask Congress to authorize the program. Villar said any possible penalties will be handled by the Attorney General's Office. "It is up to the Attorney General's Office to determine whether the U.S. military personnel in Guatemala are active or reservists, and whether or not De Leon should be penalized for failing to request permission from Congress," Villar Anleu said. In "Fuertes Caminos," U.S. National Guard Reserve members participate in building highways, repairing schools and health centers, drilling wells, and providing dental services in the country's interior. The program was started last week and is slated to last until next June. The U.S. Embassy explained that 300 men will be rotated every 15 days and that the number of U.S. military at any one time in Guatemala will never exceed 500. Villar Anleu admitted that he attended the inauguration of "Fuertes Caminos," but he only saw engineers, medics, mechanics, and carpenters, but no soldiers. The Constitution stipulates that Congress must approve the deployment of foreign troops in Guatemala or the transfer of foreign forces. National jurists suggested that De Leon may have violated the Constitution by not consulting with Congress or allowing legislators to ratify the execution of "Fuertes Caminos." Legislative sources said "Fuertes Caminos" is the result of an agreement between President de Leon and the U.S. Government, therefore it is up to the president to disclose the details of the program. This week, former Guatemalan President Francisco Villagran Kramer (1982-86) suggested to President De Leon that to avoid speculations, he disclose the contents of the "Fuertes Caminos" agreements.
