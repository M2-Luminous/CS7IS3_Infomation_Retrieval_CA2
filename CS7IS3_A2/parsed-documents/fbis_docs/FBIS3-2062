During its annual conference which ended last Friday, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) decided to cut unnecessary research, so as to concentrate on key studies that "comply with the times. CASS president Hu Sheng said that priority projects could only be given the attention they deserved by scrapping some of the other subjects. And if the cuts weren't made the academy would find it impossible to break new ground and would lose its lead in existing studies. But the readjustment was not a passive move merely caused by a lack of funds said CASS vice-president Ru Xin. The move was more of a bid to adapt the academy to the changing demands of a market economy he said. The government allocated more than 90 million yuan ($10.3 million) to the 5 000-member academy last year. And the academy listed more than 700 key research subjects in 1993 while the 30 or so institutes under CASS listed another 700 said academy research chief He Bingmeng. But with only 1,600 senior research fellows on the staff, the academy was overstretched. The fellows were being overworked, often having to head several research groups at once. And when new social and economic problems arose requiring in- depth study, the academy was finding it difficult to squeeze them onto its research agenda. Such an over-extended programme inevitably affected the quality of academy studies, He said. To ensure that the academy's research keeps up with the times, projects that are outmoded or are relatively difficult to complete will be dropped. In addition, the academy will require regular update reports from its long-term theoretical programmes. And the humanities will have to look at reality, he said. For example, the philosophy of history will this year be replaced by the study of socialist morality and ethics. The academy also hopes that the institute will strengthen its human rights studies. The Institute of Literature will initiate a programme on contemporary humanism, while the Institute of Modern History is embarking on a history of modern Chinese civilization in the hope of cultivating patriotism, he said . Forecast The director said the academy has decided to select 60 to 70 key subjects this year. These include annual analyses of economic, social and international affairs, the impact of foreign-funded businesses upon China, and Asia-Pacific regional economic and political trends. CASS has also established a Research Centre on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics headed by Wang Renzhi, former director of the Party's Central Propaganda Department and now vice-president of the academy. In addition, the academy is experimenting with a bidding system that will tender out some of the larger research projects. Successful bidders will be granted a modicum of financial autonomy: they will take responsibility for keeping within budget and in return will receive bonuses if their research is conducted well. The research on modern Chinese humanism is likely to be tendered out, he said. And CASS will widen academic co-operation with its foreign counterparts, according to the director. At the moment Sino-foreign joint projects are relatively few and far between. Last year, CASS published a record-breaking 464 books. It also published 3,532 academic papers, 532 research reports, 157 translations of foreign publications and 144 dictionaries. Two studies in particular won great acclaim from Chinese leaders and fellow scholars. They were "The Macro Guidelines, Principles and Framework of the Socialist Market Economy," edited by former CASS vice president Liu Guoguang, and "Theoretical Research and Suggestions on Establishing a Legal System for the Socialist Market Economy," written by the Institute of Law. Two other projects also were highly commended: The research on contemporary capitalism, which was assigned to the academy by Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and conducted by the Institute of International Economics and Politics; and the Institute of Economics study of the history of Chinese capitalism. Invention The Institute of Rural Development examined the developing non- agricultural sector in the countryside--the share-based co-operative businesses,which many agricultural experts consider the third wave of Chinese rural development. The Institute of Philosophy completed a project on human rights last year. Also, researchers from the Institute of Quantitative and Technical Economics, headed by Liu Guoguang, last year wrapped up an economic development strategy for the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ). This report, conducted at the request of the Shenzhen government, outlines the future of the other four SEZs in China.
