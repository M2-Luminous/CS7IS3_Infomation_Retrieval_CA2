A quick review of the events of the 17-30 July revolution in 1968 will show those who want to understand the course of events that the leader president has emerged triumphant from all his missions, enjoying the support of the Iraqi masses, who took more pride in their jihad and their great accomplishments and gains. Today, as we enter the last 10 days of the blockade, it is no longer secret that after the enemy, regardless of its names and colors, gave up all hope of succeeding in his conspiratorial and hostile plans to divide Iraq and destroy its people, resorted to its last card in this conflict, hoping that this card will achieve what it had failed to achieve through the comprehensive military aggression and barbaric blockade. U.S. awareness that it has lost the logic and the argument, that world public opinion, including that of the American people, has begun to understand Iraq's positions; and that the overwhelming majority of nations have begun to prepare appropriate plans to deal with Iraq in the near future without the economic blockade, whether or not the United States agrees, has made the United States feel that it is inevitably about to lose another strategic conflict in a world that has begun to slip away from the grip of the United States. Therefore, the United States has begun either to use additional destructive means or to strengthen the old ones. We will not exaggerate if we say that the principal aim of the United States is to increase difficulties in the life of Iraqi society by further weakening the Iraqi economy and making the people unable to shoulder the extraordinary inflation that resulted from the blockade and greed. Therefore, efforts over the past months have focused on easing the negative economic impact of the blockade so citizens do not despair. But these efforts have clashed with the fact that the current challenge for the Iraqi people is unlike any other challenge that has threatened any people in history. For the first time, a four-year comprehensive blockade has been clamped on a nation, and for the first time, all intellectual, psychological, financial, and economic energies have been used to destroy the potential of Iraqi society. Therefore, many solutions were ineffective, despite good intentions. As a result, it was extremely necessary for the leader president to assume the direct responsibilities of the prime minister. His unique leadership capabilities, his deep and far-sighted strategic vision, and his comprehensive experience in dealing with conflicts and solving complicated crises constitute a strong basis for an effective solution to problems in the daily life of the masses. Yes, the leader's assumption of the responsibilities of the prime minister will guarantee for the people a solution to years-old outstanding problems and will constitute a natural framework for state organizations to carry out their duties in a different way based on resisting the blockade in untraditional ways. This is a studied Iraqi reply to the current mobilization of hostile energies to destroy Iraq. The battle to break the blockade in the near future is no longer a dream or hope, but has become a reality about which the enemy -- ahead of the friend -- is talking. The coming months will certainly be decisive. Therefore, the blockade-breaking battle, which is considered the most serious and the most honorable battle of the Arab fate, along with its great changes, plans, and sides, should be defined and engineered by the great leader, Saddam Husayn, who dispels darkness and despair and creates hope. Let us stand behind the leader more firmly, deriving lessons from the Mother of Battles, foremost of which is sticking to the symbol of Iraq's unity, Saddam Husayn.
