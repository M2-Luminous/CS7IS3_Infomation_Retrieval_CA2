During the past year or so, we have received many letters from our readers and have invited 19 ministerial leading cadres to give their views on some flash-point economic issues which the readers have raised. We would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks to the leaders and vast numbers of readers who have shown their concerns for and have supported this column. Although this column has ended, we still welcome our readers to write to us and raise questions. We will continue to answer them in various forms. [Gong Wen] According to the figures provided by customs, a trade deficit has appeared in China's imports and exports this year, something has rarely happened in recent years. From January to November, the total volume of import and export trade was $164.2 billion, of which exports totaled $78.25 billion and imports totaled $85.95 billion, an increase of 6.2 and 27.8 percent respectively over the same period last year. The export growth rate was 21.6 percentage points lower than the rate of import growth, with a deficit of $7.7 billion on our side. Would you, Minister Wu, please tell us about the main reasons for this deficit? [Wu Yi] In my opinion, there are three main reasons: First, increasing demand in the domestic market. China's national economy grew by 12.8 percent last year, and the trend of rapid development has been maintained this year. It is estimated that this year's growth rate will reach 13 percent. This has brought about increases in domestic demand; in particularly, we have seen a rapid increase in demand for the means of production. The shortage of commodities for bulk exports has been a rare phenomenon in the past many years. Negative growth has been registered since the beginning of this year in the exports of ordinary commodities, which are important sources of state foreign exchange earnings. From January to November, the growth rate of these exports decreased by 0.6 percent over the same period of last year (calculated in terms of comparable items). Second, the role of the market has become much broader. China has made an important policy decision about the establishment of a socialist market economic structure and has given full play to the basic roles of the market in the allocation of resources under state macroeconomic regulation and control. At present, because price control has been relaxed further, the prices of approximately 90 percent of industrial consumer goods, 70 percent of the ex-factory prices of capital goods, and 85 percent of the procurement prices of agricultural products are decided by the market. Because of the weak prices in the international market and the shortage of commodity resources in the domestic market, prices have been rising to a certain extent, and the law of value has been playing a major role. For this reason, a decrease in the export of domestic commodities has appeared again. Because China has further relaxed control over imports, foreign commodities are entering the Chinese market at a considerably high growth rate. Last year's import volume increased by 26.4 percent compared with the previous year, and, from January to November this year, it continued to increase by 27.8 percent compared with the same period of last year. This fully shows that China is a large market with great potential. China's market is open. Moreover, because of the increase in foreign exchange swap prices, the shortage of funds, and insufficient transportation facilities, foreign trade departments are working under dual pressures from commodity providers and foreign buyers. The former are trying to increase prices, while the latter are seeking to force prices down. In addition, as the enterprises engaging in foreign economic cooperation and trade are in the period of changing operational mechanism, with the insufficient macroeconomic regulation and control measures and incomplete implementation of the export policies and measures, the foreign trade and export business have been directly affected. These reasons are also behind the deficit. [Gong] It has been learned that deficits have appeared in bilateral trade between China and some countries this year. For example, the trade deficit with Japan reached $5.48 billion in the first 10 months of the year, making up 77.3 percent of the total deficit in China's foreign trade during the same period. Would you please tell us how you view this problem and what measures should be adopted to resolve the problem? [Wu] In my opinion, it is difficult to avoid having a deficit in bilateral trade. The issue is that both sides should take a positive and pragmatic attitude and adopt flexible methods to solve the problem so that it does not become an obstacle to the development of bilateral economic and trade relations and so that the deficit may not be used as a pretext for exerting pressure on the other side. China's basic foreign trade policy is to ensure equality and mutual benefit and maintain a basic balance between imports and exports. At present, in the face of the unsatisfactory export situation, we will adopt a method of expanding exports rather than reducing imports to achieve the basic balance. We export so that we can import the advanced technologies and equipment needed by our modernization drive and those materials that are in short supply in our domestic market. It is estimated that our import volume will reach $450 billion over the next five years. As everyone knows, approximately 80 percent of China's foreign exchange comes from foreign trade and exports. If the deficit situation caused by slow export is not improved, China's foreign exchange earnings will certainly decrease, and its import trade will also be affected. Therefore, only on the basis of continuous and rapid growth of exports and by increasing foreign exchange earnings can the current trend of high-rate import growth be preserved. We hope that our trading partners will increase their imports of Chinese commodities so that bilateral trade can develop harmoniously. At the same time, we also hope that our trade partners with whom there is the problem of imbalanced trade will resolve the trade deficit issue on the basis of equality and mutual benefit so that the trade deficit does not affect the development of bilateral trade and economic relations. [Gong] May we ask Minister Wu to predict the situation of China's import and export trade next year? [Wu] We are resolving the trade deficit issue primarily through expanding exports. Therefore, we will concentrate our energy next year on work in the following fields of export trade. First, to intensify reform of the structure of foreign trade and economic cooperation. Beginning in 1994, a system of "unification of foreign exchange rates" will be adopted, and a unified foreign exchange settlement system will be implemented in all enterprises engaging in foreign trade business and the export trade. At the same time, a unitary and well-managed floating exchange rate system for the renminbi based on market supply and demand will be established, and the task for foreign trade enterprises to turn their foreign exchange earnings over to the state with or without compensation will be abolished, so that an environment of fair competition can be created for the enterprises. Under effective macroeconomic regulation and control, control over the operation of import and export commodities will be further relaxed (currently approximately 2,000 productive enterprises and 100 scientific research institutes have already been granted independent import and export powers). Legislative work will be strengthened so that the cohesion of foreign trade policy and a good operational order can be maintained. Second, to enhance the enterprises' sense of earning foreign exchange through export and to correctly handle the relations between mainly developing a business and the development of a diversified economy, between foreign exchange earned through export and economic returns, and between independent operation and conscientiously maintaining the operational order. All departments in charge should give the green light to the enterprises for expanding exports and provide them with high-quality service. Third, to make great efforts to open up new fields and increase exports while consolidating and developing existing markets. At present, China has already established economic and trade relations with more than 220 countries and regions. An initial pluralized market pattern has formed. We still have to make greater efforts, however, especially in striving for an early return to the status of a GATT signatory state and in creating conditions for expanding exports. Moreover, in order to "win by quality," we must continue to "fight against sham commodities" next year. We must cooperate with the scientific research, production, commodity inspection, and customs departments and rely on science and technology, policy, and management to greatly increase the quality of our export commodities. In border and regional trade, those practices that harm the prestige of China's export commodities and enterprises should be severely punished according to the law. Judging from China's foreign trade development in the first 11 months of this year, it is estimated that the total export volume for the entire year will exceed $92 billion, and the total import volume will reach more than $100 billion. Calculated on the basis that the growth rate of import and export trade is a bit higher than that of the national economy, the total volume of China's foreign trade and the import and export volume will reach $200 billion, which will mean a new and higher stage, of which imports and exports will each reach $100 billion. In foreign trade and import and export activities, there will possibly be less restrictive factors next year than there were this year. The growth in foreign trade, especially the increase in the state's foreign exchange earnings, and the increase of the state's ability in international payment will be conducive to the comprehensive development of China's foreign trade and economic cooperation. But what merits our attention is that the growth rate for our export trade next year has been set at 8.7 percent, which is lower than the GNP's growth rate--9 percent. That is why I have said that we must make continuous efforts and strive to make the growth rate of export trade same as or a bit higher than GNP growth rate. [Gong] Some people have asked even though a deficit has appeared in China's foreign trade, the number of antidumping complaints against China's export goods has nevertheless continued to increase. What on earth has actually happened? Will this affect China's export trade? [Wu] At present, some countries are faced with economic depression, stagnation in domestic industrial production, and a situation in which imports can hardly be controlled by the original tariff barriers. This, compounded with a lack of understanding about China's socialist market economic structure, has led these countries to adopt some discriminatory measures against Chinese products and regard the antidumping measure as a way to prevent foreign commodities from entering their domestic markets. We do not like to see this phenomenon. Some countries still regard our country as a country with a planned economy which still practices the old method of substitute states. This is unwarranted today. We are in favor of promoting exports in accordance with standard international trade practices. China is a developing country. It does not have the economic strength necessary to dump its commodities overseas. Because of the relatively cheap labor and low production costs in our country, the prices of our export commodities are relatively low. We hope that the governments and industrial and commercial circles of the relevant countries will take a realistic attitude toward the selling prices of China's export commodities.
