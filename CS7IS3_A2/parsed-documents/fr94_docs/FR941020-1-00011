FR941020-1-00011 FR941020-1-00002 For food stamp purposes, households are permitted to have up to $2,000 in resources ($3,000 for households if at least one member is aged 60 or older). (For categorically-resource-eligible households, the issue of accessibility is irrelevant.) Current data show that the average value of countable resources for all food stamp households is less than $100. Ninety-five percent of all food stamp households have $1,000 or less in countable resources. As very few households participating in the food stamp program have resources exceeding $1,000, the Department believes that a resource that would yield a return of $1,000 (or $1,500, as appropriate) would be a significant return for a household that is otherwise eligible for food stamps. Section 5(g)(5) also provides that the return must be determined to be not significant either (1) because the household's interest is relatively slight or (2) because the cost of selling the household's interest would be relatively great. The legislative history does not provide any direction to the Department in establishing the meaning of relatively slight interest or relatively great cost of selling other than a statement by Senator Leahy in the floor debates that no ``arbitrary sale price or percent-of-value test may be imposed''. Cong. Rec. S18326, November 26, 1991. The Department recognizes that what constitutes a ``relatively slight interest'' or a ``relatively great cost of selling'' may vary, depending on the specific resource. The ultimate inquiry is whether the resource, given the ownership interest and/or the cost of sale, would produce a significant return or significant amount of funds to the household, if sold. The Department is proposing in 7 CFR 273.8(e) to prohibit applying this provision to negotiable financial instruments such as stocks and bonds. As a general matter, stocks and bonds are liquid resources which are available to the household. Section 5(g)(5) is directed in part at inaccessibility due the cost of selling being relatively great in relation to the amount of funds that would be realized if the resource were sold. In general, brokerage firms and other financial institutions charge either a minimum fee or a small percentage of the sale when a negotiable financial instrument is sold. The Department recognizes that a household may own stock or some other negotiable financial instrument that has decreased in value since the household acquired it. However, regardless of the reduced value of that resource, it could not be considered to be inaccessible because the cost of selling it would not be ``relatively great'' unless the stock were basically worthless, and thus would not be of value as a resource in any event. The proposed distinction between negotiable financial instruments, which could not be declared inaccessible under this proposal, and other types of resources which, depending on the value of the resource and the circumstances of each particular household's ownership interest in the resource, could be found inaccessible, is given further support in language found in the Congressional floor debates on the statutory provision. Senator Leahy indicated that the ``availability'' of a resource should be one of the determinants of whether that resource may be declared inaccessible. Cong. Rec. S18325, November 26, 1991. By their very nature, negotiable financial instruments, regardless of either their current value or their value when purchased, are liquid and available to the household in contrast to other nonliquid resources such as real property. This proposal retains the provision from the 1991 proposed rule that would have required State agencies to develop standards to be used to identify the kinds of resources that, as a practical matter, the household is unlikely to sell for any significant return. Several commenters said the proposed rule placed too heavy a burden on State agencies by requiring them to develop these standards. The Department understands these concerns; however, Section 5(g)(5)of the Act is clear in requiring State agencies to develop such standards. In order to emphasize this requirement, the Department is proposing to add a new paragraph (18) to 7 CFR 273.8(e) that would require State agencies to develop standards for identifying resources, that as a practical matter, the household is unable to sell for any significant return because the household's interest in the property is relatively slight or because the cost of selling the household's interest would be relatively great. State agencies are not required to submit these standards to the Department for approval. In developing their standards, the State agencies need to keep in mind that verification of the inaccessibility of a resource that meets the defined standard is necessary only if the information provided by the household appears questionable. The 1991 Technical Amendments prohibited requiring State agencies to require verification unless the information provided appears questionable. Accordingly, the Department is proposing in 7 CFR 273.8(e)(18) to require verification of inaccessibility of resources only if the information provided by the household is insufficient to clearly establish inaccessibility. The Department would like to make it clear that this standard does not invalidate any other provision regarding jointly-owned resources and inaccessible resources, as described in 7 CFR 273.8(d). Application of This Rule to Vehicles Three commenters on the August 13, 1991 proposed rulemaking discussed whether or not vehicles could be identified as inaccessible resources under this provision. The Department believes that it is very clear from the statutory language and the legislative history of the inaccessible resource provision that it was not the intent of Congress to include vehicles. Neither Section 1719 of the Leland Act or Section 904 of the 1991 Technical Amendments nor their legislative history made any reference to vehicles when discussing the resources to be dealt with under Section 5(g)(5)of the Act. On pages 429 and 430 of House Report No. 101&hyph;569, the reasons for the legislative provision are spelled out. This legislative history specifically mentions heir property and the problems associated with attempting to assess the value of such property as the primary reason for the statutory amendments. Historically, vehicles have always been treated differently than all other resources under the Act. Section 5(g)(2) of the Act continues to require that the fair market value of vehicles be the test of whether any portion of their value is counted as a resource despite the addition of Section 5(g)(5) to the Act. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that there would be no cost involved in implementing the inaccessible resources provision. The cost of including vehicles under the inaccessible resources provision would be substantial. The Department estimates that the cost would be over $1 billion over the next five years. Therefore, the Department does not believe that it was Congressional intent to include vehicles as an inaccessible resource under this provision.
