ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is amending 25 CFR 141.10 and 141.33 to change references to the account ``Indian Monies, Proceeds of Labor'' to read ``Special Deposits,'' as provided in 25 CFR Part 114_SPECIAL DEPOSITS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rulemaking action is to amend Part 141 of Subchapter G of Chapter I of Title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which contains general regulations pertaining to reservation businesses and prescribes rules for the licensing of non-member businesses, pawnbrokers and traders who engage in retail business on the Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni Reservations, as required by 25 U.S.C. 261, 262, 263, and 264. Pursuant to the amendments contained in Pub. L. 97&hyph;257, Title I, §100, (Sept. 10, 1982, 96 Stat. 839), which provide that ``No funds shall be deposited in such `Indian monies, proceeds of labor' (IMPL) accounts after September 30, 1982,'' all deposits to IMPL accounts were discontinued. The IMPL accounts will be removed from the BIA accounting system and are no longer available for use. The references to, ``Indian Monies, Proceeds of Labor'' accounts contained in §141.10(d) and §141.33(d) are therefore no longer valid, and are being changed to refer to ``Special Deposits'' accounts, in accordance with the requirements of 25 CFR 114. A proposed regulation for 25 CFR 141 was published for public comment in the Federal Register on February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9302). After a thirty-(30-) day comment period, no comments were received.
