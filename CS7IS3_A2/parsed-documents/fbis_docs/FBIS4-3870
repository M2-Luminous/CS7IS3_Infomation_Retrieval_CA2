Zou Jiahua arrived in Toronto on 20 April after visiting Vancouver. The Darlington Nuclear Power Plant was the first stop of the tour arranged for him in Toronto. Strichter, chief of the nuclear power plant, told Zou Jiahua that he hoped to see Canadian built nuclear power plants equipped with heavy-water reactors in China. Strichter enthusiastically recommended Canada's heavy-water reactor technology to the Chinese guests. He said: Canada's heavy- water reactors are one of the world's recognized high technologies. Since they use natural uranium as fuel, they not only cost less than reactors using enriched uranium, but are also safer. In addition, Canada uses the parallel connection technology so that nuclear power plants will not have to stop operation while having their old nuclear fuel pellets replaced with new ones. Canada currently owns 22 reactors; all of them have adopted heavy-water reactor technology. After his tour of the Darlington Nuclear Power Plant, Zou Jiahua was received by Ontario Province Governor Ray [name as received]. On the afternoon of the same day, he also visited the Spa Aircraft Company [name as received]. In the evening, the Canadian-Chinese Trade Council held a banquet in his honor.
