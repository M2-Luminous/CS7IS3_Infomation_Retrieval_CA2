As a condition for China to Join the GATT, Japan had called for a reduction of tariff rates on 3,300 industrial goods and China gave answers on 2,800 items. However, it seems that both countries need more time before reaching an agreement because, "there still exists a big gap" between their proposals (according to the Japanese negotiation team). It will be the first full-fledged negotiation meeting between the two countries regarding China's joining GATT.
