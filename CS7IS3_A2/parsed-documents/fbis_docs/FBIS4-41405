Stressing that the political freedom of the media is sealed in the Constitution, he reaffirmed that the economic situation places dependence on journalists. Many political groups, who, via financial institutions and banks are trying to take the press in hand, are rushing to take advantage of this. According to Vladimir Shumeyko, they are being driven by the desire to create their own image in the run-up to the presidential elections. There are a large number of claimants to the seat of president. The head of the Federation Council said that the upper chamber of parliament stands for protecting the rights of journalists and their economic independence. He said that the state is committed to giving tax benefits to the "fourth estate," for "one cannot equate the media with consumer goods production." Vladimir Shumeyko also noted that it is precisely journalists who must become one of the creators of a nation concept which would unite Russians, would fill a spiritual vacuum and inspire confidence in tomorrow. With such an idea, economic problems would be solved much more effectively, Vladimir Shumeyko said.
