Jiang made the statement at a meeting with visiting Russian Prime Minister V. S. Chernomyrdin. The bilateral relations between China and Russia had entered a new phase since President Yeltsin's China visit in late 1992, featured by the "healthy and stable" development of the mutually-beneficial cooperation in various fields, the Chinese president noted. Jiang described the current visit of the prime minister as another important event in Sino-Russian relations. The visit, he said, would help push the development of relations between the two countries. Jiang stressed that in Yeltsin's letter to him at the beginning of the year, Yeltsin suggested that the bilateral ties should be improved to the level of a "constructive partnership" looking towards the 21st century. This idea, Jiang noted, was identical with China's view of establishing long-term cooperative ties which should be mutually-beneficial, and enjoy stable development, he said. "I also hold that Sino-Russian ties should be considered and handled strategically with an eye on the 21st century," Jiang said. The postwar history had fully proved that the development of the bilateral relations between China and Russia always produced great impact on the international situation, he said, adding that living in harmony and conducting mutually-beneficial cooperation between the two countries was itself a great contribution to the peace and development of mankind. China attached great importance to the long-term, good-neighborly and mutually-beneficial ties with Russia, and would like to further bilateral relations on the basis of the principles set out in the Sino-Russian communique, Jiang said. Chernomyrdin said that he had held good talks with Chinese Premier Li Peng, and his current visit would be of great significance to the Russian economy. The agreements reached during the visit would improve the economic and trade links between the two countries, he said. The two countries should also reinforce their cooperation on international issues, since the good-neighborly friendship between the two sides would not only serve the interests of the two peoples, but also benefit peace and stability in the world, he said. The two leaders also briefed each other on their domestic situations. Chernomyrdin brought Yeltsin's regards to Jiang, saying that the Russian president was looking forward to the official Russian visit by Jiang this September. Jiang, expressing thanks, said that he also looked forward to the visit and the meeting with Yeltsin. Among those at the meeting were Qian Qichen , Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister, and Russian ministers accompanying Chernomyrdin.
