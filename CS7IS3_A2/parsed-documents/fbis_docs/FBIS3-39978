And if Turkey is facing certain difficulties at present, this is because of the coups it had underwent." Speaking to the press after a ceremony, President Demirel said "let the democratic institutions, its army, and people of the country alone." "Everything is being discussed at parliament. A government which has received a vote of confidence is on duty, whether you like it or not. An independent court system is in effect. The press is free and on duty. I am serving the country as the president elected by this country's parliament." "We might have certain problems but who doesn't?" "I am making a call to everyone, since there are debates on whether a coup will be made in Turkey," he said. "I am addressing everyone. The regime is functioning in Turkey. Here I am representing democracy and national sovereignty and advise everyone to mind their own business." Asked if a statement made a day before by Deputy Premier Murat Karayalcin that a coup might occur in Turkey has a special importance, President Demirel said, "I am not going to interpret words said by someone else. You should listen to what people have said before and after. There is no meaning in isolating the word coup from the whole statement." In May 27, 1960 a coup has been made by the Turkish Army and the premier and his two friends have been executed. In March 12, 1971 another coup took place. The third coup of the Army was made on September 12, 1980.
