The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying: "The leader's life can be said to be a life of constant trips of on-the-spot guidance to the people. The leader has rendered great services for the people all his life and he is making uninterrupted trips of on-the-spot guidance to the people still today in his eighties." The author of the article says: The history of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song's revolutionary activities is recorded with protracted struggles and feats; it is a history of on-the-spot guidance, for which he has always found himself among the people and shared weal and woe with them. He always goes wherever workers, farmers and working intellectuals live and work, hears what they want and demand, and fully reflects it in new lines and policies for a victorious advance of the Korean revolution. The Chongsan-ri spirit and method, the revolutionary work method of our party, was created in the course of his continuous on-the-spot guidance. He guided Chongsan-ri on the spot for half a month, grasped with his keen insight the matured demand of our revolution at a new stage of development and clearly indicated the orientation and concrete tasks of socialist rural construction. In this period, he set a great example of the revolutionary work method, including the method of the superior helping the subordinate and giving precedence to political work in all affairs. The unique policy of agricultural cooperativization, which was the first to indicate the way of transforming economic sectors on socialist lines before technical reconstruction, the Taean work system, a chuche-based system of socialist economic management, and the new system of agricultural guidance were all created and proved their worth in the course of his on-the-spot guidance. In the course of his on-the-spot guidance, the great leader conceived and created with his tireless activities all the unique ideas, theories and policies of our party including the line of the ideological, technical and cultural revolutions, the rural theses, the theses on socialist education, the chuche method of farming promising bumper harvests under whatever unfavorable conditions, the invincible vitality of which has been fully displayed along with the victorious advance of our revolutionary cause. If one believes in the people and relies on them, one gains everything and wins victory every time--this is the unshakable creed of Comrade Kim Il-song. So, he has traversed the long course of revolutionary struggle with absolute trust in the people and the firm determination to lead the revolution always in reliance on them. There is no such leader as Comrade Kim Il-song who has performed great exploits, always finding himself among the people, sharing weal and woe with them and enjoying their praise and deep trust, with the noble idea of "believing in the people as in heaven" as his motto. Our people deeply feel through their historical experience and reality how honorable and happy they are to live and make revolution under Comrade Kim Il-song who visits people for on-the-spot guidance all his life. They are staunchly fighting full of confidence and optimism, entrusting their destiny and future entirely to him. It is because he always finds himself among the people, mobilizes them and leads our revolution from victory to victory, that the socialist cause of chuche is firmly defended, the challenges and aggressive moves of the imperialists and reactionaries were decisively repulsed and the Korean revolution and the cause of anti-imperialist independence have a bright future.
