Scharping told the BILD newspaper (Monday [10 January] edition): "The legitimate security interests of Russia and the other CIS states have to be considered in this. We must not give the nationalist, partly fascist, in any case antiwestern and anti democratic forces in Russia any cheap excuses. So this has to be a process of several stages that must not ignore the economic side of things, in particular." The SPD leader also stressed that the Central and East European states' fear of "being under Moscow's control again" had to be taken seriously. It was therefore "sensible to use existing instruments -- NATO and CSCE -- to give states such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, possibly also Slovakia and others, security prospects." The SPD chairman stressed, however, that Russian membership of NATO was "unrealistic from today's point of view." (This report was prereleased to DPA in an edited form)
