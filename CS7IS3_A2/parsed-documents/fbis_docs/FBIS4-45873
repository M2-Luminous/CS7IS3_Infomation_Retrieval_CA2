Reports issued in the last few days by Ramon Aguirre, director of health of the Province of Loja, state that in the Canton of Macara 6,000 cases of classic dengue fever had been identified in the last few weeks. This amounts to 20 percent of the total population. As a result he even asked for the declaration of a health emergency in the Canton of Macara. This same information was confirmed on the following day by Dr. Dalton Arevalo, the director of the Hospital of Macara, and by Dr. Jose Prado. Both of them pointed out that the situation was not a cause for particular alarm, after comparing the number of sick persons and the total number of persons living in the canton. Two days after the report by the director of health of the Canton of Loja was issued the Ministry of Health explained that a survey of the population had been carried out to determine how many persons had ever suffered from dengue fever in their whole lives. The result of the survey was that 20 percent of the population of the canton had suffered from dengue fever at one time or another. The Canton of Macara has a population of 30,000 people. In the entire Province of Loja 39 cases of classic dengue fever were reported during the first two months of 1994. It is expected that data for the month of March will show that the total figure does not exceed 100 cases, the authorities said, as they confirmed that this was not an epidemic in any way. For his part Ricardo Canizares, the regional chief of epidemiology, said in Guayaquil that, according to data provided by the Leopoldo Izquieta Perez Institute of Health, no more than three cases of classic dengue fever had been positively confirmed in the Canton of Macara. An additional 46 cases were reported but not confirmed. Meanwhile, when Nicolas Jara, the undersecretary of health, was asked about the number of cases of dengue fever recorded in the Canton of Macara, he stated that he did not know the figure. However, he ordered that the information be collected. It was reported that in January and February of 1994 39 cases were confirmed in all of the Province of Loja, and it is expected that there will be no more than 100 cases confirmed in March. Nevertheless, he recognized that the increase in the number of cases of dengue fever in the Province of Loja reflected the fact that no health precautions are being taken in Peruvian border towns.
