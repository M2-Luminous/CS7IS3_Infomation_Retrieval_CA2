FR941110-1-00008 FR941110-1-00002 Note 1: This AD does not require that the actions be accomplished on the struts of airplanes having straight bore fuse pins (installed on Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney PW4000 or General Electric CF6&hyph;80C2 series engines) or 15&hyph;5 corrosion resistant steel (third generation) fuse pins. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the strut and loss of an engine due to corrosion or cracking of the fuse pins, accomplish the following: (a) For airplanes having bottle bore style fuse pins in the forward position on the upper link: Replace any bottle bore style fuse pin with a new bulkhead style fuse pin in the forward position, or with 15&hyph;5 corrosion resistant steel (third generation) fuse pins in the forward position, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2166, dated April 28, 1994, at the later of the times specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this AD. (1) Prior to the accumulation of 5,000 landings on the fuse pin, or within 5 years since installation of the pin, whichever occurs first. Or (2) Within 6 months after the effective date of this AD. Note 2: Third generation fuse pins are installed in pairs (in the forward and aft positions). Therefore, replacement of an individual upper link fuse pin in the forward position with a third generation pin also would necessitate replacement of the pin in the aft position. Note 3: The alert service bulletin references Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2155, dated September 23, 1993, as an additional source of service information for replacement of the fuse pins with 15&hyph;5 corrosion resistant steel (third generation) fuse pins. Installation of these third generation fuse pins is preferred over installation of bulkhead style fuse pins. (b) For airplanes having bulkhead style fuse pins in the forward position on the upper link: Perform a detailed visual inspection to detect corrosion of the pins, and a magnetic particle inspection to detect cracks, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2166, dated April 28, 1994, at the later of the times specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this AD. (1) Prior to the accumulation of 8,000 landings on the fuse pin, or within 8 years since installation of the pin, whichever occurs first. Or (2) Within 12 months after the effective date of this AD. (c) If no corrosion or crack is found during the inspection required by paragraph (b) of this AD, repeat the inspections thereafter at the intervals specified in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this AD, as applicable. (1) For the inboard and outboard struts on airplanes other than those identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this AD: Repeat the inspections at intervals not to exceed 1,000 landings. (2) For the outboard struts on airplanes equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;524G or &hyph;524H series engines: Repeat the inspections at intervals not to exceed 2,000 landings. Note 4: The outboard struts of airplanes equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;524G or &hyph;524H series engines are equipped with thick wall ``4330 steel'' bulkhead style fuse pins in the forward position of the upper link. Crack propagation to critical length in these thick wall pins is slower than for pins installed on the struts of airplanes equipped with engines other than the Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;524G or &hyph;524H series. (d) If any corrosion or crack is found during any inspection required by this AD, prior to further flight, replace the corroded or cracked pin with either a new bulkhead style fuse pin in the forward position of the upper link, or with 15&hyph;5 corrosion resistant steel (third generation) fuse pins in the forward and aft positions of the upper link, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2166, dated April 28, 1994. (1) If the corroded or cracked fuse pin is replaced with a new bulkhead style fuse pin, prior to the accumulation of 8,000 landings on the new pin, or within 8 years since installation of the new pin, whichever occurs first, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect corrosion of the new pin, and a magnetic particle inspection to detect cracks of the new pin, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2166, dated April 28, 1994. Repeat these inspections thereafter at the interval specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) of this AD, as applicable. (i) For the inboard and outboard struts on airplanes other than those identified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this AD: Repeat the inspections at intervals not to exceed 1,000 landings. (ii) For the outboard struts on airplanes equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;524G or &hyph;524H series engines: Repeat the inspections at intervals not to exceed 2,000 landings. (2) If the corroded or cracked fuse pin is replaced with a 15&hyph;5 corrosion resistant steel (third generation) fuse pin, no further action is required by this AD. (e) Installation of 15&hyph;5 corrosion resistant steel (third generation) fuse pins in the forward and aft positions of the upper link on the inboard or outboard strut constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD. (f) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. Note 5: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO. (g) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on November 4, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
