Although a concrete schedule for the Fujii-Bentsen meeting has not yet been decided on, on 23 April both sides were coordinating the schedule. During the meeting with Bentsen, Fujii is expected to indicate the government's intention to maintain in the future its basic position on Japan's policies toward foreign countries and its domestic economic measures, as well on following a policy accord reached by the ruling coalition parties. Meanwhile, Bentsen is expected to call for additional economic pump-priming measures by Japan, claiming that "Japan should make voluntary efforts to achieve an economic recovery led by the expansion of domestic demand to lead a world economic recovery."
