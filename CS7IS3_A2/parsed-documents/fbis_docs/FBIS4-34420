This was announced by Venezuelan Credit Bank President Garcia Mendoza, who described the National Banking Association's communique on the way in which the Executive Branch has handled the financial crisis as disrespectful. Mendoza also did not agree with what National Banking Association President Jose Bouza Izquierdo said, because criticism is not among the duties of that association. Mendoza also said that he does not understand how the National Banking Association claims it works on behalf of the depositors during financial crises because the bankers acted contrary to this.
