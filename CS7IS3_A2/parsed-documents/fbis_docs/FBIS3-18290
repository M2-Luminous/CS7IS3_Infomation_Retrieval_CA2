An initial discussion on the measures will be held at the European Union [EU] Commission on Wednesday [2 March]. Our Brussels correspondent Nikolaos Belos reports. [Begin Belos recording] The memorandum with Greece's legal arguments on the measures against Skopje has been in the hands of the EU Commission as of yesterday evening. The memorandum was submitted by the Greek Government through diplomatic channels. According to a statement made at noon today by the Commission's spokesman, the memorandum will be examined by the legal department, which will give its opinion in the next few days as to whether the case against Greece should or should not be brought before the European Court. The spokesman further noted that an initial discussion on the Greek measures will be held at the Commission's regular weekly meeting on Wednesday. Greece's eight-page memorandum stresses that the government found itself in a difficult position in adopting the measures against Skopje as a last resort to protect its national interests. The national interests were jeopardized because of the aggravated situation caused by the unacceptable intransigence of Skopje and its insistence on expansionist claims. The memorandum describes Greece's decision as a political action for the protection of national sovereign rights. It also outlines the country's legal arguments with regard to the international and EU law. Among other examples of intergovernmental measures adopted by the EU in the past, the memorandum notes the economic sanctions against Argentina in connection with the Falklands, sanctions which were demanded by Great Britain. Another example that Greece cites in the memorandum is the EU's economic measures against Southern Rhodesia, whose aim was to exert pressure on a third country. The memorandum stresses in conclusion that the measures adopted by the Greek Government to defend its fundamental rights do not seek nor do they serve an economic goal but constitute an exercise of legal political pressure and fall within the possibilities of divergence which the EU law recognizes that member states can resort to.
