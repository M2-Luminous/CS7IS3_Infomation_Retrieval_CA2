He said he did not intend to leave the political life since he felt he shared responsibility for the appearance of the independent Slovakia. "I wanted Slovakia to become independent and contributed to this goal. I therefore cannot leave the political scene until a political structure capable of guaranteeing stability and prosperity for Slovakia is created," Moravcik said. He said he expected new groupings to appear on the Slovak political scene in the near future and mainly a strong bloc of center-oriented parties. Moravcik said the HZDS had deflected from the central line and has been lately oriented towards radicalism. He said he was for central policy but declined to say which political party he would prefer. Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar did not specify at any of government meetings his allegations that "the opposition is connected with financial circles," which were raised by him in the media, Moravcik said. On the contrary, a quick decision by the government on Tuesday [15 February] to put fifteen state-owned enterprises to direct sale testifies to Meciar's "genuine intention" to proceed with privatization in a honest way, Moravcik added ironically. Commenting on his "voluntary walk-out" from a government session on Tuesday, Moravcik said that he and Deputy Premier Roman Kovac were called upon by Meciar to leave the second part of the meeting, "if they are honest people," since it was dedicated to internal political situation.
