In a resolution, the KDH Council called this decision "a realistic possibility of saving society from the threat of the onset of political extremism." KDH Deputy Chairman Ivan Simko specified that the KDH regards as right-wing groupings, to which the KDH Council's decision might apply, the Democratic Party, the National Democratic Party, the Party of Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen, and representatives of the Standing Conference of the Civic Institute. The KDH Council meeting also dealt with the basic theses of the KDH election manifesto and the mechanism of compiling slates of candidates. [On the same day, on page 4, Bratislava SME in Slovak carries a 400-word Marian Bednar commentary entitled "Challenge." The commentator views the decision of the KDH Council of 30 April as an "unprecedented shift in the KDH's own way of thinking" and a "major breakthrough" because "vague statements about the integration of the right have assumed a far more specific shape." He believes that the KDH's "specific offer" will be accepted by "the followers of Cernak and Langos," by the former in view of their poor performance in preelection polls and by the latter because of "the nonexistence, following the demise of the Civic Democratic Union, of a political entity with which they would be ready to identify."]
