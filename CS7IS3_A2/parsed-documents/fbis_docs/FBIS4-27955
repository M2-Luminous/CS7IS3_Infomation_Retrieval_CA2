It will likely be difficult to impose UN-led sanctions because it will be difficult to win support for such sanctions from China and Russia. As a result, only the ROK, the United States, Japan, and other countries that are diplomatically close to those countries will participate in sanctions. The United States considers North Korea as a hostile country and a country assisting terrorism and has banned exports of goods, except for goods for humanitarian purposes, and South Korea has linked the nuclear issue to North-South economic cooperation. Therefore, some people question why "sanctions" are referred to at this time under these circumstances. North Korea is now facing economic difficulties; has a need to expand external economic cooperation to overcome the difficulties; and has adopted a foreign trade-first policy as one of the strategies to pursue during the three-year adjustment period for socialist construction. Therefore, other people point out that sanctions would deal a serious blow to North Korea in that sanctions would prevent North Korea from promoting external economic cooperation. Generally speaking, a country's dependence on external sources is the most important factor in assessing how effective sanctions against that country will be. It is difficult to correctly assess North Korea's dependence on external sources because not much objective information is available. Still, its dependence must be very low. North Korea's volume of trade for 1992 is estimated at $2.66 billion with the volume of exports at $1.02 billion and that of imports at $1.64 billion. The ROK National Unification Board estimated North Korea's GNP for 1992 at $21.1 billion. We can say North Korea's dependence on external sources is a little over 10 percent. Given this factor, the effect of sanctions against North Korea will be very limited. North Korea is found to be in a sense defenseless against sanctions in terms of its dependence on some specific countries and in terms of its need to import food, oil, and other strategic materials. North Korea does 33 percent of its trade with China, 17.6 percent with Japan, and 12.3 percent with CIS countries. This means North Korea does over 60 percent of its trade with these three, and it does almost 90 percent of its trade with its 10 biggest trading partners. Of course, the effect of sanctions will be minimal because China's participation in sanctions is negative and because only Japan and a few other countries will participate in sanctions. Also, oil, bituminous coal, and other minerals North Korea imports account for a fourth of the total volume of imports, and corn, rice, and other sorts of grain account for 10 percent. The amount of imports for oil and grain, strategic materials, is estimated at approximately $500 million, out of the estimated $1.6 billion. North Korea has food and energy shortages. This means North Korea is able to import less oil and grain than it needs. Still, North Korea imports 57 percent of its oil from China, 34 percent from Iran, and 4 percent from Russia, and it imports 70 percent of its food from China. This is why China is a factor that determines the success or failure of sanctions.
