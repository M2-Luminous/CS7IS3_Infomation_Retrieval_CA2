A total of 10 advanced reeducation-through-labor institutions across the country, two of which are in Hunan, were commended at the national conference. Hunan now ranks third among the country's advanced reeducation-through-labor institutions. At a national conference convened eight years ago, Hunan was criticized for its poor reeducation-through-labor work. Since then, the province's reeducation-through-labor bureau party committee has summed up lessons, readjusted leading bodies, and improved management with the result that the province's reeducation-through-labor work has made significant headway: The province's reeducation-through-labor bureau has formed a highly trained special police unit, the first of its kind in the entire country, has summed up experiences, has mapped out a "three grades, six levels" reeducation method, and has built a reeducation campus, a reeducation barracks, and a reeducation garden. At a result, the province's prisoner escape rate has dropped from 31.7 percent eight years ago to 0.25 percent at the moment. Thanks to a series of successful internal reforms, such as the labor system reform, personnel system reform, and distribution system reform, the province's reeducation-through-labor institutions have made unremitting efforts to improve product quality and raise economic efficiency. Over the past few years, they have developed a total of 56 new products, 10 of which have been awarded scientific and technological progress prizes by the state, ministries, or provincial departments. In 1993, Hunan's reeducation-through-labor institutions realized a total output value of $120 million yuan and a total profit of 12 million yuan, up by 70 million yuan and 8 million yuan respectively over 1988.
