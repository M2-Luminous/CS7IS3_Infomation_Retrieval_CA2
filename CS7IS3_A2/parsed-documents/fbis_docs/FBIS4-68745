The Moscow authorities have decided to put a complete stop to any unorganized street trading, to limit the activity of commercial kiosks, and to concentrate all trade at flea markets. This is the essence of the city government decree "On Additional Measures To Regulate Free (Street) Trading and Organize Flea Markets in Moscow" which was issued yesterday for official distribution. The decisiveness of the Moscow Government in its struggle against street trading is easy to explain. As Moscow officials have been constantly emphasizing, unorganized trade brings practically no revenue into the budget of Moscow, while seriously hurting the city's image. It goes without saying that a certain competitiveness between the leaders of Moscow and St. Petersburg also played a part here: Comparatively recently, Anatoliy Sobchak issued orders "On Regulating Small-Scale Street Trading" (KOMMERSANT wrote about this this month) which contained draconian measures on limiting street trading. Thus, one can observe a certain shift in tendency in the economic policies of the mayor's offices of the two major cities: Previously the authorities tried to illustrate their market economy orientation by encouraging free trade in the streets, but now they are trying to strengthen administrative control over all, even the most insignificant, traders and to remove them from the streets altogether, if possible. According to the new decree of the Moscow Government, any unorganized sales done by hand, from stands, carts, or cars have to be discontinued. Moreover, the authorities intend to cut down considerably on the number of commercial kiosks and stalls and to suspend their right to trade in manufactured goods and foodstuffs. They will only be allowed to sell soft drinks, cigarettes, fruits, souvenirs, flowers, and newspapers (in other words, the same goods they used to sell in Soviet times). The document emphasizes once again an idea that has in a way become traditional for the Moscow authorities: Concentration of all trading at large wholesale and flea markets around Moscow, as well as at small flea markets in all municipal districts. The administrative district prefects are requested to improve the performance of the 70 already functioning municipal markets in Moscow. The decree demands that the GUVD [Main Administration of Internal Affairs] improve the efficiency of the militia's work at markets and periodically replace assigned militiamen. At the same time, the government sets the task of opening eight new flea markets in 1994. It may be interesting to mention that, for the first time in the practice of the Moscow authorities, the decree sets specific provisional rules for organizing flea market trading: According to the document, admission to the market should be free of charge and retail stands are to be provided for a fee to all citizens without exception. In order to stimulate the emergence of flea markets, the decree provides for the extension of lease terms for plots of land utilized for organized sales. Besides, it plans to use the plots that were previously earmarked for building storage facilities to set up wholesale markets. Finally, it was also decided to open additional bus routes to bring traders to the markets at special commercial rates.
