Rukoro is reported to have received a letter which instructed him not to return to cabinet meetings and to return all cabinet documents in his possession. The letter was signed by Peingondjabi Shipoh. It is further reported that the reason given for his ousting is that he was no longer a leader of a political party. It was apparently by virtue of his former position as leader of SWANU [South-West Africa National Union] that he held a cabinet post. However, his ousting comes rather belatedly since Rukoro resigned as SWANU leader in September last year. However, sources indicate that Rukoro may have fallen out of favour for reportedly raising criticism in Cabinet on Tuesday [25 January] about the lack of Government action in the controversial case of Justice Minister Ngarikutuke Tjiriange and Home Affairs deputy minister Nangolo Ithete, whose ostrich business has been implicated in alleged illegal ostrich dealing. Tjiriange is Rukoro's direct superior, and Rukoro was apparently told to `drop the subject.' The letter to Rukoro from cabinet ordered him not to attend future meetings and to return all documentation, which he is reported to have done already. At the time of going to press last night, repeated efforts to contact the deputy minister for comment, were unsuccessful. At this stage it is not known whether Rukoro's deputy minister post is in jeopardy as well.
