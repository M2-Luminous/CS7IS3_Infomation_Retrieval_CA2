The "big structural conference," scheduled for 1996, must be held as soon as possible, Stoiber stressed in a DPA interview during the weekend [26 February]. This is the only way incorrect developments concerning the integration process can be corrected on a timely basis, he pointed out. Renate Schmidt, chairwoman of the Bavarian Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], however, accused the Christian Social Union [CSU] of marginalizing Bavaria as far as European policies are concerned. Stoiber believes that a transfer of power from Brussels to the national states and laender is urgently required. "We must exert pressure here." Stoiber has caused a considerable stir in the past few months with his criticism of the government's European policies. After the forced resignation of Environment Minister Peter Gauweiler, he appointed the minister for European affairs, Thomas Goppel, as Gauweiler's successor, declaring that he himself will take care of European policies in the future. In the DPA interview, Stoiber strongly criticized the financial burden that the European Union represents for Germany. Thus, at 22 billion German marks, Germany contributed about 70 percent of the balance of net payers in 1992. In view of a nearly 30 percent contribution to the finances of the European Union, a return of only 13 percent is not sufficient. Thus, in the upcoming financial negotiations, Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union) must insist on the agreement adopted by European Council in 1984. This decision stipulates that "every member state that carries too large a budget burden in view of its relative prosperity may profit from a correction measure at an appropriate time." This topic was not raised on the occasion of German reunification so as not to provoke resistance on the part of the partners, Stoiber stressed. "It must now be put on the agenda." Stoiber accused the European Council of Ministers of making decisions "behind closed doors" without sufficient democratic legitimation. According to Bavaria's SPD Chairwoman Renate Schmidt, Bavaria threatens to be marginalized as far as European policies are concerned. Instead of vigorously defending the interests of Bavaria and Germany at the right time, members of the Bavarian government and leading CSU politicians at the federal level are misusing the topic to acquire a stronger profile in the election campaign, Schmidt criticized.
