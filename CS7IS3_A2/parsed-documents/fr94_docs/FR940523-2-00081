FR940523-2-00081 FR940523-2-00042 A2.0␣How and by Whom the Data Will be Used A2.1␣Purpose of the Data Collection The Department will use this information for several purposes. Primarily the data will be used to report to the Secretary, and in turn to the Domestic Policy Council of the White House, HUD's contribution to the Administration's effort to increase the number of law enforcement officers by 100,000 by 1998. The Department will also analyze the information to better understand the contribution of public housing funds to local law enforcement efforts. A recent HUD technical assistance contract addressing the issues of law enforcement and public housing show an increasing financial commitment by HAs to pay for law enforcement and security services. Two major policy issues are raised by these HUD funds paying for security and law enforcement personnel: comparable level of law enforcement services provided by local government, and liability. Many of the financial commitments by HAs show evidence of public housing communities which do not receive a comparable level of law enforcement services from local government, as required by the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC), or HAs paying additional costs disproportionate to the additional services received. HAs compensate for the lower level of services by paying for additional officers or security. HUD is interested in understanding this issue, and assisting HAs to negotiate for the required comparable level of services, and for any additional services. Liability has also been raised as a major policy issue. If HUD grantees are using HUD funds to pay for law enforcement and security personnel, it could be incumbent upon the Department to ensure that all legal and insurance matters are adequately addressed by grantees before financial and contractual commitments are made for law enforcement and security services. Without any knowledge of the extent of those commitments, and which HAs are making those commitments, HUD cannot develop an adequate response for technical assistance and training. As HUD funds are increasingly targeted to law enforcement and security costs, the Department needs to understand and develop appropriate policies to assist HAs in the development of safe and secure environments. Without an understanding of current commitments and their shifts from year to year, the Department will not be able to develop effective program or technical assistance responses to HAs with inadequate law enforcement an security coverage.
