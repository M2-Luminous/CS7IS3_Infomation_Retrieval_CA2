The session was called at the beginning of the year and was a good opportunity to summarize cross-strait nongovernment exchanges, as well as to review prospects for cross-strait relations. The year 1993 was one in which great developments were made in cross-strait relations. Cross-strait nongovernment exchanges expanded, there was an unprecedented amount of Taiwanese investment in the mainland both in scope and type, and cross-strait bilateral trade continued to grow drastically. The cross-strait high-ranking nongovernment "Wang-Ku talks" were held for the first time, and ARATS-SEF [Straits Exchange Foundation] routine talks were held in Taipei for the first time. The mainland authorities issued a White Paper on "The Taiwan Issue and China's Reunification" in 1993, which states to the world the Chinese mainland's position, principle, and policies on the Taiwan issue in a comprehensive and systematic way so that the world may have a clearer picture of the issue. The rapid development in cross-strait relations has internal impetus, namely China's reform and opening up, the elevation of its position in the world, and the cultural tradition and flesh-and- blood ties shared by people on the two shores. In modern history, Taiwan was ceded to Japan for over half a century, and has been separated from the Chinese mainland since 1949. Since the beginning of the 1980's the economic development and ties between the mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong have become increasingly closer. Thus a new opportunity for the reinvigoration of the Chinese nation has surfaced. Before Chiang Ching-kuo passed away, he lifted the ban on Taiwan people going to the Chinese mainland to visit relatives. That was a practical measure with great vision, and has played a great role in promoting the relaxation and gradual development of cross-strait relations characterized by long-termed confrontation. Changes have gradually taken place in Taiwan's situation with the end of the Chiang era. The Kuomintang second-generation leaders who are now in office are characterized by fewer ties with the mainland, but with weaker anticommunist sentiments. On the one hand, they have handled cross-strait relations with a comparatively practical attitude, and gradually relaxed restrictions on Taiwan businessmen investing in the mainland. On the other hand, however, they have the consciousness of being content to retain sovereignty over a part of the country, and always want to give prominence to a "political body on an equal footing" in cross-strait exchanges, while doing their best to embody "one China, one Taiwan" in ties with foreign countries. The surfacing of the monster "vacationing foreign affairs" [du jia wai jiao 3256 0250 1120 0094] is one example. It is precisely such an erroneous mentality of being content to retain sovereignty over a part of China that has resulted in unfavorable effects on cross-strait relations today. The repatriation of hijackers from mainland China should never have been difficult to achieve, and could have been entirely resolved through full negotiations between ARATS and SEF in the spirit of the Jinmen Accord. But the Taiwan Authorities decisionmaking tier is bent on giving prominence to the political and legal nature of this routine issue, thus making the issue exceed the nongovernment scope of ARATS and SEF. Consequently, the matter remains unsolved. It is universally known where the crux of the problem lies. While dealing with cross-strait political issue, ARATS Chairman Mr. Wang Daohan said that this issue called for both mainland and Taiwan Authorities to send negotiators. That was a sensible and reasonable attitude. Because both ARATS and SEF are nongovernment organizations authorized by relevant Taiwan and mainland authorities, and were founded to resolve specific issues in cross- strait ties, the ARATS-SEF routine and functional talks should be free of political intervention. However, will Taipei be courageous enough to send men to conduct talks with the mainland on political issues? The cross-strait economic and cultural exchange will continue to expand, the talks between ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shubei and his SEF counterpart Mr. Chiao Jen-ho may make arrangements for the second Wang-Ku meeting, which is the hope and interest of compatriots in both Taiwan and mainland China. Taipei suddenly spread the news yesterday that the Tang-Chiao talks would be postponed. That is not a rational and practical attitude. We hope that Taipei's decisionmakers will be good to their word and let the Tang-Chiao talks be conducted as scheduled so that cross-strait relations may enjoy a good beginning this year.
