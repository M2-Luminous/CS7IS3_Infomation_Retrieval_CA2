In a statement to AL-AHRAM published today, al-Bid says that the features of this terrorist scheme are clear to all, and its threat extends to a number of Arab countries. He called for confronting the scheme by bringing it up for discussion at the pan-Arab level. He said the backward mentalities that want to impose their control on the Arab and Islamic nation must be confronted. Al-Bid welcomed any Arab effort to steer unified Yemen clear of the specter of civil war and help the country to continue its democratic and peaceful march and adhere to the Pledge and Accord Document on national reconciliation. He praised the efforts of Egypt and President Husni Mubarak to contain the Yemeni crisis. He said Egypt, by virtue of its relations with and assistance to Yemen, can play an effective role on the Yemeni scene. On the situation in Yemen, al-Bid said: From experience, we have come to realize that Yemen had neither the right circumstances nor the suitable leadership for unity of action in the past. Some believed the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document ended the crisis, but this is wrong; the signing meant only that we acknowledged the crisis and laid down the bases to resolve it, he said. "The situation requires that we move toward implementation in the appropriate circumstances," he added. On fears that a military confrontation may break out in Yemen, al-Bid said there are such fears, and the Military Committee needs help from Arab forces -- especially Egypt, which is the closest Arab country to us -- so that a civil war can be avoided.
