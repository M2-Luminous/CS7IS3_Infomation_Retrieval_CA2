The newspaper managers were notified that the newspaper was suspended for going beyond its goals and tasks outlined in its programme, which the newspaper did several times. The inspection declared that a recent publication containing insults against lawmakers of the Irkutsk regional legislative assembly, which was entitled "Thieves Have Won or New Regional Committee in Action", was aimed at flaring up social tension and intolerance, which violates Article 4 of the Russian Law on the Mass Media. The newspaper, which is sold beyond the Far-Eastern region and practically has a nationwide status, will have to be re-registered in Moscow.
