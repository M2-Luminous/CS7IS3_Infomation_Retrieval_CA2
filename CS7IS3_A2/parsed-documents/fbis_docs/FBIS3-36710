It is obvious that the most important issue in its agenda was the issue of the merger of the Belarusian and Russian financial systems. Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich delivered a speech at this session. We are going to broadcast excerpts of his speech addressing the gist of the protocol of the session of the Russian-Belarusian commission of experts. [Begin Kebich recording] Within three months, beginning with the date of the merger of our monetary systems, the Republic of Belarus will conduct payments of wages to staff employed in the state budget sector according to a single wage scale, which is being used in the Russian Federation. Belarus will finance measures to ensure the social protection of the population at the expense of the Republic's budget. However, this does not mean that social payments will equal similar ones in Russia. The National Bank of Belarus will allot credits -- at amounts which were agreed upon with the Russian Finance Ministry and the Central Bank of Russia -- to the Belarusian Government, commercial banks of Belarus, and other loan providers. The National Bank of Belarus can buy hard currency, precious stones, and other valuables only at the request and at the expense of the Belarusian Government and other legal bodies, and at the expense of its own funds and profits. The National Bank of Belarus buys payment notes, cash, and Russian currency above the amount which it will receive within the single exchange of money resulting from the monetary system merger [words indistinct] and performs noncash transactions [words indistinct]. Correspondent accounts will only be used for the sake of recording our mutual accounts. This will differ from the current situation, whereby these accounts are used to rigidly control (?the accounts), they will only record trade operations performed between Russian and Belarus. When the National Bank of Belarus hands back the Russian payment notes, the Central Bank of Russia will transfer appropriate sums to corresponding accounts in the National Bank of Belarus. The establishment of the exchange rate of the Russian and Belarusian currencies is based on methods drafted by the Russian National Committee for Statistics, located in Belarus, and proceeds from the buying power of the national currencies and [words indistinct]. The establishment of an exchange rate for the Russian and Belarusian currencies is closely linked with other procedures tied with the merger of the monetary systems and the change of price scales in Belarus, so as not to bring about, on the one hand, a decrease in net income and savings of private individuals and legal bodies, and, on the other hand, an increase in inflation in the newly merged financial system. The Belarusian side, agreeing in general to the above-mentioned methods of establishing an exchange rate for the Russian and Belarusian currencies, proposes to estimate the monetary resources of the population at a one-to-one rate, including cash, savings, and deposit accounts. The parties state that the creation of [words indistinct] equal conditions for mutual trade, a single mechanism for formulating free [word indistinct] prices, the distribution of domestic Russian prices for energy and other recourses on the territory of Belarus, the lifting of export customs duties on trade between Russia and Belarus constitute the obligatory condition for the existence of the single financial system. Therefore, [words indistinct]. [end recording] Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich has also touched upon the issue of a political strike which, as you know, is scheduled to take place on 15 February. [Begin Kebich recording] The situation is difficult [words indistinct]. We (?will undertake all the measures to not permit this strike.) The situation is different in various regions of Belarus. However, [words indistinct]. The task is to [words indistinct]. In my opinion, I do not have to agitate for [words indistinct]. [end recording]
