III. Application Process An application kit is required as the formal submission to apply for funding. The kit includes information on the Statement of Work and Budget for activities proposed by the applicant. An application may be obtained by writing the Fair Housing Information Clearinghouse, Post Office Box 6091, Rockville, MD 20850, or by calling the toll-free number 1&hyph;800&hyph;343&hyph;3442. To ensure a prompt response, it is suggested that requests for application kits be made by telephone. Completed applications are to be submitted to Laurence D. Pearl, Director, Office of Program Standards and Evaluation, Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 5224, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. The application due date and time will be specified in the application kit. In no event, however, will the application be due before August 15, 1994. The application deadline is firm as to date and hour. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is received after the deadline. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems. A transmission by facsimile machine (``FAX'') will not constitute delivery. IV. Checklist of Application Submission Requirements (a) General Requirements The application kit will contain a checklist of application submission requirements to complete the application process. Each proposal submitted under this NOFA must contain the following items: (1) A metropolitan areawide analysis of the impediments to fair housing choice faced by individual homeseekers within the Chicago metropolitan area, taking into account any of the institutional problems involving the major segments of the real estate and lending industries. This analysis must include a discussion of the problems which specifically relate to the marketing of single-family and multifamily housing to all segments of the population, with particular emphasis on marketing to persons considered protected under the Fair Housing Act and other statutes. The analysis must also discuss the connections between the effectiveness of marketing and the processes of selecting tenants for multifamily projects and evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants for home mortgages. The analysis must also address how its proposed clearinghouse concept will (i) address any and all impediments identified, (ii) help effect change in the current racial and income related housing patterns within the Chicago metropolitan area affected by this NOFA, and (iii) help increase the awareness of all participants in the housing process, especially participants from the real estate industry, of their obligations under fair housing statutes. (2) A metropolitan areawide affirmative fair housing marketing plan with the following components: (i) A description of an overall advertising campaign targeted toward groups identified as least likely to apply for assisted housing located within areas for reasons such as the race or national origin of the persons in the area, the lack of units that are accessible to physically disabled persons in the area and the absence of significant numbers of families with children in the area. The campaign may be organized to reach the entire area affected by this NOFA or may be segmented to reach particular jurisdictions, sections within individual jurisdictions or particular segments of the eligible population. The plan shall describe the media to be used, including minority media, community organizations and contacts, referral services that assist disabled persons, and other tactics. The objective of this part of the plan is to encourage prospective renters and home purchasers to use the services of the clearinghouse in their housing searches, especially those services that will support their searches within non-traditional areas.
