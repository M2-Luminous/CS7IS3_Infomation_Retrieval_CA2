Mr. Lu and Preliminary Working Committee members met representatives of seven local civil servants' unions yesterday for two-and-a-half hours. Unions included the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants Association and the Senior Non-Expatriate Officers Association. The Association for Expatriate Civil Servants was excluded from the meeting. Last year the government issued a directive asking civil servants to turn down invitations from the Preliminary Working Committee to discuss transitional matters. Leader of the Government Employees Association Cheng Chung-wai proposed that Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) members and civil servant unions form a group despite the government directive. Senior Non-Expatriate Officers Association deputy chairman Alex Au said his union would welcome the move as it would improve the transparency of the group which advises China on transitional matters, but it depended on the composition. "We would know what's happening about transitional matters relating to the civil service," he said. Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants Association chairman Peter Wong said he hoped the PWC would consult the unions before announcing or disclosing its proposals. "It would make their recommendations more credible," Mr. Wong said. A government spokesman, however, reiterated the administration's stance, saying there were enough channels of communication to deal with transition matters. They should only be dealt with by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. Local unions also secured assurances from Mr. Lu that China's policy towards Hong Kong would not be affected by the continuing row between Britain and China. Mr. Lu told the unions he hoped all civil servants could remain in their posts, apart from those in the directorate, which would be appointed by the Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region. He also backed calls by the unions for more cash to be put into the pension reserve fund, but refused to disclose how much. Governor Chris Patten announced in his policy speech last October that $7 billion would be injected into the fund over a two-year period. The Association of Expatriate Civil Servants vice-chairman Allan Roger said his group met Mr. Lu in 1986 and had been assured China was happy to have expatriates in the civil service after 1997. "We basically wanted China's public reassurance that they still want expats in government. At that time the expat population was 3.2 per cent of the civil service, and Mr. Lu said that was fine. Now it is down to 1.2 per cent and it is clear what the government here is trying to do. Frankly, we don't place a great deal of store in what they (China) are going to say one way or the other, because we are convinced it is not a Beijing driven scheme anyway. It is definitely a local government move."
