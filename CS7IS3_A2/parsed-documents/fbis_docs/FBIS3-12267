FBIS3-12267 "drnes039dd_94032" FBIS-NES-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 Palestinian Affairs Qaddumi on Tunis Meeting, U.S. Invitation JN2602134294 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1220 GMT 26 Feb 94 JN2602134294 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Telephone interview with Faruq Qaddumi, identified by his nom de guerre Abu-al-Lutf, chief of the PLO Political Department, "conducted a short while ago" by unidentified reporter; place not given -- recorded] [Text] [Reporter] Mr. Faruq Qaddumi: Have you taken any steps that could be announced, or at least what is the current tendency? Would the talks be suspended? And would they be resumed if your conditions are met or if new bases are laid down? Will the PLO be satisfied with moving the talks to Washington, as President Clinton called for? [Qaddumi] Moving the talks is not sufficient. The invitation, which is addressed to the PLO, seems to forget what took place yesterday. The crime perpetrated by Israeli hands -- through the army's collaboration -- cannot be forgiven. Decisive steps must be taken by the international community to stop such acts in the future. They say that Israel is protecting its security. In fact, we are the ones who need security. Israel is the hotbed of tension; it is the one which is creating such problems and practicing terrorism in the region. Israel is a Nazi state, which is perpetrating massacres. This is a Palestinian holocaust. They say that they were treated unjustly in history, however, they are inflicting their injustice on others. The United States comes to cover up this crime with its call for negotiations. This is not the issue. There should be international guarantees to protect our people inside the occupied territory. Defenseless people are facing this Israeli military warmarchine supplied to Israel by the United States. [Reporter] We can understand from what you are saying that the Palestinian leadership is now discussing whether or not the talks will continue. It seems from what you said about Israel that it is difficult to resume the talks. [Qaddumi] The continuation of the talks is difficult now. We accepted the call for peace, but Israel is practicing the opposite. It is practicing terrorism. How can a man hold talks under these circumstances. We recalled all our delegations here to Tunis. First, the Security Council must issue a resolution condemning Israel and take the necessary steps in this regard. The United States should take measures to protect our people through the Security Council and international forces. Steps also must be taken to dismantle these settlements. The United States is saying that these settlements are obstacle to peace. This crime proves that these settlements are obstacle to peace. Therefore, these settlements must be removed. Otherwise, what is the benefit of these talks? [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, does this mean that the resumption of talks now depends on the removal of the settlements? [Qaddumi] This should be the case. We are holding talks with the United States and the Security Council. These settlements must be dismantled and the occupation should end. This is the cause of tension in the region. [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf: We must be clear in the wake of the terrible massacre which took place in the Ibrahimi Mosque. Does this mean that you are suspending the talks with Israel, or will you discuss the issue of settlements and settlers during the coming talks? [Qaddumi] First, the Security Council should issue a resolution. Then, the second step comes; namely, the removal of these settlements. If no measures are taken these negotiations will be meaningless. [Reporter] Israel announced that it will take firm measures against settlers? [Qaddumi] Let us see what are these measures which will really provide security and peace for our people. [Reporter] Shim'on Peres announced that the negotiations should be rescued? How can this be done? [Qaddumi] He himself should take measures, not the Palestinian people. [Reporter] But he speaks about rescuing the negotiations as they are in a dilemma? [Qaddumi] They are the ones whose positions have brought about this dilemma, from the Cairo agreement until today. Every day, they go back on what they wrote in this agreement and postpone withdrawal. All this means Israel does not want peace in the region. It wants to be rewarded for its occupation of Palestinian and Arab territories. [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, this means all the basics on which the negotiations between you and Israel were initiated could be subject to review. [Qaddumi] The negotiations cannot continue in this manner. The cosponsors of the conference, particularly the United States, should act as a sponsor that is not biased toward Israel. The weapons it gave to Israel are enough. It suffices that the United States says it wants to safeguard Israel's security. The Palestinian Arab people and the Arab people are the ones threatened by Israel because the latter is the hotbed of tension, and a factor of instability. No more lying to the world. [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, the PLO calls for the sending of international forces to protect Palestinians in the occupied territories. A short while ago, Peres said he completely opposes this idea. [Qaddumi] This means Israel does not want peace. The international community must decide, as it does in other international problems, to safeguard peace if today's world wants to establish stability and security in all the world's regions, including the Middle East. [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, we know the atmosphere is tense after yesterday's massacre. How can one control the situation, security-wise, in the occupied territories? [Qaddumi] This can take place by adopting speedy measures. First, the UN Security Council must not only condemn this crime but should take practical measures. The United States has to play a basic role in these measures. Israel, too, must respond to the international community's will by removing these settlements so that these terrorist acts do not recur. [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, you are asking the international community, or the UN Security Council, to adopt practical measures. Give us an idea about these practical measures? What are you asking for? [Qaddumi] First, international forces. Second, the removal of the settlements. Third, to expeditiously carry out withdrawal. Fourth, the United States must shoulder its responsibilities as a sponsor of the conference to have the peace process proceed on the road to eliminating the Israeli occupation. [Reporter] These are the practical measures. However, during the meetings you are currently holding in Tunis, can you tell us about the atmosphere that prevails? [Qaddumi] The atmosphere is very tense because this crime has exceeded all crimes. This is Palestine's holocaust, commited by the Israelis against the Palestinian people. [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, do you have any new information about the way yesterday's massacre was committed? [Qaddumi] The way in which the crime was committed is that while the worshipers were performing Friday prayers more than one settler came in. There were three groups. The settler was among them. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to have these great losses, more than 65 marytrs and 250 wounded. There were three groups. The permanent presence of the Israeli Army there helped these groups carry out their crime because they entered from three doors. But, this doctor of U.S. origin is the one who stepped ahead of the others and as a result of this was hit and killed. [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, does this mean that the PLO directly accuses the Israeli Government and the Israeli Army and holds them responsible? [Qaddumi] The Israeli Government is directly responsible for this crime. [Reporter] Thank you, Mr. Faruq Qaddumi.
