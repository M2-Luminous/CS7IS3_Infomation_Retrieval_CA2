FR941006-0-00025 FR941006-0-00006 Public Comment The FDIC received only four comment letters on the proposal, three from banking trade associations and one from the parent company of several insured banks. All four comment letters enthusiastically supported the rescission of the rapid growth rule. One commenter acknowledged that the rescission would create a regulatory gap_in that neither the brokered deposit rule nor the prompt corrective action rule limits the activities of well-capitalized institutions_but the same commenter believed that this gap would not pose a significant supervisory risk due to the FDIC's system of Call Reports and its Growth Monitoring System. A second commenter echoed these sentiments, adding that rescission would reduce an unnecessary regulatory burden. The third commenter opined that rescission of the rapid growth rule would have no negative impact on the banking system; on the contrary, rescission would remove unnecessary reporting burdens and marketing restrictions. The fourth commenter added that, given the trend toward consolidation in the banking industry, most institutions will soon be so big that fewer and fewer of them will ever achieve the percentage of rapid growth necessary to trigger the rapid growth rule. After considering these comments and staff analysis of the issues noted above, the FDIC has decided to rescind the rapid growth rule. (In rescinding the rapid growth rule, 12 CFR 304.6, the FDIC will also rescind the line on the table in 12 CFR 304.7, which pertains to the Office of Management and Budget's Control Number for the rapid growth rule.) Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information contained in the rapid growth rule, which consists of the required written notice of rapid growth, has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 3064&hyph;0074, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). The current estimate of annual reporting burden for the collection of information in this regulation is 1,625 burden hours. Rescission of the rapid growth rule will result in a saving of 1,625 burden hours a year. Regulatory Flexibility Act The FDIC's Board of Directors has concluded that the final rule will not impose a significant economic hardship on small institutions. The rule does not establish any recordkeeping or reporting requirements that necessitate the expertise of specialized accountants, lawyers or managers. The rule would, in fact, reduce the reporting requirements to which banks are presently subject. Rescinding the rapid growth rule will afford some insured banks the opportunity to conduct activities previously prohibited unless notice were given in accordance with the rule (for instance, the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside a bank's normal trade area, or the acquisition of secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements, such that one or a combination of both activities were designed to increase the bank's assets by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month period). The FDIC's Board of Directors therefore certifies pursuant to section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605) that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 304 Bank deposit insurance, Banks, banking, Freedom of information, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. In consideration of the foregoing, the FDIC hereby amends Part 304 of chapter III of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: PART 304_FORMS, INSTRUCTIONS AND REPORTS 1.
