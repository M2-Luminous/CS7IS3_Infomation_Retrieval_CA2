The circular says: China today enjoys political stability and economic growth, the people live in peace and work in contentment, and the reform of the economic and political administrative systems are continuing. Nevertheless, we must soberly realize that we cannot afford to be optimistic about the state of security in certain places and departments. This is particularly true during the Spring Festival period when people will visit their families and friends, schools will be closed for holidays, and there will be all kinds of celebration activities. Lawless elements will take advantage of these opportunities to steal, rob, practice hooliganism, and abduct women and children; and such residual phenomena as gambling, prostitution, patronage of prostitutes, feudal superstitious habits, and other social viles are likely to resurface. Thus, leading party and government authorities must exert great efforts to ensure social security and intensify law propagation during the Spring Festival and consider this project an important assignment for safeguarding social stability. Plans should be drawn up and performance should be accessed collectively so that the people will have a peaceful and happy Spring Festival. The circular urges all committees for comprehensive management of social security and judicial departments to work in conjunction with party committee propaganda departments to launch a project to publicize the law during the Spring Festival. It says: We should fully take advantage of radio and TV broadcasts, newspapers, and other modern mass media as well as literary and art shows and other projects, such as holding a propaganda week (or day), to publicize the significance of intensifying social security; to publicize "PRC Criminal Law" articles about punishment for conduct that endangers public safety, violates citizens' personal freedom and democratic rights, and infringes upon others' property; and also publicize the "PRC Regulations for Controlling Public Offenses" so that the masses will be reminded to abide by Chinese laws and regulations and take an active part in comprehensive management of social security, so that we will all understand our responsibility and work with various departments and units to safeguard social security. The circular says: We must count on the masses and give full scope to the roles played by grass-roots units -- such as neighborhood and village committees, and crime squads formed by the masses -- to discover lawless conduct in time and harshly and promptly crack down on crimes which seriously undermine social security and order. All committees for comprehensive management of social security must coordinate with various other units to work with public security authorities to ensure security during the Spring Festival. Judicial authorities at all levels must intensify their control of and assistance and education for personnel undergoing reform or education through labor and take the initiative to assist public security authorities and party and government departments in placing, assisting, and educating those who are on probation. Grass-roots mediation organizations must actively provide mediation services so that factors that may sharpen contradictions will be nipped in the bud.
