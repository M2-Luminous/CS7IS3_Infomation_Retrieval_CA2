Amangeldy Muraliyev, chairman of the State Economic Committee, emphasized that presently the country is experiencing a slump in production that looks set to worsen, because, on one hand, the stage of industrial restructuring has not yet begun, and on the other the diversification of forms of ownership has not yet reached a level where market mechanisms begin to work. In Muraliyev's view, it is clearly essential to pinpoint sectors to be financed on a priority basis down to the level of individual enterprises and industries; to work out a mechanism of tied credit and investment allocation; and to set up a special government commission to deal with the matters. The State Economic Committee chairman said that transformations in the agricultural sector have facilitated access to land for broad sectors of the population, helped agricultural enterprises achieve greater independence, and given private farmers a new lease on life. Hopes that a competitive environment will emerge following the introduction of new economic methods, however, have not been fulfilled. Muraliyev said that the objectives of financial stabilization require that a number of unpopular measures be taken in the short run. These include the freeing of bread and municipal services prices, the abandonment of licensing, and drastic cuts in loans to state-owned enterprises. We need to find an optimum compromise, he emphasized, between a tight monetary policy, the development of production, and the maintenance of the minimum living standards of the population. In his view this is not an easy task, but the national referendum demonstrated people's high degree of confidence in President Akayev and, hence, in reform. We should draw on this confidence, Muraliyev said, in order to carry out economic reform at this stage in a proper fashion.
