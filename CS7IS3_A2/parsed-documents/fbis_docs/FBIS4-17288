Two months have passed since Professor Livshits moved to the Kremlin, taking up the post of leader of the Russian Federation president's group of experts. "You encounter many absolutely gripping topics here," he says: "There are dramas, tragedies, joys -- in a word, everything a man needs." From this we may conclude that my interlocutor has taken up his new job with characteristic enthusiasm. Nevertheless, summing up his one-month incumbency in his new post, he noted that so far he has only been laboring to "reduce the negative, not to create the positive." February-March saw an unforeseen substantial fall in production. One reason is well known -- the mass defaulting which caused enterprises to shut down. No economic mechanism can regulate the problem of debt defaulting smoothly, without destroying production: No coercive measures were drawn up, and a reversion to the past was feared. A virtually spontaneous, very expensive, mutual absorption of debts (apart from the recovery of debts by the Ministry of Finance) is taking place. You often hear directors say that, on the whole, many people have adapted: Defaulting will go away miraculously, they say, and things are OK. But there will be no miracle. This is a crisis of incomplete reform. And trying to solve the problem once again by the methods of 1992, i.e. through credit injections, would mean ending up this time with inflation not of 15-20 percent, as before, but all of 40 percent. Fortunately, the government understands this perfectly. The payments crisis induces Prof. Livshits to observe that there is no controlled mechanism of economic reform in Russia. Reform is a change in the design of a mechanism, be it a clock or an economy. In this sense reform is not being carried out in terms of a controlled process of redesigning the economic mechanism from above. Nor has this been the case, in the estimation of the expert group leader, for at least 18 months to two years (reform is being carried out spontaneously from below, but that is another story). Even though governments and ministers have changed in this time -- some called reformers, others the reverse. We are accustomed to judging how reformist a government is by what sort of monetary and credit policy it implements. In reality, this is no more than an illusion: Monetary policy, in Livshits' opinion, can create better or worse conditions for reforms, but it does not change the design. The number of monopolies is not thereby reduced, nor do civilized markets emerge, or changes in the forms of ownership occur. So that there is just one sign of a reformist government, Aleksandr Yakovlevich insists: whether or not it engages in reform, whether or not it controls the process. We have contrived to lose all control over state enterprises, although we have considerable experience in this area. The state sector is being not just privatized but sold off chaotically, without premeditation, without any kind of decrees or laws. Therefore virtually no reform can be seen in this area. Unfortunately the returns on privatization are so far small. Check privatization was necessary, but it brings virtually nothing in to the budget. With such meager investment resources we must seriously consider how to sell the most efficient property to major investors. World experience shows that a country which carries out mass privatization as a rule obtains healthy resources and does not suffer inflation. Taxation. Reform in precisely this area is capable of influencing the design mentioned above, to wit, by stimulating investment activity. Instead of this, as my interlocutor puts it, the only result of the taxation system currently operating is "a Russia-wide groan from below." One further argument to prove the absence of reform -- the wholesale markets. There are changes in this area, but they are fairly untypical. The painfully familiar former state supply bodies have now been transformed into joint-stock companies, but in no way ceding their monopoly status in the wholesale markets. In actual fact the situation has even worsened, since a state monopoly was hardly worse than is a private one. In recent months, and even years, it has been fashionable to talk about the allocation of structural priorities, the points of growth where resources should be invested, about selective policy. Has this policy been elaborated in reality? You can see in the federal budget how resources are distributed for federal special-purpose programs. But here only the projects that are finalized earliest and best can receive priority, and these projects will be funded accordingly. Does this mean that a given project and a given sector are really accorded priority? Certainly not. And what is the structure of priorities in our country today? There is really nothing especially clever here: It is nothing but the result of the real correlation of forces in the Duma and between the representatives of certain sector blocs. Who would be so bold as to claim that these are indeed Russia's structural priorities? All the above might prompt someone to ask the legitimate question: But why, in point of fact, complicate life for ourselves? Why is all this necessary, if all over the world the process of forming market mechanisms has proceeded as naturally as the grass grows? Yes, the Kremlin's chief expert suggests, this is absolutely true: Only the American grass was not concreted over for 70 years. On the other hand, we made up our minds to smash the concrete and wait for grass to appear. It did indeed spring up, but through the cracks and overlying pieces of concrete. Hence all this grass takes on wild, distorted forms. Such are the outlines of our market economy today. What we really need to do is dismantle this concrete seriously, genuinely, but this is not yet being done. There is only one solution: to complete reform, as clearly stated in the president's message to the Federal Assembly. Today inflation has been comparatively stabilized; however, this is the result not of last year's policy, but of the policy of the first few months of this year. And a further rapid fall in inflation should be viewed as a great danger. The value of such achievements is only significant when what is really important is not thereby lost. Today we are losing part of our high-tech industry, as my interlocutor wrote in IZVESTIYA in December, and this process has not been stopped. In an economy like ours inflation can be beaten only gradually, through positional warfare. But the factor of its relative stabilization must be used to achieve at least, for example, a small reduction in centralized interest rates. That is to say that investors should be given some kind of signal for action. Of course they need guarantees and economic freedom, but this is again nothing less than controlled reform. The systemic crisis, the incompleteness of reform -- all this cannot, unfortunately, be solved overnight. Livshits assures us that, whatever we do now, by the fall all the same, familiar problems will come our way again. But since we know in advance that reform will progress slowly, we must try at least to minimize the difficulties as much as possible. There are elementary ways and means connected with the elementary introduction of order. Why is this not being done? I think, because of the weakness of the state and many other factors. Incidentally, there is no problem of defaulting on payments in the private sector. Where there is no state sector, debts are always extracted, albeit by primitive methods. This is another weed growing through the concrete. But for a state to be unable to cope with state enterprises -- who ever heard anything like it? All the same, do they know behind the Kremlin walls what to do about defaulting? Above all, there are no plans there to change the government; no direct coercive measures are being prepared, although certain recommendations are being made to the president. There is no question of hitting the kopek in anyone's pocket; but the time has come to compel enterprises to settle their debts, activating their hard currency resources if necessary. Aleksandr Livshits himself believes that a clear timetable should be established for the elimination of budget debt not only for 1993, but also in terms of the resources being distributed now. We must find the strength to establish rigid controls over the passage of budgetary funds through the whole system. If necessary, laws should be amended. We should worry especially about Russian enterprises which deliver products to the CIS republics and are not receiving payment on time. All this, of course, will not provide a radical solution to the default problem -- there is no avoiding bankruptcies and the circulation of promissory notes. But the scale of these things can be markedly reduced. The government's strategy was made public at the beginning of March. Descriptions of it as inflationary have not been borne out. If it manages to adopt a series of measures to counter defaulting on payments, improve the situation in the consumer market, and seriously tackle the redesign of the economic mechanism, paths to survival will be opened.
