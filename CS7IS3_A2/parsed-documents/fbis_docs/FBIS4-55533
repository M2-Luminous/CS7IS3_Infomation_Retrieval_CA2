The main topic was how to preserve an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nada al-Isa reports on these talks: [Begin al-Isa recording] Stipe Mesic listened with pleasure to the information provided him by Messrs. Pejanovic and Lazovic after their return from Moscow, where they went as members of the Serbian Civic Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They stressed that they had held talks in Moscow with Vitaliy Churkin, who said for the first time that Russia, too, wanted to preserve the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. He openly said that he no longer trusted Karadzic. Pejanovic and Lazovic discussed Croatian-Muslim relations, that is, the future federation, with Stipe Mesic. Messrs. Lazovic and Pejanovic addressed the same issues at today's news conference in Zagreb. In order to help improve relations between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Stipe Mesic accepted the invitation by Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly Chairman Miro Lazovic to visit Sarajevo soon. He will come, he said, as soon as this week's assembly session was over. As is known, the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] has been announcing that it will seek Mesic's removal at the session. However, Mesic says: I will remain the chairman of the assembly even after the session. They will not manage to remove me, even though they are hoping to. Mesic revealed specially for Radio Television Bosnia-Herzegovina the latest news from the Croatian political scene, which, by the way, has still not been announced in Zagreb. The entire Zagreb county, the largest one in Croatia and politically the most attractive, has left the HDZ and joined Mesic's Party of Independent Croatian Democrats [HND]. Mesic says that, because of that, many HDZ members in Zagreb will not be able to sleep tonight. Finally, Stipe Mesic told the Sarelians that he will come and visit them very soon, in his position as assembly chairman -- he claims -- and he does not believe in the rumors that the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] is creating transportation problems from Zagreb to Sarajevo, as some claim in the presidential quarters in Zagreb.
