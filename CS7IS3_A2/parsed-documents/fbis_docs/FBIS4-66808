Under the action plan, party-oriented election campaign will be launched from August first and multi-channel assessment system introduced for selection of candidates for the polls. District and Pradesh Congress-I Committee Presidents will not be given tickets to contest the elections and instead they will be asked to concentrate on campaign, the party spokesman, Mr V.N. Gadjil, told newsmen after a three-hour crucial meeting of the CWC. The working committee decided that bodies of Pradesh Congress-I Committees and the AICC [All-India Congress Committee] would continue as no organisational elections could be held this year. As regards the executive bodies at different levels, after the expiry of the term in April/May this year, they may also be continued but may be reconstituted by the party President, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, wherever necessary, in order to make them more effective. The CWC took strong exception to the anti-party activities by some members in the last Assembly elections and decided to initiate disciplinary action against them. Asked to identify those facing action, Mr Gadgil said that they were mostly DCC [District Congress Committee] presidents and clarified that no PCC [Pradesh Congress Committee] President was involved. Apart from elections scheduled in the four States, the Congress-I ruled States of Maharashtra and Gujarat and the Janata Dal-ruled Bihar may also opt for an early poll. The CWC also discussed the Dunkel draft and decided to launch a campaign to blunt the onslaught of the Opposition, which, it felt was misleading the people on the issue. Though the present term of the Congress-I Committee at all levels comes to an end in April/May this year, the CWC will remain unaffected, Mr Gadgil said. Explaining other provisions of the action plan, Mr Gadgil said that it sought appropriate representation to women, minorities, scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and backward classes in all Congress-I committees. It provides for appointment of spokespersons for all the PCCs and launching of membership drive fort-night in June and July. Frontal organisation and party cells should be allowed to conduct their own membership drive and multi-channel assessment system should be introduced for selection of candidates.
