FR941216-0-00028 FR941216-0-00010 Accordingly, 48 CFR parts 525 and 552 are amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for 48 CFR Parts 525 and 552 continues to read as follows: Authority: 40 U.S.C. 486(c). PART 525_FOREIGN ACQUISITION 2. Section 525.203 is revised to read as follows: 525.203 Evaluation of offers. (a) The HCA or a designee may authorize the use of a particular foreign construction material when the use of a comparable domestic construction material would unreasonably increase the cost of the contract. The cost of a particular domestic construction material shall be determined to be unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 6 percent. The cost of construction material includes all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued). (b) The evaluation process described in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to: (1) Excepted materials listed in the solicitation; or (2) European Community (EC) and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) country construction materials offered in response to solicitations for construction contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more. (c) Offerors proposing to use foreign construction materials (other than EC or NAFTA country construction materials on contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more) are required to provide adequate information for Government evaluation under paragraph (a) of this section. Offerors may submit alternate offers for comparable domestic construction materials at stated prices. When foreign construction material (other than EC or NAFTA country construction materials on contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more) is not authorized under paragraph (a), evaluation of the offer must be based on the stated price, if any, for comparable domestic material. If an offeror proposing to use foreign construction materials (other than EC or NAFTA country construction materials on contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more) does not furnish data on the cost of comparable domestic construction material, and the use of foreign construction material is not authorized, such offer must be rejected, unless the contracting officer is able to obtain prices on comparable domestic material which verifies that domestic prices are unreasonable. (d) The contracting officer shall add 6 percent to the cost of foreign construction materials (other than EC or NAFTA country construction materials on contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more) authorized for use in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, to the prices offered, if applicable, for evaluation purposes only. 3. Section 525.205 is revised to read as follows: 525.205 Solicitation provision and contract clause.

Alternate I shall be used for construction contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more that include the Buy American Act_Construction Materials Under European Community Agreement and NAFTA clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.225&hyph;15. 4. Section 525.402 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 525.402 Policy. (a) Under (FAR) 48 CFR 25.402(a), when the estimated value of all items or products (exclusive of any item or product within any of the exceptions described in (FAR) 48 CFR 25.403) listed in the solicitation exceeds the Trade Agreements Act threshold, contracting officers shall evaluate offers without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act or the Balance of Payments Program. * * * * * PART 552_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES 5. Section 552.225&hyph;8 is revised to read as follows: 552.225&hyph;8 Trade Agreements Act Certificate. As prescribed in 525.407(a), insert the following provision: TRADE AGREEMENTS ACT CERTIFICATE (DEC 1994) (DEVIATION FAR 52.225&hyph;8) (a) The Offeror, by signing this offer, certifies that each end product to be delivered under this contract is a U.S. made end product, a designated country end product, a Caribbean Basin country end product, a Canadian end product or a Mexican end product as defined in the clause entitled ``Trade Agreements Act'' at 48 CFR 552.225&hyph;9. (b) Offers will be evaluated in accordance with subpart 25.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation except that offers of U.S. made end products, designated country end products, Caribbean Basin end products, Canadian end products, or Mexican end products shall be evaluated without the restrictions of the Buy American Act or the Balance of Payments Program. (End of Provision) 6. Section 552.225&hyph;9 is revised to read as follows: 552.225&hyph;9 Trade Agreements Act. As prescribed in 525.407(a), insert the following clause. TRADE AGREEMENTS ACT (DEC 1994) (DEVIATION FAR 52.225&hyph;9) (a) This clause implements the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 2501&hyph;2582) by providing a preference for U.S. made end products, designated country end products, Caribbean Basin country end products, Canadian end products or Mexican end products over other products. ``Caribbean Basin country end products,'' as used in this clause, means an article that: (1) is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a Caribbean Basin country (as defined in section 25.401 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)), or (2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of materials from another country or instrumentality, has been substantially transformed into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was so transformed. The term includes services (except transportation services) incidental to its supply; provided that the value of those incidental services does not exceed that of the product itself. It does not include service contracts as such. The term excludes products that are excluded from duty free treatment from Caribbean countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)). These exclusions presently consist of (i) textiles and apparel articles that are subject to textile agreements; (ii) footwear, handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather wearing apparel not designated as eligible articles for the purpose of the Generalized System of Preference under title V of the Trade Act of 1974; (iii) tuna, prepared or preserved in any manner in airtight containers, (iv) petroleum, or any product derived from petroleum; and (v) watches and watch parts (including cases, bracelets and straps) of whatever type including, but not limited to, mechanical, quartz digital or quartz analog, if such watches or watch parts contain any material that is the product of any country to which the Tariff Schedule of the United States (TSUS) column 2 rates of duty apply.
