After failing to reach an agreement at a conciliation meeting at the Regional Labor Court (TRT) yesterday, the sector held a meeting and decided to continue with the stoppage and expand it. The measure is already affecting 12,500 workers of the sector. According to the Diadema Metalworkers' Union, five more enterprises will be paralyzed as of tomorrow, among them Kepler Weber, which produces heaters. The TRT will make a decision on the strike on Tuesday. Representatives of the enterprises producing capital goods and electric and electronic equipment claim that sales in the sector have not yet improved, as they have in the automobile sector, and that enterprises cannot pay the 19 percent salary increase paid by car manufacturers. The workers, however, rejected the 4 percent readjustment offered by the enterprises. The strike began to lose strength in other sectors. Among car manufacturers, only Scania and Mercedes remain paralyzed. To return to their jobs the employees of the two enterprises want to agree on new contract terms in their collective bargaining negotiations. "We want a clause establishing at least the gradual reduction of the labor day," Jeferson Gaule Sampaio, of the Mercedes factory commission, said.
