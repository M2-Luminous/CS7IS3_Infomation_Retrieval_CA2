Vice Governor Wen Shizhen delivered a speech at the conference, in which he urged governments at all levels throughout the province to go into action immediately, to enhance the price readjustment and control in line with the arrangements and demands made by the central authorities, to carry out price inspection, to strengthen the price management, and to realistically do a good job in the province's price work. Wen Shizhen pointed out: The current general situation in the province's economy is fine. The province continued to maintain a trend of faster economic development in January and February and smoothly published major and important measures for the reforms of tax systems and foreign exchanges. However, what merits attention is that the pressure of current inflation has increased further. Repercussions still remain of price hikes cropping up at the end of 1993 in some commodities. Problems concerning commodity prices are still the general concern of society. Wen Shizhen emphatically pointed out: In successfully handling the matters of commodity prices, governments at all levels should put their work emphasis on vigorously maintaining relative stability in the prices of vegetables and grains; on establishing the foundation of copying with grain risks, on perfecting the foundation systems for the prices of nonstaple foodstuffs; and on doing a good job in carefully organizing the issuance of measures for reform in various prices. They should also put their work emphasis on guarding against excessive price hikes, on earnestly implementing the price policies of supporting agricultural development and protecting peasants' interests, on establishing or improving as soon as possible commodity price system, and on perfecting the systems of price management. As for important living commodities and the means of production whose price restrictions have been relaxed and whose price fluctuation is larger, governments should enforce the systems of putting price hikes on file and submitting application for price hikes. As for some of these commodities, they may also enforce measures for differentiating their rate, conducting control, and imposing temporary restriction. Attending the provincial telephone conference of commodity prices were the province's vice governors and vice mayors in charge of commodity prices and responsible persons from the departments concerned. During the conference Xie Guangren, director of the provincial price bureau, delivered a speech in which he made arrangements for the province's mass price inspection.
