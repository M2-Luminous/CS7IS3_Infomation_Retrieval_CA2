This decision was made by representatives of 21 nongovernmental organization (NGO) countries who met in Brasilia. Between 24 and 29 April, 70 NGO's met in Brasilia to create the forum that will work in coordination with the OAS. Among its objectives, the forum will report on and clarify human rights violations. It will also promote an exchange between NGO's and the governments of the Americas. The forum will be directed by a secretariat of seven countries. The United States, Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, Cuba, Venezuela, and Paraguay are the members of the secretariat. Benedito Domingos Mariano, director of the Santo Dias Human Rights Center of Sao Paulo, was elected secretary general. He will organize the structure of the new Inter-American organization, promoting the creation of branches in each of the 21 countries of the forum. The objective is to follow the model of Amnesty International. Oscar Sappiano, the OAS Inter-American Human Rights Commission president, attended the Brasilia meeting. He proposed that the forum should join the commission's consultative council. This position will give the forum the right to participate in investigating human rights violations throughout the continent. The Inter-American Human Rights Forum will be connected with the seven-judge, OAS Inter-American Human Rights Court which passes moral judgment on the governments that violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The forum will also help to prepare the annual human rights record reports submitted by various governments to the United Nations.
