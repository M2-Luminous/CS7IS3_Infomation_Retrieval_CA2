Meetings in Washington Inspire Feeling of Optimism"] [Text] I have already had occasion in Washington to answer questions from representatives of the press on the results of our delegation's participation in the work of the session of the leading organs of the IMF and the World Bank, as well as the conference of finance ministers and heads of the central banks of G-7 countries which was held at the same time. The results of our trip could be briefly reduced to the points listed below. But I would like first of all to explain the reasons for Russia's presence at these important international financial forums. The lessons of recent years demonstrate that the transitional economies' need for bilateral and multilateral financial assistance is far more considerable than previously thought. That is why close cooperation with the IMF and the use of its resources remain critically important not just in the short term but also in the medium term. The systemic transformations fund created a year ago for the purpose of assisting structural reforms has proven its effectiveness in this regard. Nevertheless, broader use must be made of the IMF's existing instruments. We stated all of that frankly at the session of the Interim Committee of the IMF Board of Governors. The foreign debt problem, for example, is very topical today for states with a transitional economy. In 1993 the easing of the debt burden which we inherited from the former Union formed the major part of the West's official assistance to Russia. We appreciate our creditors' understanding of our temporary difficulties. It will take great effort to support Russia's balance of payments both this year and in the next few years. Because in these years the debt servicing payments are due to reach their peak. We have no other option but to ask our creditors for a new rescheduling of the debt repayment. Our delegation described the Russian Government's rigorous but very realistic program of economic reforms. In our view, Russia, in cooperation with the multinational financial organizations, will be able to achieve a breakthrough and begin moving toward stabilization and economic recovery in 1994. All the conditions are in place for this: Inflation has begun to be curbed, an extremely realistic draft federal budget has been approved, the government intends to adhere resolutely to a policy of financial stabilization and systemic transformations and not make changes to the currency exchange system, and the Central Bank will not undertake any measures to maintain the ruble exchange rate artificially. On the basis of all that we raised a whole series of major problems of concern to us at the meetings which we attended. The essential nature of the agenda lent itself to that: Unlike previous years, the discussions which were held were not on the question of whether our government intends to continue the course of reforms but on the question of building a foundation for their implementation and, specifically, of creating conditions conducive to attracting foreign investments into Russia, introducing a tax regime to aid that process, and insuring such capital investments against political risks. At the meeting with the G-7 ministers we raised the question of the discriminatory approach against Russia in the international markets in aluminum, uranium, and space technology among others. We support the creation of a social and legal base whereby Russia would be regarded as a country with a transitional economy, not as a state with a centralized trading system. In that connection we stressed once more the need to abolish the Jackson-Vanik amendment insofar as it applies to the Russian Federation, an amendment which, as is well known, linked the granting to the former USSR of most-favored nation status in trade with the United States to the USSR's "conduct" in the human rights sphere, above all Jewish emigration. There was another set of questions on reorienting the previously announced package support for the Russian reforms to projects in the social sphere. Finally we examined problems pertaining to Russia's mutual relationship with the creditors of the Paris Club. We stated bluntly that this year our potential for servicing the foreign debt will be even more limited than it was last year. And we found understanding. By all accounts the Paris Club and the Russian Government will reach agreement on changing the structure of our foreign debt payments by the end of May or the start of June. We are looking forward to more favorable conditions for settling the debt than the deferral granted by the club last year of a payment of $15 billion out of the total of $18 billion. We also put forward an initiative on Russia's possible membership of the Paris Club as a creditor. The fact is that many developing countries owe large amounts to Russia as the successor in law to the USSR. Furthermore, in our relations with international financial organizations and the G-7, we have always stressed that we are not only asking for support for our course of reforms but are also acting as a donor toward former Soviet republics and are bearing enormous costs as a result. We are not insisting on permanent membership of the Paris Club but a mechanism for our participation at least as an observer must be created. With the representatives of the World Bank we discussed the possibility of Russia's obtaining several major credits in the coming months for various economic reform programs, including a second loan for the modernization of the oil industry ($500 million), two credits for the reform of the agricultural sector ($325 million), the modernization of financial institutions ($200 million), and the reform of entrepreneurial structures ($200 million). We hope that the World Bank will be able to allocate a large part of these credits as early as the end of the current financial year (which expires 30 June). The agreement to grant a loan for the development of an employment and social protection service has already been signed with the World Bank: We will receive $70 million from it for that purpose. Thus it may be said that Russia's problems and our relations with the leading international financial organizations were at the center of attention of these meetings. The Russian Federation Government's present course found understanding and support. For my part I can say that the results of the meetings in Washington left us with a sense of satisfaction.
