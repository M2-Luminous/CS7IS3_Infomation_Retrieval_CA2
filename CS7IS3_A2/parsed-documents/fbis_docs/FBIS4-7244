FBIS4-7244 "dreas082_d_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 South Korea DPRK Defector Discusses Chemical Weapons DPRK Defector Discusses Chemical Weapons OW2804092494 Tokyo KYODO in English 0900 GMT 28 Apr 94 OW2804092494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 28 KYODO -- North Korea is capable of delivering chemical weapons with SCUD missiles and has already targeted missiles at Okinawa and Guam, a defector from North Korea's armed forces said Thursday. Sgt. Yi Chong-kok, who defected to South Korea on March 18, told a news conference that North Korea has the technology to mount chemical weapons onto SCUD missiles though it is not capable of mounting nuclear weapons. "Missile bases located in Myongchon and Hwadae of North Hamkyong province have Okinawa and Guam within its shooting range," said Yi, who served in the nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau in the Korean People's Army General Staff. Yi also said missiles at a base in Jagang Province, which borders China, are aimed at China. North Korean Leader Kim Chong-il, Kim Il-song's son and heir- apparent, does not appear to hold the reins in the military although he is supreme commander of the armed forces, he said. "Kim Pyong-il, Kim Chong-il's stepbrother and ambassador to Finland, is more popular among North Korean people because he is handsome and is believed to have good personality," Yi said. North Korean Vice Premier Kim Pok-sin, after inspecting frontline military units in March 1992, told President Kim Il-song soldiers had little rice and clothing and wore shoes made of bark, according to Yi. Upon receiving the report, the president sacked an official involved in supplying food, and ordered the Administration Council to provide rice and 400,000 pairs of military shoes, Yi said. "North Korea's food shortage is even worse in the countryside and I heard old men and children have died of starvation in Yanggang Province and South Hamkyong Province," he said. Yi also said he heard that North Koreans in Yomjoo and Tongrim in the North Pyongan Province rioted to protest food shortages last August and September. "Even if North Koreans want to see their country adopt Chinese- style open-door policies, they realize their country is becoming more and more isolated, and communism can no longer survive with the collapse of the Soviet Union," Yi said. "North Korean Leader Kim Il-song seems worried about the possible fall of his regime," he added.
