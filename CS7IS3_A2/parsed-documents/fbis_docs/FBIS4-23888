At the end of the meeting, the French Government representative, Mr. Larome, gave an interview to our colleagues, (Innocent Huhito) and (Tito Mbasha). The Paris envoy begins the interview by explaining the purpose of his mission: [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] You said that your mission was to see how to assist orphans, and to meet with General Kagame. However, I would like to ask you about France's present role -- what is the exact role of France over the Rwandan issue? [Larome] The first role is, as far as is possible, to press the United Nations to intervene on a larger scale and in a more consistent manner in Kigali, to stop the massacres of children, women, and civilians, who have been killed with impunity. Minister Juppe made a declaration yesterday in France, after having agreed with his (?European counterparts), with Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali of the United Nations, that we press for a rapid intervention, if the need arises, under the aegis of the UN flag in Kigali. [Correspondent] With a humanitarian mission or intervention? [Larome] The troops must first be on a completely humanitarian mission, that is to say they should be able to protect the people they are guarding and to supply them with the food and drug convoys which we are already managing to bring to Kigali, though under extremely difficult conditions. [Correspondent] Is this in the framework of the United Nations, or will it be at France's own initiative? [Larome] The role of France on the present issue [word indistinct] usual African partners, is to press the United Nations to intervene in the most efficient manner possible. [end recording]
