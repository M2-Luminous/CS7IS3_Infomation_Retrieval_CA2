FR941031-1-00028 FR941031-1-00005 These factors have led the FAA to establish an aging commuter-class aircraft policy that requires incorporating a known design change when it could replace a critical repetitive inspection. With this policy in mind, the FAA recently conducted a review of existing AD's that apply to de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 series airplanes. Assisting the FAA in this review were (1) de Havilland; (2) the Regional Airlines Association (RAA); and (3) several operators of the affected airplanes. From this review, the FAA has identified AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;1658, as one that should be superseded with a new AD that would eliminate short-interval and critical repetitive inspections. AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03 currently requires repetitively inspecting the wing rear spar cap for cracks on certain de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 series airplanes, and replacing any cracked part. De Havilland, Inc. (formerly Boeing of Canada, Ltd.) has issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 6/295, Revision D, dated December 20, 1991. This service bulletin specifies procedures for installing wing rear spar attachment caps that are manufactured from a material having improved stress corrosion resistant properties. This installation is known as Modification 6/1301. As a result of the previously discussed AD review, Transport Canada considers Modification 6/1301 mandatory and has issued Transport Canada AD CF&hyph;73&hyph;03R1 in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of §21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy and after reviewing all available information, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to eliminate the repetitive short-interval inspections required by AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;1658, and to prevent cracking of the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps, which could result in loss of control of the airplane. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 series airplanes of the same type design that do not have Modification No. 6/1301 incorporated, the proposed AD would supersede AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03 with a new AD that would (1) initially retain the requirement of repetitively inspecting the wing rear spar cap for cracks and replacing any cracked part; and (2) eventually require installing wing rear spar attachment caps that are manufactured from a material having improved stress corrosion resistant properties (Modification 6/1301) as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with de Havilland SB No. 6/295, Revision D, dated December 20, 1991. The FAA estimates that 82 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 22 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification, and that the average labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. Parts cost approximately $6,350 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $629,432. This figure is based upon the assumption that none of the affected airplane owners/operators have incorporated Modification 6/1301. The intent of the FAA's aging commuter airplane program is to ensure safe operation of commuter-class airplanes that are in commercial service without adversely impacting private operators. Of the approximately 82 airplanes in the U.S. registry that would be affected by the proposed AD, the FAA has determined that approximately 45 percent are operated in scheduled passenger service. A significant number of the remaining 55 percent are operated in other forms of air transportation such as air cargo and air taxi. The following paragraphs present cost scenarios for airplanes where no cracks were found and where certain category cracks were found, utilizing an average remaining airplane life of 15 years and an average annual utilization rate of 1,600 hours TIS. A copy of the full Cost Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Determination for the proposed action may be examined at the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 91&hyph;CE&hyph;21&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri. •No Cracks Scenario: Under the provisions of AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03, an owner/operator of an affected de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 series airplane in scheduled service who operates an average of 1,600 hours TIS annually would inspect every 26 weeks. This would amount to a remaining airplane life (estimated 15 years) cost of $14,058; this figure is based on the assumption that no cracks are found during the inspections. The proposed AD would incur the inspection at one 1,200-hour TIS interval and then, at 2,400 hours TIS, the operator would have to replace the top flange of the wing spar attachment caps (eliminating the need for further repetitive inspections). This would result in a present value cost of $8,331, which would be a present value cost savings of $5,727 or $4,154 annualized over the 1.5 years it would take to accumulate 2,400 hours TIS. An owner of a general aviation airplane who operates 800 hours TIS annually without finding any cracks during the 1,200-hour TIS inspection would incur a present value cost savings of $6,430. This would amount to a per year savings of $2,450 over the 1.5 years it would take to accumulate 2,400 hours TIS. •Category I cracks found scenario: These are spanwise cracks that are inboard of the third rivet, or spanwise cracks that exceed 50 inches, or any chordwise cracks: Under the provisions of AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03, an owner/operator who found cracks under this scenario would have to immediately repair the cracked part and repetitively inspect every 26 weeks. The proposed AD would require immediate replacement as terminating action for the repetitive inspections, which would result in present value compliance costs of $8,355. The present value cost savings for this scenario would be $6,300 for airplanes in scheduled service and $6,295 per general aviation airplane.
