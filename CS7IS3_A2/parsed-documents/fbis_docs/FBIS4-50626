A reporter asked at today's news conference: It is said that Wei Jingsheng will not be re-indicted on treason charges. Will he be indicted on other charges? In reply Wu Jianmin made the above statement. Another reporter asked: Most recently there have been reports that demonstrations and protests had occurred in Lhasa, and that some foreigners in Tibet had their passports confiscated or were expelled from Tibet. Will you please confirm these reports? Wu Jianmin said: I have not heard of such incidents. There will not be any problems for foreigners in China as long as they obey Chinese law. Wu said: We should be aware that some people are deeply prejudiced against China, always attack and spread talk against China, and start rumors to confuse people. They do these things with ulterior motives. In any case, these words do not merit our attention or trust.
