FR940805-2-00020 FR940805-2-00014 Chicago Field Office, NREL Area Office; Federal Assistance Award to Photonic Sensor Systems, Inc. AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its intention to enter into a cooperative agreement with Photonic Sensor Systems, Inc. (PSS). This new cooperative agreement will in effect continue a research project that had been funded by the Department with Georgia Tech Research Corp. (GTRC), (an affiliate of the Georgia Institute of Technology) for development of a sensor system to monitor ammonia. ADDRESSES: Questions regarding this announcement may be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Golden Field Office, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden, Colorado 80401, Attention: J. K. Lewis, Contract Specialist or call (303) 275&hyph;4739. The Contracting Officer is John W. Meeker. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: With assistance from DOE through Cooperative Agreement # DE&hyph;FC02&hyph;89ID12905, GTRC developed an optical sensor for real time detection of ammonia. The original application was to monitor ammonia transfer from agricultural croplands, and thereby reduce the amount of nitrogen fertilizer used; however, PSS has determined that the sensor can also facilitate the use of ammonia in a variety of industrial applications such as large scale refrigeration where the use of ammonia as the refrigerant has development of the sensor through commercial prototype and evaluation of this prototype in full-scale agricultural and industrial settings.. DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, and is a continuation of, an activity presently being funded by DOE, and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity and satisfactory completion of the activity. Also, the applicant has exclusive domestic capability to perform the activity successfully based on ownership of the fundamental patent rights and technical expertise gained in the earlier phases of the project. DOE funding for the proposed activity is estimated to be $605,000 and PSS's share is estimated to be $332,000 for a total of $937,000 over a three year project period.
