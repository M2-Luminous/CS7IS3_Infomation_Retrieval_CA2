Commenting on the most recent computer predictions, which show the Socialist Unity Party's successor party as the third-strongest party with 18 percent of the vote, Bisky told journalists that Saxony Anhalt shows that "people in the east want us." Despite really massive threats in recent weeks, the voters did not allow themselves to be confused, he said, adding that this is a good thing and gives him confidence for the federal elections. The PDS is aiming for at least three first-past-the-post seats, and thus entry into the federal parliament, Bisky said.
