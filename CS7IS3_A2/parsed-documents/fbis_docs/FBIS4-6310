"Agreement has almost been reached on the principal policies. The new government will probably have more stability," Hiraiwa said. The business leader said it is "not a bad thing" that the new government is taking time to form. "The coalition parties are trying to bring their views together. This implies that a firm framework will be established," Hiraiwa said. Some differences in opinion may appear, however, when important policies are actually put into effect, he warned. Commenting on fledgling signs of economic pickup, Hiraiwa noted that although consumer spending is improving, businesses are still taking time to recover. "But I don't think the economy will be like last year," he said, pointing to the lack of economic comeback in 1993. He said the appreciation of the yen against the dollar will be central to judging corporate performance in the future.
