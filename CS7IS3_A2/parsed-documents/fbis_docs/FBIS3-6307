The Electicity Utility Industry Council, an advisory body to the international trade and industry minister, set up a panel Wednesday to discuss easing rules and will come up with a detailed plan by the end of June. Currently, firms can only sell electric power that has been left over at power generators being used in their plants. If firms are allowed to join the wholesale electricity market, "the competition should help lower fees for general use in the long term," an official at the trade ministry said. Firms that have a certain standard of technology will in principle be allowed to freely start the business, instead of getting a license from the trade minister as currently required, the officials said.
