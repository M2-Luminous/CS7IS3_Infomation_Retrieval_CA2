I am pleased about your delegation coming to us to settle some very important issues in accordance with the accord reached between President Clinton and myself, said Kravchuk. He went on to say: I have received a letter from President Bill Clinton saying that the delegation will work in three principal directions of mutual economic relations between our two states, which, above all, relates to the $350 million granted to Ukraine, the accord about which was reached earlier. The second direction is the development of trade and investment in this sphere, and the third has to do with reforming the Ukrainian economy and [securing] assistance from the United States of America in this matter. I was very glad to have received this letter on the eve of our meeting. We are happy [to acknowledge] that very good relations have formed between our countries, Nicholas Burns told journalists. We came here to promote their further development. Our president holds President Kravchuk in great esteem and instructed us to do our best to bolster the formation of the best possible relations between the two countries and their governments.
