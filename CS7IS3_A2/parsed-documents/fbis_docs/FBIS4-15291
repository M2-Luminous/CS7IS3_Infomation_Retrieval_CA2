"After the experience with Comecon and communist regime one cannot expect the Czech Republic to organise some east European economic or political system. On the other hand, I am for the creation of the free market sphere. I will always support this sort of cooperation," said Klaus in fluent Russian. "First, operation is necessary, then follows the fitness centre and only afterwards one can attend the Olympic Games. We are in the fitness centre, while Russia remains on the surgery desk," said Klaus who arrived for a two-day visit to Russia today. Asked about the prospects of the Czech-Russian economic cooperation, Klaus replied "the word cooperation belongs to the past, I care for business." "We were experiencing cooperation for 40 years, and it was not useful for either country," he noted. When asked by a student to comment on the economic situation in Russia, Klaus answered that as a premier of the foreign state he could not afford it. "After some lost elections I will gladly deliver a lecture on the issue," he said. Academy leadership proposed today to Klaus to become honorary professor.
