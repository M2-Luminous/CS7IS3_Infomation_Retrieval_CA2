Its formation must be promoted by a proper policy of the state. 1. The state must provide the conditions for the growth of an economy which shall be dominated by private ownership of manufacturing, commercial, and service establishments. 1.1. Once the share of the private sector in the Polish economy exceeds 50 percent in terms of both employment and generation of national income, its further growth should be principally decided by the increase in the number and size of family-owned enterprises (and farms) in agriculture, industry, trade, and services. In addition to eliminating the impediments to freedom of private enterprise under law it is necessary for the government to pursue a tax policy that supports the growth of private business and promotes business investments. The experience of many countries proves that, in order to grow, small business needs a policy of credit preferences by means of credit-price subsidies, the creation of a system of credit guarantees and of the institutions providing such guarantees, and the building of an infrastructure supporting the private sector in terms of consultantcy 33 and promotion. 1.2. Of special importance to not only the growth of the private sector but also to righting a fundamental wrong is the reprivatization of the property seized by the communists--in kind whenever possible or in monetary or material form whenever so dictated by social considerations. 1.3. The privatization of "socialized" plants should be continued upon promoting in particular employee privatization which turns broad strata of the population into proprietors. 2. An important objective of government policy should be the promotion of investment by foreign capital whenever this means creating new jobs, opening access to foreign markets for Polish goods and producers, and introducing new technologies in our country. 2.1. A basic prerequisite for attracting major capital investment to Poland is the stability of tax laws, and especially of the income-tax and VAT rates. 2.2. In general, individually negotiated tax and duty exemptions should be eliminated and regular tax and fee rebates should be introduced for investors--also through the establishments of various kinds of economic zones and areas. 2.3. The protection of the domestic market should be strengthened and the practice of establishing duty-free quotas for domestically manufactured finished products abandoned. 3. Spending on science and education should be treated as capital investment. 3.1. Research subsidies provided by the state budget should enable our science to stay abreast of the accomplishments of world science. 3.2. Support by means of subsidies, tax exemptions, or duty exemptions should be provided to both basic research in particular domains and applied R&D work. 3.3. Support by means of both tax policy and subsidies should be provided to educational centers and students. 4. Economic policy should promote optimal conditions for economic cooperation with the countries of the European Union, these being most favorable to Poland. 5. In current economic policy an particularly important objective is to combat unemployment, and especially unemployment among young people. 5.1. Special protection by means of economic instruments should be provided to domestic manufacturers and products. 5.2. By means of a broad variety of instruments ranging from the policy on currency rates of exchange through tax exemptions and credit 3I3 preferences to diplomatic moves, exports of Polish products and services should be promoted. 5.3. Tax and credit preferences should promote production for export. 5.4. Tax and credit policy should promote investment to an extent sufficing to halt the growth in unemployment in 1994 and to reduce unemployment by at least 1 million in 1995. 5.5. Tax preferences should be granted for investments in regions with highest unemployment. 5.6. A program for building superhighways on the basis of non-state financing should be initiated. 5.7. A program for training unemployed young people 16 to 23 years old should be initiated most urgently. 6. Strengthening the family should be a long-range objective of social policy, and it should be promoted by economic policy. 6.1. Family allowances should be preserved as an entitlement for which all families with underage children and child-raising homemakers are eligible. 6.2. The legal minimum wage should assure decent living conditions for the employee and, when family allowances are included, also for his/her family. 6.3. Tax policy should strengthen family life by means of a joint tax return for all persons living in a joint household. 7. Social policy should assure the material security of retirees. The traditional ratio of retirement pensions to the mean wage should be retained, and they should be subject to cost-of-living adjustments. 7.1. Similar protection should be extended to sickness benefits, especially for persons who cannot support themselves by working. 7.2. The state should promote the growth of private insurance companies. 8. All citizens should be guaranteed a minimum of health care. 8.1. The universal nature of health care should be assured by universal compulsory health insurance. 8.2. Citizens should have access to additional group and individual insurance. 9. Social policy should promote, by means of various instruments, adequate housing with allowance for the financial possibilities of individual citizens. 9.1. The state should promote the growth of credit institutions and the purchases of housing, and it should pursue a tax policy promoting 33 housing construction and personal spending on housing (also by means of a credit and payment system). 9.2. Local governments should, upon appropriate support from the state budget, expand the infrastructure of land development and housing and support the construction of private rental housing. 10. Employees of the state administration, the procurature, the judiciary, the police, and the military, as well as teachers should be afforded special protection of their occupations and incomes. 11. Current social policy should principally focus on alleviating the consequences of the unfavorable development of the economic situation, and especially the consequences of unemployment and inflationary growth of the cost of living.
