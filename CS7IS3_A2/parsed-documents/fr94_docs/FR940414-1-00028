FR940414-1-00028 FR940414-1-00009 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 48 CFR Part 225 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Offset Administrative Costs AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD). ACTION: Proposed rule with request for public comments. SUMMARY: The Department of Defense is proposing amendment of the Defense FAR Supplement to change the criteria for contractor recovery under foreign military sale contracts of the contractor's offset administrative costs. DATES: Comments on the proposed DFARS rule should be submitted in writing to the address shown below on or before June 13, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to The Defense Acquisition Regulations Council, Attn: Ms. Alyce Sullivan, OUSD(A&T)DP(DAR), IMD 3D139, 3062 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;3062. Telefax number (703) 604&hyph;5971. Please cite DFARS Case 93&hyph;D004 in all correspondence related to this issue. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Alyce Sullivan, (703) 604&hyph;5930. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background DFARS 225.7303&hyph;2(a) is amended to revise the language on offset administrative costs. The revision originated based on a Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA) procedural change. DSAA will issue a corresponding revision to the Security Assistance Management Manual. In addition to the revision of offset administrative costs, the language currently in 225.7303&hyph;2(a) (1) and (2) has been combined to make it more clear and all subparagraphs under 225.7303&hyph;2(a) have been renumbered accordingly. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. , because it eliminates a procedural requirement for contractor recovery of offset administrative costs, under foreign military sale contracts. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS sections will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 94&hyph;610 in correspondence.
