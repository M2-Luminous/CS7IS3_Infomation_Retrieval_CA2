FR941107-2-00155 FR941107-2-00088 The report also discusses quarterly expiration prices and price changes at 4:00 p.m. and the close. The data show very little volatility at the close. Nearly half the stocks had no change at the close, 79% changed one-eighth point or less, and 92% changed one-quarter point or less. The stocks with sell imbalances over 50,000 shares at the close on average declined more than one-eighth; the stocks with buy imbalances over 50,000 shares at the close increased 0.3125 points on average. As noted above, pursuant to the NYSE pilot program, the auxiliary closing procedures for expiration Fridays and QIX expiration days (cumulatively, ``expiration days'') place limitations on MOC order-entry with regard to orders related to any strategy involving an expiring derivative index product. The auxiliary closing procedures also restrict the cancellation of MOC orders and provide for the dissemination of MOC order imbalances of 50,000 shares or more in certain pilot securities. The present proposal would extend the existing pilot procedures for a one year pilot period through October 1995. MOC order cancellations for bona fide errors would continue to be accepted. Once a publication of an imbalance in a pilot stock has been made, any MOC orders subsequently entered in such pilot stock will be accepted only to trade on the opposite side of the market in relation to such published imbalance. The entry of a MOC order to establish or liquidate positions related to a strategy involving derivative instruments, however, would not be permitted even if such orders might offset published imbalances. The Commission believes that the auxiliary closing procedures should enable market participants to gain a more accurate picture of the buying and selling interest in MOC orders at expiration. The Commission continues to believe that, by requiring early submission of MOC orders and disseminating significant imbalances (50,000 shares or more) in certain specified stocks, the NYSE should be able to attract contra-side interest to help alleviate imbalances caused by the liquidation of stock positions related to index derivative product trading strategies. In this regard, the NYSE's most recent report concerning expiration Friday volatility and the expiration Friday closing procedures indicates that the procedures have worked relatively well and may have resulted in more orderly markets at the close on expiration Fridays. The Commission is approving an extension of the pilot program through October 1995. As long as some index derivative products continue to expire based on closing stock prices on expiration Fridays, the Commission agrees with the NYSE that such procedures are necessary to provide a mechanism to handle the potential large imbalances that can be engendered by firms unwinding index derivative related positions. During the pilot extension, the Commission expects the NYSE to continue to monitor closely the effectiveness of the procedures, and to submit a report with all of the same data previously requested for prior periods. The report should cover all expirations through June 1995, and must be submitted to the Commission no later than July 31, 1995 9 along with a proposed rule change which should either request an additional extension of the pilot program or permanent approval of the pilot procedures. 9 The Commission notes that this request for information is not exclusive and that the NYSE should add any additional data and analysis to the report in order to assess the effectiveness of the procedures in reducing excess market volatility on expiration Fridays. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register. This will permit the procedures to continue on an uninterrupted basis. Further, on September 9, 1994, the NYSE issued an Information Memo to its members notifying them of the auxiliary closing procedures. Finally, special auxiliary closing procedures have been utilized by the NYSE since 1986, and the procedures are intended to reduce excessive market volatility at the close. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) 10 that the proposed rule change is hereby approved on a pilot basis through October 31, 1995. 10 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 11 11 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1991). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
