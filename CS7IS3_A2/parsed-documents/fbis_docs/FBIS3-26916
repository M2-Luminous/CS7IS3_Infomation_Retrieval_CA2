Except for "SJ-4" ["Shijian-4"], a space probing satellite, and a simulated satellite, which were successfully launched today, the other six are "FY-2" ["Fengyun-2'] meteorological satellite, "DFH-3" ["Dongfanghong-3"] communications satellite, a satellite for scientific exploration and technological experimentation, all of which were developed and manufactured by China; "Asia-Pacific-1" and "Asia-Pacific-2" satellites, operated by the Asia-Pacific Satellite Company; and Australia's "Aussat B-3" satellite. According to a briefing by relevant experts, in the launching of the abovementioned satellites, new models, different types, complex performance, and high technological demand are their characteristics. Some satellites represent the popularization and application of mature technology, others signal the opening up of new technology and a new domain; some are for experiments ascending to a new level; and others mark an important move by China to ensure its place in the world domain of high science and technology. Among them, the "SJ-4" space probing satellite, which was launched by the "Long-March 3A" carrier rocket, was launched for the first time on an experimental basis -- as will the other second-generation applied satellites, such as the "FY-2" meteorological satellite" and the "DFH-3" communications satellite.
