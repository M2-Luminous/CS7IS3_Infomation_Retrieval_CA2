During the visit Kannik and his Ukrainian counterpart, Gen. Vitaliy Radetskyy, signed an agreement on cooperation between the two countries' defense ministries. Kannik invited Radetskyy for a visit to Estonia. Kannik told BNS today Ukraine's independence means also Estonia's independence. He said the relations between the two countries are steadily improving. "Estonian-Ukrainian relations are reaching the stage of concrete cooperation," Kannik said. "The questions of possible weapons purchases will be solved on the expert level. We are very much interested in the agreement on conventional arms reduction Ukraine has signed," the defense minister told BNS. "The Estonian-Russian and Ukrainian-Russian relations have reached very delicate dimensions, so we need one another all the more," the minister claimed. The agreement Kannik and Radetskyy signed on April 20 is a framework agreement that maps out different opportunities for cooperation in the defense sphere, including consultations on the formation and financing of defense forces and joint action within NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Other issues discussed at the meeting of the defense ministers included international peacekeeping operations, the state of Estonian-Russian and Ukrainian-Russian relations, division of the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet, and tensions around the Crimean peninsula. The Ukrainian defense minister told BNS Russian troops must leave Estonia by the proposed withdrawal deadline of Aug. 31, 1994. "Russian military bases on your territory are your domestic affair and the decision whether to retain them is up to you," he noted. Radetskyy did not support granting Russian military retirees a special status in Estonia. [passage omitted]
