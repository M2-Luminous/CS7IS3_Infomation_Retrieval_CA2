The step is meant to counter the effects of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on the economies of these countries. An official Jordanian source has asserted that Jordan welcomes other Arab parties to join this integration, especially the PLO, if it chooses to link the economy of the autonomous area with the Arab states instead of Israel. The initial reaction of the Palestinians to this plan is one of PLO concern to maintain and develop good economic ties with Jordan. However, a Palestinian source said what is proposed now is a three-way Jordanian-Syrian-Lebanese coordination. He feared that the Palestinians could be pushed further into the lap of Israel. The plan of economic integration will be at the heart of the Jordanian-Syrian talks at the level of prime ministers next Monday in Amman. This issue was also raised on the bilateral level between Jordan and Lebanon during the visit of Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz to Amman this week. On another level, a summit meeting will be held between Jordan's King Husayn and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington in mid-June to discuss the developments in the peace process. Also, the tripartite Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli committee that was formed nine months ago will meet next Monday in Washington to discuss projects in the Jordan Valley. Amman insists on resolving the border question with Israel before setting up any economic projects with the Jewish state.
