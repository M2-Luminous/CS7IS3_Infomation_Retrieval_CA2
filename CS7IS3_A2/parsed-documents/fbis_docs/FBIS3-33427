President de Leon announced on Friday the dismissal of National Defense Chief of Staff Jose Luis Quilo and the appointment of General Marco Antonio Gonzalez as his replacement, in an unexpected action that provoked numerous rumors in the Guatemalan capital. De Leon appointed Gen. Carlos Enrique Pineda to the post of assistant chief of staff. Gonzalez is considered the president's "trusted man" while Pineda is a commander with a well-known background as fighter in the low-intensity war that has prevailed in the country for 33 years. Given his post, Pineda must join the government peace commission that will resume negotiations with Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) guerrilla commanders in March. The government meeting with the URNG, to be held in Mexico City, was initially scheduled for the second half of February. However, it was postponed until the UN Human Rights Commission, currently gathered in Geneva, issues a resolution on Guatemala. The morning newspaper PRENSA LIBRE today reviewed the changes that occurred in the military leadership, terming them "encouraging signs" of the government's "positive" attitude. LA REPUBLICA said the removals represent a "rearrangement" of currents within the Army and they are linked with the peace negotiations. According to analysts, the less "harder" line within the Armed Forces has been strengthened by the movements, but those analysts do not dare speculate if the initiative came from the presidential office or the military barracks. Military commanders have officially termed these movements as "routine" although a military source consulted by AFP admitted there are "divisions" within the corps on the position that should be assumed in the negotiations with the URNG rebels. A controversy recently arose regarding the guerrilla demand to create a Truth Commission, similar to the one which last year investigated war crimes in El Salvador and provoked the fall of the country's highest ranking military leaders, who were charged with numerous human rights violations. Guatemalan Defense Minister Gen. Mario Enriquez said "the Army's activities can be verified at any moment;" adding the commission was not necessary. He said such an investigation would be used to discredit the military corps and it would increase divisions among the Guatemalan people. Enriquez said the guerrilla group will also have to answer for its crimes, including the deaths of U.S. Ambassador John Gordon Mein and German Ambassador Karl von Spreti in the 1960's, and journalist Isidoro Zarco, owner of the morning newspaper PRENSA LIBRE, in the 1970's.
