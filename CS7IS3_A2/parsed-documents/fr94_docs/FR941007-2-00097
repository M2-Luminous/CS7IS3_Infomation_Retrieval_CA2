FR941007-2-00097 FR941007-2-00062 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,626] Jockey International, Inc.; Distribution Center, Kenosha, WI; Notice of Revised Determination on Reopening On September 21, 1994, the Department, at the request of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers' Union (ACTWU) reopened its investigation for the former workers of the subject facility. The initial investigation resulted in a negative determination on May 24, 1994. The negative determination was published in the Federal Register on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30617). New findings on reopening show that all of the statutory requirements for a worker group certification have been met. The investigation revealed that the Distribution Center in Kenosha serviced the Jockey sewing plant in Kenosha and was a substantial part of the company's integrated production process. Workers at Jockey's sewing plant in Kenosha were certified for TAA on July 30, 1993 under petition, TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,835. Workers at the Distribution Center experienced employment declines as a result of the production declines at Jockey's sewing plant in Kenosha. The Distribution Center closed in May, 1994. Accordingly, the Department is revising its negative determination for workers at Jockey's Distribution Center in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Conclusion After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reopening, it is concluded that increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with underwear produced at Jockey International, Inc., Kenosha, Wisconsin contributed importantly to the employment declines of workers at the Kenosha, Wisconsin Distribution Center of Jockey International, Incorporated. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following certification: ``All workers and former workers of Jockey International Inc., Distribution Center in Kenosha, Wisconsin who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after March 15, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.'' Signed at Washington, DC this 26th day of September 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
