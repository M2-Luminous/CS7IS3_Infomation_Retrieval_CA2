FR940613-0-00125 FR940613-0-00016 With respect to §552.21(g), the commenter questioned the use of restraints on an inmate in administrative detention or disciplinary segregation. The Bureau notes that this paragraph (now designated as §552.22(g)) states that, except when the immediate use of restraints is required for the control of the inmate, application or continued application of restraints on an inmate in administrative detention or disciplinary segregation requires the approval of Warden or designee. The Bureau wishes to note that such application would not be routine, and it believes that requiring approval at this level is sufficient to ensure that such application does accomplish legitimate penological objectives. As noted below, the Bureau is making further amendments to this section. With respect to §552.21(j), the commenter noted a discrepancy in that this paragraph provided that all significant incidents involving use of force and application of restraints require documentation, while §522.26 stated that all incidents involving use of force or restraints be documented. As noted below, newly designated §552.22(j) is being amended to remove this unintentional discrepancy. With respect to §552.22, the commenter objected to exception being made by the Director for use of confrontation avoidance procedures in specific institutions or housing units. As noted below, this section (now designated as §552.23) is being revised to remove stated exceptions. With respect to §552.23, the commenter stated that with the exception of preventing inmate self-injury, it is never necessary to implement four-point restraints. The commenter noted particular objection to paragraph (e), stating that it allows prison staff to deny the inmate in four-point restraints an opportunity to use the toilet if he or she continued to resist or became violent while being released. The commenter believed that any self-destructive behavior exhibited by an inmate in four-point restraint should be reported to medical staff and that control over the use of four-point restraint by medical personnel is essential. The Bureau believes that this section contains sufficient safeguards. As noted below, however, this section (now designated as §552.24) is being further amended for editorial purposes. The Bureau believes that the editorial restatement of the introductory text clarifies that four-point restraints are to be used when it is determined that they are the only means available to obtain and maintain control over an inmate. The provisions in paragraph (e) are intended to guarantee that the inmate's access to toilet facilities are controlled by the inmate's behavior. The Bureau believes that newly designated §§552.24(f) and 552.26 adequately provide for medical review and responsibility. After due consideration of the comments received, and based upon the experience gained from application of the previously revised regulations, the Bureau makes the following further amendments. For the sake of clarity, the provisions in former §552.20 are being revised into two separate sections, and former §§552.21 through 552.26 are redesignated as §§552.22 through 552.27 in order to accommodate the new section. Paragraph codification and cross references in the revised regulations have been adjusted as necessary. In §552.20, the introductory text (formerly paragraph (a)) is further amended to include a statement that staff are authorized to use force only as a last alternative after all other reasonable efforts to resolve a situation have failed. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section (formerly paragraphs (a) (1) and (2)) are amended for editorial purposes. In paragraph (d) (formerly paragraph (a)(4)) the word ``wounds'' is revised to read ``injury'' to describe more accurately conditions which may lead to authorized use of restraints by staff. Because an injury may be of such a nature that it would not by strict definition be considered a wound, the Bureau believes it reasonable to use the broader word ``injury.'' In new §552.21 on types of force, section headings were added to paragraphs (c) and (d) for the sake of editorial consistency. In addition, paragraph (c) (formerly §552.20(d)) is amended to include reference to soft and ambulatory (leg) restraints. The use of soft restraints and ambulatory restraints is intended to allow for graduated procedures in applying restraints. In newly designated §552.22, paragraph (a) is amended to remove an obsolete cross reference, and paragraph (g) is amended to include reference to graduated procedures in applying restraints. In paragraph (h), introductory text is amended to include an example of restraint equipment, and paragraph (h)(2) is amended to clarify specific situations to help avoid physical problems of an inmate under restraints. Paragraph (j) is amended to remove any inconsistency with the provisions of newly designated §522.27. Newly designated §552.23 is revised to broaden the use of confrontation avoidance procedures. To this effect, paragraph (b), which contained provisions for exception, is removed.
