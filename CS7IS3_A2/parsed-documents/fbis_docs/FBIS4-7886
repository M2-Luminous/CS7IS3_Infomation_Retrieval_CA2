Here are main spheres of cooperation listed in the declaration: economy, social issues, industry, finance, environment protection and technology. The two countries intend to encourage investments and direct contacts between firms, to intensify their cooperation in agriculture, industry and power engineering and to work on joint projects in third countries. The two countries express their readiness to support the authority of the United Nations, and acknowledge the role of the CSCE for maintaining stability and security in Europe, the usefulness of position coordinating through consultations within the Western European Union and the important role of the Council of Europe. They share the conviction that security and stability should be based on the observance of international law and the principle of defence sufficiency. Bulgaria and Belgium declare that their "own security is directly related to that of NATO member states, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the Partnership for Peace programme." Belgium is willing to support Bulgaria's participation in the integration process in Europe. In accordance with the EU resolutions of Copenhagen (June 1993) the two countries' cooperation will be aimed at Bulgaria's admission to the European Union. Bulgaria and Belgium have similar views on the significance of the illegal immigration problem and are convinced that every state should allow its citizens to return. They should agree on the practical application of this principle.
