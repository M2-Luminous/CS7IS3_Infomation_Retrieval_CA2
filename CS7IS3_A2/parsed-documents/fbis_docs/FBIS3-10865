Rodolfo Bacerril Suaffron, president of the Chamber of Deputies Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday warned that the attempt to create an institution that would engage the northern neighbor in a "parallel count" of our elections would not only "confuse' the work of the international media, it is insulting and disrespectful to our government. In all this series of "new attitudes" regarding serious problems such as illegal aliens, and internal matters, such as the elections, one can clearly see political interests by the opportunistic forces that are only seeking votes, alerted Jorge Tovar Montanez from the Popular Socialist Party. Bucerril Straffon, who was interviewed separately, said quite annoyed that the mere pretension is "insulting" and demeaning because no nation can assume the right to create institutions to become the overseer of electoral rights, of human rights, and of the political rights of another nation. But the worst part, he said, is that many of these proposals have been made by unscrupulous politicians who want to use whatever conflicts exist in Mexico to create trouble. Tovar Montanez said that this is just one of the actions that the neighboring country is beginning to carry out to create signs of increased feelings of hostility in U.S. society toward Mexicans in an effort to justify its economic setbacks. This announcement, together with the one about carrying out military exercises at the border near Ciudad Juarez, are events without precedent that are part of a global policy of meddling, the legislator said. He stated: "Now they are announcing that in July there will be a meeting with the chiefs of state of the rest of America to discuss the suitability of structuring a military peace force for democracy and in defense of human rights. This is a very worrisome situation." He concluded by saying that on the one hand they propose militarization and erecting metal walls, and on the other they want to supervise the domestic electoral process in the country of people whose human rights are criminally violated every day, and every time there is an illegal crossing of the border. This is a contradiction, he affirmed.
