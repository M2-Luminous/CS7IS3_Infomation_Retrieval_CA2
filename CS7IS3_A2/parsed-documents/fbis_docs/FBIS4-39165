A UNIAN correspondent learned from unofficial sources that material and domestic provisions for people's deputies were discussed. It was stated that the state's Supreme Council and leadership had been revealed as unprepared for the elections taking place and for parliament being competent, because there were not even enough places for deputies in hotels. Members of the provisional commission for the provision of deputies' accommodation noted that the granting of apartments to all deputies is also still a problem. After this some of the deputies expressed themselves in favor of the advisability of the existence of a semi-professional parliament: half works permanently and half comes for the sessions. This proposal caused the most arguments because such a proposal would, in the first place, suit representatives from government and commercial structures, who up to now have not resigned from their previous place of work. People's deputy Ivan Zayets maintained in his speech that he knows of one building for deputies, which will be rented out in the district, where he stood for election. Should the electors disagree with parliament decisions, one may expect picketing of this building. It was learned from the same sources that the closed sitting was also about payment for the labor of people's deputies. According to a deputy who did not wish to be named, the talk is about a payment, which would only be sufficient for food. At the sitting, Oleksandr Tkachenko reported that the candidacy of Vitaliy Masol for the post of Ukraine's prime minister would be submitted for examination by Ukraine's Supreme Council on 14 June. The deputies are to determine their positions regarding this in groups and commissions by the said date. Masol is a former chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Ukraine Soviet Socialist Republic, who resigned at the demand of the hunger-striking students in October 1990. He is an economist, who graduated from the Kiev polytechnic institute and the institute of management of the national economy, and managed a heavy machine-building enterprise. He was a people's deputy of the Supreme Council of the Ukrain Soviet Socialist Republic of the 9th-11th convocations, and also head of Ukraine's state planning, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and a deputy of the Supreme Council of the USSR of the 10th-11th convocations. He will be 66 years old in November 1994.
