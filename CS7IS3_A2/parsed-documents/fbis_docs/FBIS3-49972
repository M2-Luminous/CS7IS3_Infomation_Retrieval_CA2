Seselj said in a talk with Bulgarian Embassy First Secretary Marjan Raikov that the Bosnian Serbs could not cede more territories to the Bosnian Moslems as they have already `made too many concessions'. The Moslems were dissatisfied with one-third of the overall territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina which was supplied mostly by the concessions provided by the Bosnian Serbs. Seselj, who is head of the SRS deputy club in the Federal parliament, also said he urged as close as possible rapprochement between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. Setting out he did not oppose an independent former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.M.), Seselj stated doubt that its independence was possible because, as he said, of the threats from the neighboring Albania. The Albanian national minority accounts for 21 percent of the overall population of over two million in the F.Y.R.M. the political leaders of the extreme nationalistic parties of ethnic Albanians urged secession of the western part of the F.Y.R.M., where this ethnic group had a marked majority, and joining it to the neighboring Albania. The issue of F.Y.R.M., according to Seselj, would at any event have to be resolved between Belgrade-Sofia-Athens, which, as set out, could be the only guarantors of independence of the F.Y.R.M.
