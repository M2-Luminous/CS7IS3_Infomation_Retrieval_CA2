Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-15MAR94-DPRK-U.S.-IAEA DPRK Warns That U.S. Preconditions Will "Rupture" Talks SUMMARY Amid foreign media reports of IAEA inspectors departing North Korea after encountering difficulties, Pyongyang on 15 March used the authoritative vehicle of a Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement to demand that Washington proceed with the 21 March DPRK-U.S. high-level talks in Geneva as scheduled. Reinforcing earlier warnings against the imposition of preconditions for the talks, the spokesman threatened that North Korea would call off the meeting and refuse future nuclear inspections. Pyongyang radio at the same time issued an oblique threat to proceed with a nuclear arms development program. END SUMMARY Seeking to place Washington on the defensive, the Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, carried by Pyongyang radio on 15 March, declared that North Korea has "completely fulfilled" its obligations under the 25 February DPRK-U.S. agreement and called on the United States to do its part without setting "unreasonable preconditions." Repeating the familiar refrain on the 25 February accord, the spokesman said that the accord set forth "simultaneous" action by both sides, namely 1)"resumption" of inter-Korean contacts for exchanging special envoys and 2)IAEA inspections for ensuring continuity of safeguards on Pyongyang's part, in return for 1)suspension of Team Spirit and 2)resumption of DPRK-U.S. high-level talks in Geneva on 21 March. Now that "several rounds" of inter-Korean talks have been held and IAEA inspections "enough for continuity of safeguards" have been completed, he warned, any U.S. failure to fulfill its obligations will "automatically" render the 25 February accord "invalid." If Washington persists in its "unreasonable" insistence that nuclear inspections must be proven "satisfactory" to the IAEA and that special envoys must be exchanged by the North and the South before Team Spirit can be cancelled or the bilateral talks can take place, the spokesman warned, Pyongyang will consider DPRK- U.S. negotiations to have ended in a "rupture" and will take unspecified "unilateral" and "appropriate" action. Ominous Threat Clearly seeking to add weight to its threats, Pyongyang seems to be preparing a public fallback position in case of failure of its nuclear talks with Washington by hinting at a readiness to proceed with a nuclear weapons program. In the latest variant of this threat, Pyongyang radio on 15 March reiterated North Korea's profession of concern for alleged Japanese plans to develop a nuclear capability. After criticizing Japanese Foreign Minister Hata's alleged statement on "countermeasures" in case of North Korean intransigence on the nuclear issue, the radio declared that Pyongyang "may face a situation of having no choice but to reconsider [its] position regarding the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." IAEA Inspections The 15 March statement comes amid reporting of the departure of a group of IAEA inspectors from Pyongyang (KCNA, 15 March) and speculation that the IAEA may hold a special Board of Governors meetings to address difficulties encountered by the inspectors (Yonhap, 15 March). Giving credence to foreign media accounts of disputes between Pyongyang and IAEA inspectors, Seoul's KBS-1 radio carried a report of a North Korean Embassy official in Beijing saying that Pyongyang had rejected a request by IAEA inspectors to extract samples from "one facility," regarding it as an "unjust demand" (15 March). The councillor, Choe Han-chun, was depicted as playing down the significance of the dispute, claiming that it was "not a serious problem" and can be resolved through future dialogue between North Korean and the IAEA. Implications Pyongyang is clearly moving to forestall any IAEA move to convene a special meeting of the Board of Governors- -a predecessor to possible referral of the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. By assuming a tough position and emphasizing the gravity of the situation, the North Korean leadership seems to hope that Washington will propose a compromise solution. (AUTHOR: YIM.
