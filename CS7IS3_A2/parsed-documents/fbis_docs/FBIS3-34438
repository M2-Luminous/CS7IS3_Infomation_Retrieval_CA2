The Majles held an open session last Sunday, and deputies of Shahreza, Mashhad, Maragheh, and Shabestar made speeches. Then Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri made a speech about the birthdays of his holiness 'Ali and his holiness Jesus, and then the Majles went into session. Then the credentials of Mr. Mofattah from Razan were examined and ratified. We to call your attention the details of the discussions. Statements of the Speaker of the Majles In his speech, Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri, the speaker of the Majles, offered his congratulations on the birthday of his holiness, Jesus Christ, and asked all the Christians of the world not to allow during these days the massacre of Muslims such as in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the hand of false followers of his holiness in the Christian world, contrary to the lofty ideas of that divine prophet who was a prophet of justice and humanity. He added: In the Christian world especially, why do the spiritual leaders of Christianity keep silent with regard to such crimes in the world and pass over such horrible crimes with indifference? Would Christ pass over so many crimes with indifference if he were here? In another part of his speech, the speaker of the Majles offered his congratulations on the birthday of his holiness 'Ali to all the Shi'ites in the world and said: Rajab 13 is the birthday of a revered human being who does not accept being a caliph because he seeks justice and finally, if he accepts the leadership of the Islamic nation, again it is because he seeks justice. [sentence as published] Pointing out that the pious offspring of the Commander of the Faithful in the policies of the Second Five-Year Plan that he outlined follows the same goals (social justice) he said: It is the same social justice [which he shows] in the general policies that the grand leader of the revolution stated. We thank God that if we were not fortunate to live at the time of his holiness 'Ali, we live in the time of his pious offspring and leader of the revolution, who thinks like him and defends the suffering of history, and that we are in a Majles, which is the manifestation of 'Ali's justice. He expressed hope that we will take steps to implement social justice and support for the oppressed, especially in examining the budget and the Second Five-Year Plan, which will soon start. Also, in our speech, behavior, and speeches from our podium, in our positions and in our meetings, we should observe justice and human rights and try to make the Majles a manifestation of 'Ali's justice in the true sense of the word. In conclusion, he offered his congratulations on the birthday of his holiness 'Ali to the [social] workers. Seyyed Mojtaba Hashemi, Deputy From Shahreza In our country, most government subsidies are for imported items. The first pre-agenda speaker of the open session of the Majles on Sunday was Mr. Hashemi, the deputy from Shahreza, who offered his congratulations on the birthday of his holiness 'Ali and said: Reaching the stage of social justice for which the true owners of the revolution are hungry and seeing their wishes in the words of the grand leader, especially the lines of the economic, cultural, and social policies of the Second Plan, makes careful examination and thinking about the developmental standards of the Second Plan of the regime a certainty. The experience of developed countries can to some extent draw the curve and stages of development for us. In continuation, he considered one of the most important characteristics of the Development Plan the setting of the financial and monetary framework of the regime and said: Determining this axis is in the area of foreign borrowing, raising the issue of privatization, controlling imports, creating a proper tax system, and expansinf exports. If it is uncoordinated with the financial system of the national economy, it will act as a double-edged sword. Using the experiences of developing countries and examining the causes of failure of many of the Latin American countries and the factor of success in the developing countries have made use of foreign borrowing resources. [sentence as published] The use of such resources is pursued with conditions, of which the most major expressed by the lending establishments and countries are the free commercial and economic markets of the borrowing country and securing democracy. Political freedom is for creating a free commercial system. On this basis, multinational companies that themselves have taken advantage of these funds under very simple conditions in raising this complex phenomenon, under the pretext of attracting investments in the developing countries, procure all their financial needs through the banking systems of the country in debt along with the clear difference in foreign currency in the region. [sentence as published] On the other hand, the interests from the activities of the so-called foreign investments within the framework of the progress of banks and financial establishments causes the free exit of large amounts gained every year through this system. In this manner, we see that the so-called developed countries of Latin America have about $400 billion in foreign debt today, whose annual interest is about $40 billion annually. Hence, we see that the transfer and escape of capital from these countries every year is about $35 billion, whereas in the Pacific region countries, we see that by creating an orderly banking system and using all banking and monetary resources and ultimately severely controling imports, large amounts of capital, especially in industrial production and commerce, are employed. These financial resources are mainly provided domestically and prepared from the savings of the people in a suitable environment towards a philosophy of export investment. The deputy from Shahreza continued: The consumer model in these countries (the Pacific region) is strongly controlled. What we lack, despite the directions of the First Plan, are the necessary restrictions on the import of luxury items and the prevention of the capital outflow are handled with care in order that the use of these resources achieve development. Hence, absolute government power over the above-mentioned pivotal points, as the main driving force along with necessary controls, is one of the special priorities of a development program. He added: A high percentage of these debts are paid under transferring technology and creating coordination and improvement of the monetary system to the borrowing countries. For example, in 1987, Argentina allotted $400 million of the loans it received to equip and revise its monetary system and computerize its Central Bank. The largest portion of these loans ultimately is used to repay past loans. The creation of uncontrolled inflation due to the increase in the rate of foreign currency and the devaluation of domestic currency, failure to pay the interest on loans and to pay debts or delays result in the escape of capital and under special conditions when economic growth requires investment, it will cause foreign banks to increase their interest rates. In conclusion, the speaker said: Protective policies of the lending companies, establishment of heavy taxes on the products of developing countries, and other protective measures prevent offerings and competition by developing countries. In our country, most government subsidies are allocated to import items. The question is, has foreign aid been effective in economic development? Hoseyn Fattahi-Ma'sum, Deputy From Mashhad The next speaker was Fattahi, the deputy from Mashhad, who offered his congratulations on the blessed birthdays of his holiness 'Ali and his holiness Christ and, honoring Agricultural Development Week, said: Today, with the problem that so-called civilized humanity is facing and also the problems facing our Islamic country due to the cruel policies of global oppressors, having a model and example for the perpetuation of government and the life of people is very important and essential. The human-creating school of Islam, due to its ideological content, has offered clear methods and models in its practical dimensions as well. He added: These questions are at issue before all the officials and people. If we claim to be Shi'ites and followers of 'Ali, like Osman ebn Hanif who was a friend of the Imam, are we not the target of the Imam's words and reprimands? Why do you have aristocratic banquets and sit at the glittering tables of aristocracy? If we truly consider ourselves the followers of Imam 'Ali and followers of religious guardianship, let us show with our sincere actions and with a national and general will, as was the view of our sire, 'Ali, and the statements of the grand leader, which have been all but forgotten, that we will avoid luxuries, waste, festivals, aristocratic ceremonies, experience seminars, and unnecessary travels abroad, and in keeping with the method and ways of being a Shi'ite of 'Ali implement simple living in all the offices, ministries, institutions, organizations, and everywhere in the country. Dr. Fattahi then continued: If the Islamic Republic of Iran today cannot free itself through a general mobilization from the claws of domestic and foreign problems, can it claim that it has truly acted for the goals of Islam and followed 'Ali? Why is it that with an annual foreign currency income of more than $16 billion it is unable to pay its debts on time? What factor has caused society to be lead on this course? Of course, the fundamental essential investments and the efforts of the revered government officials and the president following the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, which was successful, must be remembered. Is the way to be free of these economic problems to move towards more borrowing and the creation of new obligations, or is it in preventing the futile waste of the foreign currency revenues on unnecessary projects and programs and avoiding various excesses of the organizations and institutions that require government foreign currency and the uncontrolled sale of foreign currency to the people? Requesting that the officials supervise the uncontrolled import of goods, he also asked all the officials who somehow are responsible for supervising the current affairs of the country to increase their investigation and supervision and deal decisively, like 'Ali, with the violators, economic terrorists, embezzlers, and bribery gangs. He added: On the one hand, I request that the economic planners of the country devise their course of action on the path of raising production and revenues and conserving expenditures and avoiding excessive waste in the offices. They should not think that by raising prices and putting pressure on the shoulders of the oppressed and downtrodden classes in society we can follow the correct economic path. Has anyone thought about who must tolerate all this economic pressure? Will the increase in the cash flow of the ministries and companies not be followed by excessive expenditures and waste? Will this method not cause a small number to become rich and a large number of low-income people to be harmed more than ever before? Continuing, Dr. Fattahi pointed out the issue of self-management and the bill of general insurance, which is the basis of the Plan: The spirit and basis of this bill was the transfer and sale of nonteaching government hospitals to the private sector or insurance companies, and the teaching hospitals must be self-sufficient, as stated in Note 10 of the budget bill. The question is, is insuring people and providing general insurance only possible through the sale of hospitals to the private sector or collecting heavy treatment expenditures from people in the educational hospitals? The deputy of Mashhad then, in regarding the issue of oil, referred to the policies set by the grand leader and, addressing the related officials, said: Why do you not revise oil policies in order to eliminate dependence of this important industry on Western countries? Why should OPEC headquarters be in Austria? Why should we not try, as a revolutionary country with the help of other oil rich countries that are mostly in the Middle East, to foloow the idea of the leader of the revolution and think about honor and dignity through oil in the world? Mostafa Seyyed Hashemi, Deputy From Maragheh When the response to the Majles deputies is issued after one year by the ministries, how do they deal with the letters and requests of ordinary people? The third speaker was Hashemi, from Maragheh, who offered his congratulations on the birthday of the Commander of the Faithful and said: Our people know that the Islamic revolution of Iran has central and fundamental principles, which are molded with the blood of the nation and have forever drawn the perspective of domestic and foreign policy. This revolutionary and political enthusiasm has been manifested in the slogans of independence, freedom, and Islamic Republic. He then continued: We must know that the struggle of the Iranian people against the United States is not a slogan struggle, but our struggle is a Koranic and principled struggle that has ideological roots. The government must think about the unhealthy economic relations, discrimination, poverty and unemployment, bureaucracy, law breaking, creating jobs that are among the effective factors in poverty and deprivation, addiction to narcotics, smuggling, migration, decrease in agriculutural production, and growth of false jobs. It must take steps in the area of jobs and job opportunities for unemployed youth who are at a critical age. For this purpose, the ground for investments in industry and production must be prepared. Both in theory and practice, we must think about education and the universities of the country that are a fundamental and rooted principle for the training of expert manpower. It should not be that our high-school and college graduates do not benefit from scientific learning and use of individual and social life without being armed by any kind of skill, merely pursuing an education to receive a degree. [sentence as published] In continuation, the speaker criticized the system of bureaucracy left over from the monarchical regime and said: We have a system of a Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Construction Jihad, environmental health, welfare, the Imam's Emergency Committee, and Ministry of Post with 5,000 postal workers. [sentence as published] And we have a parallel to the Ministry of Post in other organizations with several times the above-mentioned people. Today, science and 14 years of experience tell us that any parallel system, in fact, rather than having a positive effect has a destructive effect. Mr. President, the people are happy with the changes you made in bureaucracy in terms of the issuance of passports, drivers' licenses, birth certificates, etc. These steps were necessary but not sufficient. When the response to the honorable deputies of the Majles is issued by ministries after more than one year, how are the letters and requests of ordinary people dealt with? He then said: You (president) know better than anyone that administrative change must be at the top of the agenda and programs of the government. The unprincipled behavior of some of the organizations with clients must be investigated. As God is my witness, if this continues, the people may get tired. We must not stall the people. I swear to God, the people are noble. In conclusion, he made reminders to the minister of roads and transport concerning the establishment of flights to Sahand Airport, preparing division plans, and expediting people's building permits to the Ministry of Housing. Hasan Aminlu, Deputy From Shabestar Hasan Aminlu from Shabestar, as the last pre-agenda speaker, offered his congratulations to the social workers of the country and said: The Second Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget were presented to the Majles late. This budget, which was supposed to be presented to the Majles on 15 Azar [6 December], was completed after a 15-day delay. A cursory study of the above-mentioned budget shows problems and weaknesses, and it is noteworthy that certainly on the days that we shall have a discussion of the budget, we shall deal with the details. Referring to Notes 25 and 29 of the 1373 budget, he said: A cursory study of the chapters concerning social affairs clearly reveals that divisions are not balanced. In this year's budget, in social affairs, we had a growth of 22 percent. This increase, when divided among various chapters, is unbalanced. He continued: Of this 22 percent, 66 percent is allocated to social security and welfare, 48 percent to training and affairs of the youth, 41 percent to culture and art, 26 percent to higher education, 25 percent to education, 24 percent to urban development, 24 percent to the environment, 13 percent to rural development and 12 percent to health and treatment [percentages as published]. The least growth that exists in the 1373 developmental budget is the budget for health and treatment. Aminlu then referred to the deputies' reminders to the health and treatment sectors and pointed out: With the ratifications of the budget, when it is too late, reminders do not mean anything anymore. If the deputies want to create just distribution in these sectors so that later it would not be necessary to make reminders, they must look at it when writing the budget. Thirty percent of the budget growth of health and treatment, if we take into consideration 22 percent inflation, means a 19-percent decrease in the growth in this sector. Hence, next year in the developmental chapter, in our health and treatment section, I warn you right now, we shall have an absolute stoppage. Ratifications The first item on the agenda of the open session of the Majles on Sunday was examinating the credentials of Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah from Razan. First the report of the Investigation Committee concerning his credentials was read as follows: The election file of Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah from Razan, which was referred to the Investigation Committee due to the objection by Mr. Naqba'i, was examined in numerous sessions and now the report is presented to the Majles. Based on the final minutes of the lieutenant governor's office of Razan, the election were held on 29/05/1372 [19 June 1993] with the formation of 165 registration centers. The total votes were 29,762: of that Seyyed Abolqasem Hasani-Tabataba'i had 15,221 votes; and Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah, 14,183 votes. [figures as published] As a result of eight objections made to the Executive Committee and their being sent to the above-mentioned Council of Guardians, on two occasions representatives were sent to Razan electoral region, and a number of ballot boxes were invalidated. As a result, Mr. Tabataba'i's votes decreased to 12,954. Hence, Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah, with 14,155 votes, gained the majority of votes and was introduced to the Majles as a Majles deputy. Due to Mr. Naqba'i's objection in the Majles, the above-mentioned case was sent to the Investigation Committee. After listening to the statements of Mr. Naqba'i and also the reasons of the member of the Council of Guardians, the committee sent a three-member delegation to Razan. The above-mentioned delegation, after contacting the officials of the election regions, the people of those areas, and also the dispatched representative of the Council of Guardians, submitted a detailed report to the committee. The Investigation Committee, after hearing the delegation's report regarding the most important objection of Mr. Naqba'i concerning the invalidation of six ballot boxes, based on Article 20 of the law of the supervision of the Council of Guardians over Majles elections, considered the opinion of the Council of Guardians regardings the invalidation of ballot boxes as the final opinion and the matter was closed by them. In other instances of the objections by Mr. Naqba'i, the opinion of the committee is as follows: In Paragraphs 1 and 6, the rejection of the competence of the candidates is determined by the Council of Guardians. In regards to Paragraph 2, support of executive elements for the elected candidate was not proved. In regards to Paragraph 3, the participation of well-known people in the campaign and the use of well-known figures, if true, is not prohibited by law. In regards to Paragraph 4, there are generalizations that have not been proved. And in regards to Paragraph 7, the ballot boxes have generally been examined and no violations observed. It should be pointed out that there is no protest concerning the competence of Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah. Finally, the committee, after hearing the statements of Mr. Mofattah and holding six sessions, voted by secret ballot and announced the following results: Total votes, 11; supporting, 9; opposing, 1; abstentions, 1. Hence, the credentials of Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah were ratified. Then Naqba'i defended his objections and expressed his objection regarding the credentials of the deputy from Razan. Then Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah defended his credentials, which were ratified by the Investigation Committee, and considered Mr. Naqba'i's protest baseless. It is interesting that then Mr. Mohassel-Hamadani defended the credentials of Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah and rejected the objection of Mr. Naqba'i concerning the procedure of the elections in Razan. Then his credentials were put to a vote and ratified with 121 supporting votes by the Majles. The next item on the agenda was the proposal to extend the content of the law of landlords and tenants to the offices of physicians that was returned from the Council of Guardians, which was amended in the open session of the Majles on Sunday. According to this amendment, two notes were attached to Article 2 of the law of the relations of landlords and tenants ratified in 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984]. In Note 1, the collection of any sort of fee under the heading of lock money in the rented offices and transfer of the physician offices to others, if not mentioned in the text of agreement between landlord and tenant, is prohibited. Also, the use of residential places in places that in the landlord and tenant agreement it is not stated to be used as a physician's office is prohibited without the consent of the owner. Also in this session, the proposal exempting the ratifications concerning the internal bylaws of the Majles from the content of Article 2 of the civil law as very urgent was presented to the Majles and its urgency was ratified. It is interesting that according to the article of the civil law, the law must be implemented 15 days after it is published throughout the country. The next item on the agenda of the open session of the Majles on Sunday was the proposal to amend Note 1 of the law of the employment status of the martyred, self-sacrificing, and freed prisoners of war employees ratified on 16/06/1372 [17 August 1993]. First, its very urgent status was put to a vote. Prior to that, Mr. Gharibani, the deputy from Ardabil, said: This proposal on the employment status of the employees of the martyrs families was presented to the Majles with more than 80 signatures. Our opinion is that this very urgent proposal be ratified prior to the discussion of the budget in the Majles, because if after the ratification of the budget there is a financial burden, the gentlemen will not succeed. Then, the very urgent status was put to a vote and not ratified. Then an urgent status of the proposal was put to a vote and ratified by the Majles. The next proposal was the urgent amendment of Articles 16 and 20 of the law of documents and property records, which was ratified by the deputies. It is noteworthy that Articles 16 and 12 concerning the period of protest in regards to property to be registered, claims related to the protest to the boundaries of the property requested for registration, protests by neighbors, number of times of protest, the situation of protests after notification, and the period..., respectively. On the Margins of the Majles Bylaws Reminder of Mr. Hazrati, Deputy From Rasht Mr. Hazrati, in the early moments of the open session on Sunday, referring to Article 147 of the internal bylaws, made a bylaws reminder and said: My question to the honorable minister of interior was supposed to be discussed today in the open session, and it was said that he was on a trip and whenever he is free he is supposed to act on these bylaws. Mr. Nateq-Nuri said: The day that the president spoke about the plan in the Majles, your question was on the agenda of the Majles. But his speech was long and you agreed that the Majles was tired. Today, also, we had put it on the agenda of the Majles, but it was reported that he is accompanying the president on a trip, and we will certainly put it on the agenda for Tuesday. Bylaws Reminder of Mr. Noruzi Engineer Noruzi, in a bylaws reminder concerning his question to the minister of industries, said: Since Azar [22 November-21 December], almost simultaneous with the question of Mr. Hazrati, I posed a question. It was also published, but was not put on the agenda. Now, in regards to Mr. Hazrati, due to the absence of the minister of interior, there was no opportunity. But my question has not been published in the weekly agenda, either. The speaker of the Majles, Mr. Nateq-Nuri, said in this regard: According to the new bylaws, a question that is given to me is given to the committee. The committee invites your honor to speak there. The procedure that was acted on on the basis of the decree of the Imam was made into a bylaw. After examination in the committee it will be given to us. Now, we will investigate to see whether or not the committee has pursued the matter.
