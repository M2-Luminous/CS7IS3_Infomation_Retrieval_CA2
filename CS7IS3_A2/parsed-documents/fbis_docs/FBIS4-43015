Today's vote saw the election for the opposition of Aldo Corasaniti, Democratic Left, to chair the Constitutional Affairs Committee, and Giangiacomo Migone, of the Progressives, as head of the Foreign Affairs Committee, after government candidate Giovanni Spadolini withdrew his candidacy. A run-off vote was held for the Chairman of the Defense Committee, after the first ballot draw, with the opposition Progressive candidate Raffaele Bertoni edging out Luigi Ramponi of the National Alliance, the government's candidate. The government Freedom Alliance took only the Justice Committee chair with Antonio Guarra of the National Alliance, while Giorgio Brambilla of the Northern League was elected to helm the Environment Committee. The 8-5 defeat of the government in securing the Senate committee chairs was seen by many observers to be the result of conflict within the government coalition, especially between Prime Minister Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the Northern League of Umberto Bossi, as well as the government's refusal to politically bargain with some opposition forces, such as the former Christian Democrats of the People's party, viewed by the latter as a sign of the government's arrogance. Forza Italia has been particularly critical of the Northern League which it has accused of "irresponsible" behavior, just short of betrayal for having allegedly bargained with the Left. Tiziana Maiolo, the Forza Italia chairman of the House Justice Committee, this morning said it was indispensable that the forces making up the government coalition clear up their difference and reach an operative consensus. In reference to the "irresponsible" Northern League, she said "I hope this behavior ends after June 12 (European elections), that bit is just a preelection ploy and not permanent, otherwise we will have to go to early elections." Any eventual early elections, she added, would have to involve both House and Senate because at question would be the government coalition itself. According to Maiolo, the government coalition's position to reject candidates from the opposition was a guarantee for Berlusconi to keep the government in the center. Forza Italia House whip Raffaele Della Valle was also in favor of the coalition summit and observed "It is never negative that a government coalition meet to examine the performance of its individual members." Looking at the government setback in the Senate, Della Valle said "This result is the consequence of an election which produced a framework of total uncertainty in the Senate. I don't think it is yet the case to emphasize or dramatize this result which is, without a doubt, negative, but which must be taken for what it is. I don't think it is cause to take a step as drastic as dissolving the Senate. Certainly, it makes it harder to work, for the majority." Della Valle then observed "the commission votes should be examined carefully for there is something in the coalition which isn't working. This is what should be subject to an in-depth examination by the majority and the government." Michele Sellitti, Senate whip for the Socialist group, said the chair vote was a "warning to the majority on the need for dialogue with the opposition.... We recognized its right to chair the 13 standing committees and asked that the opposition be given the chair of the Commissions for Control. The confrontation developed due to the total lack of openness by the majority to an absolutely reasonable and legitimate hypothesis as this." The Senate whip for the National Alliance, Giulio Maceratini, had a different view and said "Either the political framework changes or we go to new elections because this is no way to govern." He, too, agreed that an eventual early vote would have to be for both houses of parliament, even though the Constitution allows for dissolving only the Senate. "The result (of the Senate vote) was undoubtedly negative, but it was a battle fought with unequal arms." After being accused by its allies of not abiding to coalition agreements, the National Alliance today issued a statement claiming it had the right to ask that "Forza Italia and the National Alliance clarify their positions." A party communique went on to criticize the hard-line its coalition partners had adopted in the Senate chair vote and said that unless differences were resolved, then early election would be necessary. According to the Northern League, Forza Italia and the National Alliance had been amateur in not recognizing the opposition's right to chair the Bicameral Control Committees and had "failed to listen to the Northern League's advice." The results of the election for Senate committee chairmen saw the government coalition win the chairs for Justice, Budget, Public Works, Health and the Environment Committees, while the opposition will head the Committee for Constitutional Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Defense, Finance, Education, Agriculture, Industry and Labor.
