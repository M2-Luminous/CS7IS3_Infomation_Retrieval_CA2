FR940610-0-00015 FR940610-0-00005 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AWP&hyph;4] Establishment of Class E Airspace; South Lake Tahoe, CA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace at South Lake Tahoe, CA. A Localizer Type Directional Aid (LDA)/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the South Lake Tahoe Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward from the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The establishment of Class E airspace will provide adequate airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at South Lake Tahoe Municipal Airport. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., December 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Scott Speer, System Management Branch, AWP&hyph;530, Air Traffic Division, Western-Pacific Region, Federal Aviation Administration, 15000 Aviation Boulevard, Lawndale, California, 90261; telephone (310) 297&hyph;0697. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On March 15, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish a Class E Airspace area at South Lake Tahoe, CA. (59 FR 14804). An SIAP was being developed for the South Lake Tahoe Municipal Airport at South Lake Tahoe, CA. This will add controlled airspace extending from the surface for IFR operations at South Lake Tahoe Municipal Airport. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceedings by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No objections were received concerning this proposal. The coordinates in the proposal were based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from the surface designated as an extension to a Class D surface area are published in Paragraph 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in this Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulation establishes Class E airspace at South Lake Tahoe, CA. This action will provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing the LDA/DME&hyph;1/2 approaches at South Lake Tahoe, CA. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.

The incorporation by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 of Federal Aviation Administration Order 7400.9A, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, is amended as follows: Paragraph 6004␣Class E airspace areas designated as an extension to a Class D surface area * * * * * AWP CA E4 South Lake Tahoe, CA␣[New] Lake Tahoe Airport, CA (Lat. 38 ○53 ’38 ’ ’ N, Long. 119 ○59 ’43 ’ ’ W) That airspace extending upward from the surface within 1.8 miles each side of the South Lake Tahoe LDA/DME south course extending from the 4.3-mile radius of South Lake Tahoe Airport to 9.8-miles north of the airport.
