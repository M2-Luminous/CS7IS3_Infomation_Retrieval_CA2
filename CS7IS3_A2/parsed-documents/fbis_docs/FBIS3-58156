Besides, France called upon NATO to send the warring factions a clear political message to stop hostilities. The issue of the former Yugoslavia will not be on the agenda of the 16 NATO heads of state and government but will nevertheless be raised by France, which hopes that NATO, and also the United States, will strongly support the peace efforts deployed, so far in vain, by the Europeans, indicated officials wanting to preserve anonymity. Paris would like NATO to support the peace plan elaborated by the Twelve in December. The same officials say that the other topics on the summit agenda, namely the U.S. Partnership for Peace proposal offered to the ex-Soviet Bloc and the reinforcement of the European defense strength, should be endorsed without difficulty by the heads of state and government. On the other hand, the discussion on Bosnia might be more lively owing to persistent divergences of opinion among the Allies. Furthermore, reliable sources say that Washington does not want the Bosnian issue to overshadow its proposal to open up NATO to East European countries, which in its opinion, remains the priority issue of the summit.
