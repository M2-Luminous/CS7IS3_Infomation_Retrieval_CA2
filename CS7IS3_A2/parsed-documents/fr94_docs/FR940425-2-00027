FR940425-2-00027 FR940425-2-00022 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket No. GP94&hyph;7&hyph;000] Railroad Commission of Texas; Tight Formation Determination_Texas&hyph;158, Spraberry (Trend Area) Formation FERC No. JD94&hyph;03253T; Preliminary Finding April 19, 1994. The Railroad Commission of Texas (Texas) determined that the Spraberry (Trend Area) Formation (Spraberry Formation), underlying all of the Aldwell Unit and part of the Merchant Unit in Reagan County, Texas, qualifies as a tight formation under section 107(c)(5) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). For the reasons discussed below, the Commission issues this Notice of Preliminary Finding that the determination is not supported by substantial evidence. Background 1. Commission Regulations To qualify a formation as a tight formation, ยง271.703(c)(2)(i)(A) of the Commission's regulations requires the jurisdictional agency to determine that the expected in situ (matrix and natural fracture) gas permeability throughout the pay section is 0.1 millidarcy (md) or less. 1 Section 271.703(c)(2)(i)(B) requires the jurisdictional agency to show that the expected pre-stimulation stabilized natural gas flow rate, against atmospheric pressure, for wells completed for production in the formation is not expected to exceed the depth-dependent maximum flow rate specified in the table in that section (217 Mcf per day in this case). 2 Finally, ยง271.703(c)(2)(i)(C) requires the jurisdictional agency to show that wells completed for production in the formation are not expected to produce more than five barrels of crude oil per day, prior to stimulation. 3 1 18 CFR 271.703(c)(2)(i)(A). 2 18 CFR 271.703(c)(2)(i)(B). 3 18 CFR 271.703(c)(2)(i)(C). 2. Texas' Determination On March 7, 1994, the Commission received Texas' notice determining that the Spraberry Formation underlying all of the Aldwell Unit and part of the Merchant Unit in Reagan County, Texas, qualifies as a tight formation. Hardy Oil & Gas U.S.A., Inc. is the applicant before Texas. The recommended area, which is approximately 24,136 acres in size, is within the same 150-mile long Spraberry Trend Field as the acreage involved with two prior proceedings involving the Spraberry Formation (Texas&hyph;81 and Texas&hyph;156). The record shows that the Spraberry Formation in the recommended area consists of four intervals_the Upper Spraberry, Lower Spraberry, JoMill, and Dean_that have been producing oil and/or gas for at least 30 years. The record also shows that natural fractures are present throughout the formation and that approximately 233 wells have penetrated the Spraberry Formation within the recommended area. 4 4 Although ยง271.703(c)(4)(iii) requires Texas to include the location of all wells producing from the recommended formation, the record does not clearly indicate how many of the 233 wells have actually produced from the formation. Texas' conclusion that the Spraberry Formation meets the Commission's permeability guideline is based on: (1) 1992 pre-stimulation pressure buildup (PBU) test data from the SAU Well No. 25&hyph;2 ( # 25&hyph;2 well), which is within the recommended area; (2) Type curve data from two stimulated Spraberry wells within the recommended area and thirty-two stimulated Spraberry wells outside the recommended area; (3) 1992 PBU test data from four wells located from 12.5 to 54 miles away from the recommended area; 5 and 5 Two of the PBU test results are from wells located in the areas recommended in the Texas&hyph;81 and Texas&hyph;156 proceedings. The applicant incorporated this data to demonstrate that the permeability and flow rate characteristics of the Spraberry and Dean formations are relatively consistent over a large portion of this 150-mile long trend. (4) A table from the ``Atlas of Major Texas Oil Reservoirs'' (1983) showing that the average permeability to oil in the Spraberry (Trend Area) formation is zero.
