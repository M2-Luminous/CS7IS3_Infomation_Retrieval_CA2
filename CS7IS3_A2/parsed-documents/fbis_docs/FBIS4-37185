Meanwhile, Colonel John Garang, leader of the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement [SPLM], has announced the formation of a "National Executive Council" which has 27 members and has the task of running the areas under SPLM control in the south of the country. Al-Bashir described Wells' visit, which was concluded yesterday, as "evidence of U.S. President Bill Clinton's special interest in what happens in Sudan." He added in press statements during his weekly meeting with the media that "Washington is dealing with Khartoum positively for the first time." [passage omitted] Minister of State for Presidential Affairs Dr. Ghazi Salah-al-Din has told AL-HAYAH that "Wells explained her mission of boosting the peace efforts and ensuring relief for the victims of the civil war, but she did not broach relations between the two countries." But Salah-al-Din, who held a long meeting with the U.S. envoy, said that "some other points over which the United States had been critical of the government" were also raised. He saw the visit as "a new development in relations between the two countries replacing the policy of attack, accusation, and pursuit we felt in the past." Meanwhile, SPLM sources have stated that the new 27-member "National Executive Council" has been entrusted with "the role of actual civilian authority in the areas under SPLM control." They added that the announcement of the council marked the beginning of changes "which are fundamental in the context of the New Sudan" declared by the SPLM's first conference last March. They added that the Council will administer "the liberated areas." Garang kept the defense portfolio for himself in addition to the chairmanship of the council. Commander Silva Kir, his deputy, got the foreign and interior portfolios, Deng Alore the state's affairs portfolio, Dr. Justin Yak the health portfolio, Commander Yusuf Kuwa the affairs of Kurdufan (district), Daniel Kudi environment and tourism affairs, Laurence Wall education affairs, Arthur Queen human affairs, and Dr. Peter Nute Cole legal affairs [names as transliterated]. Five governors were also appointed for the provinces of Kurdufan, Upper Nile, Equatoria, Bahr al-Ghazal, and Blue Nile. [passage omitted]
