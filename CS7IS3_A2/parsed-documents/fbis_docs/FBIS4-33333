Vallarino pointed out that it is not the Legislative Assembly's fault that the IFI's are not making disbursements because of laws that have not been approved. The Legislative Assembly will not give urgent treatment to the bills that are necessary for reaching agreements between the national government and the IFI's. Arturo Vallarino emphatically said that the Legislative Assembly is never consulted about the alleged priorities. [Begin recording] [Vallarino] If there is time, if the bills are considered necessary for the improvement of the administration of justice or for the social improvement of Panamanians, then we are going to approve them, but if we believe the bills do not have the importance or the priority for the country, then they will have to wait until the Legislative Assembly considers them, approves them, or rejects them. [Ortega] Has the government failed to coordinate with the Legislative Assembly in view of such an important economic situation? [Vallarino] We believe it is a flaw. That is why the Legislative Assembly approved a bill requiring that all commitments above $10 million be approved by the Legislative Assembly; the Executive has systematically been refusing to follow that procedure. The Legislative Assembly cannot be responsible for commitments made by the Executive simply because of the money it will receive. As long as the Executive refuses to allow the Legislative Assembly to intervene in the processing of the credits, we are going to find these types of conflicts. [Ortega] Is there a solution to this problem on this occasion? [Vallarino] The president has not yet approached us to try to convince us to pay special attention to the bills. He has simply said: Approve these bills because the disbursement of money depends on it. We believe that we are not going to reach an agreement within this system. [end recording] Vallarino pointed out that it is never too late to correct flaws in coordination, especially in the political and economic arena.
