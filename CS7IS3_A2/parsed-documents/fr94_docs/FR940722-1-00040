FR940722-1-00040 FR940722-1-00012 Section 23.697␣Wing Flap Controls Proposed new §23.697(c) would provide safety standards for the wing flap control lever designs installed in airplanes that use wing flap settings other than fully retracted when showing compliance with §23.145. This revision is needed to ensure that the flap settings, which establish the safe operation of the airplane, can be positively selected. Section 23.701␣Flap Interconnection Section 23.701 (a)(1) and (a)(2) would be revised to clarify the requirements for flap systems installed on part 23 airplanes. Following the revision of §23.701, as adopted by Amendment No. 23&hyph;42 (56 FR 353, January 3, 1991), the FAA discovered that the new requirements could be interpreted in a way that was not intended and that this interpretation could result in approval of airplanes with unsafe flight characteristics in the event of flap failure. To clarify the intent of the requirements, the FAA issued on March 14, 1991, a policy letter to all aircraft certification offices that provided guidance for the correct application of the requirements. Since then, the FAA has reexamined the requirements and determined that §23.701 (a)(1) and (a)(2) need to be revised to ensure that a failure of the flap system would not create an asymmetric flap configuration that could result in an unsafe flight condition. Therefore, §23.701 (a)(1) and (a)(2) would be revised to clarify that one of the following would apply: (1) The moveable flap surfaces must be synchronized by a mechanical interconnection or by an approved equivalent means, that is independent of the flap drive system. (2) The wing flap system must be designed so that any failures of the flap system that would result in an unsafe flight characteristic of the airplane, such as flap asymmetry, is extremely improbable. These revisions would ensure that a failure of the flap drive systems will not result in a flap asymmetry configuration. Section 23.703␣Takeoff Warning System This proposed new section would require a takeoff warning system on some commuter category airplanes. The requirement would be applicable if the flight evaluation showed that an unsafe takeoff condition would result if lift devices or longitudinal trim devices are set to any position outside the approved takeoff range. If the evaluation shows that no unsafe condition would result at any setting of these devices, a takeoff warning system would not be required. For those airplanes on which a warning system must be installed, the proposal would provide requirements for the installation of the system. Section 23.723␣Shock Absorption Tests Paragraph (b) of this section would be revised by changing the word ``reserved'' in the phrase ``reserved energy absorption capacity'' to ``reserve.'' Section 23.729␣Landing Gear Extension and Retraction System This proposal would revise §23.729(e) to clarify that a landing gear indicator is required for each gear. The last sentence of current §23.729(e) would also be removed. This sentence, which states that the switches may be located where they are operated by the actual landing gear locking latch or device, is advisory material and should not be included in the requirements. If future guidance is needed to identify acceptable switch locations, Advisory Circular 23.701&hyph;1 will be revised to include that information. This proposal would also add a new §23.729(g) requiring that if the landing gear bay is used as the location for equipment other than landing gear, the equipment must be designed and installed to minimize damage. On larger airplanes, such as the commuter category, a primary cause of damage to such equipment would be tire burst. In addition, service history has shown that rocks, water, and slush enter the landing gear bay and cause damage. The equipment on any size airplane should be protected from damage by such external sources.
