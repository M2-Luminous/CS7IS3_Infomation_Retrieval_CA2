A statement by the Slovak Foreign Ministry addressed to the members of the Danube Commission, received by CTK today, said that Hungary's representative to the Commission had accused Slovakia of failure to honor the official system of announcing emergency occurrences on the Danube. According to preliminary information by Slovak authorities, the accident in the lock at Gabcikovo was due to man's failure as the captain grossly violated regulations guiding passage through the lock. "The unequivocal conclusions stated by Hungary are evidently aimed at discrediting the reliability of the Gabcikovo hydroproject and its positive contribution to international navigation and to its safety," the statement says. It points out without specification that Hungary's "unilateral" moves, that are at variance with its international commitments, raise serious obstacles to international navigation. The statement also points out Hungary's effort "to get the Danube Commission entangled in the dispute between Slovakia and Hungary [over Gabcikovo] even though both parties have agreed to settle the dispute before the International Court of Justice in The Hague." The statement also protests against the effort to include Gabcikovo in the agenda of the Danube Commission's deliberations. It stresses that at the next session of the Commission's relevant body, Slovakia will raise the question of "seeking solution to the unfavorable navigation conditions caused by the moves taken by Hungary." Under agreement reached by Slovak and Ukrainian bodies the Zernograd will be removed from the lock on Saturday [19 March].
