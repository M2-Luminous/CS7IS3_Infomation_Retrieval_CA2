The treaty will presumably be signed by the presidents of Lithuania and Poland already this spring. The accord will come into effect after it is ratified by the Lithuanian parliament and when the sides exchange ratification documents. Lithuanian and Polish experts last week completed editing the text of the treaty. At a press conference in Vilnius Monday, Gylys said the text of the treaty will be publicly announced in accordance with "the established order." The minister admitted that Lithuania and Poland failed to fully coordinate their positions on the 1920 occupation of Vilnius and its region by Poland. But Gylys said an emphasis should be laid on the future, not on the past. "The past is too heavy a burden." "Many wounds, as well as reasons to start polemics or even conflicts, remained in the postwar Europe, but European states rose above all this and chose integration," the minister said. In his words, "if we will base relations with neighbors on wrongs, we will become a zone of tension." Minister Gylys emphasized the need to have "a strong political basis" for solutions to practical problems. In his opinion, the treaty will become such a basis. Commenting on criticism that the accord does not include sufficient security guarantees for Lithuania, Gylys said the treaty clearly says that neither of the states have any territorial claims and consider present borders inviolable. The treaty was sharply criticized by MP Romualdas Ozolas, head of the parliament's commission for regional affairs. The lawmaker also made some sharp remarks about the Polish ambassador to Lithuania. Minister Gylys said such statements "practically insult nations and diplomats accredited in our country." The minister said he was surprised that Ozolas, who is the chairman of the Lithuanian Center Union, expresses such "eccentric" views.
