He said the government arrived at this decision after listening to advice from the Press Council. He also said that the publications had been repeatedly reminded about their contents, but the government's directives went unheeded. According to Subrata, the publications' operational licenses were withdrawn because of two categories of cases -- an administrative reason and the content of news reports. EDITOR magazine was banned due to an administrative reason under the Information Minister's Decision Letter No. 124/1994 and DETIK tabloid was banned under the Information Minister's Decision Letter No. 125/1994. TEMPO magazine was banned for its news reports under Information Minister's Decision Letter No. 123/1994. The three Minister of Information's Decision letters banning the publications are effective as of today, 21 June 1994.
