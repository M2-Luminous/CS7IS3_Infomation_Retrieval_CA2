And yet, with regard to Bosnia, they have done everything. They have feigned humanitarian anger and engaged in the flights of fancy of an armchair colonel. Not forgetting, of course, to be photographed in Sarajevo -- the scene of all the crimes. All the governments, from Left to Right, from Washington to Paris, and including London, are as bad as each other. All were guilty of the same negligence. And in a few days, France has managed to change the situation. It has been immediately followed by the United States. Together, they have proposed to their NATO partners that they give the Serbs between 7 and 10 days to withdraw their artillery to a radius of 20 km around Sarajevo. Failing which, the West will carry out air strikes. It is all perfectly clear. Of course, one would have wished that this determination had been displayed earlier. It would have spared many human lives in Bosnia. The West is arriving late, but it is arriving. Moreover, this is thanks to France. Although it has old habits in the sphere of passive diplomacy, it is sometimes capable of going into action. That is what happened last Sunday following the massacre at the Sarajevo market, when Foreign Minister Alain Juppe forcefully asked NATO to send an ultimatum to the Serbs. Until then the Western countries had hypocritically passed the Bosnian buck among them. At regular intervals, the United States turned accusingly toward Europe. And the reverse was true. If one could do nothing it was because of the other's impotence. The two then agreed to point the finger at their new scapegoat -- the United Nations -- although they were its guardians. Their caution and duplicity eventually became criminal. The months went by and then the years. And the shells continued to fall on the civilian populations, as on Gravelotte [scene of battle in Franco-Prussian War 1870-1871]. Each time the pressure mounted in the international sphere, the Machiavellian Serbs took a step backward and the West returned to its concerns. Yesterday, during the NATO meeting, they repeated the same farce. By concluding with the Bosnians an "immediate cease-fire" agreement in Sarajevo, and by accepting the principle of the withdrawal of heavy weapons which will be placed under the control of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. For the first time in a long time, therefore, it is France which has led the field. Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Balladur were on the same wavelength, the foreign minister was able to convince some people, intimidate others, establish alliances, and above all form a bloc with the United States. The international community could no longer sit back and watch the Bosnian tragedy while 28,000 Blue Helmets -- potential hostages -- were intended to intervene between the warring sides. Nobody yet knows how the story will end: Mr. Juppe in particular and our country in general will at least have made some attempt. It is often by preparing for war that you make peace....
