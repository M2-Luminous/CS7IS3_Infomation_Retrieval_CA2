In a statement to REUTER, 'Abd-Rabbuh said that the PLO will receive an Israeli delegation within the next few days to discuss measures that will provide security for Palestinians in the occupied territory. 'Abd-Rabbuh added that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has no plans to meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Cairo tomorrow, as was reported earlier.
