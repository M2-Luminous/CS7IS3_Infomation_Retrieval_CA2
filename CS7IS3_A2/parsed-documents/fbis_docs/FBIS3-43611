The decision was made at a kwaZulu cabinet meeting, a statement by Mr Buthelezi said. "The kwaZulu government will therefore not hold itself responsible for the consequences which may ensue should such an invasion take place in areas under the jurisdiction of the kwaZulu police. And nor will the kwaZulu government be held accountable for anything that takes place outside formal arrangements and co-operation with the kwaZulu government," said the statement. Mr Buthelezi said both police forces could operate in each other's jurisdiction only after consultation.
