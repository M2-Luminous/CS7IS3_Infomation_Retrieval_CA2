Before opening fire a grenade was lobbed into the tavern which did not detonate. The attack which happened at 11:50 PM followed a similar pattern to that in Kenilworth, Cape Town, earlier this year when gunmen lobbed a grenade and opened fire on worshipers in the St James Church. Eleven people died in that attack. Three people in the tavern among the about 60 patrons were killed in the attack while the owner of nearby Machados restaurant, Jose Cerqueira, was also killed by the attackers when he tried to return fire. The area was immediately cordoned off by police and roadblocks set up as far as George and Port Elizabeth, police radio control said. Police had also deployed 43 additional vehicles in the townships to try and locate the getaway vehicle, a blue Opel Rekord believed to have been stolen in Khayelitsha at 11PM. Police helicopters were also being deployed. The grenade was later on Friday morning detonated by police in the tavern resulting in windows being blown out. The scene at 4:30AM resembled a shambles. Benches and tables were piled outside in station road. The media were not allowed inside the tavern as police were still busy with investigations, but from the entrance it looked like the tavern had been hit by a bomb. A coffee shop, "Down at Marlenes" opposite the tavern had one of its windows shattered by bullets. The owner of the Benson Bistro close to the Heidelberg Tavern, Anita Haupt, said she was just closing her premises when the attack occurred. "I thought it was a car backfiring," Ms Haupt said. She said the owners of the restaurants in the area were getting together to organise stricter security. SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] TV news later reported the registration number of the getaway car as being XA- 20252.
