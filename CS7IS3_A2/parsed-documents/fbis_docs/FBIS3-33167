Mexican Foreign Minister Manuel Tello Macias, who presided over the meeting, said at the session's closing that "as of today, the OAS will tackle the social problems of our nations on a priority basis." Tello Macias and OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares considered the meeting named "Inter-American Cooperation for Development" to be finished. The commitment by the 34 OAS members materialized in two documents that contain the conclusions reached following two days of discussions between foreign ministers and representatives at the Foreign Relations Secretariat headquarters in Mexico City. On 18 February the delegates signed the documents entitled "Commitment To Promote Joint Cooperation and Overcome Poverty" and "Framework of General Policies and Priorities of Joint Cooperation for Development." The first document seeks primarily to strengthen democratic institutions and contribute to maintaining peace and security in the hemisphere as a formula for overcoming the poverty that affects 43 percent of the population in Latin America and the Caribbean. This document urges the "promotion of joint cooperation for development as an OAS goal and as a suitable tool to support ... local development efforts." The American countries committed themselves to promote cooperation "without seeking to impose preestablished individual models and by valuing direct participation from the communities." The document states that "the strengthening of national programs designed to meet the basic needs of the population" is necessary to stem the poverty problem, particularly regarding the most vulnerable sectors of society. The second document pointed out that joint cooperation for development will support efforts br OAS states to achieve full and sustainable growth. Specifically, the delegates will seek to contribute to the eradication of poverty from the continent to strengthen the commitment and the consolidation of democracy in the area and its institutions. The document is comprised of a framework of priorities for the OAS and the Inter-American Council for Integrated Development (CIDI). Those priorities include the improvement of nutrition and health levels, attention to population issues such as family planning, support for education, promotion of productive employment, and support for the fight against drugs. The delegates agreed that in order to support the poor sectors "other actions are required (such as) insuring larger and more efficient social expenditures in accordance with the priorities and criteria established in each country." They added that the OAS will welcome regional projects that respond to multinational initiatives and that facilitate the participation of public and private organizations. The OAS offered to give special attention to countries that "have faced serious situations of armed violence and that are rebuilding their economies." The foreign ministers and officials in charge of development programs who attended the meeting agreed to share their experiences as well as "to promote technology exchange, the broadening of markets, and the mobilization of resources." In order to achieve these goals, a coordination mechanism between the OAS cooperation institutions and the CIDI will be examined. This mechanism will come into force with the Managua Protocol. The Managua Protocol was approved by the OAS General Assembly in June 1993, although it has only been ratified by Canada and Mexico, which ratified it today. That commitment establishes, among other points, Inter-American cooperation for development as the tool to anticipate crisis and strengthen democracy in the area. The delegates also agreed to promote the immediate ratification of the Washington Protocol, which includes the eradication of poverty as a primary goal of integrated development. They reiterated that: "The goals and principles in the OAS Charter, namely the ideals of peace, democracy, respect for human rights, social justice, solidarity, and integrated development, constitute the basis of this organization."
