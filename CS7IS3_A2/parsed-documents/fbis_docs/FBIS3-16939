It was constructed using unique Russian technology, and is the only one of its kind, not only in Russia, but, experts concede, in the whole world, in terms of the level of technological safety and of the efficiency of rendering the chemical charges harmless, the so-called discharge process [rassnaryazheniye]. The military unit on whose books this factory is today is forced to find substantial resources for the maintenance of the mothballed works, though a decision was made back in 1989 to set up a training center here that would use neutral media. Administration heads of seven Russian regions where all chemical weapons of the former USSR are now stored recently visited the installation: Everybody seems to have woken up to the fact that it is more dangerous to store than to destroy them. Therefore, technologies for chemical disarmament should be moved closer to places of storage: A state program of financing, and, more importantly, an open discussion in the mass media over location of chemical disarmament enterprises are needed to achieve this. Otherwise, things will happen as they did in Chapayevsk -- the installation was built in secret, with immense resources, but it is not working.
