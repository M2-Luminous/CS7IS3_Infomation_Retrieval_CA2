The two finally gave themselves up to the Djibouti authorities after releasing the 113 people on board the plane, it was learned from airport sources. The plane, which was operating a flight between Bahr Dar (western Ethiopia) and Addis Ababa, landed at Djibouti International Airport around 1545, where after nearly four hours of negotiations the 105 passengers and eight crew members were released. The hijackers, who are said to be Ethiopians of Amhara origin, agreed to release their hostages and surrender after they were assured of being given political asylum, it was learned from reliable sources. The negotiations were led on the Djibouti side by Interior Minister Harbi Farah Idris and Transport Minister Ahmed Waberi in the presence of the Red Cross representative in Djibouti. The Ethiopian ambassador to Djibouti also closely followed the negotiations at the airport, the same sources said. The media was kept out of the meeting and the Djibouti authorities maintained a total blackout on the affair until it ended. The plane was expected to leave the Djibouti airport around 2100 for Addis Ababa with all the 113 passengers and crew members.
