FR940613-0-00058 FR940613-0-00015 WASHINGTON COMBINATION: The State indicated that the listing in the SNPRM for ``Dump truck with pup trailers'' should be changed to ``Truck and trailer.'' We agree, and this change has been made in appendix C. OTHER COMMENTS: The State indicated that the listing in the SNPRM of ``truck tractor with dromedary box-semitrailer-trailer'' should be changed to read ``truck tractor carrying a freight compartment no longer than eight feet-semitrailer-semitrailer or full trailer.'' As indicated previously, we have decided for the time being not to list dromedary equipment separately. This vehicle is therefore covered by the listing for the truck tractor and two trailing unit LCV which also has a cargo-carrying length of 68 feet. The State also commented that the length of the cargo-carrying units for ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' should indicate that the 68-foot length includes the load. We disagree. The ISTEA limited the length of cargo-carrying units, not loads. If the State wants to prohibit, or allow, cargo overhangs over that length, it is free to do so since it retains all the authority it possessed prior to the ISTEA to regulate cargo overhangs. WYOMING Many of the comments made by the WTA and the State DOT involved allowable lengths and weights for what previously had been differentiated as ``Rocky Mountain'' and ``Turnpike'' Doubles. The recategorization into truck tractor and two trailing units now used in appendix C, has accommodated many of these comments. COMBINATION: On or before June 1, 1991, Wyoming only allowed combination vehicles consisting of not more than three single vehicles. This precluded the operation of triple-trailer combinations which consist of four single vehicles_a truck tractor, a semitrailer, and two trailers. A provision of the ISTEA, in effect, gave the State until the next general election day following enactment (November 3, 1992) to decide whether to allow ``Triples.'' A Statewide referendum to allow their use was defeated in the November 3, 1992, election and, as a result, the ISTEA bars the use of ``Triples'' in Wyoming. LENGTH OF THE CARGO-CARRYING UNITS: Provisions relating to the length of a semitrailer in a truck tractor-semitrailer combination will not be added to appendix C since this vehicle is not subject to the ISTEA freeze. The State DOT argued that its 60-foot semitrailer length limit would apply to automobile and boat transporters with no overall length limit. This is not consistent with the Federal requirement that States must allow standard automobile and boat transporters to have a minimum overall length of 65 feet (75 feet if stinger-steered), with no specific limit on the length of the semitrailer. However, application of the State rule does not conflict with the Federal requirement since, as a practical matter, it only applies to vehicles longer than 65 or 75 feet. Such longer combinations would be subject to the ISTEA freeze. As a result, appendix C has been changed to list the overall length of auto and boat transporters, since cargo is typically carried on a headrack the same length as the tractor, in addition to the cargo on the trailer. OTHER COMMENTS: The WTA said that a truck-trailer combination falls under the definition of ``any other combination of vehicles'' in Wyoming law and, therefore, is limited to a total overall length of 85 feet with no single unit exceeding 60 feet. While the combination is limited to 85 feet, the 60-foot limit applies only to semitrailers in a truck tractor-semitrailer combination. The showing of 78 feet for the length of the cargo-carrying units was based on allowing 7 feet for cab length. The WTA said that it could not understand why the cargo-carrying length of saddlemount combinations was shown in the SNPRM as 75 feet. Under Wyoming law it would be considered as ``any other combination'' subject to an overall length of 85 feet. We agree. Since the tractor in a saddlemount combination is part of the cargo being transported, we have changed the length of the cargo-carrying units for this combination to 85 feet. TOW TRUCK OPERATIONS The nature of the service provided by wreckers or tow trucks is such that these vehicles need to have immediate access to all roads in a State to remove disabled or abandoned, as well as accident-damaged, vehicles. They are, to that extent, emergency vehicles. There is no evidence that Congress intended to include these operations under the freeze restrictions. Therefore, the FHWA proposed in the SNPRM to exclude emergency towing operations from any of the freeze provisions proposed in appendix C. Comments on this issue were received from the California and Washington DOT's and the California Highway Patrol.
