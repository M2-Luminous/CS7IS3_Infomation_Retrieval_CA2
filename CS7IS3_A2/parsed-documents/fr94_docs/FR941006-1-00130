FR941006-1-00130 FR941006-1-00016 The act anticipates that new information about the safety or effectiveness of marketed drugs may require changes in labeling to reflect necessary limitations on use or to warn of previously unanticipated hazards (see e.g., 21 U.S.C. 355(e)). FDA has required by regulation that manufacturers provide warning statements for specific drug products (e.g., drugs for internal use which contain mineral oil, 21 CFR 201.302; isoproterenol inhalation preparations, 21 CFR 201.305; acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing preparations, 21 CFR 201.309). The impetus for requiring warnings for each of these products or product classes was evidence of risk in a specific patient population or from a specific use of the product. FDA responded to these risks by requiring warnings to help patients use prescription drug products more safely and effectively. For example, given the particular risk of severe paradoxical bronchoconstriction associated with repeated, excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations, FDA requires that warning information to patients be included as part of the label and as part of the instructions included in the package dispensed to patients (See 21 CFR 201.305). The specified warning statement may be placed on the immediate container with a statement to the pharmacist not to remove it or may be included in a package with instructions to pharmacists to place the warning on the container prior to dispensing (see 21 CFR 201.305(c)(2)). Based upon FDA's authority under sections 201(n), 502(a), 505 and 701(a) of the act, the agency is proposing to require that manufacturers of prescription iron-containing products disclose information about the risks presented by their products in the form of a warning statement that would appear on such products in the manner described below. d. What should the label warning be required to state? FDA has considered what information should be required in the warning statement to ensure that, as required by sections 201(n), 403(a)(1), 502(a), and 505 of the act, users of iron-containing products are made aware of the potential consequences of their use, i.e., that the labeling of iron-containing products states the facts that are material with respect to the consequences that may result from the use of these products. The proposed warning statements in the AG and NDMA petitions contained the various information elements as shown in Table 9. FDA tentatively concludes that to fulfill the requirements of the act, the warning statement should incorporate some elements from both of these petitions, as well as other elements that are designed to ensure that the statement performs its function. In reaching this tentative conclusion, FDA considered several factors. FDA agrees with the AG petition that the term ``Warning'' is necessary to alert the user to the potential consequences of the use of the product, that is, to the dangers of iron overdose. This term is universally accepted as denoting danger. FDA tentatively concludes that the potential for iron-containing products to cause death or serious injury any time a small child gains access to the product warrants the use of this term. FDA tentatively concludes that the statement must bear the instruction to ``Keep away from children.'' Because a child is at risk of serious injury or death any time he or she gains access to iron-containing products, this statement is a material fact about the consequences of use of the product and is also necessary to ensure the safe use of the product.
