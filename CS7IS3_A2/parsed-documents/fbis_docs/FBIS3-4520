The pros and cons of doing business in the world's most populous country and the fastest-growing economy were again at Washington's spotlight as the debates over China's trade status heated up. With the commerce department keeping secret on the classified document - "U.S. commercial interests in China to the year 2000", outside the beltway, traders could barely wait to ride the oriental express. "China is now defined by great expectations," "Beyond MFN", a new book on China's most favored nation status, noted in its preface. "the (U.S.-China) relationship is of rapidly increasing importance to Americans." Then, where are the real commercial interests of the U.S. in China, which, according to some projections, will be the world's largest economy in 20 years and which, among other handicaps, lack modern infrastructure? Over the years, U.S. exports to China, according to official sources here, have been led by aeronautic equipment, power generating machinery, fertilizer, electric machinery, medical equipment, grain and chemicals. Among the U.S. imports from China were, in line with imports value, apparel, toys and games, electronics, footwear, leather goods, power generating machinery and plastics. "In the future, Mainland China will certainly be the center of a web of investment and trade relations because of its vast population and market potential," said Claude Barfield, director of trade studies at the American Enterprise Institute, at a symposium today. The area of China, China's Taiwan and Hong Kong is the America's fourth largest export market and third largest supplier. "The overwhelming amount of U.S. sales is in manufactured goods," Jeff Garten, undersecretary of commerce, said in a recent speech in Tokyo. Over the past five years, U.S. imports from China have been increasing at a rate of five times faster than exports. While U.S. exports to Japan have remained unchanged since 1990, its exports to China have risen by 55 percent. According to the U.S.-China Business Council, China plans to spend over 200 billion U.S. dollars on imports from 1993 to 1995. Many of these imports are in the areas in which U.S. industries are particularly strong. Among other things, China's import markets in the next two years of power-generating equipment, aerospace, computers and telecommunications will be respectively 100 billion, 40 billion, 40 billion and 30 billion dollars. Apparently, there are worries. While every other western country has rearranged programs to actively promote exports to and investment in China, "the U.S. Government has not," wrote Jerome Cohen, a China expert at New York University School of Law. Actually, U.S. private direct investment in China, as percentages of the total amount of such investment in the people's republic, has dropped from 4.6 percent in 1991 to 2.8 percent in 1992. "As the greatest industrial power in the world and the destination of fully one-third of China's exports, the U.S. has received only a paltry share of the huge China market, a cause for some concern," he stressed. The book "Beyond MFN-Trade With China and American Interests", meanwhile, noted that in China and Asia, there had been "diminishing dependence" on the U.S. as the major purchaser of their products. What's worse, the U.S. consumers, buying some 30 billion dollars of goods from China and Hong Kong last year, have to pay seven to 10 billion dollars more if China's MFN status was revoked by the white house. Jobs and profits in the U.S. companies doing business with China, observers here noted, will be jeopardized. Noting that U.S. businesses are at "a significant disadvantage" in competing for China's favor, Jerome Cohen stressed that "one should not underestimate the importance of favorable U.S. policies for promoting U.S. business interests." Said a senior Chinese official last spring, "if (the U.S.) come into the Chinese market too late, it will be occupied by others. It is a big cake. Come early and you get a big piece."
