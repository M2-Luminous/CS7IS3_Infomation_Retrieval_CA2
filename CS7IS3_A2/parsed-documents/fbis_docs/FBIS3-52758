Different news media have dispatched various reports that indicate new developments in Afghanistan. On the basis of these reports, the opponents of Borhanoddin Rabbani have made his removal from power a pre-condition for ending the fighting in Kabul. Analysts predict that in this way the situation in Afghanistan is in the throes of unpredictable events. The question being asked by analysts is whether such a demand will be. In any case, even if power passes hands in Kabul, one cannot expect fundamental changes to occur in the course of events in that country. The only difference would be that the tragic fight for power in Afghanistan would be repeated in a different form, because none of the groups wish to reach a total and comprehensive agreement. On the contrary, each group looks into the future of Afghanistan only through the prism of its own interests. One can find the evidence for this in many agreements that have been signed during the past two years, especially the Islamabad and Jalalabad agreements. There is very little flexibility in the positions adopted by various groups. The whole country is awash with weapons and armed forces. The forces under the commands of various leaders do not obey them in practice. The leaders themselves distrust one another, and each agreement is invalid in the eyes of others. The combination of these factors prevents one from making a positive assessment about the developments in Afghanistan. The truth is that what the people of Afghanistan need at present above all else is security. Any development that will not bring about secruity for the people of Afghanistan is to be rejected. The two-year war among various rival political and military groups has destroyed the resources and capabilities of Afghanistan, has denied security to the people, has caused death and injury of thousands of people, and has turned many more thousands into refugees. Even now one cannot look forward to a bright future for that country. Political analysts believe the problem of Afghanistan does not consist in what group holds power in that country. The problem is that whatever group comes to power in Kabul, other groups raise the banner of opposition to it. It seems that the only solution to this problem is for all the rival groups to sincerely lay down their arms and to sit round a negotiation table with the aim of achieving the interests of their country and to disarm the irresponsible military forces. Then, each group should accept some responsibility in proportion to its ability and aptitude. In this context, each group should give priority to the national interests of Afghanistan above its own group interests. Otherwise, war will continue until all groups are worn out. Under such circumstances, the people of Afghanistan will be the main losers, and foreigners would impose their conditions on them from ouside.
