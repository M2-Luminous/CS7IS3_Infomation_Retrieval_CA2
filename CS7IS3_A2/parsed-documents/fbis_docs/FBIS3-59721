Under the internationally opened research system, Riken will perform basic research and its frontier research system will evolve in the Nagoya area. The research by Riken will be at the Biomimetic Control Research Center (Center chief, Masami Ito, Professor of University of Nagoya, Engineer Department), and will be organized into research teams assigned to the following sections: 1) movement circuit net, 2) movement genetics, 3) living body mimetic sensor and 4) control system theory.
