FR940802-2-00009 FR940802-2-00007 Foreign-Trade Zones Board [Docket 27&hyph;94] Foreign-Trade Zone 104_Savannah, GA; Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.; Distribution and Processing Facility; Application for Subzone Bulloch County, GA An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Savannah Airport Commission, grantee of FTZ 104, requesting special-purpose subzone status for a new distribution and processing facility of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., located in Bulloch County, Georgia, in the Savannah Customs port of entry area. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on July 15, 1994. Wal-Mart is a nationwide discount merchandiser, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company employs 520,000 people and its total sales exceed $67 billion. Wal-Mart is constructing a new distribution/processing facility (1.5 mil. sq. ft. on 163-acre site) at County Road 204 and Highway 301, Statesboro, Georgia, some 45 miles northwest of Savannah. The facility will be used to store, test, and distribute a wide range of consumer products, some of which are of foreign origin. There will be processing activity for some products. The application contains requests for authority to assemble stereo systems (duty rate 3.7%) and camera kits (duty rate 3.0%) under zone procedures. Items sourced from abroad for the stereo assembly operations include: tuners, amplifiers, and turntables (duty rate range 4.4%&hyph;6.0%). Items sourced abroad for the camera kit assembly operations include: camera cases (plastic, leather, and other), lenses, and film (duty rate range 3.7%&hyph;20.0%). Zone procedures would exempt Wal-Mart from Customs duty payments on the foreign products that are reexported. It would be able to defer Customs duty payments on domestic sales, and choose the finished product duty rates on the above noted items processed at the facility. The application indicates that zone savings would help improve the international competitiveness of the distribution/processing facility. In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is October 3, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to October 17, 1994). A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations: U.S. Department of Commerce District Office, 120 Barnard St., A&hyph;107, Savannah, Georgia 31401 Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3716, 14th Street & Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230 Dated: July 22, 1994.
