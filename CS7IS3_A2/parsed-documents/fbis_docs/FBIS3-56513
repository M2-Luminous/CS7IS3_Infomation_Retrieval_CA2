He said that at present Armenia was continuing consultations with the Russian leadership on the issue. Such consultations, said Abramyan, seem to be held between the Azeri leadership and the leaders of the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh. Abramyan said that to achieve a political settlement meetings at the level of foreign ministers, then at the level of the presidents who are to sign an agreement had been planned. So far, said the spokesman, it was a matter for the future. Abramyan reaffirmed Armenia's preparedness to continue backing Russia's peace-making initiatives. The chairman of the parliamentary commission on Nagorno-Karabakh, Seyran Bagdasaryan, said that not a single politician, not a single international organization had the right to determine the future of Nagorno-Karabakh. It was up to the people of Nagorno-Karabakh to decide their future status. He believes, though, that some provisions of the program on the settlement of the Karabakh conflict, initiated by the Russian president's aide, the well-known political scientist Andranik Migranyan, are interesting and deserve to be considered. IF Note: To settle the Karabakh and Abkhazian conflicts, Migranyan proposes to grant to Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhazia broad self-rule within Azerbaijan and Georgia. It is also necessary to create demilitarized zones around Karabakh
