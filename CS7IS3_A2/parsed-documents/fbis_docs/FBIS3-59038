Since the program is explicitly also addressed to the neutral states and since "custom-made bilateral agreements" are possible, the two points of the U.S. proposal submitted in October that are most important for Switzerland have been taken up again, Daniel Eckmann, the spokesman of the Department of Foreign Affairs announced on Tuesday [11 January] upon an inquiry. Full membership, however, is impossible for neutrality reasons. Yet since the document adopted by the NATO summit in Brussels is more comprehensive than the project outlined by U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin, its wording must be analyzed by the Military and Foreign Affairs Departments so that the Federal Council can discuss political steps. However, it is clear "that Switzerland neither wants full membership nor any kind of cooperation that might affect our neutrality," Eckmann stressed. Owing to the character of the partnership treaties adopted in the Brussels document that makes possible custom-made agreements, anything from the exchange of information, cooperation in disaster relief, and operations that promote peace is conceivable. However, the spokesman of the Foreign Affairs Department ruled out joint field exercises with NATO units, as proposed by the Brussels document for this year. The goal of possible cooperation with NATO is ending Switzerland's "security-political blind flight" and establishing an open and structured dialogue with the Western military alliance.
