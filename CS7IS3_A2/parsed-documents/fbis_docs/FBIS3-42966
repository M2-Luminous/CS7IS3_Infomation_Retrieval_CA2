Comparing these results with those of the previous poll at the end of last year, the ratings of almost all members of the government have increased slightly. We will soon see whether this tendency shows durability. But this time let's look at that area which under current circumstances essentially influences both the public's opinion of the Cabinet of Ministers and the success of the government's actions: the intersection of foreign policy and domestic policy. In the first two weeks of 1994 the most prominent event, Mr. Rucs's action, and its repercussions were already widely known and greatly discussed in the mass media, causing one to reflect on a few other, less examined situations. First of all, Mr. Rucs's operation obviously will provoke certain background questions regarding resolution of the fate of the Skrunda radar base. That could be exploited both as linkage, and as the opposite, as a non-linkage argument in the expression of public opinion in Latvia. In which direction this argument is used will become apparent very soon in the government's orientation of the information flow. Secondly, a foundation was laid for a new polarization in public opinion, which might possibly be maintained until the local elections. Whether its heirs will be "an understanding, moderate orientation" or "the active radical forces" is still hard to predict. Much will depend on future propaganda campaigns, of course, and also on political activists in Russia. Thirdly, the government must react to the shortcomings made obvious by the activities of the state's administrative mechanism, which were revealed in the events in the Vidzeme borough. Regardless of how we evaluate Mr. Rucs's actions, also knowing that in the world these sorts of incidents are not rare by any means, it is clear that even in a state with a deliberately decentralized administrative structure, development of such a situation is viewed as abnormal, both in the legislative and executive structure activities aspects. Fourthly, our country is threatened by routinization of behavior inherited from the previous government, the unsatisfactory tendency--a sufficiently significant process of evaluation to concentrate attention on the actions of individuals. And therefore the most essential is the question, which has often been heard already, whether this noisy action has hidden causes and, if so, then what? But are those who are able to answer this question able and willing to do so? The [Parex] expert group would be very thankful to NEATKARIGA CINA readers for their critical suggestions and proposals. Our phone numbers are Riga 331663 and 334162. Poll Results Post Name Total Latvians Others Recognition (%) (%) (%) Coefficient Bank of E. Repse 27.9 37.9 15.2 0.79 Latvia President Foreign G.
