According to Gorazde correspondent Enes Murtovic, "the beginning of the ninth day of the latest and the fiercest offensive on Gorazde does not hold out hope that the Serbo-Montenegrins will easily give up their aim, which is to capture Gorazde. By capturing the town Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic would round off the borders of the phantom Srpska republic, whose borders are marked with blood and [word indistinct] of innocent people from this region. Last night the aggressor fiercely attacked Borova and (?Gosun) with all available means from the direction of Ustipraca. Dobrijevici and Razalice were attacked from Mesici. After fierce fighting and after inflicting heavy losses on the aggressor, the defenders of Gorazde repelled several infantry attacks by the Chetniks between Ustipraca and Mesici." Murtovic also reports that "this morning the Chetniks have continued their fierce attacks in the Gorazde area. All the front lines of the Gorazde defenders between Foca, Cajnice, Ustipraca, and Rogatica are being targeted. The Gorazde city center was spared destructive shells this morning, probably because General Michael Rose, commander of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], is expected to arrive here." Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "since last night, Karadzic's terrorists have continued their artillery attacks in the Bihac region. The target of their artillery and tanks deployed in Grabez are Bihac and [words indistinct] surrounding area. Civilians and civilian houses, as well as vital communications, are again being targeted." The correspondent also says that "on the front lines facing the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomous region, small arms provocations and the shelling of the Cajnici area and Krivaja in the Cazin commune have continued." According to a correspondent from the free territory of Brcko, "the Serbian aggressor has continued shelling the defense lines and regrouping his forces. Last night, the Chetniks attacked the central part of the Brcko defense lines with 60-mm and 82-mm mortars and portable rocket launchers."
