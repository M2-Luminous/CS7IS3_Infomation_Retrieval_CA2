FR940204-1-00067 FR940204-1-00013 Behren's silverspot butterfly is similar in appearance to two other subspecies of Speyeria zerene (Hammond 1980, Howe 1975, McCorkle and Hammond 1988). The threatened Oregon silverspot butterfly ( Speyeria zerene hippolyta ) has lighter basal suffusion on the upper sides of the wings than Behren's silverspot butterfly. Another related taxon, the endangered Myrtle's silverspot butterfly ( Speyeria zerene myrtleae ), is larger in size and also lighter in color than Speyeria zerene behrensii. Behren's silverspot butterfly inhabits coastal terrace prairie habitat. The life history of Behren's silverspot butterfly is similar to the callippe silverspot butterfly. The females lay their eggs in the debris and dried stems of the larval foodplant, violet ( Viola adunca ) (McCorkle 1980, McCorkle and Hammond 1988). Upon hatching, the caterpillars wander a short distance and spin a silk pad upon which they pass the fall and winter. The larvae are dark-colored with many branching sharp spines on the back. The caterpillars immediately seek out the foodplant upon termination of diapause in the spring. Each larva then forms a pupa within a chamber of leaves that they have drawn together with silk. The adults emerge in about 2 weeks and live for approximately 3 weeks. Depending upon environmental conditions, the flight period of this single brooded butterfly ranges from July to August. Adult males patrol open areas in search of newly emerged females. The historic range of Behren's silverspot butterfly extends from the mouth of the Russian River in Sonoma County northward along the immediate coast to southern Mendocino County in the vicinity of Point Arena (Mattoon, in litt ., 1989). The six historic populations were known to occur in coastal terrace prairie and adjacent habitats. The single extant population, which was recently discovered, occurs on privately owned land near Point Arena in Mendocino County. The Alameda whipsnake ( Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus ) is a member of the Colubridae family (Morey and Bioassay 1988). It was described by William Reimer (1954) from a specimen collected in Berkeley Hills, Alameda County, California. The common name ``Alameda whipsnake'' is utilized in this proposed rule instead of ``Alameda striped racer'' that was used in the November 21, 1991, Animal Notice of Review (56 FR 58804). ``Whipsnake'' is a widely recognized common name for other members of the genus Masticophis (Stebbins 1985). The Alameda whipsnake is a slender, fast moving diurnal snake with a narrow neck and a relatively broad head with large eyes. The dorsal surface is colored sooty black or dark brown with a distinct yellow-orange stripe down each side. The anterior portions of the ventral surface are orange-rufous colored, the midsection is cream colored, and the posterior and tail are pinkish. The adults reach a length of 91 to 122 centimeters (3 to 4 feet). This subspecies is distinguished from the more common California whipsnake ( M. l. lateralis ) by its comparatively wide orange stripes, which run laterally down each side. The Alameda whipsnake inhabits the inner coast range in western and central Contra Costa and Alameda Counties (McGinnis 1992). One of the two major populations extends from approximately El Sorbante south to about Hayward. The second is found from Clayton/Mount Diablo southeast to the Vasco Road area. It occurs mostly on privately owned land, but also occurs on State and county land. The Alameda whipsnake usually is found in northern coastal scrub or chaparral, but it also may occur in adjacent habitats. This extremely fast-moving, lizard-eating specialist holds its head high off the ground in a cobra-like manner to peer over grass or rocks at potential prey. The Alameda whipsnake has been found to exhibit territorial behavior, possessing home ranges varying in size from 2 to 8.7 hectares (5.0 to 21.5 acres). Some animals have been recorded to have moved over 1 mile while traversing their areas (McGinnis 1992). The life history of the Alameda whipsnake is not well understood (Goldberg 1975, Hammerson 1978). A proposed rule to list the callippe silverspot butterfly as endangered with critical habitat was published on July 3, 1978 (43 FR 28938). The critical habitat portion of that proposal was withdrawn by the Service on March 6, 1979 (44 FR 12382), because of procedural and other substantive changes in the Endangered Species Act by the 1978 amendments. The Service again published a proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the callippe silverspot butterfly on March 28, 1980 (45 FR 20503). The proposed rule to list the callippe silverspot butterfly was withdrawn on September 30, 1980 (45 FR 64607), because the 1978 Endangered Species Act amendments required that the final rule for the species be completed within 2 years after the date of publication proposing to list it as endangered or threatened. The callippe silverspot butterfly was listed as a category 2 candidate species in the May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664), and January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), Animal Notices of Review. This category includes species that may be appropriate to list as endangered or threatened, but for which conclusive data on their biological vulnerability is not currently available to support proposed rules. The species was listed as a category 1 candidate species in the November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804), Animal Notice of Review because of increased threats from overcollecting (see Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section). This category includes taxa for which the Service has on file enough substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to propose listing them as endangered or threatened.
