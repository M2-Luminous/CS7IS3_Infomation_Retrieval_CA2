In a statement to a Ukrainian paper, the foreign minister mentioned as an example the fact that the Socialists, contrary to the six-party agreement, are urging a referendum about joining NATO. Geza Jeszenszky also criticized the MSZP for thinking that relations more balanced than the present ones are possible with Romania, Slovakia, and Serbia. According to the Hungarian Democratic Forum government member, the political directions and minority policies of these countries preclude rapprochement.
