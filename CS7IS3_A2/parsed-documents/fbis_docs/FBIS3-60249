Nagaoka University of Technology in Niigata Prefecture and Michigan State University in the United States jointly discovered the microbe, temporarily named Rh1, that could help solve the problem of how to safely dispose of the toxic chemical. Rh1, which propagates in soil, seems to be the most effective of the dozens of PCB-eating microbes that have been found since 1973, the members said. PCB is formed by dozens of constituent elements of chlorinated carbon compounds. Rh1 resolves most of the elements, whereas previously discovered PCB-consuming microbes break down only some of them, the researchers said. The team found the microbe in soil containing an agricultural chemical with a structure similar to PCB, they said. They confirmed the effectiveness of the bacteria in tests on low densities of PCB, said Masao Fukuda, an assistant professor at the Japanese institute. The group will try to upgrade Rh1 by gene recombination so that it can be used for high-density concentrations of PCB, and also examine if the byproducts of the bacterial action are safe, he said. PCB was used in a wide variety of industrial applications as a heating fluid and electrical insulator, but is no longer produced because it was found to be a poisonous environmental pollutant.
