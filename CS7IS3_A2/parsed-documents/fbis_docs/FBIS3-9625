Ladies and Gentlemen! First of all, I want to thank you for the honor of being able to speak at your center, which has gained worldwide recognition as an institution whose analyses, advice, and forecasts are attentively listened to, not just in Poland but also beyond its borders. So I expect my speech to contribute to a better understanding of concepts that are the current guidelines for the Ukrainian Government in its hard work aimed at strengthening a sovereign Ukraine in European international relations, and also that it will contribute to a better understanding of our approach to contemporary political realities. The restitution of the Ukrainian state, as the two years of its independent existence have shown, is taking place under extremely complicated external and domestic conditions. To a great extent, these conditions are a consequence of historical eruptions that took place in Europe in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Unfortunately, our expectations of speedy reforms and the unconditional acceptance of Ukraine into the European community of nations did not materialize. Also, our expectations of speedy assistance on the part of Western countries came across the fact that these countries, while undergoing serious crises in their own economies, were not able to come up with sufficient resources to support young and independent states, including Ukraine. It is also true that it would be a mistake not to see some prejudices and old-fashioned stereotypes in the politics of some countries. It was also difficult to predict that, along with the elimination of military and political confrontation between the two blocs, the world is not going to become a safer place, and the degree of predictability with regard to individual countries' behavior will not increase at all. Bloody conflicts are going on in various regions of the globe, which require much effort and many resources on the part of developed countries and the entire international community. International organizations whose goal was to maintain and assure peace are faced with new and unexpected challenges that force the world to change its approach to many problems that have, so far, not been unequivocally resolved. Ukraine does not exist in a vacuum, nor is it isolated from the world and these events. The complexity of the new situation in Europe and around the world required a constant search for ways of maneuvering so as to lead the country through the underwater reefs that emerge at points of disagreement among the countries of the world, as well as at points where different and sometimes contradictory interests and trends cross one another. There are also many specific domestic factors that do not make our situation any easier. You are aware, ladies and gentlemen, that Ukraine inherited, as a legacy of the former USSR, an industry that is oriented primarily to the production of products of the military-industrial complex, and also morally exploited technologies, completely amortized industrial equipment, the enormous burden of the Chernobyl disaster, as well as many other problems, the overcoming of which would be difficult for even the world's most developed countries. A whole list of objective and subjective reasons also led to a decline in production and a rise in inflation. Within the complicated economic situation, a constant shaping of Ukraine's internal political system is taking place. Currently, as never before, we are radically feeling the need for cardinal changes in the activities of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Of course, under conditions where mistakes simply cannot be avoided, many people find it hard to resist the temptation of making political capital. At the same time, representatives of a whole range of organizations, parties, and movements have been using the most disgraceful of methods: preying on national and religious feelings, applying completely unmotivated incitements to strike, and cultivating separatist ideas. But the Ukrainian nation and Government have already made the final choice. While not paying attention to any kind of obstacles, we will persistently follow the path of a return to all-human values, the creation of a state based on law, and the guaranteeing of human rights and freedoms; it is the path of democracy and economic transformations, a rebirth of Ukrainian culture with simultaneous legal guarantees of maintaining the independence of all national and ethnic minorities living in Ukraine. The fundamental principle of securing state independence and political sovereignty has been the basis for Ukraine's foreign policy doctrine from the very beginning. As one of the founding members of the United Nations, Ukraine declared its desire to shape and develop its relations with other countries in accordance with the UN Charter, decisions contained in the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference, the Paris Charter for New Europe, and other CSCE documents. Nonconditional observance of generally recognized norms of international law and nonapplication of any means of pressure or dictate whatsoever in international relations, acquired special importance in Ukraine's foreign policy. Taking the aforementioned principles as the basis, we wanted Ukraine's entry onto the international scene as a sovereign country to take place in the "softest" way possible, without interfering with relationships and connections existing in the international community. At the same time, Ukraine, due to many factors and reasons and aware of its role in the world, intends to achieve the place it rightly deserves among European countries. I would like our fundamental and priority-based approach to be well understood: Ukraine is an inherent and inseparable part of Europe, and that fact determines the philosophy and direction of our ideas on Ukraine's place and role in the contemporary world. Precisely because of that, overcoming the artificial separation of Ukraine from Europe, as well as overcoming the barriers which continue to exist and divide our not-too-big continent, is one of the most significant tasks of our independent policy. The policy is aimed at securing certain guarantees of Ukraine's external security, using experiences acquired by European democracies in the area of building a democratic society of law and order which would be an inseparable part of European political, legal, economic, material, and spiritual culture. A return to the practice of bilateral relations with other countries after a break of 70 years, is a fact which cannot be overestimated from the standpoint of building an independent and democratic Ukraine. At the same time, we view the European region as a whole, and as a common home for all nations and countries which live here. The full integration of Ukraine into all-European political, economic, cultural, and other kinds of associations, is our final goal. It is quite a natural thing that neighboring countries are of primary importance in that activity. That is why the fact that Russia, Poland, Hungary, Belarus, Moldova, the Slovak Republic, and Romania are our geographical neighbors, requires working out precisely this kind of policy, that is one of approaching them as neighbors with whom one wants to see peaceful coexistence, cooperation, and mutual respect. That is an objective reality and must be perceived precisely in that context. Speaking about bilateral relations, I would like to discuss separately Ukraine's relations with the Republic of Poland. We remember and we highly appreciate the fact that your country was the first foreign country to have recognized Ukraine's independence. After Ukraine gained its independence, relations between our two countries, which have a balance of common, European interests as their basis, entered a qualitatively new stage and right now we are fully entitled to describe them as relations of a strategic partnership. The decision to establish a Consultative Committee of the Presidents of Ukraine and the Polish Republic, which was made during the visit of Polish President L. Walesa to Ukraine, is proof that Poland also treats Polish-Ukrainian relations in an appropriate manner. The committee's activity includes analyzing and preparing proposals concerning a wide variety of issues which emerge in relations between Ukraine and Poland, as well as problems of the Central and East European region and international politics. Ukraine is a European country and in its desire to integrate with European political and economic structures in the most natural way possible, it is condemned to the necessity of developing multifaceted relations with European countries, with economically developed ones as priority, whose assistance Ukraine counts on in the current period, which is very complicated from the standpoint of making our economic and political independence permanent. The development of relations with Western European countries creates the necessary conditions for resuming Ukraine's political, economic, cultural, and spiritual ties with European civilization, as well as for speeding up the democratization process, the implementation of market reforms, and nursing the national economy back to health. At the same time, such cooperation will become a basis for widening Ukraine's participation in European structures and for the future integration of the Ukrainian economy into the European and world economic area. Access to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean determines other priorities in the area of regional cooperation, first of all with countries enjoying some authority, primarily with Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria. Our country attaches great importance to the development of mutually beneficial and effective bilateral relations with countries of the Asian and Pacific region which, due to its extremely high rate of economic and social development by a majority of countries in the region, has quite correctly been called the "region of the 21st century." The process of a practical shaping of partnership relations between Ukraine and countries of the Asian and Pacific region, has already begun and it is bringing results which can be felt as time passes--that is demonstrated first of all by the results of last year's official visits to Ukraine by state and government delegations (including at the highest level) from India, the People's Republic of China, Vietnam, and other countries. But it is with the year 1994 that we associate our special hopes linked to the implementation of enormous prospects for Ukraine's cooperation with countries of the Asian and Pacific region. Our relations of mutual understanding and cooperation with Japan and also with North and South Korea, are beginning to take the desired course. We regard the development of relations with countries of the Near and Middle East, as well as Africa, as one of the most important directions of Ukrainian foreign policy; these countries are gradually becoming our economic partners. The official visits by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to Egypt, Israel, and the Republic of Tunisia, are proof of our intentions and readiness to develop mutually beneficial cooperation with the countries of these regions. Our relations with the United States in military and political areas, are valuable to us; this applies in particular to common security and disarmament. But the priority nature of these relations is not just a consequence of that: Currently, economic cooperation with that huge country is important to Ukraine. As for our relations with Russia, they remain the main priority in Ukraine's relations with the outside world, and this is the way they will remain in the predictable future. Russia is our most important neighbor. Our approach to the development of these relations is defined in detail in "The Main directions of Ukrainian Foreign Policy." We understand that Russia is a special kind of partner to us and that is why we regard our relations as those of a special partnership. Of course, there are also many problems in the development of our relations, as we have seen during 1993, these problems were first of all caused by the fact that issues linked to the collapse of the former Soviet Union continue to be unresolved. This applies in particular to the problem of legal continuity, the property of the former USSR, as well as some others. Some constructive measures have been undertaken in that regard in the recent time period. We have always been saying--and we will continue to do so--that Ukraine is open to any proposals which would not conflict with our national interests, and these are the realities of our approach to the development of relations with Russia. We believe that compromises are certainly important; however, they must correspond to the fundamental interests of this or that state. It is understandable that the internal political situation that has now developed in Russia compels us to make some reflections. It may be necessary to work in not very favorable conditions; however, this will not change our view that we must work. We are ready for such work. I would like to emphasize once again, however, that real achievements in the development of Ukrainian-Russian relations may be made only if every political decision takes into account, to the maximum degree possible, the interests of both parties. Vital is the good will of both partners; the Ukrainian side exhibits such a good will. In the situation which has now developed in Russia and some other states of the CIS, also due to the conflicts which pose a real threat to peace and stability not only on the territory of the former Soviet Union, but also in all of East Europe, one can say that the 52 million Ukrainians are able to play and are already playing a serious stabilizing role throughout the post-Soviet areas. Therefore, one of our main priorities is supporting the process of strengthening stability and security, both in Europe and in our regional relations. Being aware of the importance of both regional and national activities for strengthening the stability and security in Europe, Ukraine confirmed its devotion to these goals by firmly starting along the road to achieving the status of a nonnuclear state. This is proven by the signing on 14 January of the well-known Trilateral Declaration by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, as well as the recent decision by the Supreme Council of Ukraine canceling the reservations included in the resolution on the ratification of START I. This exceptionally important decision paves the way for the practical implementation of the program of the gradual nuclear disarmament of Ukraine, as well as renders the overall situation in Europe and in the world more stable and predictable. Considering the principle of the indivisibility of international peace and security to be one of our main guides, in our foreign policy we defend the approach of "security for ourselves through security for everyone." Considering this principle to be the motto of contemporary European international relations, it is with particular responsibility that we approach one of the most important elements of the situation in Europe today--the ability of each European state, including those called "new democracies," not only to seek, but also create security. In this context, the role of Ukraine, as we understand it, is tremendously important because, as a consequence of Ukraine's regaining its statehood in Europe, a radically new geopolitical situation has developed. The establishment of a potentially powerful state, located in the geographical center of Europe, and its entry into the European community without any conflict should play a stabilizing role. Such a role certainly corresponds to the principles of Ukraine's foreign policy. Our diplomatic efforts concentrate on establishing and strengthening stable international mechanisms of security on the bilateral, subregional, regional, and global level. This task is rather difficult and it must be resolved in not-very-favorable surroundings, because when new independent states appeared, whose national interests have not been established and agreed upon yet, the old structural mechanisms, supporting stability and security, were practically destroyed. This produced the effect of the so-called security vacuum, which was felt by practically all the new democracies. Old threats and dangers were replaced by new ones. Bearing the above-mentioned facts in mind, Ukraine launched an initiative to create a zone of stability and security in Central and East Europe. This idea is to a certain extent convergent with the approach which was once proposed by Polish President L. Walesa, and then also by French Prime Minister E. Balladur. The most important element in our approach is that stability and instability cannot coexist for a long time without conflict. The stability of "traditional Europe" is supposed to become the stability of "the new Europe." Each participant should make serious efforts so that this can be achieved. Since the confrontation of military blocks in Europe has ceased to exist, especially important becomes the issue of establishing an all-European security structure on the basis of existing international organizations, such as CSCE, NATO, Council of North Atlantic Cooperation, and the Western European Union. We are convinced that only the direct membership of Ukraine in such a structure will provide it with indispensable guarantees of its national security. An important role in the strengthening of security in the CSCE region is played by NATO. Ukraine actively participates in the activities of its new organ--the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, the establishment of which was indisputably a logical and bold step. However, time is running out. Present-day challenges call for a new look at the concept of the activities, the role, and the place of NATO in Europe. A significant step in this direction was the acceptance of the "Partnership for Peace" program at the NATO summit in January. Ukraine expressed its readiness for active cooperation with NATO within this program, and I myself have recently had the honor to place my signature on the "Partnership for Peace" framework document. Thus, our country was the first CIS state to join this program. It was with understanding that Ukraine responded to this initiative, as one that does not introduce any new lines of division in Europe, leaves an open door to NATO, and is an instrument for gradually extending this organization for the purpose of shaping a new security system in Europe. At the same time we believe that it is extremely important and indispensable to resolve the problem of NATO's continuing search for its new role in the process of building the European security system and the problem of the organization's overcoming its "identity crisis" in the contemporary, postconfrontation Europe. Certainly the issue of ensuring stability and security in the new Europe is multidimensional and complex. It comprises elements of a military-political nature, as well as economic, social, cultural, humanitarian, and other areas. We understand that in all those directions, we must face very difficult tests. We also understand that the main burden of passing from the communist model of development to the European, democratic model will have to be carried by ourselves. At the same time, we expect that the importance of the tasks that we must face will encourage all of Europe to give some thought to the current situation and to understand the significance of uniting their efforts in the work of building a more secure and flourishing new Europe. Economic relations, both bilateral and multilateral, with European countries are of tremendous importance to us. As we worked on the concept of Ukraine's regional cooperation, we bore in mind the obvious necessity of "economizing" our contacts, increasing the commercial-economic aspect of Ukraine's participation in regional organizations. Only this road will be able to lead us to effective implementation of economic transformations of the country and to the transition to the market economy. Ukraine's firm goal is the development and deepening of comprehensive cooperation with the EC and gradual integration into the Pan-European economic zone. Right now we still need aid and support from the European Union and leading European financial establishments. We are aware of the fact that the full incorporation of Ukraine in the contemporary all-European process in all its dimensions calls for some time, considerable efforts, and an open request on the part of all the interested parties. We speak about the latter firmly and openly, taking into consideration our real possibilities and the results of the lasting integration of the economic and social systems within the former Soviet Union and the Council for Economic Mutual Assistance. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Ukraine not only wants to be incorporated into the integration processes in the West, but it also supports real, new integration processes in the East. It is most important to abandon, within those integration processes, the centralized system of controlling the economy, and to strengthen qualitatively new relations that are mutually favorable and effective. Right now in Ukraine, active preparations are under way for the adoption of a new constitution; soon we will hold practically the first democratic elections to the organs of the legislative authorities. A general strategy of the country's economic and political development is being defined. Despite great difficulties, fundamental elements of democracy and a socially oriented market economy are taking root in our social life. Moreover, Ukraine managed to maintain the most important things: peace and social, civic, and ethnic order. Today we can say with full responsibility that there is no alternative to democracy and economic reform for Ukraine. In the future, we see Ukraine as a democratic state with equal rights in a united Europe. We expect you to actively support this historical striving of ours. Thank you for your attention.
