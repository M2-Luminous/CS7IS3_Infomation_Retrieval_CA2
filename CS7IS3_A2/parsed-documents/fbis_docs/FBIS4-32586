But that is not a consequence of a change in political direction. Rather, the uncertainty can be attributed to the fact that the details of the new government's economic policy are still unknown. In the opinion of Jozsef Rotyis, international causes are behind the slow decline of share prices over an extended period. The Prague and the Warsaw exchanges, for instance, have suffered sharper declines of their share prices than the Budapest Stock Exchange has. On the other hand, the present slow correction is also a result of exaggerated expectations at the beginning of the year. Nevertheless, the managing director believes that waiting to see what the change of governments will bring is also a significant factor in the decline of the exchange's trading volume. This is not an exodus of foreign capital, but new investments usually are not initiated at times like this, he emphasized. Jozsef Rotyis expressed concern about ideas that are being voiced frequently nowadays--namely, that in privatization it is necessary to concentrate on finding strategic investors and, therefore, public offerings and privatization through the stock exchange will be playing a smaller role in the future. Which would mean that large financial investors would mostly shun privatization in Hungary and would turn to other countries in the region. To retain the presence of these large investors in the Hungarian stock market, domestic small investors must also be attracted to a greater extent, because only that can ensure the stock market's liquidity. However, the stock exchange expects foreign investment to become more lively once the uncertainties regarding the new government's economic policy have subsided. An indication of this is a report in last Friday's WALL STREET JOURNAL to the effect that George Soros's investment fund, which manages several hundred million dollars, is about to embark on a more active investment policy in Central Europe. And the managing director of the Budapest Stock Exchange believes that other investors will be following in Soros's footsteps.
