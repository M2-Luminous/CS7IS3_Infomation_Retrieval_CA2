Certain well-informed sources, preferring to remain anonymous, sent our newspaper the text of a letter by IAEA Director Hans Blix to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk summarizing the results of the work done by the experts of his organization. We have the opportunity to acquaint our readers with almost the full text of this letter that is of great interest. Here it is (the original style is preserved): "...documented were numerous shortcomings in ensuring safety at the operational nuclear units. Particular concern is aroused by specific problems connected with the obsolete design of the old-type No. 1 reactor that are still waiting to be resolved... "Experts have also pointed to a number of factors that, when combined, effect the overall safety situation. Difficult work conditions and a substantial steady drain of qualified professionals represent a big problem. In addition, a limited possibility to purchase common equipment results in a deficiency of necessary spare parts. "The most serious problem established by the experts is the accelerated deterioration of the `Shelter' at the No. 4 reactor unit. The destruction of this unit, if it were to take place, would complicate safety conditions of operational units and produce grave ecological consequences. "Although fully aware of the magnitude of the economic crisis that Ukraine confronts, I consider it my duty to bring to your attention that international safety norms are currently not met in Chernobyl. Given the graveness of the present situation, you might want to convene a meeting with the concerned countries to discuss what measures could be taken to improve the situation..."
