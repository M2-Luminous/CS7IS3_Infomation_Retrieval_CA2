Speaking at a press conference, he was commenting on the rejection of the place name bill by the Slovak Parliament on June 3. Egyutteles deputies pointed to the statement made by Premier Jozef Moravcik on Monday [6 June] that tomorrow coalition talks would decide on the further fate of the "place name" bill. They said that it is possible that a new deputies' bill could be presented and discussed by parliament in June or July. With the law rejected, one of Slovakia's commitments to the Council of Europe still remains unfulfilled. Although the government coalition, backed by ethnic Hungarian parties, has a clear majority in parliament, only 67 deputies voted for the bill, while 61 were against and six abstained. A single vote was missing for the bill to be rejected. [as received] Two Egyutteles deputies abstained from the vote, and one even voted against. Miklos Feher, one of the above three Hungarian deputies, insisted that on the very day of the vote representatives of ethnic Hungarian groups of deputies (those of Egyutteles and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, MKDH, which have 9 and 5 members respectively in the 150-seat parliament) agreed on behalf of their groups not to support the bill if a proposal by an independent deputy that villages named after figures from Slovak history be not allowed to bear Hungarian names was accepted. A law in such a compromise form would be "discriminatory and anti-democratic", Feher said. The towns and villages in southern Slovakia were named after significant Slovak figures only after February 1948 (the communist putsch in Czechoslovakia) and their present names are the expression of "cruel re-Slovakisation", and have no historical ground, he added. Feher stressed that the ethnic Hungarian deputies, who had decided to back the bill, had changed their opinion "five minutes before the vote". Deputy Arpad Duka-Zolyomi, who had voted in favour of the bill, said that not only Hungarian deputies were to be blamed for the result of the vote. "The roots of the failure must be sought in the government coalition," he said. Besides the absence of twelve coalition deputies and the fact that three coalition representatives did not support the bill, the negative result was also due to the "unfulfilled promise by the coalition", which failed to prevent the adoption of proposals for changes deforming the initial government bill.
