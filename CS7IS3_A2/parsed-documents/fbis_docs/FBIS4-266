He warned that any village that will be found to have instigated violence of any order will be fined heavily, apart from other legal measures being taken against them. The president told the two communities, the Kalenjin and the Kikuyu, living in Burnt Forest to also form youth groups who will be the watchdog of the villagers. The president explained that the recent clashes in the area erupted when two Kikuyu youths hurled a grenade at two Kalenjin youngsters who fortunately were not killed. He said following the attack, the police arrested the attackers but some people took the law into their hands and sparked off tribal animosity which led to the clashes. The president told the wananchi [citizens] in the area to abide by the law and report to the security agents whenever they are aggrieved, so that investigations could be carried out. President Moi instructed the police to hunt down some few people who are known to have incited the people by spreading falsehood. The president cautioned the Wananchi against being incited to fight one another, saying that in the long run, they and their children will be the sufferers. President Moi particularly took a swipe at the DAILY NATION newspaper for fanning tribal animosity in the area by publishing false reports. President Moi said the media in the country should play a more responsible role of promoting a harmonious coexistence among the different communities in the country. The president also called on the churches to preach to the people the importance of maintaining peace, instead of using the pulpit to criticize the government and making inflammatory statements.

He explained that there are some people who have run away with their household goods to seek sympathy, claiming that their houses had been burnt when that was not the case. He said no one should be allowed to create the impression that some communities were being chased away from Burnt Forest and urged all the people in the area to return to their farm. By a show of hands, the people in Burnt Forest assured the president that they were for peace and will cooperate with all those concerned to ensure that normalcy resumed. President Moi, at the same time, called on all leaders from the Burnt Forest and the surrounding areas to hold barazas [meetings] and emphasize to the people the need to live harmoniously.
