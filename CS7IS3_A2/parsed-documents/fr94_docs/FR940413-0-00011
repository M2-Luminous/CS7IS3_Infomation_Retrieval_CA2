FR940413-0-00011 FR940413-0-00002 Section 1610.11␣Prepayments Comment Summary: One commenter suggested that paragraph (b) be changed to conform with the language of the RE Act. Others commented that the elimination of prepayment premiums should apply to all outstanding RTB loans, not just those approved after November 1, 1993. Response: REA believes the language in this provision of the interim rule correctly interprets RELRA's amendment to section 408(b)(8) of the RE Act. All RTB loan agreements entered into before November 1, 1993, contain a prepayment premium provision. That prepayment premium policy was determined by the RTB Board of Directors. The original prepayment policy was established by the RTB Board of Directors on February 10, 1972, and later revised on May 3, 1984. RELRA eliminated the premiums only on loans approved after November 1, 1993. Further, a provision to eliminate the prepayment premium for RTB loans approved before November 1, 1993, was initially included in an early draft of the legislation but was eventually removed. Section 1735.10␣General Comment Summary: With regard to REA's use of borrower-funded consultants (paragraph (e)), one organization commented that while the interim rule follows the legislation, many question the intent, usage and unfair advantages such activity could bring to small companies with little or no capital resources. Response: REA recognizes these concerns; however, the option of hiring a consultant is necessary in order to adhere to the provision of the legislation. In accordance with the legislation, the Administrator is authorized to accept funds voluntarily provided by a borrower to be used to obtain assistance from third party experts in the review of a loan application. The purpose of this provision is to assist in the expeditious review of numerous loan applications given limited REA manpower and resources. The Administrator intends that the telephone loan programs be administered in a fair and impartial manner. Comment Summary: With regard to paragraph (b), one organization commented that the language ``in REA's opinion'' should be deleted from the final rule because REA does not possess the authority which this reference implies to deny loans without a factual basis. Response: This language was included to insure that (1) the main objectives of the RE Act (i.e., provide service to the widest practical number of rural subscribers), and (2) the provisions of the borrower's modernization plan will be carried out by borrowers of REA telephone loans. REA will not deny a loan without a factual basis. If the purposes of a loan are not consistent with the goals of the modernization plan for the borrower's State, then REA will deny the loan. This determination will be based on the modernization plan requirements and objectives provided in §1751.106. However, REA has considered that strict conformity to the requirements of a borrower's modernization plan could result in loans that would not be economically or technically feasible. REA has expanded §1735.10(b) to take into consideration these situations when making loans. Section 1735.17␣Facilities Financed Comment Summary: One organization commented that the interim rule correctly recognizes that under the legislation certain facilities and purposes will not be financed depending on the type of loan. The commenter further stated that the background statement fails to acknowledge that RTB loans will still be made for section 201 loan purposes and that loans that fall into the restricted purpose category are the new cost-of-money loans. Response: See the response to the comment on §1610.1. Section 1735.22␣Loan Security Comment Summary: One commenter objected to the Times Interest Earned Ratio (TIER) maintenance requirement stating that REA is without authority to impose such requirement, and that the TIER range established in the legislation as eligibility criteria is adequate to protect loan security. Also, that the 1.75 TIER level is arbitrary. Response: The TIER criteria put forth in the legislation determines the borrower's loan eligibility, it does not imply that risks to loan security are nonexistent if the borrower meets the eligibility criteria. Using the TIER eligibility range for maintenance purposes would require the borrower to maintain a minimum TIER of only 1.0. Allowing the borrower to maintain net margins at a level sufficient only to cover interest expenses does not offer much financial security nor assure credit quality. However, during the forecast period (i.e., construction period) when interest expenses are higher and associated revenues are not yet realized the borrower can maintain a TIER of 1.0. Afterwards, the TIER maintenance requirement merely requires the borrowers to maintain the TIER predicted by the projections given to REA by the borrower and on which REA relied on making the loan, but not to exceed 1.75. The TIER maintenance requirement provides some assurance of adequate loan security without placing an additional burden on the borrower. In fact, more than 93 percent of REA borrowers have existing TIERS of 1.75 or greater. This standardized maintenance requirement is needed because the new eligibility requirements rendered the previous maintenance requirement inequitable and obsolete. As a Federal lending institution, REA has the responsibility to protect the Government's security interest.
