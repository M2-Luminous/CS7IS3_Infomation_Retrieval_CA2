In March last year, North Korea announced that it would quit the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). North Korea has since used its "nuclear card" to force the United States to hold a dialogue with it and push the international community around while holding up its actual withdrawal from the NPT. The Korean peninsula has been a zone where superpower interests have clashed. The Koreans have a history of the superpowers defying their will and their nation's existence was denied. They have a deep-rooted desire to get neighboring superpowers to pay attention to the Korean peninsula and get them to listen to what they advocate. North Korea aims to have U.S. Forces withdrawn from South Korea. President Kim Il-song's basic perception is that South Korea is occupied by U.S. Forces. The president has consistently asserted that the only way to end the division on the Korean peninsula is to make direct deals with the United States. In that sense, the "nuclear" is his most effective trump card. Kang In-tok, head of the Far East Affairs Research Institute in Seoul, South Korea, who is well versed with North Korean affairs, has said: "For North Korea, the nuclear issue is a 'strategy for survival'." North Korea is said to be suffering serious economic stagnation and if the present situation continues, it would be hard for North Korea to keep its present system in place. Kang also has explained that North Korea intends to use the "nuclear card" to receive economic aid from the United States after normalizing relations with the United States and obtain a U.S. guarantee for the maintenance of its system. Many North Korea watchers in Seoul have pointed out that "North Korea is serious about developing nuclear weapons." Their common analysis is that North Korea aims to 1) reverse its inferiority in conventional war capability over South Korea; 2) tighten the grip on its system that is being shaken by food shortages; and, 3) spurn outside pressure. North Korea recently removed fuel rods at an experimental atomic reactor in defiance of the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] demand for halting their removal at the expense of the third round of the U.S.-North Korea high-level talks. A diplomatic source in Seoul has said: "North Korea did so because it was intent on developing nuclear weapons." Yun Tok-min, a professor at the South Korean Foreign Ministry Diplomacy and Security Research Institute, has analyzed: "North Korea abruptly strained the situation on the Korean peninsula in an attempt to "make the United States acknowledge the inevitability of allowing North Korea to have one or two atomic bombs." He also has said North Korea might believe that the Clinton administration would give in to its threats. The North Korean Foreign Ministry abruptly announced North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA on 13 June, dealing a sharp body blow to brisk moves toward slapping sanctions against North Korea. The announcement did not use the term "North Korea's withdrawal from the NPT" and the announcement is taken as part of North Korea's operations aimed at holding talks with the United States. The prevailing view is that "at present, the top priority task for North Korea is to prepare for a succession from President Kim Il-song to Secretary Kim Chong-il and the possibility is slim that North Korea will opt for war, which could result in its collapse" (says a Seoul-based expert on North Korea). Some experts on North Korea take the view that if economic sanctions are imposed against North Korea, North Korea would make some concessions for fear that the sanctions may deal it a fatal blow. Will North Korea aim to normalize relations with the United States without giving up its nuclear program? If the Kim Il-song regime aims to achieve these two incompatible goals, it would further deepen its international isolation.
