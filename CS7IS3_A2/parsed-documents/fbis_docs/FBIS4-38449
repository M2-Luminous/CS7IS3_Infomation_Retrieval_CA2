Georgian units tried to drive Abkhazians out of their positions overnight, but were repelled, it added. The village of Lata again became the strategic point for which the conflicting sides are fighting. The Georgian forces which were pushed up into the mountains want to seize it for a further offensive down into Abkhazia. Abkhazians, naturally, are defending the stronghold. Military experts predict that combat activities will intensify in the gorge soon as the important location provides an access to the Black Sea. The forecasts are proved by several days of artillery preparations by Georgian forces.
