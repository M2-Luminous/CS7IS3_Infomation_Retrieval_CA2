FBIS4-7918 "dreeu068__a94005" FBIS-EEU-94-068-A Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Assembly Vote on VAT Act Amendments Detailed Assembly Vote on VAT Act Amendments Detailed AU0704092394 Sofia BTA in English 1831 GMT 6 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0704092394 Sofia BTA English BFN [Excerpts] Sofia, April 6 (BTA) -- Today parliament defeated both bills on amendments to the Value-Added Tax [VAT] Act which came into effect on April 1. The mass media demanded that newspapers, advertisements in them and Bulgarian books be exempted from VAT. One of the bills was moved by Yuriy Borisov and Ivo Atanasov, MP's of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party]. Under it Bulgarian scientific and fiction books and newspapers with the exception of porn publications would be exempted from the 18 percent VAT for a period of three years. The other bill was moved by MP of the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] Lyubomir Pavlov; under it advertisements in the mass media would also be exempt from this tax. The Borisov-Atanasov bill was defeated 111-65; the Pavlov bill was killed 140-27. According to Miss Velislava Dureva, MP of the BSP, the secret ballot was prompted by media threats that MP's who vote against the amendments would from now on be totally ignored by the press. Before the plenary sitting Mr. Petur Balabanov, MP of the BSP, told reporters that the parliamentary BSP (holding 99 of the 240 seats) had decided to back the Borisov-Atanasov bill. The New Union for Democracy (16 seats) had similar intentions, voiced by its co-chairman Stefan Bozhilov two weeks ago. As to the parliamentary SDS (87 seats), its attitude was officially declared at a plenary sitting by Mr. Ivan Kostov. It backed the proposal of the Budget and Finance Committee but it was not moved in the form of a bill and could not be put to the vote. The Budget Committee suggested that newspapers do not register for VAT purposes until the end of this year and be further charged 10 percent turnover tax. The parliamentary DPS [Rights and Freedoms Movement] was not unanimous, said Mr. Hasan Ali before the plenary sitting. They finally decided that everyone should follow the dictates of his own conscience. The independents also failed to take a clear stand. Its members would vote differently, said Mr. Ruslan Semerdzhiev. The two bills were not put to the vote at the end of last week for lack of quorum. [passage omitted] If passed by Parliament, the exemption of newspapers, magazines and Bulgarian literature from VAT would cost the national budget no more than 50-70 million leva a year, said the chairman of the Parliamentary Economic Committee, Mr. Asen Michkovski. Although parliament's regulations provide for both open and secret ballot, the choice of the latter for a bill, and at first reading at that, sets a precedent in our parliamentary practice, he pointed out. After that parliament went on to pass parts of the Judiciary Organization Act at second reading and debated amendments to the Incomes Tax Act at second reading.
