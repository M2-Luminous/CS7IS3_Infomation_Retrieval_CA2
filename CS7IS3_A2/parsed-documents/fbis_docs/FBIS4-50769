The two sides will exchange opinions on furthering bilateral cooperation in the four areas. Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin will co-chair the meeting. China and Russia are neighbors highly complementary to each other in terms of economy and enjoy economic and trade cooperation in many fields, according to Geng Xuncai, deputy director of the European Affairs Department of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC). He said that bilateral economic and trade ties are developing rapidly, with last year's trade volume reaching 7.7 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 31 percent over 1992. In addition, means of bilateral economic and trade are diversifying with the development of barter trade, cash trade, compensation trade, entrepot trade, leasing, project engineering and labor services. He said that the Chinese Government maintains an active attitude towards the development of Sino-Russian trade and such cooperation has a bright prospect. In general trade, using its main foreign trade channels such as large trade corporations, the Chinese side will seize the opportunity to press for a gradual shift from the dominant barter trade to cash trade with involvement of all foreign trade means. He said that the Chinese side will continue to stress the role of border and regional economic and trade cooperation, further strengthening administration over such cooperation and the standardization of commodities inspection, in a bid to better facilitate the development of such cooperation and two-way investment. In scientific and technological cooperation, he said that China hopes for extending cooperation to such high-tech fields as aviation, space technology, medical sciences, chemical industry and machine-building. He added that the problem of communications constitutes an obstacle in bilateral trade, hoping that the two countries will make full use of land transportation, along with the proper development of sea transportation. He said that he believes the coming meeting will accelerate the development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
