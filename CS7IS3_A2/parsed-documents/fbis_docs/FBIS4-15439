FBIS4-15439 "drsov068_v_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Lithuania Presidential Adviser Notes `Tension' Presidential Adviser Notes `Tension' WS0704182694 Tallinn BNS in English 1648 GMT 7 Apr 94 WS0704182694 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Vilnius, Apr 07, BNS -- Russia's intentions to create military bases in Latvia and countries of the CIS "can hurt the fragile agreement between Russia and Latvia on the Skrunda radar base," Justas Paleckis, foreign policy adviser to the Lithuanian president, said Thursday [7 April]. Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree April 5 suggesting Foreign and Defense ministries to create bases in Latvia and the CIS for testing new weapons systems. Paleckis said he hasn't seen the official text of the decree yet, but if media reports are precise enough, the Russian leader's decision can create tension in Baltic-Russian relations. The presidential adviser said the decree contradicts Brazauskas' view that the Baltic coast should be free of arms in the future. Paleckis said the idea was mentioned in the Lithuanian president's speech at the United Nations last year. Paleckis said military bases in foreign countries is an international practice, "but everything depends on historic circumstances and agreement between states, while the historic circumstances for Russia's military return to the Baltic states are unfavorable in this case."
