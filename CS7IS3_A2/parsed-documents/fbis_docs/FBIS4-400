Our editorial department has learned this from an informal but very reliable source. Thus the go-ahead has been given for the evacuation of our fellow countrymen from Rwanda. All afternoon the airport remained closed to Belgian planes. The Rwandan soldiers were blocking the runway with armored vehicles. The Belgian Embassy had started negotiations with the Rwandan authorities to have the airport opened, apparently with success.
