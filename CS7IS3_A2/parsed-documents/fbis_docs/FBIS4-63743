They were published in today's newspaper. [Shkurenko] The vice prime minister told representatives of the press how these decrees were drawn. A week ago during a six-hour long conversation between the president and the head of the cabinet of ministers measures for stabilizing the economy and continuing reforms were examined. Then the government drew up a package of documents, which were discussed during Boris Yeltsin's meeting with managers and Viktor Chernomyrdin's meeting with representatives of enterprises, banking, and economic structures who were participating in the signing of the Public Accord Treaty. At the present time draft decrees are being drawn up relating to regulation of the consumption fund, improving banking activity, on some issues regarding the regulation of the securities' market, protecting of consumers from dishonest advertising and on the sale of enterprises that are in debt. Regarding the latter it will probably be signed literally today or tomorrow. Regarding the decrees that have already been signed by the President, Shokhin said the following: [Shokhin] I would like to draw your attention to the fact that in this package of documents there are many openly liberal premises connected with reducing taxes. We were pursuing two aims simultaneously: to ease the tax burden while at the same time enforcing tax discipline more strictly. No one can dispute that this is a normal demand. As the enterprises begin to get out of this situation, if they want to obey the law, bearing in mind that the general policy of the government has been defined here as that of reducing taxes, either they want to test how firm the strict measures that are indicated in the decrees are, and the future will show, and the experience of many countries shows, that in conditions of sufficiently lenient taxes, they pay much better than they evade tax, and we will gradually move toward that. If enterprises will have many accounts and are failing to provide information that they are not registering their accounts at least, there can be no question of help for those enterprises from the budget, of centralized investments. The problem of abolishing quotas is in actual fact the problem of stabilizing our export-orientated production facilities. That mechanism allows us to stabilize the situation in the oil and gas complex, metallurgy, cellulose, and paper production. Many clauses in the decrees that came out yesterday were already registered back in March, in particular. They were even submitted to the State Duma. On the other hand, a certain critical mass is needed not only in the number of decrees, but also in the number of clauses contained in them to impart additional impulses to the reforms. The critical mass, it seems, is present in that package of decrees.
