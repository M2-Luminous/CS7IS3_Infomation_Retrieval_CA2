Dogan Gures are totally absolutely unnecessary, untimely and inappropriate when there are still four months until Gures's time of duty is up. In a written statement, Demirel said that when the time comes, necessary procedures will be done following the government's proposition and in line with the Constitution and the laws. "However," he said, "that will be a posting and not an approval. The power of accepting the government's proposal belongs to the president." Demirel said in the statement that the Turkish Republic is a constitutional and legislative state, where everyone's duty and authority is determined by the Constitution and the laws. "The chief of staff's appointment and the procedure when his duty ends, are all determined by the Constitution and the laws," he said, adding that clauses number 117 and 104 give the power to appoint the chief of staff to the president. "The presidency represents the high commander at the Turkish Armed Forces [TAF] in the name of the Grand National Assembly," he said, adding these speculations can hurt the TAF, and they should be stopped. "I would like all to know that when the time comes, everything necessary will be done in line with the Constitution and the laws," he concluded. A scandal broke out in the society this week when a man listened to a three-way telephone conversation between Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and two cabinet members. The conversation, recorded because one of the ministers was talking from the telephone in his car, was issued in one of the dailies. In the conversation, Ciller was asking her ministers to make necessary arrangements to extend the duty of Chief of Staff General Gures for another year. On Friday, a written statement published by the Prime Minister's Office said that the polemics concerning the issue have been continuing in certain circles and the press, adding the power for duty extension of the chief of staff, General Dogan Gures, belongs totally to the political authority. Earlier the same day, President Suleyman Demirel said that he was the one who will say the last say on the extension of the duty of General Gures.
