[Janicina] Mr. Borovsky, the new chairman of the Union of Industry, sent me a letter in which he insists that each privatization project be discussed with his organization. I do not know how they got this idea because the Union of Industry has no jurisdiction over these matters. In the same letter, Mr. Borovsky expressed the view that the ideal share of companies' property earmarked for coupon privatization would be 5-10 percent. Everything suggests that, like Economy Minister Peter Magvasi, he would recommend privatization by the management in most cases. I am not principally opposed to this, but there should be no payment in installments in such cases; the money must be put on the table. Even Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova agrees with me on this point. [Stulajter] Although at first glance this looks like a problem of the privatization concept and privatization techniques, it cannot be ruled out that, on the hidden plane, it is primarily a political problem. [Janicina] This cannot be ruled out. For example, I have reservations about the term "tried-and-tested management" because what we are talking about are, to a smaller or greater degree, communist cadres who are trying to gain economic and, subsequently, also political power. On the other hand, there should be no generalization. I realize that there are factories that will fall on their face if their management leaves. When the management is competent and able to pay, it is a contender like any other, from my point of view. I do not have the right to discriminate against people in privatization only because they are members of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] or because they were in the communist party in the past, and I am not going to discriminate against them. As for the concept of privatization, the fact remains that some SDL representatives regard coupon privatization as property distribution, which is not the task of this government, in their opinion. From my viewpoint, coupon privatization is, first and foremost, privatization. [Stulajter] The last amendment to the law on large-scale privatization increased the powers of your ministry. Under this amendment, the ministry can determine the terms, extent, and method of privatization. Are you determined to use your powers in extreme situations, defying the "resistance" of other government departments and various interest lobbies? [Janicina] I intend to use but not abuse those powers. This means that whenever different views on some matters arise in the government, I will prefer talks to confrontation. One has to listen even to those who view things differently.
