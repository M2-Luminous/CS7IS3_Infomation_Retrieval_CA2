At various intervals, but on the basis of one pattern, we find out about the possible official prospects of certain individuals. The authorities sometimes call these reports rumors or provocations, or use the more refined word "leaks." Perhaps none of the current high-ranking officials is bypassed, but there is no point in talking about politicians who have retired. Are leaks of information a necessary instrument for presidential power? What is your attitude to this? [Filatov] You have broached an important question. Because the spread of rumors about cadre changes in the top sphere of power is now virtually being turned into a system. I would even say that leaks of information have become an instrument of political power. I would stress: a weapon in political infighting, but by no means an attribute of presidential power. The desire of any government to know how society will react to proposed actions by the authorities is understandable and explicable. A lot of civilized methods for gathering information at the stage of the formation of a plan or any steps exist for this purpose. And we know of examples where certain decisions were modified as a result of such a social verification, bided their time, or else simply never appeared. This is quite normal. It is another matter when nothing has happened and yet there is a "leak" of information.... I think that this method has unfortunately started being used extensively recently, indeed with purely opportunistic aims. [Kucher] Sometimes this bears fruit.... [Filatov] In that case I would talk about something else, something more important. Any phenomenon must be tested, to see whether it is to society's benefit or to its detriment. Any action by the authorities intensifies people's faith in them or else, conversely, destroys trust in them. I generally believe that you should be extremely careful in dealing with preliminary information. As for using it to selfish political ends, that is all the more immoral. Because when a person is schooled in this system of "idle" intercourse, in this lifeless pattern of work with him, then the authorities increasingly lose moral substance in his eyes. And that is terrible, because we could obtain a situation whereby there will be no faith in official documents. People will inclined to identify truth with rumor and not accept what is really happening. That is why I have a very negative attitude to immoral methods of checking people's reactions. But we sometimes call routine procedures by the wrong name. For instance, a document which is intended for official use has to be circulated. An ordinary aspect of work is thus sometimes set up as an enforced leak of information. Immunity is willy-nilly built up in respect of the actual term "leak." No wonder that the sense of rejection is weakened in a real "leak" which plays the role of political intrigue. There is also another side to the question. Those about whom the rumors are being spread must also be protected. This is not just a question of the fact that people are very vulnerable and handle rumors about themselves very badly. Besides, I see the authorities' ability to protect a person against lies as a display of their moral character. Although, of course, it is equally dangerous for society to create an imaginary aura of infallibility and sanctity around officials. [Kucher] Does it not seem to you that similar outlines can been seen in almost all subjects concerning recent cadre policy? It works out that the change of cadres comes first, and then a belated and vague explanation of the true reasons for it. So only one conclusion tends to suggest itself willy-nilly: It means that some kind of bureaucratic games are going on here, which have nothing to do with state interests. And since that is the case, it looks as though the authorities are losing touch with the people.... [Filatov] The first thing that I would like to stress is that cadre policy, generally speaking, is only just beginning to take shape. The president has created a Cadre Policy Council. It includes representatives of all the structures which have a direct bearing on this matter. There are three commissions, two of which are already working. One of them is headed by Justice Minister Yu.Kh. Kalmykov. This commission puts forward candidacies for judges, whom the president either appoints himself or presents to the Federation Council. The second commission examines the possible award of military ranks and posts. It is led by presidential aide Yu. Baturin. There is also a third commission, which has not started working yet: Its duties include selecting candidates for top official posts in various Russian missions abroad -- excluding ambassadors, since they are appointed by the president as a result of consultations with the Federal Assembly. In this way, the first step has been taken toward moving the problem of appointing cadres in the top echelon of power out of the direct influence of bureaucratic structures. And I think that, if the process of deregulating cadre appointments and reshuffles proceeds along a normal path, then suspicions will be removed. I will say frankly that a colossal shortage of cadres is to be perceived in the country, particularly for the leading components of the administration. After all, you can see for yourselves that the same people are revolving in the orbit of power all the time. It looks as though we cannot manage without any serious or profound training of cadres capable of operating in the new market conditions. This problem is being widely discussed in the Kremlin right now. If we have a good reserve and a normal system for training cadres, particularly for the top leadership personnel, then, no doubt, the basis for the dramatic situations which we frequently come up against will disappear. [Kucher] How do you explain the rather frequent change of characters in the official political arena? A shortage of cadres? [Filatov] Not only that. Society's socioeconomic morale and the results of internecine struggle among the political forces also affect the frequency of cadre changes. That is precisely what makes the cadre structure in the state unstable. Actually, I believe that this is a temporary phenomenon in the current conditions, because it is sometimes possible to reach compromises by means of cadre reshuffles. And a compromise in politics makes it possible to ease tension in society and leads to a stabilization in the situation. How it is reached is another matter. Or, more precisely, how it is greeted in certain political circles. Not everyone has fully understood and accepted the presidential powers in terms of cadre policy. His opportunities are determined by the Constitution. But some people would like to see this as an excessive strengthening of personal power. The president does have, for example, the right to release or appoint a government member on the premier's submission. But he also has the right to appoint a person by his own decision to a leading post even if he is not a government member. It is particularly pointless to dramatize the situation when the president releases, moves, or dismisses someone from service, sometimes for reasons known only to himself. Sometimes people lose sight of the fact that, when the people elected the president, they voted not just for the personality of the politician but also the statesman, who has a program which must be implemented. That is why the key posts in the president's entourage must be occupied by people who have the same political orientation as him. If someone in that team is out of step with the chosen aim, makes mistakes, gets confused, or betrays it -- this has also happened -- then naturally the president parts company with him. It is another matter when a person only finds out about a decision concerning his future from a newspaper or radio report. But here the blame is to be laid at the door of those charged with reporting on adopted decisions before they are announced, and that includes me. [Kucher] Does President Boris Yeltsin need obedient officials to carry things out or active people with a clearly defined commitment? [Filatov] The president forms the cadre policy of the Russian state, proceeding on the basis that this is a qualitatively different state. So the top stratum of administrators must be qualitatively different. Only professionals can work in certain sections, and in certain places professionalism must be supplemented by persons with a clear-cut political orientation. Policy is determined by the president, which means that those who help him to do this and are directly in his team, are also political figures. [Kucher] Are we to hope that there will no longer be a place for favorites in the presidential team?... What principles lie at the heart of the new line in cadre policy? [Filatov] First of all, professionalism. Second, the capability for long-term hard work, and, naturally, solidarity with the president's line. [Kucher] So what about independence of thought? [Filatov] Yes, that too. Until a decision is adopted, you can discuss and analyze. Apart from the Staff apparatus, the president has various formations: the Presidential Council, the Security Council, the Expert Analytical Council, this Council for Cadre Policy, and the recently formed Council for Social Policy. A number of commissions are in operation. The president does not work alone but is surrounded by an intellectual and professional elite. That is where arguments go on, views collide, a concept of reform is elaborated. Believe me, the people there are not all of the same opinion. But it is only the president who adopts a decision, taking all opinions and approaches into account. [Kucher] Let us take the Sergey Shakhray case. I would like to know how the new principles of cadre policy have operated with respect to him. [Filatov] I do not want to talk about that subject for ethical reasons. [Kucher] The qualities of the cadre corps surrounding the president in many respects leave their mark on the mechanism for elaborating presidential decisions. Are there any rules according to which their elaboration proceeds? [Filatov] The process of preparing a decision does not proceed according to one technological diagram. A plan of action is drawn up. The government proposes something, and something else comes from the State-Legal Administration as well as the president's assistants and the ministries and departments. The concept of future documents must be discussed by the interested parties, and sometimes proceeds directly from Boris Nikolayevich. He is very active both at the moment when the document comes into being and in the period when it is to be signed. [Kucher] The opinion exists in society that the president's reaction to topical events in the country is sometimes belated and sometimes not commensurate with their significance.... [Filatov] If there is such an opinion, than we must listen to it. However, I believe that the president's reaction does correspond to the degree of the event's importance. In the final analysis it is he who decides how to do this -- in writing or orally -- and when to react, who should speak -- the press secretary, the foreign minister, the president himself, or a particular state employee. So that strictly speaking from the viewpoint of reacting to events which are generally significant to the country I believe that everything is in order here. Maybe the content of such information is not always detailed, but that is another matter. [Kucher] There is no presidential party in the country at the moment, and at the same time we know of unsuccessful attempts to create one. I remember the president's recent statement at the democratic forum, to the effect that if such a party were to be created, he would be the first to join it... What is the state of affairs in this sphere at the moment? [Filatov] I think that a party should be created. We are living in an excessively dynamic situation, whereby various movements and blocs are simply not managing to develop a normal party structure and party activity, but elections have to be held. Of course we need such a party.... This question is being raised by many imminent politicians and public figures. [Kucher] What kind of a party will it be? [Filatov] Most likely it will correspond to the type of state we are building. And reflect the style of its development and its aim. It must be a social democratic party. In any case, this is what determines the president's activity, it seems to me. At least the years of his struggle against the communist ideology draw a picture of a social democratic type of state. That is precisely what is enshrined in the new Constitution -- a federative, democratic, rule-of-law, social state. [Kucher] Can you see a place for yourself in the state party? [Filatov] I would not refuse to support such a party or be in it. [Kucher] Sergey Aleksandrovich, I ask everyone I talk to this question, and I would like to know your opinion: What are we building here? [Filatov] It seems to me that we do not have to attach any kind of ideological adjective to our state. Then everything falls into place. Sometimes people say: There is no common idea in the country, no ideology of reform. That is not true. We want to our state to be democratic. Have we achieved this? Not at the moment. But we have freely elected the president and the Federal Assembly. Local self-government is being created. We are fighting for freedom of information and freedom of the press. And you cannot say that there has been no success in this. The world recognizes the fact. And take our courts. They have already started protecting constitutional human rights, although of course we are still at the beginning of the path and through force of momentum are still doing a lot of things in an administrative way, responding to people's letters and complaints. We are in favor of laws' taking precedence over the will of officials. Here too there is no end of work to be done. In a normal rule-of-law state several thousand normative acts are in operation, but here, as I see it, we do not even have one thousand yet. At the moment a lot depends on the personality of the administrator, his abilities and talent to predict and solve problems. That is why the slogan "cadres determine everything" exists at the moment. Are the contours of the future Russian state taking shape? Of course they are. The individual and his rights are of paramount importance in the new Constitution. Can we fully ensure these rights today? Not at the moment. But we are getting increasingly close to being called a civilized state in which the individual is the main figure, protected by all the attributes of a democratic state. People should own property and live peacefully amid wealth. That is how it should be. And will be! [Kucher] What, in your opinion, is the state obliged to do today for society? [Filatov] Preserve it, and prevent a reduction in the level of consumption. The figures show the monstrous economic position in which our state finds itself today. Nevertheless, the consumption of food products is a main factor. Admittedly, we are all demanding various things from the state through force of momentum. We are still proceeding as if on a knife edge, and we have to go down the path worthily, so as not to fall into the abyss. It seems to me that, during this period, all groups should give up persistently trying to obtain various funds and preferential conditions for transient benefits. [Kucher] They will not agree to that. Or they will pretend to agree. [Filatov] But then there will be no results. If you aim to keep the fall in production at a level of 25 percent by the end of the year, and inflation at no more than 10 percent, then this can be achieved only by giving up lobbying activities. Accord in society is, after all, not just a subject for discussion by political scientists or journalists. Accord has an economic foundation. Accord requires restrictions, of a financial nature too. [Kucher] Do you really believe in the idea of accord? [Filatov] I believe in the idea of accord very strongly. I think that our state will not be able to get out of the crisis situation in which it finds itself without becoming aware of the need for sociopolitical conciliation. Stressing the importance of the Social Accord Treaty, the president noted that we have not had such a thing in almost 80 years. For eight decades our country lived in a regime of civil war, when part of society overtly or covertly destroyed the rest. No other country, with the possible exception of fascist Germany, has allowed such a scale of destruction of its own citizens as we permitted to happen. Hence the conclusion that we must give up Bolshevik methods of solving civil conflicts once and for all. But what the aggressively minded opposition is now trying to do constitutes Bolshevik tactics; and, whether we like it or not, this will inevitably lead to violence. Yet we have no right to fight. The treaty is the path to peace in Russian society. [Kucher] That formula is too general.... [Filatov] You see, there are a lot of laws missing in our society, and that is why it is, so to speak, naked and defenseless in the face of confrontation and violence. Until society is saturated with legal norms, accord is needed as a method of settling conflicts. As an intermediate link in peace. It will be difficult for us to get out of the crisis. Critical moments, notably connected with the refusal to support loss-making enterprises, cannot be ruled out. And the problem of unemployment arises here. Of course, you can shout that this is a crime, that the people have been reduced to penury. Certain speculative politicians who are pursuing power may play on this. But the problems nevertheless need to be solved, and they need to be solved economically, partly through constructive dialogue, that is, on the basis of the peaceful manifestation of the professional opinion of the majority. That is the substance of the accord idea.
