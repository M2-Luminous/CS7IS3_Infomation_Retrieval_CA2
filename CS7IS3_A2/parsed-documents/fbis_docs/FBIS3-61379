Lyutyy; place and date not given: "By the Thorny Path of Choice"] [Text] The Gagauz People's Party, which is headed by Konstantin Taushanzhi, the well-known economist and politician and head of a department of Komrat State University, has unequivocally advocated elections to the Moldovan Parliament on the territory of areas of compact residence of the Gagauz. The Gagauz People's Party (GNP) is guided only by parliamentary methods, prohibiting confrontation, the use of force, and so forth. This is what Konstantin Taushanzhi says on this subject: [Taushanzhi] First, we are convinced that participation in the elections expresses the interests of an absolute majority of the Gagauz population and that there is no alternative to peaceful dialogue and negotiations. The power method, the method of confrontation, has not produced and will not produce results. We have already experienced this, when armed persons prohibited the inhabitants of our districts from taking part in the elections for president of the Republic of Moldova. We proceed from the fact that participation in the elections is the constitutional duty of each citizen, it is his right and obligation, if you wish; and if there is even only one single person wishing to cast his vote for a future deputy, all the conditions for the realization of his right must be created. Disregard for this right, pressure, bans, and threats are just further disgraceful stunts of the compromised leadership of the Gagauz Republic. They are the embodiment of the ignorance of the self-proclaimed leaders of Gagauzia, who want to decide for the people. [Lyutyy] What is the explanation for the policy of the present Komrat leaders? [Taushanzhi] Their fear of the people. After all, their behavior, all their actions, their spending, and so forth have to be answered for. The people have been waiting for this account for three years now. Since 1990, when the workers of the villages and towns made their modest contribution (money) to the cause of national revival, for the support of the Provisional Committee, and then for the opening of the university. We made these facts known at that time and thanked via the newspaper all those who made these donations. And now what? The group of "leaders" has surrounded itself with armed persons and is pursuing a policy that is bringing the Gagauz people burdens and deprivations. The present leaders are rejecting all projects; no proposals for a peaceful settlement of the matter are to their liking. I am sure that were they given autonomy, even a republic within a confederative Moldova, they would reject this also. Because it would, all the same, be necessary to render account and be responsible. And they have nothing to tell people; they have brought them to poverty by their obduracy and unwillingness to conduct a civilized and honest dialogue. [Lyutyy] Konstantin Petrovich, how did the Gagauz Party emerge? [Taushanzhi] It was forced into being by the policy of a small group of people called leaders who could by turns, without shame or conscience, trample on anyone who thinks or, even more, acts differently. The party's goals are a peaceful solution of the Gagauz issue, the increased social protection of society, and the realization of economic reforms, and we are opposed to criminal privatization. These are the people's hopes. As far as our opponents are concerned, I would advise them to pay heed to the people. But they have become confused. They have forgotten that the republic should serve the people, not the other way about. It would now seem that people have been rounded up by force as hostages; and I am overwhelmed by a sense of grievance and exasperation that we can find ourselves the victims in a political game, which is resumed on each occasion by a "third party," attempting to incite disagreements between the Gagauz and Moldovans. So I would like to say that the slogan: "Nobodies have become everything," is once again pertinent today; that a parallel can be drawn with 1946-1949, when arrogance and ignorance were dominant and when questions of the building of the kolkhozes, dispatch to Siberia, and so forth were decided only by weapons. Can it be that 50 years later we have taken this same route in Komrat? It is hard to believe, but it is so. "President" Stepan Topal appeals to the people "to defend Gagauz's gains." What is he talking about?! Can it not be seen that the living standard is falling and that crime is growing menacingly? The "upper stratum" has sunk to an impossible level. What is happening currently in Komrat is reminiscent of a sandbox game: We have created a republic with the name of "Laughter and Tears," we have created a state, seemingly, in which turmoil and lawlessness reign (but there is a heap of ministers, on the other hand!). For this reason there is no Gagauz Republic either de facto or de jure. There is a handful of adventurers, and that's that. [Lyutyy] What can you say about the party's immediate plans? [Taushanzhi] Soon we will be choosing the parties to which to affiliate at the elections. We are oriented as yet toward the three parties that support the integrity and independence of Moldova, oppose unification with anyone at all, and support the Gagauz areas being given special status within the framework of international law. We regret that the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova has not lowered for us the 4 percent quota at the elections. Further, we understand that the leaders from Komrat have a desire to preserve the conflict with Chisinau (in order that it might always be possible to exacerbate relations as they see fit), but the position of certain ministers of the Republic of Moldova, who in the guise of compromises are supporting the present Komrat leaders in every possible way, is absolutely incomprehensible. Time will tell how correct our course proves, but even today the number of people supporting and sympathizing with us is getting larger and larger. And this implants confidence in the choice of a difficult, but correct and honest path for the achievement of the hopes and aspirations of the Gagauz people.
