The position of managing director Gerlai Matyas--after the OKHB's [National Commercial and Credit Bank] 25 percent buy-out--ceased to exist, and, at the end of October, his French managing partner Ives Thon's commission also expired. On 1 November, their combined positions have been taken by the 37-year-old economist Gert-Jan de Kieviet, freshly arrived from the Netherlands. His career at Bull began in 1989--earlier he was the vice-president of an insurance association--and by 1991 he had become the head of Bull's social security department. According to Mr. Kieviet--whose opinion had been influenced by an IDC [Information and Documentation Center] analysis on the Hungarian computer industry--in recent years, Bull Hungary's strength has developed exactly in areas for which IDC predicted the greatest growth potential: value-added (complementary) services, applications (ready-made, complete solution), and the PC sector, respectively. In reference to the future, Mr. Kieviet expressed his intent to make the company a market leader in distributed computing architecture and systems integration: he will not be a simple box-seller, but wants to transform Bull Hungary into a production unit with its activities focussed on open systems solutions and services while "working together with consumers as teams". In the West, the switch-over to open systems is extremely expensive and cumbersome, due to the already installed, custom-designed systems--made up of a large number of computers--and due to the software written for them. In this respect, Hungary enjoys a much luckier position. Others, beside Mr. Kieviet, are also looking for these new avenues: For instance, presently, a French banking specialist is investigating ways to adapt Bull applications to Hungarian conditions. Mr. Kieviet places a great enphasis on applications and complete solutions; according to his experience, not only in Hungary is Bull considered by many to be just a hardware and software manufacturer. The new CEO would like, by all means, to change this image, showing the Hungarian market how complete the Bull product line actually is. He also wishes to introduce a more efficient management: He believes that the marketing division must not rigidly separate from the other branches. At year's end, the commission of commercial director Jean-Luc Chalant will also expire: His activity will be covered by existing personnel. The new director has been preparing for the new assignment since last summer, by diligently studying Hungarian, familiarizing himself with the country. He confesses to have found many similarities between Hungary and the Netherlands.
