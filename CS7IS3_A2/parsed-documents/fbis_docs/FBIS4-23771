The assembly calls on the government to use all legal means possible to put an end to the insecurity prevailing in the north by deploying special units, reinforcing military presence, and training the Armed Forces and security forces so they may fulfill their mission. Th government should redeploy the integrated combatants throughout the national territory and set up camps to train them to observe strict military discipline. This means that any other combatants should be evacuated from cities and villages. The destruction of all combatant bases should be done concurrently with the integration of the combatants into the government forces.
