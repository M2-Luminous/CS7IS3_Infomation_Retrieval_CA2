The Zulu monarch said he hoped there was no substance to rumours of an attempt on Mr Mandela's life: "It would be rank foolishness for anyone to attempt to do such a thing. A thing like that would literally burn this country to ashes". Friday's meeting between the two leaders was called off after the ANC said there were "firm reports" of a planned assassination attempt on Mr Mandela. "I hope that is no more than a scare story," said King Zwelithini. "I would have liked to know from the president of the ANC what he knows about the Zulu monarchy, Zulu sovereignty and the kingdom of kwaZulu." Addressing several thousand Zulu subjects in the kwaZulu capital of Ulundi, King Zwelithini dismissed the ANC's contention that the proposed meeting was initially arranged intended to be closed. He said kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi had indicated in correspondence with the ANC's Jacob Zuma that the meeting would be a "public discussion". The king said he saw no reason why the meeting should have been private. "I am sorry that Mr Mandela was unable to attend today's meeting. I would have been grateful to know from him why members of his organisation have insulted me almost daily in radio programmes, speeches, and press statements." King Zwelithini said he felt slighted by statements from Mr Mandela and other ANC members that he was being prevented by Mr Buthelezi from seeing Mr Mandela. He said Mr Buthelezi had gone out of his way to ensure the meeting went ahead, "even by breaking protocol in giving unlisted telephone numbers to Mr Mandela". The king said he had also been offended by the ANC's attitude to the kwaZulu legislative assembly [KLA]: "There can be no action against the KLA without it being action against me as reigning king". Claims that Mr Buthelezi was his paymaster were offensive, said the king, who referred to monarchies worldwide which were supported by state funds. "What should be so exceptional about the Zulu monarchy in this respect. Why does the ANC hurl these insults at me?" He said statements by ANC spokesmen that he supported the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] were lies, saying he had not attended a single Inkatha rally. Cultural gatherings which he attended with Mr Buthelezi were alleged by the ANC and the media to be IFP rallies, the Zulu monarch argued. "I am sorry that the opportunity for the ANC to clarify these things in order to clear the air between me and its leadership was lost because of the Mandela assassination scare."
