Pavlikova, deputy economics minister of Ukraine, by T. Mayboroda; place and date not given: "The Invisible Being Acquires a Face or the Deposit Privatization Certificate Becomes a Paper Voucher"] [Text] There is not long to wait: in another three to four months the citizens of Ukraine, just as the Russians at one time, will get vouchers--privatization papers which will be simpler for them to handle than special-purpose savings bank deposit accounts in becoming owners of an appropriate share of state property. The Ukrainian variant of the voucher is a type of coupon which can be exchanged directly for shares in the desired subject of privatization or a privatization intermediary-investor who guarantees you decent dividends. Such intermediaries have already appeared in our country and their numbers will grow together with the competition, on the crest of which potential investors will, naturally, make all manner of promises. In such a situation, dear fellow citizens, you must try not to make a bad deal, listen carefully, delve into every detail, first becoming acquainted with the economic file of the enterprise whose shares you decide to acquire in return for the vouchers or of the intermediary to whom you decided to entrust their investment. We requested Lada Pavlikovskskaya, deputy economics minister of Ukraine to explain certain aspects of the forthcoming "voucherization". [Mayboroda] Lada Anatolyevna, everyone knows that in Russia it was possible to sell the vouchers, exchange them for something, give them as a gift, and so on. Why will that be impossible in Ukraine? [Pavlikovskaya] Practice has indicated the low effectiveness of such a "primary" securities market. In addition to that this required quite a lot of time. That is why we decided not to release the voucher on the market. This privatization paper in itself will not be the subject of purchase or sale, but, exchanging it into shares, the citizen will be able to dispose of it as he sees fit--sell them, give them as gifts, or exchange them. [Mayboroda] The editor receives many letters complaining about the supposedly very low nominal value of our property certificate--the voucher. It is impossible to purchase very much both for its initial price--30,000 karbovantsy or its current price which is slightly over a million. [Pavlikovskaya] Yes, I am aware of that widespread misconception. One, however, should not equate the nominal value of the voucher with its real price on the market. The figure designated on it is merely a part (in valuational expression for a certain period) of the 70 percent of state property subject to privatization, amounting to the share of each citizen of Ukraine. On the securities market, under favorable conditions, it will be possible to obtain shares for the voucher the real price of which will possibly be measured in more than one million karbovantsy. [Mayboroda] Will it be possible to invest one's voucher in housing? [Pavlikovskaya] We provided for the possibility of converting a privatization certificate and a housing check. Three concurrent types of securities were envisioned for the country: a certificate for privatization of state enterprises, a check for privatization of housing and a bond for land privatization. We now have two types of securities and they exist in the form of the deposit account. The privatization certificate--1,000,050 karbovantsy and the housing check--12,000 karbovantsy. It is true a problem did occur which we are yet to resolve--the "weight" of the nonindexed housing check proved to be less than that of the certificate by a factor of almost a hundred. Therefore I would advise waiting until the problem with indexation is resolved which will be accomplished in the very near future. As far as the land bond is concerned, that issue, in principle, remains open because the mechanism for mass-scale privatization of land has not yet been worked out by Ukrainian legislators. [Mayboroda] In Russia vouchers were in circulation for quite a long period. In June of this year their acceptance from citizens is coming to an end, according to available information. What sort of deadlines are we going to have? [Pavlikovskaya] In accordance with the privatization program the certificate expires in 1994. A few days ago, however, a decree of the president of Ukraine was published concerning the introduction of privatization property certificates into circulation, in accordance with which prior to 31 January 1995 citizens will be able to use both the noncash deposit accounts and the cash property certificates, and then, after 31 December 1996, only the cash vouchers. By the way, many of our countrymen have already utilized their privatization accounts in the Savings Bank. A new list of 150 enterprises being privatized was published recently. Therefore for those who have already made their selection, there is no need at all to wait for the appearance of the paper voucher. [Mayboroda] We make frequent use of the market experience gained by Russia. It would be good to learn more often from the mistakes of others and not our own. Have our economists extracted certain lessons from voucher privatization conducted by the neighbors? [Pavlikovskaya] Recently a group of Ukrainian specialists of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Economy, the State Property Fund, and the Savings Bank visited Moscow and Syktyvkar specifically for the purpose of familiarizing themselves with the massive privatization at the center and in various regions of Russia. We noted a sufficiently successful coordination of these processes and good organization in the conduct of auctions. I think that the check auction centers, and centers for acceptance of bids from citizens and sale of shares are in essence being organized by us as well. We intend to improve the computer network, however, by comparison with the Russian one. All-Russia auctions are currently under way in Moscow where shares of industrial giants are offered for sale. Bids for these shares arrive from the periphery whereas residents in the capital take practically no interest in regional sales. If possible we would like to allow a resident, for instance, of Odessa to effectively participate in an auction conducted in Lvov or Donetsk through the computer network. [Mayboroda] That would be an expensive luxury. [Pavlikovskaya] Yes. Such a network would not be cheap. We are however, counting on the support and technical assistance of the American Development Agency which, by the way, is already helping us with the production of cash vouchers.
