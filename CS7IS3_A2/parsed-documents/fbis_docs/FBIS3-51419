I reply to the points in your message and at the same time I present to you the guidelines of my actions to facilitate the process of peace and reconciliation. 1. The dynamics of war changes are such that had we not acted without wasting a single hour in favor of peace, we would have entered an irreversible process that would have had very serious historical consequences for the Mexican people. Precisely because I understand the difficulties in communication, my replies have not been conditioned to your replies. The unilateral cease-fire and the amnesty law bill show the government's willingness to find a political solution. I understand that the cease-fire from your side and your desire to participate in dialogue are aimed at finding a political solution. Citizens and political forces throughout the country are demanding a political, humanitarian, socially oriented solution that will guarantee peace and reconciliation. 2. I have made it clear publicly that Samuel Ruiz Garcia, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, is undoubtedly a citizen, who with his pastoral duties, has demonstrated his commitment to peace. He is a trustworthy mediator, therefore, I reiterate that, for this commissioner, the messages sent to us through him are recognized as authentic. Since the positions and the methods used are antagonistic and since we do not want to get involved in situations that could increase our differences, we have been acting within a negotiation strategy of messages of harmony, with facts, that could facilitate the political solution of the conflict. Following a study of the Chiapas situation, of the recognition of the need for changes, after observing the serious consequences of violence, and after considering the seriousness of the violence if it continued, I have come to believe that the search for peace requires three phases and a negotiation environment: 1. The suspension of all attacks, the establishment of a dialogue with the EZLN through reliable paths, that this commissioner refer to you by your name, and seek to guide public opinion toward the construction of peace, and through a dialogue establish specific guarantees for you in the amnesty process. 2. That the unity of the residents of Chiapas facilitate political unity, adherence to government action, immediate changes in the application of justice, and serious social response to the problems of the Indian communities. 3. Once conditions for pacification exist and political changes for justice and social programs in Chiapas are under way, Mexican society as a whole and national political forces -- without pressure of the armed struggle and through the political and legal process -- can reflect upon what happened and agree on policies and changes to improve the atmosphere of general political coexistence. If instead of a negotiation in peace followed by deeds in favor of Chiapas unity for security, justice, and democracy, we would have waited or wished to resolve a global agenda amidst violence, today violence would continue with irreversible consequences for public liberties, economic stability, and the possibility to carry out the changes needed in Chiapas. 3. [Number as heard] Regarding your representativeness and the treatment that would facilitate communications with you, as commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, I answer this concern. Just as we have spoken about negotiation through messages with deeds, this response is aimed at the basic point of your proposal. In one communique, you requested recognition as a belligerent army. In another communique, you proposed that only Mexicans by birth participate in the mediation so that the conflict can be resolved only by Mexicans. That is why, to reconcile your political decision to obtain representativeness and not have foreign interference in this conflict, and to conduct the negotiation process within the framework of our law, I have addressed you as the EZLN, respecting the denomination that has given you identity. 4. Finally, you asked me what is my duty and my position. My duty, as commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, is to create room for communication and negotiation to solve the conflict by political means. I honestly report to the Government of Mexico, society, and public so that an objective and more practical communication, without subjectivity, can be initiated. I am in touch with broad forces of society to gather their feelings, and in my proposals, I include what I deem are the basic positions of the Government of Mexico and sectors of society, on which the economic and political stability of the country rests. Regarding the EZLN, I have done everything that is possible to stop the war and open paths for peace. Although I am totally opposed to your methods, I try to listen to your reasons and try to open paths that offer security to all, and in due time, possibilities for legal political participation for your organization. Regarding my personal political position, I have come to this land willing to seek a political solution to the conflict. I did it when violence was on the rise; I did it because I believe in the superior value of peace and the need for reconciliation. Like Benito Juarez, I believe that the best way to give vigor to the fatherland is by strengthening the Republic with free citizens, democratic institutions, just government, and adherence by all to the law. Mexico and the world have listened to your reports of abuses, discrimination, injustice against Indians and peasants. There has also been a general rejection against violence. All political forces in the country are in favor of peace. On behalf of all the families that want peace and reconciliation, and aware of the complexity of the problem and solutions, I honestly tell you that this is the appropriate time to reach the best results. This is the moment to build a political solution. Many things can be achieved with the mobilization of society in favor of peace and justice. However, violence today would adversely affect society and would further divide the peoples. From San Cristobal de las Casas, 18 January 1994
