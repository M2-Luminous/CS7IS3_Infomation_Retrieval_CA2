In his traditional interview for Georgian radio given on Mondays Shevardnadze noted that the process of deploying peacekeeping forces in the conflict area "will not be long." A plan for deploying disengagement forces will be worked out soon, he said. According to Shevardnadze, Russia is playing a particularly active role in this work. The U.N. Security Council and the CIS Collective Security Council will consider the plan in the near future. "I think that we'll get support in both organizations," Shevardnadze said. With reference to the work of the country's parliament the Georgian leader said that different political forces call for early parliamentary elections. They include the opposition and the party he leads -- the Union of Georgian Citizens, he said. "This issue remains open," Shevardnadze said. "My own stand will depend largely on how constructive the parliament's work will be." The Georgian leader expressed solidarity with the demands of "some sections of society, particularly intellectuals," for strengthening the country's executive authorities. With reference to the visit to Tbilisi by President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan expected this week, Shevardnadze said that their discussions will focus on the situation in the Caucasus. "A dialogue on the situation in the Caucasus must be constant between the leaders of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia," he pointed out.
