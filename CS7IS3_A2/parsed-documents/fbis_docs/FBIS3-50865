The objective of Calen is, among others, to increase knowledge of the true national situation within a regional, continental, and international context, through appropriate and modern methodologies. This center will be in charge of the National Higher Studies Course established in 1986. The center will be headed by a director, who will be responsible to the Defense Ministry. It will also have an academic deputy director and a course director. The post of director will be held by a general, and the deputy director will be a civilian (a professional with a university degree), or a graduate from Calen or from Esendena [National Defense and Security School]. The executive branch will select the civilians who will study in Calen, who will be nominated by various organizations. The Defense Ministry and Armed Forces commanders will nominate officers to attend the courses. Within the military career, the completion of these courses will be considered credit toward attaining an assignment. According to the Defense Ministry the creation of this center will not represent any expense, because all the necessary resources are already available and need only be reallocated.
