The Dalai Lama has repeatedly expressed a desire to visit Taiwan, and earlier reports said he would visit this month. The official said the commission welcomes the Dalai Lama to preach on the island, noting that the number of Buddhists in the Dalai Lama's sect has been on the rise here. The Dalai Lama has on several occasions given credit to Taiwan for its political democratization, prosperity, and freedom of press and religion, the official indicated. "He should come here to learn for himself the situation about Taiwan." The Dalai Lama has been in exile in India since he fled Tibet in 1959 after mainland Chinese troops crushed an uprising there.
