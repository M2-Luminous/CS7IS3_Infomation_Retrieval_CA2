FBIS4-3233 "drchi075_r_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-075 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 North Region Serious Pollution Reported in Beijing Rivers Serious Pollution Reported in Beijing Rivers HK1804041994 Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in Chinese 1132 GMT 16 Apr 94 HK1804041994 Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE Chinese BFN [Text] Beijing, 16 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--In recent years river channels inside and outside Beijing have suffered from human-made destruction and serious pollution. Therefore, some experts have time and again warned relevant departments and citizens that because there is a serious shortage of water resources and pollution is getting worse, many river channels on the outskirts of Beijing have silted up. The River and Lake Management Section of the Beijing Municipal Water Resources Bureau revealed that former Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong personally inspected the Erdao channel in Jintailu last year. This channel was called a "present-day dragon beard ditch" [meaning the channel was full of residue]. He immediately instructed the relevant department to improve the situation. In a week the dregs were cleared but the channel stilted up again the following week. It was learned that the river water passing through this channel was for the Beijing No. 1 Thermal Power Station to generate electricity. The silt in the channel caused by pollution threatened the normal operation of the power station. Once, the relevant department dredged up some tree branches, foam plastics, bicycles, three-wheeled carts, dead pigs, and dead dogs from a silted-up section of the channel. Pollution similar to this is not rare in Beijing. Some experts said that apart from industrial pollution, the most threatening is human-made pollution. Most of the 175-km long river channels on the Beijing outskirts are clean in the upper portions, green in the middle, and black in the lower reaches. Protecting water resources, which are seriously in short supply, has become an urgent task for Beijing.
