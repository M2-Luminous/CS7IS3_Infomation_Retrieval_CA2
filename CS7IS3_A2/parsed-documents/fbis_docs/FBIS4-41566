The litas was introduced June 25, 1993 when the central bank was headed by Romualdas Visokavicius. He told reporters Friday that the introduction of Lithuanian national currency was praised by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In Visokavicius' view, the Currency Board, which was set up after the litas was pegged to the U.S. dollar, will not survive long. Meanwhile, the bank's current head, Kazys Ratkevicius, maintains that the Currency Board, whose task is to preserve a stabile litas- dollar rate, is very useful to the country's monetary policy. But both Ratkevicius and Visokavicius noted that tying the litas to Western hard currency is not enough for the economy to start recovering. Lithuania's industry and gross domestic product must be aimed at Western standards, as well, Visokavicius said. In Ratkevicius' view, an important factor helping to preserve a stabile litas are the central bank's receipts in hard currency. The chief banker said the bank purchased around 60 million U.S. dollars over the past three months. Ratkevicius also informed reporters that 500 and 1,000 lit bills have already been printed, but there is no need to release them into circulation yet.
