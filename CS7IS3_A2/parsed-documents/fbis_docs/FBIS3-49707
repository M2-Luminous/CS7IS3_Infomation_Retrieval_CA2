It is a rule that our diplomacy does not take it into consideration as a warning signal but rather as an expression of human absentmindedness, the left-leaning daily PRAVDA writes today. The author points to the television station CNN, whose interview with V-4 representatives omitted Slovakia, to the general surprise. The U.S. daily TODAY, examining the views of American citizens on the expansion of NATO, even mentions Albania while again forgetting Slovakia, the daily adds. The culmination comes with statements by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Premier John Major who, speaking about the Visegrad Four countries, again omit Slovakia. The author of the commentary adds that everything has been explained in the long run -- the Western politicians have mentioned only countries who have made biggest progress in economies. Concluding the article, the daily voices hope that Slovak politicians will at last sober up after Prague and Brussels as Slovakia will not achieve recognition by shouting, but through political culture and economic growth. The independent NARODNA OBRODA turns its attention to the Brussels NATO summit assessing it as the continuation of the West's strategy of "not burning its fingers unnecessarily." Partnership for Peace theoretically gives each state the hope of becoming a member of the North Atlantic Alliance by a date which has not been precisely defined, which means that it provides them with equal chances, the daily writes. Moscow is highly satisfied with such a solution as theoretically it gives it an opportunity to join NATO and because Partnership for Peace does not much differ from Moscow's preferences of creating European security structures together with abiding with bilateral treaties, the daily writes. "However, the Brussels summit and the preparation of U.S. President Bill Clinton's Prague meeting with the Visegrad Four presidents showed that in reality there exists the possibility of a "two-gear solution" (the incorporation of individual states in NATO), the daily stresses. It notes that "Prague has definitively buried the possibility of a coordinated course in political and security questions and that prospects for economic cooperation are growing ever vaguer. "Naturally all this was bound to provoke the displeasure -- to a greater or lesser extent expressed aloud -- of other members of Visegrad Four which is currently merely a pseudo-group. Czech President Vaclav Havel and Premier Vaclav Klaus have made it unambiguously clear that self-seeking preference of Czech interests was their primary goal. They do not want take into account the fact that the Czech Republic is part of a certain region whose developments will influence the development of the whole European area, the paper writes. [passage omitted] NARODNA OBRODA writes that the fact that British Premier John Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Brussels again omitted Slovakia in their speeches on Visegrad was an almost sinister signal as far as Slovak membership of NATO is concerned. "This only confirmed the wide-spread view that the Slovak Republic, in the year of its independent existence, did not prove itself sufficiently as regards the transformation of its economy and stabilizing the internal political situation, including solution of ethnic minority problems.... Instead of this we are witnessing constant political floundering and the fight for a mere survival on the political scene," the daily writes. "People who might think that the world around does not register this are committing the worst injustice against the citizens of this country," the paper writes, warning against underestimation of a "very serious signal from Brussels."
