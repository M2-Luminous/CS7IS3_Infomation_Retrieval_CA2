Embassies are now reopening and diplomats are knocking at the door.... William Ryerson is totally committed to his job, and expresses satisfaction with what he has done in the past two years. What our people were looking forward to, and what they expected from him, was U.S. investment in Albania. He sidesteps this issue, however, saying that "investments are expected to come only from private U.S. companies," and that "the delay is a result of the hurdles placed in the path of the Property Law." This law, however, has already been 90 percent implemented by our government. Is this simply a slip of the tongue, or it is his suspicions that prompt him to say this? Is this the truth, or it is just false information from the Albanian media? Further, he adds that "one other decisive factor for the involvement of U.S. companies in Albania is the restoral of peace in Bosnia." Thus, there is a pretty long list of excuses to justify the failure to keep past promises. What are the arguments? Are they mere exercises in face-saving? Ryerson himself brought to Albania a lot of warships, and the chemical fertilizers and pesticides that are so badly needed by our poor agriculture. That is why the Albanians "appreciated" Ryerson's presence at the ceremony to commemorate the first anniversary of our policymakers' coming to power and at several award ceremonies, even various pioneers' events. In order simply to get rid of Fatos Nano, who used to irritate Mr. Ryerson, they found a pretext to imprison him. From now on, I believe Mr. Ryerson will be left in peace to address his compliments to his excellency the president and describe him as "the man who is sacrificing himself for the sake of Albania." In addition, Mr. Ryerson expresses joy over Albania's stability, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press! Dictatorship, he says, does not exist any more! One can understand the reluctance of U.S. investors who, before coming to Albania, have to consult with Mr. Ryerson, or who are still waiting for the wars to end (God forbid that the warnings that the wars have only just begun should come true), but why do people from the Albanian diaspora in the United States and other countries not come to Albania? Are they scared by the "sweet" words of Mr. Ryerson, the U.S. plenipotentiary in Albania? It seems that U.S. and other foreign investors do not like tranquility and stability, or else they are astute enough to realize that there is some truth behind the diplomat's words.
