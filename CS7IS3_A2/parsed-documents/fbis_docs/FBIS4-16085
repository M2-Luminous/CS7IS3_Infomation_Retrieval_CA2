"They will soon raise a question about the Supreme Soviet changing the basic law. However, they should be dismissed from their posts for violating the Constitution." A. Lukashenka is sure that the amendments to the Constitution, stemming from the just-signed treaty, will not be adopted by the Supreme Soviet. This will give ground for the government to blame parliament for being unwilling to cooperate in the process of integration between Russia and Belarus. In his opinion, the document signed on 12 April is (?worse) than that signed in September 1993. First of all, this document does not resolve the primary issue -- common prices for energy resources in both countries. "Such a ruble zone is devoid of all sense, because Belarusian goods on the Russian market will not be competitive due to their much higher prices," Lukashenka noted. In his opinion, the signing of the treaty on the unification of the monetary systems will somewhat add to Kebich's chances of winning the presidential elections, but there is still enough time for people "to sober up and see who is who." Touching upon the upcoming presidential elections, Lukashenka stated that recently "a pressure on those supporting Lukashenka has begun." This pressure is exerted "primarily by the government and Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb." Alyaksandr Lukashenka reported that the group supporting him today numbers some 1,000 people; the majority of them are young people, veterans of the Afghan war, and representatives of working collectives.
