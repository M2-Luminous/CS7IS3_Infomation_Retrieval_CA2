He said Iran possesses machineries, industrial raw materials and energy sources, which fact should make the path of the second 5-year development smoother. The Iranian economy was in a better position today than five years ago, he added. On the fuel problem in the country, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said Iran would face no problem in this connection since its natural gas production of 120 to 130 million cubic meters per day exceeds its domestic demand of only 80 million cubic meters. He appreciated the efforts of construction jihad workers and reiterated the importance of training and research for the country's reconstruction.
