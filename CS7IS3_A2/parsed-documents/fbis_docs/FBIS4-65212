However, leaving aside those crises, what have we gained? Surely it is time to question the status quo in foreign policy caused by this fragile role-sharing at the top, and France's relative immobility at a time when, on the contrary, everything is moving and changing around us. Here, as in other areas, we must be careful not to sweep the coming months under the carpet as if they were merely an interlude. Looking beyond cohabitation and the internal squabbling in the majority, we should above all ask ourselves whether the "Gaullist-Mitterrandism," that serves as the basis for our foreign policy, is still pertinent. France's foreign policy consists of a series of layers, it is a doctrine which grew through accumulation (de Gaulle, Giscard, and then Mitterrand), forming a hybrid whole. The reality on which it was founded is now being shaken. The global view that was dear to General de Gaulle, and European policy as defined by Valery Giscard d'Estaing and further elaborated by Francois Mitterrand, are now showing signs of exhaustion. The loss of stability of the African Financial Community [CFA] franc, the birth of a major African power (South Africa), the progressive resolving of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the collapse of the FLN's [National Liberation Front] Algeria, and the collapse of Arab secularism clearly illustrate the disappearance of the old reality that governed Gaullist policy. With NATO playing an increasingly international role and with the start of the Partnership for Peace with Russia, our concept of independence with regard to deterrence must be questioned. It should also be admitted that the United States is incapable of organizing large-scale operations for the West all by itself. Lastly, the enlargement of the European Union [EU] and the probable shift in its center of gravity, together with the hitches in Franco-German relations merely throw into doubt European policy since 1974. These are all reasons to justify the fact that, just as it is up to the presidential candidates to redefine a social pact for French society, they will also have to establish a veritable foreign policy pact. The elections of 1981 and, even more so, 1988 were ballots for continuity in foreign policy. The election of 1995 will have to mark a break, assuming everyone is aware of the need for modernization. 1. What Borders for Europe? Given that the EU is, as the president of the Republic likes to remind us, tracing the frontier of our destiny, it would be useful to know whether this border will stretch as far as Vladivostok or if it will stop at Poland. Since shape often determines content, it would also be useful to know whether we are resigning ourselves to a "low-profile" Europe of 20 states, which would constitute a delayed but real triumph of the British goal of a vast free-trade area, or if a few countries convinced that future combat will be based on European identity can find a way of pulling the others along. In any event, French policy was not to accept enlargement without deepening, that is without putting the institutions in order and clarifying the procedures governing the Union. The result is that we are now rewarded with enlargement without deepening! 2. Fate of the France-Germany Tandem This issue is related to the border question: Chancellor Kohl assures us that his country "will not accept its eastern borders being the EU's eastern borders." But where is the line of France's vital interests? It is true that, officially, the twin motor is doing well. Both countries are still pulling the European bandwagon along; they are pushing for a structured and eventually political Europe, in line with the consensus uniting their elites; and monetary coordination survived the EMS [European Monetary System] explosion. However, the traumatism of 1990 has left its mark: Even if Francois Mitterrand can point to Mrs. Thatcher's memoirs to prove that France was not put out by German unification, Germany still formed the idea that the United States was a more reliable ally. In any event, Germany has found a alternative policy in Central Europe, whereas France, denied a southern European alternative by the increasingly clear shift in Italian politics and the Spanish crisis, has to rely on the Franco-German connection working smoothly. At this stage, it would be better to follow the advice given by Jean-Francois Poncet, a convinced supporter of the German alliance: Take the initiative, voice your reserves, and revise the Franco-German treaty, given that France still has a major contribution to make in terms of defense. Here again, the status quo can be prejudicial. The official logic that united both countries over the Maastricht Treaty is that of a Union moving forward in step. The implicit logic is that of a Union being hauled along by a Franco-German tandem, with a few countries joining in sooner or later. The current wave of Europessimism is imposing a minimalist view of a union marking time before splitting up. 3. Relations With the United States While isolationist pressure is resurgent across the Atlantic and while we remain convinced that British support is and will remain (unless the Labor Party wins the next elections) illusionary, then our problem is indeed how to keep the United States active in Europe. We must not therefore be afraid of seeing France strike an inhabitual pose, changing tack and chasing away the recurrent anti-American demons, even if "imperialism" remains embodied in trade and especially culture. Faced with an America which gives the impression of wanting to discard Europe through an uncertain policy, France must find the way of reconciling a European identity with a continued American presence. 4. Maintaining Peace in Europe Who keeps the peace and with what legal and military means? The door to peace, as the unfortunate Bosnians will tell you, is barely ajar. Official sources claim with one voice: "It is because of a lack of European unity, not the fault of Europe itself, and France is doing more than anyone!" Maybe, but this was not and is not enough to stop the Serbs or to make them understand that they could not go on behaving the same way indefinitely, i.e. until they have founded a "Greater Serbia." It is certainly not enough to impose the EU's point of view. In a context where the defense forces of small countries are in an impasse, and where a not insignificant share of German public opinion is attracted by pacifism, attention is focused on the European nuclear powers. Without doubt, in this area France has European ambitions (after all, the Charles de Gaulle [nuclear aircraft carrier] was described by the head of state as the jewel in the crown of a future European navy), and without doubt, Edouard Balladur's "Stability Pact" project represents the first stages of a global political response, but the concept of a joint defense force remains in limbo. In the meantime, what good is such an effort if it merely serves an immobile foreign policy? 5. Mediterranean Stakes Free of the lyrical portraits painted by the general [de Gaulle] who, from the speech in Phnom Penh to the "Quebec libre" speech compensated for the decline in French power with the birth of an independent policy, the "Gaullist-Mitterrandian" foreign policy looked toward the north and the west rather than the south and the east. Now we border directly onto the south, much more than we do onto the east. Depending on how you view things, this is a friendly frontier (Spain and Italy) or a threatening frontier (the Maghreb). The current risk of Italian instability under the weight of corruption and the same risk in the future for Spain, emphasizes the absence of a French vision of Europe which failed to stand on two legs -- the Franco-German duopoly and Mediterranean solidarity. The political instability in Algeria means we risk paying dearly for this lack of vision. If we are to change foreign policy, we have to modify the consensus that supports it, but this is impossible in a period of cohabitation. We must therefore hope that through the presidential debate that is getting under way, France will adopt a policy in line with its principles, a policy that delivers what it promises. From this point of view, the Yugoslav failure, the cowardliness shown over Bosnia, and the trap that has ensnared our soldiers on the ground, where humanitarian efforts screen out the reality of war, and the cautious phrases putting the aggressors on a par with the aggressed, will mark the end of an era in foreign policy. The Bosnian drama invites us to move into the future and to drop the Gaullist-Mitterrandian illusions.
