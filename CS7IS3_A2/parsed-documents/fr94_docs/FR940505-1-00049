FR940505-1-00049 FR940505-1-00012 C. Proposed Action on the South Coast SIP Revisions 1. CO Plan a. Statutory provision and general preamble requirements. The air quality planning requirements for CO nonattainment areas are set out in sections 186&hyph;187 of the Act, which pertain to the classification of CO nonattainment areas and to the submission requirements of the SIPs for these areas, respectively. EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing the Agency's preliminary views on how EPA intends to act on SIPs submitted under Title I of the Act [see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)]. The reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the EPA's preliminary interpretations of Title I. In this proposed rulemaking action, EPA is applying these policies to the proposed South Coast CO SIP, taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Those states containing CO nonattainment areas classified as ``Serious'' were required under the Act to submit by November 15, 1992, a plan that provides enforceable measures to achieve annual emissions reductions leading to attainment of the NAAQS by December 31, 2000. The Act mandates other specific plan elements, which are discussed below. In today's action, EPA is proposing to partially disapprove and partially approve the plan for the South Coast, in accordance with the provisions of section 110(k) of the Act governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). EPA is proposing to approve the plan with respect to procedural requirements, employee commute options (ECO) program, and forecast of VMT. EPA is proposing to disapprove the plan with respect to the attainment demonstration, reasonable further progress (RFP), reasonably available control measures (RACM), enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/M), VMT contingency measures, and TCMs to offset growth in motor vehicle emissions and meet progress and attainment requirements. The State's submission to address the requirements for the clean-fuel vehicle fleet has been conditionally approved in a separate rulemaking. EPA will also act separately on the State's oxygenated fuel program. EPA is proposing to take no action on the plan's emissions inventory for the reasons discussed below. b. Procedural requirements. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act requires states to provide reasonable notice and public hearing before plan adoption. The SCAQMD satisfied this requirement by furnishing proper notice and adopting the plan at a public hearing held on November 6, 1992. Following adoption by the Governing Board of the SCAQMD, the plan was forwarded to CARB, which submitted the CO plan as a proposed revision to the California SIP on December 31, 1992. On April 29, 1993, CARB submitted a letter correcting certain adoption and implementation dates for measures under CARB's jurisdiction. c. Emissions inventory. Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plans include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory included with the South Coast CO plan generally conforms to applicable EPA guidance (see, for example, Emission Inventory Requirements for Carbon Monoxide State Implementation Plans, EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;91&hyph;011; Procedures for the Preparation of Emission Inventories for Carbon Monoxide and Precursors of Ozone, Volume I: General Guidance for Stationary Sources, EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;91&hyph;016; Procedures for Emission Inventory Preparation, Volume IV: Mobile Sources, EPA 450/4&hyph;81&hyph;026d Revised). This guidance allows approval of California's motor vehicle emissions factors (in this case, the EMFAC7EP update) in place of the corresponding federal emissions factors. The methodologies used to prepare the base year and projected emissions inventories, as described in Chapter 3 of the plan, are acceptable. EPA is not proposing to approve into the SIP the State's emission inventories, however, because a different inventory is employed in the federal attainment demonstration for CO, and a new CO inventory has been developed for use in a South Coast SIP revision scheduled for adoption later this year. EPA hopes to be able to approve the revised inventory in the final SIP action and use this new inventory in the final CO FIP. Moreover, State and local agencies are preparing comprehensive revisions to the base year and projected inventories for motor vehicles. EPA may use some or all of this revised and updated motor vehicle data to amend the attainment demonstration in the final FIP. If the State submits an approvable CO SIP along with acceptable updated emissions inventories for the South Coast, EPA will be able to approve the revised State plan and inventories and substitute them for the federal plan and federal emissions inventories. d. Reasonably available control measures (RACM). Section 172(c)(1) requires the plans for all nonattainment areas to provide for the implementation of all RACM (including Reasonably Available Control Technology, or RACT) as expeditiously as practicable. EPA interprets this requirement to impose a duty on all nonattainment areas to consider all available control measures and to adopt and implement such measures as are reasonably available for implementation in the area as components of the area's attainment demonstration. The South Coast CO plan's control measures are presented in Chapter 4, Chapter 6, Appendix B, and Appendix C. The control measures are also discussed below in sections II.C.1.g., h., i., and j. The State and local control measures (with adoption/implementation dates before 2001) are as follows: M&hyph;G&hyph;12, Oxygenated Fuels Program (1991/1992); ARB&hyph;4, Improved Certification Requirements for alternative Fuel Retrofit Systems (1992/1992); M&hyph;G&hyph;5, Motor Vehicle Buyback Program (1993/1993&hyph;1997); M&hyph;G&hyph;4, Low-Emission New Fleet Vehicles (1991/1993&hyph;2000); M&hyph;G&hyph;11, Inspection and Maintenance Program Enhancement (1993/1994); M&hyph;G&hyph;1, Zero-Emission Urban Bus Implementation (1992/1994&hyph;2000); ARB&hyph;5, Low Emission Vehicles and Clean Fuels Program (1990/1994&hyph;2003); ARB&hyph;1, Revised Emission Standards and Test Procedures for Medium-Duty Vehicles and Light Heavy-Duty Engines (1990/1995&hyph;1996); ARB&hyph;7, Low Emission Vehicle Standards for Heavy-Duty Engines (1992/1998&hyph;2007); ARB&hyph;11, Inspections of Fleet Heavy-Duty Trucks (1992/to be determined); ARB&hyph;12, Control of Off-Cycle Emissions (1993/to be determined); ARB&hyph;16, Retrofit/Operational Requirements for Locomotives (1993/1992&hyph;1997); M&hyph;I&hyph;7, Eliminate Leaf Blowers (1993/1994); ARB&hyph;13, Emission Standards for Utility Engines (1990/1994&hyph;1999); ARB&hyph;15, Emission Standards for Off-Road Motorcycles (1992/1995); ARB&hyph;14, Emission Standards for Construction and Farm Equipment (1992/1995&hyph;2000); ARB&hyph;18, Emission Standards for Off-Highway Vehicles (1993/1995&hyph;2000); ARB&hyph;17, Emission Standards for Marine Vessels (1993/1997&hyph;1999); P&hyph;B&hyph;6, Control of Emissions from Petroleum Refinery Flares (1992/1996); FC&hyph;1/2g, Transit Improvements (to be determined/to be determined);
