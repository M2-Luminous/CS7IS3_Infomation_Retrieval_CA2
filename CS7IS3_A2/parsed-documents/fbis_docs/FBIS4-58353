It is considered the biggest gas field in the country. The ceremony began with a recital from the Holy Koran and a prayer for the repose of the souls of the righteous martyrs. Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi Jawad then delivered a speech in which he said: I am pleased to be given the opportunity to inaugurate this project amid the national celebrations of immortal April and the birthday of leader President Saddam Husayn, may God protect him. This is considered one of the important projects to be carried out by the technical and engineering teams of the Northern Oil Company to develop Iraqi oilfields. The project involves the development of Saddam oilfield, which the responsible foreign contracting company left incomplete in August 1990. Dr. Talal 'Ashur Kan'an, director general of the Northern Oil Company, also delivered a speech in which he said: The project, whose first phase we are inaugurating today, is an integral oil complex in this area which is far from the company's central installations. The complex consists of units for oil separation, soft oil treatment, desalination, dehydration, treatment, and injection of polluted water, and gas assembly and compression. The complex also includes two pipelines: an oil pipeline which is linked to the second pumping station on the second Iraqi-Turkish pipeline with special adjustments to link it to the northern refineries, and a gas pipeline which is linked to the northern gas complex. The designing of this integral technical complex for the production of crude oil and gas takes into consideration the possibility of expanding oil operations in this area by including the production activities of Hamrin oilfield in the future.
