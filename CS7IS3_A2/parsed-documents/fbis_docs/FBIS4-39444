However, the same resolutions allow supplies of goods and produce to Iraq in the form of humanitarian aid, provided permission exists from the Security Council committee for sanctions, said Grigoriy Karasin, director of the information and press department of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry, speaking at a briefing today. In this connection he said that the Russian side is seriously concerned over a number of Russia's humanitarian requests which are now going through the UN Security Council committee for sanctions. In particular, for several years now the Committee has been blocking Russia's request to supply Iraq with equipment in order to continue the construction of Iraq's "Yusufiyah" thermal electric power station . "We have always believed that the purpose of our project is solely humanitarian. On no account does it contradict the well known resolutions of the UN Security Council, particularly considering that the special missions of the UN which at one time visited Iraq attributed the restoration and the construction of the power station in that country to humanitarian needs," he said.
