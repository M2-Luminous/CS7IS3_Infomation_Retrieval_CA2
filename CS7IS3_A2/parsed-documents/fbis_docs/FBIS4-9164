Good morning to you, Sir. [Kwasniewski] Good morning. [Woyciechowski] I have read all of the press commentaries after yesterday's historical meeting between the SLD Sejm deputies and the president, and there are two titles: GAZETA WYBORCZA says "Cease-Fire," whereas TRYBUNA says "Agreement, Agreement, Agreement." Is it more like a cease-fire or more like an agreement? [Kwasniewski] I certainly would hesitate to say that this was a historical meeting because I would rather reserve such assessments for a few months from now. But what definitely did happen was the establishment of contact between the SLD Sejm Deputies Club and the president. Such contact was missing for a long time, and, if there was any, it was just through the press and in a rather sharp tone, too. I believe the meeting may be more like a cease-fire as far as political issues are concerned in 1994, and also the possibility of focusing on the most important issues like preparing a constitution and necessary economic measures. I think there is agreement on some detailed issues. I mean we came to an agreement about the coalition's participation in the presidential ministries and also a certain procedure associated with the issue of the finance minister. So I think that on these specific issues... [Kwasniewski pauses] We also agreed on cooperation regarding constitutional issues. So on these issues, there is agreement. [Woyciechowski] A cease-fire is something where people shoot at each other and then say: Why don't we stop for a moment before we resume shooting? [Kwasniewski] You know, I think the conversation was important and honest because, among other things, neither side has any illusions; by the way, I began the meeting by saying this. The SLD is made up of a group of people and voters who have never voted for Lech Walesa, neither in Solidarity times nor in political times [sentence as heard]. On the other hand, Lech Walesa, coming as he does from a different camp, has never spared his remarks addressed at us, which were often very critical or, I would even say, malicious. And this situation is a fact and nobody can expect that even if very close cooperation takes place, there will be feelings--love or falling in love. But what is important is that, as a result of democratic decisions after 1993, both the president, who was elected in 1990, and we, who constitute the coalition's main core after 1993, are burdened with responsibility. This was a conversation between partners who are aware of the responsibility and who are aware that people do not wake up in the morning to read about new conflicts at the top of the power structure, but they would like to wake up in the morning to good music and positive news, then go to work in peace and return from work with a feeling of safety. It would be good to have a job at all. [passage omitted] [Woyciechowski] Having seen the short pieces on the television newscast last night--we could see a very cordial atmosphere, laughter and relaxation--does that mean that Sejm deputies for the SLD, those who were there and their electorate, will vote for Lech Walesa in the next presidential election, or will they vote for Aleksander Kwasniewski? [Kwasniewski] You know, I think your forecasts are too far-reaching. Let me begin with yesterday's atmosphere. I think it was one of [hesitating] seriousness. The questions were tough, and part of the meeting was conducted in silence, which is hard to.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And the television did not show that? [Kwasniewski] I do not know what it showed. I have not seen it. The meeting lasted almost two hours, so I do not think that the television could have shown it in its entirety. But one must remember that holding the audience's complete silence and interest, where you have 200 Sejm deputies plus about 100 journalists and television teams--that is not easy to do. There were moments of very serious conversation. [passage omitted] As far as the presidential elections are concerned, I think that--by the way, this was the goal behind the meeting--the election campaign should not start too early unnecessarily. We are condemned to it, anyway--I mean in a positive sense--in 1995, which is the scheduled time for the presidential elections. I think it is unavoidable that, just like any other political campaign, this one will be filled with confrontation, disputes, and strong words. I would also like the campaign to be about merits, but I realize that such appeals often are really wishful thinking instead of having to do with reality. It would be good if the campaign were to begin at a specific point in time, not sooner than.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] It has already begun at a certain point in time--several months ago. Who initiated the campaign? [Kwasniewski] I think the campaign is a result of the fact that one person in Poland is determined, and it is no wonder. I mean Lech Walesa, who is eager to be reelected. He spoke out about it for quite a long time yesterday. And he spoke in a tone of self-confidence, saying that he at least has no doubt that he will indeed be reelected president. But he did speak about some seven years many times, so I am not sure how to... [Kwasniewski pauses] I think he meant seven years from today. From time to time, he mentioned seven years, so it was clear that he is interested in both a full implementation of his tasks in the current term, which is quite understandable, and in running in the 1995 election. But, like I said, the goal behind the meeting was to have 1994.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And what about yourself? Would you like to be president? [Kwasniewski] I have spoken about this many times before. On this issue, neither I nor my political party has made any decision yet. Of course, we are not blind. We can see that there are all sorts of opinion polls published in which my name appears. Of course, I would be lying if I said it gives me no satisfaction that I rank high or even in first place. But I want to be clear on that: I have not made any decision, and I think that a year in Poland--and this is what is needed more or less to make a real decision on initiating the presidential campaign--is such a long time that there will be all kinds of events that will either increase such [hesitating] pressures on me or will weaken them and my readiness to make the decision. That is why I do not discuss this right now at all, and I admit quite frankly that I go to sleep without dreaming about the presidency, and I wake up after a good night's sleep also without thinking about the presidency. There are simply other issues I think are more urgent right now. [Woyciechowski] How do you evaluate the results of the meeting now that more than 10 hours have elapsed? Are you satisfied with the results? [Kwasniewski] I believe that the most important thing that was achieved was the return to communication between the president and.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That simply means talking, something that has been missing for how long? [Kwasniewski] Well, as a matter of fact, I have not had the opportunity to talk with the president since the Sejm and the Senate started their work. It was our last meeting. After that, we had contacts related to all kinds of state celebrations or other; however, these were not occasions to hold talks. Thus, communication was established, and, in my opinion, it is the most important thing. As I said, as a consequence of the elections, both the president and we--participants of the coalition--bear responsibility for the same. I have often opposed, also here at Radio Zet, the concept, imposed by some advisers of the president, that the president is in opposition to the coalition. This is impossible. We are in the same configuration of power of the very same state. Therefore, it is impossible to... [Kwasniewski pauses] The president may cooperate with us well or not so well. He may or may not like the coalition. However, we are obliged by the Constitution to cooperate with one another. Thus, in this sense, there is a chance to improve cooperation, to make it more efficient, to avoid conflicts. [Woyciechowski] Yesterday afternoon, after this two-hour meeting with the entire Parliamentary Club of the SLD, a face-to-face meeting, as the press called it, was held between you and the president. Was it really a face-to-face meeting, between you and the president only, or were there also presidential ministers and your SLD colleagues at the meeting? [Kwasniewski] It was a meeting between only the president and me. I think that.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Without a microphone, without.... [Kwasniewski, interrupting] That is right. I think it was a face-to-face meeting, that is certain. Now, I can only hope that no one heard that, but I cannot bet on that.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] How long did the talk last? [Kwasniewski] Probably a half-hour or so. [Woyciechowski] Did you drink coffee, mineral water, or something better? [Kwasniewski] No, no, there was nothing better. There was no coffee or mineral water, either. It was a talk during which we tried to come to agreement on.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What was the talk about? [Kwasniewski] First of all, about what the channels of cooperation and information should look like. Aside from that, there were also a few other issues that we discussed. However, it was a face-to-face talk, with no witnesses, so I believe that this must be borne in mind. [Woyciechowski] It was a confidential talk, and you cannot speak about it. Do I understand you correctly? [Kwasniewski] Well, it was not confidential. I think that sometimes such talks are held between people, and they want to discuss certain issues between themselves. This is actually what happened. Now, because it was a talk after a longer period of not talking, the meeting was all the more important. That is, at least I attach great importance to this talk. I believe that such talks with the president will be held now and then. I would really like that. [Woyciechowski] What did Walesa really promise the SLD yesterday afternoon, or last night? [Kwasniewski] This was a public meeting, and we not only can but also should discuss it. I believe that among the elements that were agreed upon... [Kwasniewski pauses] elements about which, one can say, there is agreement, is first of all that a very important issue, or even the most important issue, in 1994 will be to prepare the constitution jointly. [Woyciechowski] That means that the Small Constitution will not be amended after all? [Kwasniewski] No. The Small Constitution is the second stage here, as it were. This means that we cooperate in line with the existing law within the framework of the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly. Participating in it will also be representatives of the president. They will propose their ideas and concepts. This is their inalienable right. I believe that we will try to.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That means that the year 1994 will be the year of the constitution? [Kwasniewski] That is right. I would.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] When will the constitution be adopted? In December? [Kwasniewski] I believe that December is a good time--before Christmas. It is a good idea to finish this year with something very specific.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And, until that time, the Small Constitution will not be amended? [Kwasniewski] I will even say more. I believe--and this is how I understand our joint decisions of yesterday--that we will not change the Small Constitution at all, and, without any changes, it will exist until the new constitution is adopted. We can imagine that, because rather little time will elapse from December, when the constitution will be adopted, to March--that is, to the nationwide referendum--I believe that we should not really make any experiments with the Small Constitution. Now, all of the correct motions... [Kwasniewski pauses] Because many motions are correct, I believe that even the recently discussed deputies' motion is rational. I think that these motions should be discussed during work on the big constitution. [Woyciechowski] As you say all this, these are all enormous decisions, of historical importance. These decisions were made by the president on the one hand and the SLD club on the other. What will happen if the club of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] does not agree to that? [Kwasniewski] Well, I do not think we should fear that because we happen to have identical views on the issue of the constitution. The cooperation that we have had so far with the PSL club has been absolutely full, and I cannot see any dangers here. However, I think it is really important to finish the work on the constitution after five years of talking about it. The participation of the parliament and the president, as well as our invitation of other, extraparliamentary groupings--all this creates the indispensable infrastructure to finally do this, to present it to the people. The nation should decide whether it accepts or rejects this constitution. The point is that we are finally discussing specifics; so far, we have been wondering how the constitution should be prepared, but we have not been discussing the heart of the matter--we have not been discussing the constitution. [Woyciechowski] What else did Walesa promise? The presidential ministries--the Ministry of National Defense [MON] and the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW]? [Kwasniewski] That is right. That is.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] These will be deputy ministers who... [Woyciechowski pauses] They will be there but they will do nothing? [Kwasniewski] I believe that these comments are entirely unfounded. If there were to be ministers who dealt with nothing, I would have to say that we are not supporters of wasting taxpayers' money in such a silly way. We have proposed this concept all along. It has now been most fully included in the proposals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ]. It lies in the following....[Kwasniewski pauses] and I believe that it is the direction of changes in the state administration in general. We have a group of civil servants who have signed contracts, who cannot be removed as the government changes. However, there is also a political group--the minister and his deputies, who come and go as governments change. In the presidential ministries, it would look like this: The minister--that is, the number-one person--is a man who is agreed upon with the president and his deputies, who deal with various issues, but who also participate in preparing the strategy of the ministry.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In other words, they know everything that is happening.... [Kwasniewski, interrupting] They both know it and exert influence on it, and they can.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] They are members of the coalition. What will it be like? MON and the MSW. Where will a PSL man go, and where will an SLD man go? Has this been established? [Kwasniewski] No, it has not. I believe that the construction proposed in the MSZ is available to both coalition members; this means that such representatives will be appointed by both parties, and they will be in all three ministries. [Woyciechowski] The last issue: Rosati. Will Rosati certainly not be the finance minister? Will Borowski return? [Kwasniewski] I want to say one thing. I also discussed this with the president during a private moment in the meeting. It would be very bad if the issue of Professor Rosati ended up in an unclear atmosphere that is related to slander. One of the questions was: Can decisions be based on slander? Incidentally, the president is a man who has often been slandered himself. Thus, caution and, first of all, protection of a good name should be required here. I believe that, in this sense, it should be stated clearly that Prof. Rosati is an honest and competent person, whose abilities should be taken advantage of in Poland. Of course, one can discuss whether today's political configuration allows us to do this. A lot seems to suggest that it is not this moment. However, I want to say clearly that Prof. Rosati is an outstanding man, and I believe that we will be able to take advantage of his talent more than once. Now, as for filling the post in the Finance Ministry, the issue is definitely becoming increasingly urgent. [passage omitted] [Woyciechowski] If I understand you correctly, after Rosati's candidacy, there will be no other candidates. For the time being, Borowski, and then we will see. Did I get you right? [Kwasniewski] I believe that very serious talks will be held on this issue very soon. This should be dealt with. As the recent developments, such as the issue of the popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] have shown, there must be a person coordinating the economic issues who would make risky and difficult decisions. It is good that the economy is working as it is without the finance minister, but, really, we all need real decisions, made by someone, to feel better. I often find myself in a situation of a man who is supposed to make decisions but who does not have the necessary information and knowledge on a given issue. [Woyciechowski] The last question: What will the situation be like in Poland over the next few months? Will it be peaceful? [Kwasniewski] I believe it will. I believe that we have ensured at least several months of peace, concentration on economic issues and the constitution. However, we will also have elections on 19 June. These will be local elections, so they will certainly not whip up great political emotions. Nonetheless, they will make our lives more colorful until the summer holidays. [Woyciechowski] If there are going to be a few months of peace, was yesterday's meeting historical or not? [Kwasniewski] If we manage to end 1994 with the constitution, and if we manage to avoid many disputes at a time, I believe it was an important meeting. Now, whether this was a historic meeting--I am rather cautious about such evaluations. I hope it was. [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. [Kwasniewski] Thank you very much.
