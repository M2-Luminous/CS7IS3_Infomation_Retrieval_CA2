Two deadlines set by the local Philippine National Police [PNP] lapsed last week but only 15 out of 45 firearms issued by the government to the CPLA men in this province had been returned, Supt. July Cordoviz, Abra PNP director, said. More than a hundred government firearms were loaned by the Aquino administration to the CPLA when the latter joined the government's anti-insurgency campaign in 1987. Last month, President Ramos ordered Balweg and the CPLA to return all firearms issued to them. Abra is the home base of Balweg but CPLA forces are also deployed in other Cordillera provinces. Cordoviz, however, discounted the need to retrieve the rest of the guns by force, saying that he was relying on peaceful negotiations he had initiated with Balweg and the tribal groups' council of elders last 2 January. On the other hand, Gov. Vicente Valera wanted all CPLA firearms "whether government-owned or CPLA-owned" taken in at once. Valera said he will ask the national government for "specific moves" to hasten the turnover of the guns. "We are ready in case (Interior Secretary Rafael) Alunan III tells us to do," Valera said. He did not elaborate. At the start of Oplan Paglalansag [Operation Dismantle] last year, Valera called for the inclusion of the CPLA in the nationwide campaign against loose firearms, branding the group as a "private army." He had complained against the group's alleged intimidation of voters during the last local elections and its alleged demand for food rations from villagers during its operation here. Cordoviz said they had a dialogue with Balweg and his group in Luba, Abra where they agreed to comply with the president's directive. "But it's taking them a long time," he added. Of the 15 firearms turned over by the CPLA here, three Garands and one M14 rifle were given during the 2-4 January Luba dialogue. Eight Garands were brought to the PNP camp here on 6 and 9 January, according to Cordoviz. Other firearms now with the PNP were one M16 rifle and two Garands which were confiscated from CPLA men in Bucay town last 3 November. Cordoviz said he was scheduled to have a second dialogue with CPLA leaders led by Mariano Agostos from Luba this week.
