(Regarding North Korean delegate's threat to turn Seoul into a "sea of flames") I was surprised at the remark when I heard it. Later, I received a formal report that the words had been blurted out in counterarguments to South Korean delegates who had gotten on our delegates' nerves. South Korea and the United States once said we already have nuclear bombs without any proof, and now they say we have the capability to produce them. They are just trying to corner us with their groundless claims. If we have such a capability, we would not bother to hold a dialogue with the United States. At the negotiations with the United States last year, our delegate proposed: "If you have suspicions against us, please help us shift all nuclear reactors to light-water reactors. Since we do not have funds to carry out the plan, we need financial aid or loans." In response, the U.S. delegate agreed to do that. Although we both are supposed to implement the agreement, the suspicion is becoming an obstacle to the fulfillment of the agreement. If we really have nuclear weapons, we would have to conduct nuclear experiments; however, we have no place to test a nuclear weapon. Also, we do not have any target against which to use such a weapon. They probably believe we are developing the weapon to confront our compatriots, but that would never happen. Why do we have to have a nuclear weapon while we have no place to use it? If we show the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) everything they want to see, they will say they have doubts about other places that they want to see, and more places, and this attitude will continue. While the IAEA says they have doubts about our military facilities, inspections of military bases are beyond its authority. North and South Korea have a bilateral arms reduction accord. If mutual arms reduction is carried out in line with the accord, we can show everything, including military facilities, to each other. Since the truce (of the Korean war), we have been under what are actually comprehensive economic sanctions by the economic sphere of the United States. What further sanctions can be imposed beyond those we have been subjected to? I feel like saying once, go ahead and try. China has never tried to apply pressures on us. We are not a vassal state of China. I was deeply impressed with (ROK) President Kim Yong-sam's inauguration address in February 1993. He stated "even the best friendly nation cannot stand closer than compatriots," and this is my longstanding opinion, too. In response to his address, I hammered out a 10-point guideline (for Korea's reunification). However, President Kim recently said we would be isolated unless the nuclear issue is resolved. I just do not understand why he made such a remark.
