"We must be firm on the ground and we must be strong-willed, I would even say stubborn, to get a diplomatic process that works" in Bosnia, Juppe said in a radio interview only hours ahead of a meeting in London with his British and U.S. counterparts Douglas Hurd and Warren Christopher. The three top diplomats are meeting to prepare talks of the three major powers, the United States, Russia and the European Union, as well as the United Nations, to define a common policy on the Bosnian question. The goal is finally to tell the warring Bosnian parties "to come to the negotiating table and talk seriously," Juppe said. Juppe said Bosnian Serbs have acted "savagely, and continue to do so, in Gorazde" but that the international community could pressure the Bosnian Serb's sponsor Serbia with sanctions "which hurt and which should continue to hurt." Juppe said an overall settlement in Bosnia should be based on the European plan for the former Yugoslav republic to become a viable state with institutions that loosely join the Serb, Croat and Moslem communities. Territory should also be divided up "in order to end the dialogue of the deaf in which we have been stuck for months and months." He added that what has happened at Gorazde showed that the international community was reacting too slowly and that this should be corrected in the future. [passage omitted]
