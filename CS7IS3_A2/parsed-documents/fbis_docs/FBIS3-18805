FBIS3-18805 "drweu046__a94037" FBIS-WEU-94-046-A Document Type:Daily Report 9 March 1994 ANNEX Germany Economics Ministry Wants Lower Wages for Certain Jobs AU0803140594 Hamburg DPA in German 1254 GMT 8 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0803140594 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The FRG Economics Ministry is in favor of clearly reducing wages for relatively unskilled work and improving them with subsidies from unemployment insurance or other social benefits. This proposal was made by Economics State Secretary Johannes Eekhoff in Bonn on Tuesday [9 March] with a view to the employment conference of the seven leading industrial states [G-7] in Detroit on 14-15 March. Eekhoff, who is preparing the conference for the German side, pointed to experiences in the United States. Unemployment benefits there are only 35 percent of the previous salary and is paid for only half a year. This exerts massive pressure on the unemployed to accept any job that pays less. "We do not want that," Eekhoff said. However, in Germany, too, one must have a more sensible combination of lower wages and social benefits. This need not necessarily be a citizen's money [Buergergeld], which unites all social benefits. Eekhoff does not expect any specific decisions from the conference of the economics, finance, and labor ministers of the G-7 countries United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy,and Canada in Detroit. There will not be a joint communique. The point is to learn from each other. Thus, the conference can provide stimuli for a new dynamism for growth and employment, he said. For the German side it is interesting to hear how the United States has created many jobs over the past years despite a relatively low growth and why unemployment in Japan is still relatively low in international comparison. Germany has been asked for a report about dual vocational training, which is seen as a reason for the relatively low youth unemployment in Germany. The G-7 conference is to be opened with a speech by U.S. President Bill Clinton, who suggested the conference at the G-7 economic summit in Tokyo in summer 1993. Then there follow five two-hour rounds of talks of the ministers about all aspects of the labor market crisis, from tax polity to technology issues to wage policy. These topics are also to be discussed further at the next economic summit in Naples in July.
