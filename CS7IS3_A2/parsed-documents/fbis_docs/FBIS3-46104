Now, they have returned to the Beijing Children's Welfare Institute, where they have lived since they were deserted by their parents, completely recovered from congenital glaucoma and ear deformity. They are starting a bright new life. The two children are among handicapped orphans from the institute who were selected to receive free medical treatment, a charity move by the city's public health bureau. The Beijing Children's Welfare Institute is the country's largest, housing more than 600 homeless children, 90 percent of whom are handicapped. Many children in the institute are confined to bed all year round, due to illnesses ranging from heart disease to congenital handicaps. Half of them have been in urgent need for medical treatment. Although staff try their best to take care of these children, it is impossible for the institute to raise the huge amount of money needed. Last August, two deputies to the Beijing People's Congress revealed the problem in a report to the city's public health bureau. Zhu Zonghan, head of the bureau, went to the institute himself for an inspection. He then made the decision to arrange operations for the children. Two months later, the bureau organized experts from five hospitals to examine 40 children. Thirty-two of them were selected for operations. On December 3, the municipal public health bureau called on all hospitals in Beijing to offer free treatment to save the handicapped orphans. The proposal won wide support. Twenty-six hospitals committed themselves to perform operations, while many other hospitals provided assistance in technology, equipment and funds. A hospital volunteered to accept five hare-lipped children, and promised to look for foster parents for them. The Beijing children's hospital promised to take all the child patients the other hospitals could not. On January 12, all the 32 children suffering from severe problems, such as large-scale scalds, hydrocrania, heart deformities or harelip, were sent to the 26 hospitals for the best of treatment. Various enterprises gave money to help in saving the children. A Beijing-Taiwan joint venture handed over 20,000 yuan (2,100 U.S. dollars). Many organisations, such as the city's association for the handicapped, the department of civil administration and the women's federation have also shown their concern in a practical manner. Zhu Li, wife of Premier Li Peng, and Lin Jiamei, wife of China's former President Li Xiannian, have visited the children and brought them toys.
