During the press conference given by the highest authority on competition, questions about Berlusconi and his group were snowballing. Saja explained: "The aim is to establish a dividing line between political activity and other activities. Let us hope they will be able to do so." It is now up to the experts -- Antonio La Pergola, Giorgio Crisci, and Agostino Gambino -- to study the situation, and Saja was saying that "studying is always a good thing." However, he seemed "less than enthusiastic" about the solution adopted: "Let us hope they will be able to do something. Political power must be distinct from economic power. This is the objective." What formula should be adopted? "Transferring his assets would be the most radical as well as the best solution." Could foreign models whereby the management of the assets is entrusted to a third party be effectively adopted? "They have limitations." What about the idea put forward by Andreatta [Italian Popular Party lower house floor leader], who invited Berlusconi to give the banks a mandate to sell? "A mandate would be required." What about the PDS's [Democratic Party of the Left] plan whereby anyone who has been granted a government concession should not be allowed to govern? "We must first be clear about what is meant by concession. A concession may also involve a small state-owned plot of land." Concerning Fininvest, the PDS, and guarantees: On this point he is also engaged in a long-distance polemic with Fininvest chairman Fedele Confalonieri, who considered the progressive proposal "a little over the top," and who stated: "It is Fininvest that needs assurances, because now Berlusconi is devoting himself to his job as prime minister and he is relatively uninterested in us -- assurances that we can continue to work, without major cuts or hasty sellouts." Saja's reply to this: "Why, who owns Fininvest?"
