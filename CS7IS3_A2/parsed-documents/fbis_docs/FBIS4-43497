Brugger, whose party has been the middle-of-the-road political vehicle representing a majority of the Alto Adige's German speakers in the Rome parliament since World War II, told a dinner in his honour here yesterday evening that the people of the South Tyrol had already experienced "what fascism was on their own skin." The South Tyrol question is one of the older ones in contemporary European history. The seeds were sown at the end of World War I when Italy was handed an almost entirely German-speaking area strongly linked to the Tyrol and Austria. Under fascist rule, radical Italianisation brought the replacement of German education and place names, and major industries were also created in Bolzano and its environs to encourage immigration there by Italians. The fascist regime's forced Italianisation plan failed however and, in 1939, Hitler and Mussolini decided to solve the dispute with an iron fist. German-speaking inhabitants of the region were required to choose between being German and Italian. If they chose the former, they were forced to emigrate to the Third Reich, if the latter they lost their cultural identity. The history of self-determination for Alto Adige-South Tyrol has been spattered with extremist violence, and bomb attacks began again in the early 1980's after a lull lasting from 1972, when a long-negotiated autonomy statute went into effect, until 1979. The most hotly disputed part of the package, mostly by the Italian speakers who rewarded the neofascist Italian Social Movement, now forming the bulk of the National Alliance, in terms of votes for its pro-Rome stance, is obligatory bilingualism and the division of public employment, social welfare contributions and housing on an ethnic basis. As the Berlusconi government was being formed, Brugger warned that the "dangerousness of the neofascists" had been shown once more by their electoral and postelectoral demands for a revision of post-World War II treaties. Now, saying that the Berlusconi government includes five ministers and 11 deputy ministers who are "neofascists," Brugger warned that Italy is going to the right. If new elections are held in the near future as some people are speculating, Brugger said the right would advance again and the Northern League's decline would continue. Brugger also voiced concern over the concentration of the means of information in Berlusconi's hands and his apparent attempt, together with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini to get the public broadcasting corporation, RAI, under his control, too. Last year, an SVP congress in Bolzano, or Bozen as the German speakers call it, reasserted the demand for self-determination. In the run-up to the March 27-28 general elections, the SVP filed suit against Italy's new electoral law. The argument was that the 4-percent threshold set nationwide for access to seats in the proportional section of the ballot would automatically rule it out because of its support is only local. The constitutional court rejected the case, but said the government would have to move to ensure that the evident disparity of treatment was corrected.
