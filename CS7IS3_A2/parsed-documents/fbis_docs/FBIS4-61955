Late on 6 May, the president's press service circulated a communique on the appointment of Nikolay Travkin as member of the government. The Democratic Party leader has become the first minister without portfolio in the history of modern Russia. Nikolay Travkin, 48. Leader of the Democratic Party of Russia; head of Moscow Oblast's Shakhovskoy Rayon administration since 1992. Received secondary education at the Building Technical School in Klin, and higher education at the Pedagogical Institute in Kolomna. A Hero of Socialist Labor. [passage omitted] Boris Yeltsin's haste in appointing Travkin to a position that does not yet exist is quite easily explainable. Travkin, who usually criticizes the government rather sharply, has surprisingly easily agreed to accept this figurehead position for purely juridical reasons. Being a State Duma deputy, he has no right to combine work in parliament with the duties of head of administration of Shakhovskoy Rayon. Now that he has the status of minister, he can do so. As for Boris Yeltsin, this gave him a fine opportunity to demonstrate his magnanimity toward leaders of the opposition who, in moment of need, show loyalty necessary for the president. In other words, Travkin's appointment as member of the government can be seen as a payment to the Democratic Party of Russia leader for having signed the agreement on social accord. "The odd man out" in the story of the appointment of a new member of the government is, paradoxically, the head of government. Rumors of the impending replacement of Yefim Basin, chairman of the Construction Committee, with Nikolay Travkin that appeared shortly before the signing of the agreement could not naturally go past the premier. It is, however, obvious that he could not consent to the replacement of a politically loyal and experienced construction general (Basin in the past was in charge of the Baykal-Amur Railroad project) with a half-teacher, half-builder. Viktor Chernomyrdin could after all prevent the negative impact of Travkin's appointment to a more important position in the government. But he has not yet succeeded in solving the other problems -- which job in the White House would correspond with Travkin's present status (in addition to running Shakhovskoy Rayon), and what to do about potential ministers without portfolio Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Gennadiy Zyuganov, and Mikhail Lapshin who have not yet signed the agreement.
