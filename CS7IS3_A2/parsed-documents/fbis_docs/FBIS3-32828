These are the rules of democracy and of civilization. They are inescapable, despite the fact that many of us feel that great injustice is done when, after having borne the brunt of an atrocious war, in which they proved capable, moreover, of implementing a correct and humane strategy, the Armed Forces are made the target of pseudo-apostles of good. In internal wars--and above all, in one as long as this one has been and against as treacherous, cruel, and savage an enemy as Shining Path--the tendency to form secret extermination groups is almost spontaneous. In a recent interview, Enrique Obando stated that in every army of the world there is a double code: a written one that comprises the regulations and conforms with the Constitution, and an unwritten one that in a veiled manner authorizes the existence of groups that carry out illegal operations. If this double code is a commonplace in all armies, it is also one in ours, which has endured the strain of an extremely hard internal war. This is what occurred in Argentina. But, there, the secret code was applied in a systematic manner, and became official strategy. In Peru, it was applied only sporadically, never systematically. On the contrary, the incredible, the truly extraordinary fact, is that, beginning in 1990, the Armed Forces were able to implement the opposite strategy. Starting from that year, their systematic strategic policy was one of alliance with the population, under which the Armed Forces gave arms to the civilian patrols, food and civic aid to the disadvantaged urban populations, and built roads in high-risk areas. An intelligent action that enabled the capture of thousands of terrorist leaders without firing a single shot. An astute strategy, in sum, extremely respectful of human rights, diametrically opposed to the strategy of indiscriminate slaughter. This is why it produced results. This is why it had the people's support. These are the facts. In Peru, that code of silence did not become strategy. There was a group of executioners, but it was a vestige of a previous stage, and in conflict with the strategy that in the end succeeded. In truth, the Peruvian Army, being in no way compromised by the investigation, has no reason to feel mistreated by it. Very much on the contrary, the Army must proudly show everybody its proven ability to learn and adapt its war strategy not only to humanitarian principles but also to the reality of the only effective action for defeating an enemy that felt it could move among the people like a fish in the water. Clearly, the code of silence is incompatible with democracy. What we know today about La Cantuta is owing to the fact that a policy split within the Army has led certain officers to reveal the identities of those who might have been the perpetrators of that massacre, bringing information to public light that, in another time, would not have been made known. This, in addition to its hard-fought rivalry with the accusing group, is why the Army is resisting the investigation. But justice is inevitable. And in the end, in spite of everything, the truth shall prevail: That the Peruvian Army was able to overcome the terrorist enemy cleanly, by intelligent, humanitarian, and democratic means.
