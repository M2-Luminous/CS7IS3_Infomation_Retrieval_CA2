The following is the full text of the statement: We have yet to see the full text of the "report." Judging from the excerpts that have been revealed so far, we can see that the report by the British Parliament Foreign Affairs Select Committee has ignored the objective fact that Chris Patten's political reform package violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and the understandings reached between the Chinese and British governments, refused to adopt the suggestions of some official British participants that the British government resume cooperation on the basis of the agreements between the two sides, deliberately confused the truth, supported the British Government's policy of further confrontation with China, boosted Chris Patten's "three violations" political reform package, openly recommended that Britain play the "international card" on the Hong Kong issue, and openly advocate intervening in Taiwan and Tibet, which are China's internal affairs. The "report" also made wanton and unreasonable attacks on certain provisions in the Basic Law of the PRC Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The report is a negative example; it makes people see how veteran colonialists racked their brains in exploiting every opportunity to continue their colonial rule and influence in Hong Kong. However, all these efforts are futile. Nobody can change the Chinese Government's determination to reclaim Hong Kong and restore sovereignty over it as scheduled in 1997. The Chinese Government has announced more than once: We will establish the first government and legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law and National People's Congress resolutions. No decisions made unilaterally by Britain during the transition period on key issues straddling 1997 will be recognized by China.
