The reshuffle follows the resignation of Jean-Pierre Bagnena, leader of the opposition Gabonese Socialist Party, and Jean-Francois Ntoutoume Emane, member of parliament of the ruling Gabonese Democratic Party. Mr. Bagnena refused the post of secretary of state for health because he was not consulted beforehand, while Ntoutoume Emane refused the post of minister of state control, decentralization, territorial administration, and regional integration because he was dissatisfied with the duties and functions assigned to his department. The resignation of the two ministers brings the number of cabinet ministers down from 38 to 36. The presidential decree which announced the technical reshuffle also stated that the state secretariat for health has been scrapped. Furthermore, the decree stated that Pierre Nziengui Mabilat, minister of small- and medium- scale enterprises, has been named interim minister of state control, decentralization, territorial administration, and regional integration.
