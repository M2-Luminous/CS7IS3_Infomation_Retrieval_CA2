Findings and Conclusions: The following proposed findings and conclusions on the material issues are based on the record of the hearing. 1. The record indicates that the handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in designated parts of Walla Walla County, Washington, and designated parts of Umatilla County, Oregon, is in the current of interstate or foreign commerce or directly burdens, obstructs or affects such commerce. The proposed production area is discussed in material issue 3. The record evidence shows that in July 1989, 49 percent of the commercial shipments of Walla Walla Sweet Onions were marketed in Seattle, Washington. That percentage increased over the following four years, and, in 1993, 71 percent of the volume moved to outlets inside the State, the remaining 29 percent going to both eastern and western destinations outside Washington and Oregon. An indeterminate volume of Walla Walla Sweet Onions is sold within the proposed production area at roadside stands, and some are marketed throughout the United States. A negligible percentage of the crop is processed. The record indicates that no Walla Walla Sweet Onions are currently exported, but that they may be in the future. In addition to Seattle, the record indicates that other major markets for Walla Walla Sweet Onions include Chicago, Illinois, and San Francisco, California. USDA Market News reports show that these three markets accounted for about 12 percent of commercial shipments in June, July, and August of 1992. Walla Walla Sweet Onions also were marketed (in descending order of volume marketed) in Los Angeles, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Boston, Massachusetts; New York, New York; Baltimore, Maryland; Cincinnati, Ohio; St. Louis, Missouri; Dallas, Texas; Miami, Florida; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Detroit, Michigan.
