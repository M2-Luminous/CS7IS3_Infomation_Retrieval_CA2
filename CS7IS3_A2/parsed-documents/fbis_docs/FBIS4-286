However, a spokesman for the company emphasized that this is a private decision, and not one taken by the British Government. The spokesman was reacting to reports that the British and Portuguese Governments are preparing for the evacuation of large numbers of British and Portuguese passport holders from South Africa if widespread violence breaks out. It is estimated that up to 350,000 British passport holders could be involved in the evacuation. NP [National Party] and ANC spokesmen said they were concerned about reports on planned evacuation operations. Mr. Carl Niehaus of the ANC said the ANC would consult the countries concerned about these plans. He said these reports cause unnecessary tension. NP spokesman Marthinus van Schalkwyk said he doubts the practicality of such plans and added that South Africans should not allow themselves, as he put it, to be led by the nose.
