The meeting lasted one and a half hours and came about as the result of an IKL initiative. IKL is one of the two organizations that Russia demanded information about in a note prior to the first round of the presidential election. At the meeting the IKL leaders raised the subject of the note and the border question. The IKL wants to return to Finland the borders fixed in the Peace of Tartu [1920]. The IKL leadership was satisfied with the discussion and described relations between the embassy and the IKL as businesslike. According to representatives of the organization, the meeting did not give the impression that Deryabin considers the IKL to be illegal or that the organization is in any way contrary to the Paris peace agreement. The IKL gave Deryabin a clock made of wood, with an image of Finland with borders from the Peace of Tartu. The IKL leadership gave assurances that the organization does not represent a threat to Russia, nor does it intend to harm relations between Finland and Russia.
