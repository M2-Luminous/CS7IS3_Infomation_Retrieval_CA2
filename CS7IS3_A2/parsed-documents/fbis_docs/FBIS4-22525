In its 3 years of existence, the company has demonstrated its ability not only to survive under difficult economic conditions, but to substantially extend the boundaries of its activity. The company's results in 1992, when it increased the volume shipped from 12.3 million metric ton-kilometers in 1991 to 94.2 metric ton-kilometers, attest to its success. The airline's activity is also respected because it was one of the first in Russia to export not only raw material, but competitive high-tech transport services in the international market. VOZDUSHNYY TRANSPORT correspondent Valeriy Ageyev asked Aleksey Isaykin, the executive director of "Volga-Dnepr," to answer a few of the questions asked most often by the newspaper's readers. [Ageyev] Aleksey Ivanovich, has your company made any unique shipments lately? [Isaykin] Yes, not long ago one of the airline's An-124-100 "Ruslan" aircraft delivered a single load of 130 metric tons to the Australian city of Perth--a 20-meter unit for repairing the footing of offshore drilling rigs. Our pilots spent 28 hours in the air, bypassing airports in Istanbul, Madras, and Singapore. The transportation of 232 metric tons of stage equipment for the Michael Jackson world tour, as well as the 120 metric tons of concert equipment for Madonna's tour through Latin America--these were operations that were not so much unique as they were noisy. [Ageyev] But the unique trips are certainly not the only aspect of your activity. [Isaykin] You are right. Our company is not limited to unique flights. On 18 November, we delivered 6 metric tons of humanitarian cargo from the United States to Ulyanovsk. These were medicines and medical equipment donated by parishioners of St. Luke's Church in Oklahoma City to the Ulyanovsk Oblast hospital. Together with the humanitarian cargo, we carried oil drilling equipment to Russia from the United States. [Ageyev] "Volga-Dnepr" has developed the reputation of a reliable partner in the world market today. What have you accomplished in the field of international cooperation? [Isaykin] Our relationships with foreign partners are not limited just to the contracts to carry cargo. A delegation from Oklahoma State University was in Ulyanovsk in October 1993. Bobby Henn [as transliterated], a professor of international marketing, and the regional manager of the Air Express International airline conducted business seminars for 8 days for "Volga-Dnepr" employees. The subject of the seminars dealt with an analysis of the situation in the world market for air freight service, the study of management strategy for entering the world market, the problems of managing an international air freight airline, and familiarization with the specific nature of the market for air freight service and its industrial base. At the conclusion of the American specialists' visit, an agreement was reached on training for our company's employees at Oklahoma State University. [Ageyev] What kind of new transportation services can "Volga-Dnepr" provide today? [Isaykin] We want to extend our activity in other directions as well. In addition to carrying large-sized and extra-heavy loads, "Volga-Dnepr" can offer a new form of service. We are prepared to provide for the reception of foreign delegations and the organization of business meetings and visits in the Yak-40 aircraft. The economy and business class cabins have been furnished with upholstered furniture, which is convenient both for business negotiations and a quiet rest. Our Yak-40 also has the equipment needed to organize the passengers' meals. [Ageyev] Does "Volga-Dnepr" have any objectives for the very near future? [Isaykin] Unquestionably. First of all, the airline's short-term goal is to become Russia's number one air freight company. And our long-term goal is to become one of the world's leading air freight companies. In order to achieve these objectives, we have worked out a definite strategy, which includes improvement in the management of the company and its material and technical base and creation of a favorable image for the company both in our country and abroad, as well as superior knowledge of the world market's requirements for air freight service, and meeting them in a timely manner at the level of world standards. We are continuing to form our team of professionals who are prepared to work in other countries and we are developing an advanced system to provide information support. We are also trying to maintain good relations with our partners. In many respects, we are obligated to the "Aviastar" AO [Joint-Stock Company]--the Ulyanovsk Aviation Industrial Complex, our main stockholder--for our successful activity. The "Aviastar" AO builds the An-124-100 "Ruslan" aircraft, which forms the basis of our fleet. Incidentally, there are six "Ruslans" in it at present. In addition, because of cooperation such as this we do not need spare parts for any aircraft equipment. It seems to me that by having such support and a finely tuned operating mechanism, "Volga-Dnepr" is capable of reaching the goal it has set: to become Russia's leading air freight company and one of the leaders in air freight service in the world market.
