Speaking to the local press here today, U.S. Ambassador to Angola Joseph Schreiber said the United States, Russia and Portugal -- three observer countries of the Angolan peace process -- believe the initiative benefits the ongoing peace talks in Lusaka, capital of Zambia. Luanda has reportedly agreed to give unita the four portfolios of mineral, health, trade and travel, seven deputy-minister posts of finance, agriculture, interior, defense, social rehabilitation, communication and public works, as well as governors of Kuando-Kubango, Uige and Lunda-Sul Provinces, deputy governors of several other provinces. The United States firmly supports U.N. Special Envoy to Angola Blondin Beye in his efforts to bring lasting peace and reconciliation to the Angolan people, the ambassador said. Beye had proposed the government accommodate the UNITA in a future cabinet. He said the United States will shoulder 30 percent of U.N. expenses for peacekeeping missions in the southern African country.
