The six private radio stations in Sofia which suspended their broadcasts for two days in protest against the tax are back on the air today but every hour on the hour they will air protest noise effects. The only paper to come out was BULGARSKA ARMIYA the daily of the Defence Ministry. Today it carries an interview with Deputy Defence Minister Boyko Noev about his visit to the United States last week. The CASH weekly which came out today has blank spaces instead of text and carries only advertisements. "This is what a censored newspaper would look like," it is written on the front page. Any attempt to levy VAT on the press, no matter what motivates it, is pure censorship in the form of liquidation, reads the commentary in this weekly. A rally of intellectuals is scheduled to take place this afternoon in support of the media protest. The editors-in-chief of the leading national dailies will meet tonight to discuss the forms in which to continue their protest.
