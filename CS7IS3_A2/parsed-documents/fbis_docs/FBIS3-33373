Asked about the opposition of Ministers Murilio Hingel (Education), Henrique Santillo (Health), and Leonor Franco (Social Welfare) to the composition of the fund, Fernando Henrique Cardoso said that those who are against it should resign. If any minister works against the economic plan, he should have the courage to resign, said Cardoso after holding a confidential meeting with President Itamar Franco at the Brasilia Air Base. Cardoso alerted President Franco to the problems in having the emergency fund approved and to the need for the government to firmly maintain its proposal. Cardoso said: "The government is united. The creation of the fund is a government decision." He reiterated to the president -- as he did last week during the carnival celebration -- that it would not be wise to make any concessions on the cuts made to the budget to create the emergency fund. The president organized a meeting with the ministers who were dissatisfied with the economic team but he later cancelled the meeting. The ministers of education, health, and social welfare worked with Congress to change the composition of the fund because they want a higher budget for their ministries. Minister Cardoso, who was irritated by the ministers' behavior, did not give in to the pressure and President Itamar did not disavow him either. Cardoso said: "There is nothing to negotiate in the proposal. The government will not give up the goal of zero deficit. As Congress already approved it in the first round, I do not believe it will change its point of view either because it is hot or it is cold." Constitutional revision rapporteur Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul] said he rejected the 31 amendments to change the fund's composition, thus keeping the proposal approved in the first round.
