The Prime Minister faces being painted into a corner at this week's European Union [EU] leaders' summit in Corfu, where the choice will be made on Friday [24 June] or Saturday, and may once more end up in a minority of one. Britain backs former cabinet minister Sir Leon Brittan to succeed Jacques Delors next January but Germany and France are supporting Mr Dehaene, who is favourite to gain the post. EU leaders are to decide on their favoured candidate at Corfu amid suggestions that it is time for one of the smaller member states to have their candidate chosen, either Mr Dehaene or his rival the Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers, with Ireland's former European Commissioner Peter Sutherland emerging as a possible compromise candidate. As backstage wrangling continued about the successor to Sir Norman Fowler as Tory chairman, some vocal Euro-sceptics, such as Sir Teddy Taylor, were also seizing the moment yesterday to threaten restoration of internecine warfare on Europe over increases in Britain's net contributions to the EU in two years. The rises, agreed at the EU's Edinburgh summit under Mr Major's presidency nearly two years ago, will see Britain's contributions increase, in line with those of other countries, from 1.7 billion pounds this year to an estimated 2.8 billion pounds in 1995/6. The Government has so far delayed the introduction of a bill, promised in last November's Queen's Speech, enabling an increase, and it may now be put back until the autumn. Although the sceptics conceded yesterday they cannot block the legislation, they may yet disrupt its passage. Yesterday, embittered former chancellor Norman Lamont, sacked by Mr Major a year ago, called on the Prime Minister to veto the Dehaene candidacy. Implying vacillation by Mr Major, he said in a BBC interview: "It is an absolutely crucial decision. We have spent the last two years arguing against the proposals of Jacques Delors. We do not want to have more of the same for the next two years. We must make up our mind, stick to it and be determined. Unless you take a firm position and stick to it you never win anything." Pro-European Tories see the Dehaene decision as not worth the veto. They pointed out that 10 years ago Lady Thatcher vetoed Claude Cheysson and ended up with a candidate she liked even less in Mr Delors. Meanwhile, with manoeuvring still continuing over the party chairmanship and former holders of the job Lord Parkinson and Kenneth Baker still urging the appointment of Michael Heseltine who does not want it, Lord Archer appeared to be moving up the list. He won the backing of constituency activists in one Sunday newspaper poll as a tribute to his indefatigable touring of local associations. No longer bothering to disclaim his ambition, he said: "I have always been fascinated by that side of politics but I am quite happy to serve the Conservative Party in any capacity the Prime Minister says." David Hunt, the Employment Secretary, the favourite for the job, likewise suggested, though with noticeably less enthusiasm, that he would accept any challenge Mr Major offered.
