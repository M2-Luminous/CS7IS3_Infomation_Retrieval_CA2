Foreign Minister Willy Claes announced the decision just after the religious ceremony that took place this morning in honor of the 10 blue helmets killed in Rwanda. Willy Claes: [Begin recording] [Claes] We have decided once and for all to withdraw Belgian troops from the UN contingent. We have made this decision for two reasons: The first is that, on the basis of undeniable facts that are confirmed to us every hour by our diplomats and our soldiers in Rwanda, this UN peacekeeping mission, as defined in tempore non suspecto by the UN Security Council, no longer has any sense; moreover, in spite of the presence of the UN force, we did not manage to prevent the murder of tens of thousands of people. The second reason is that, considering the anti-Belgian climate, whatever his excellency the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels might say, there is such an anti-Belgian climate, that we cannot take the responsibility for asking our soldiers to take extra risks. [Correspondent Jean-Michel Moestart] Can one conclude from the Belgian decision that if the UN Security Council were to give the green light tonight, our blue helmets would leave Rwanda at the same time as the Belgian para-commandos deployed for the evacuation operation? [Claes] No, we are not making any link between our Belgian blue helmets and the Belgian paras. [end recording]
