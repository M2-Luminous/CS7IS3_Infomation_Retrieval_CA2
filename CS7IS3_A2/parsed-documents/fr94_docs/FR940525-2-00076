Effective Dates: If the proposed exemption is granted, the exemption will be effective from August 26, 1992 through November 10, 1992. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. H&V is a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts engaged in the manufacture of technical and industrial papers and nonwoven fabrics. The Plan is a profit sharing plan which contains a cash or deferred arrangement under section 401(k) of the Code. The Plan is administered by the Savings Plan Committee (the Committee) of H&V. Under the Plan, participating employees make elective contributions pursuant to salary reduction agreements. H&V makes matching contributions not in excess of 6% of the participant's compensation. The Plan had approximately 47 participants who were affected by the subject transaction, and at the time of the transaction had assets with an approximate aggregate fair market value of $2,767,369. The Plan currently has assets of approximately $4,361,700. 2. Contributions under the Plan are allocated to the accounts of individual participants (the Accounts). The Accounts are invested at the direction of participants in one or more of the investment options available under the Plan. Investment directions may be made or changed as of January 1 and July 1 of each Plan year and remain in effect until changed by the participant. 3. Prior to July, 1992, two investment funds were available to participants, the Guaranteed Investment Contract Fund (the GIC Fund) and the Fidelity Equity Income Fund. The investments held in the GIC Fund at that time consisted of four contracts: (i) Fidelity Group Trust, at 8.33%, maturing on March 31, 1993; (ii) Vanguard Fixed Rate GIC Trust II&hyph;90, at 8.17%, maturing March 31, 1993; (iii) Vanguard Fixed Rate GIC Trust II&hyph;91, at 7.45%, maturing on March 31, 1994; and (iv) Principal Group Annuity Contract No. GA 4&hyph;3031, at 6.53%, maturing on March 31, 1995. Participants who invested in the GIC Fund received interest at a combined rate calculated as the average of the rates on open GICs held in the Fund, weighted in proportion to the amounts allocated to each such GIC. 4. In September, 1991, the Committee began discussing the possibility of expanding investment options under the Plan in order to give participants greater flexibility and diversity of choice among investments with respect to appropriate levels of risk and return. On April 16, 1992, the Committee resolved to offer four investment options, effective as of July 1, 1992. These were to be the GIC Fund, the Fidelity Equity Income Fund and two additional options, the Fidelity Growth and Income Fund and the Value Line U.S. Government Securities Fund. Participants were informed of the additional options by notice from the Committee on May 26, 1992. 5. The Committee subsequently received and processed directions from participants for changes in investments as of the July 1, 1992 change date. The new investment directions required the transfer of $258,572 held in the GIC Fund, or approximately 10% of Plan assets, to other investment options. 6. Because of restrictions under the GICs, however, the Plan was unable to redeem its interest in the contracts to effect the transfer of amounts to other investments as directed by participants. Specifically, under the Principal Group GIC, Principal could terminate the contract if withdrawals were made prior to the maturity date. H&V understood that similar restrictions applied under the other GICs held in the GIC Fund (although in fact there were no comparable restrictions on the Vanguard GICs). 7. To enable participants whose Accounts were invested in the GIC Fund to make use of the new investment options and to protect participants from incurring penalties for premature withdrawals from the GICs, the Committee resolved to advance funds to the Plan. On August 26, 1992, $188,000 was wire transferred by H&V to the Plan. The $188,000 was invested in equity funds in accordance with the directions of those participants whose account balances in the GIC Fund could not otherwise be transferred.
