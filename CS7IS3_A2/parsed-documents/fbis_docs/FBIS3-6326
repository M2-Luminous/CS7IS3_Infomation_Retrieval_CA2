Akira Yamagishi, president of the eight-million strong Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), told a meeting of Rengo's central committee that the forum "is intended to back the ruling coalition and to develop and establish a political system for changes of governments." He said the forum "will study designs for a broader spectrum of policies." Yamagishi said Rengo will set up a preparatory panel in early April as a prelude to founding the forum. On Rengo's support for political parties, Yamagishi said the confederation will not only cooperate with the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the Democratic Reform Party (DRP), a political arm of Rengo, but also other parties. Rengo, founded in November 1989, has backed the governing coalition since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa took power last August. Yamagishi has envisioned a future reorganization of Japanese politics with three main political forces -- the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), new conservative forces, and liberals. He has reiterated Rengo will back the liberals comprising the SDPJ, the DSP, the DRP, new party Sakigake, the Japan New Party and the more liberal elements of the LDP after the political reorganization. Yamagishi indicated at the committee meeting that Rengo will shape its own tax reform plan and submit it to the government. The governing coalition has set up a panel to conclude ways of financing tax cuts of some 6 trillion yen in the fiscal 1994 state budget by the end of the current 150-day ordinary Diet session that began January 31.
