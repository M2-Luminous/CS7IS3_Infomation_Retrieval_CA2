In a meeting with the press to illustrate his ministerial game plan, Comino, 39, recalled how his position had no negotiation powers and thus he saw his task more of one to coordinate the actions of the other ministries in a European Union framework. Comino went on to suggest adopting a "blue stamp" to be applied to measures taken by Parliament which are in line with European Union regulations and laws. In this way, he observed, his office would not have to dedicate 50 percent of its time trying to resolve conflicts between Italy and the European Union which much of the time are born from conflicts between laws and regulations more than Italy's failure to adopt EU laws. The minister then went on to suggest the creation of "trans-national socio-economic areas" which would serve as a link in the European Union decision-making process during the initial stage, when precise projects are drawn up. Comino also stressed the need for Italy to play a more leading role in the European Union, "a more qualified presence," with less emphasis on its presence in the bureaucratic apparatus. Asked to comment on the reaction of Italy's European Union partners to the presence in the Rome executive of ministers from the National Alliance, the rightist party born from the neo-fascist MSI [Italian Social Movement], Comini replied "Foreign Minister Martino has already re-assured the Europeans" and that on this question "there has been a lot of exploitation by many sides."
