[passage omitted] The three contracts are as follows: - The ROH contract, worth Fr3.5 billion, provides for the upgrading of four 2,000-tonne frigates and two 10,000-tonne refueling tankers sold in 1980 (Sawari I contract). The upgrading, to be carried out in Toulon (Var region) by the French Naval Construction Division (DCN), entails over 3 million hours of work for DCN and 1.2 million hours for subcontractors and services suppliers (Thomson-CSF, Navfco). To this must be added the support services for the six ships' crews, which will remain on board during the whole upgrading process. To take full advantage of this period of inactivity, some equipment and on-board weapon systems will also be upgraded. - The SLBS (Logistical Support for Bitube and Shahine Systems) maintenance contract, worth Fr3.4 billion, is the continuation of the 'Al-Thaked contract (1984), which provided for the provision of short-range ground-to-air Crotale-Shahine missiles batteries and bitube 30-millimeter weapon systems (complete with command stations, carriages, and radars). French manufacturers will supply spare parts and technical assistance. - The Shola maintenance contract, worth about Fr2 billion, involves rocket thruster units for short-range ground-to-air Shahine and Crotale missiles previously purchased by Saudi Arabia. The program provides for replacing several hundred thruster units intended for all missiles already sold, and includes technical assistance. Both missile-related contracts entail some 4.5 million hours of work, which will be distributed between project leader Thomson-CSF and its major subcontractors (Giat industrie, Renault Vehicules Industriels, Matra, SNPE [National Company for Powders and Explosives]).
