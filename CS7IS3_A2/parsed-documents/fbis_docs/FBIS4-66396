The scientists fused the liver cancer cells and the activated B cells, both were obtained from white rats, to produce new hybrid cells (vaccine). After being injected back into the white rats, the hybrid cells (vaccine) induce the rat's immune system (B-Cells) to produce antibodies, which can automatically recognize the cancer cells and kill them. Test results indicated that white rats receiving injections of both newly-developed hybrid cells (vaccine) and cancer cells at the same time have survived, those receiving only cancer cells died within 60 days. The hybrid cells can prevent cancerization of normal cells as well. It is the first successful research worldwide to use immune cells (B cells) to develop vaccine. The achievement has laid the foundation for using vaccines to prevent and treat liver cancer.
