Speaking about numerous meetings he had in New York, among them with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and with ambassadors of the Security Council permanent member states and other prominent UN figures, the Yugoslav prime minister emphasized the efforts Yugoslavia was making for a peaceful resolution of the Yugoslav crisis. Prime Minister Kontic received support for the Yugoslav position -- that the planned NATO military action in Sarajevo could threaten the peace process in Bosnia and bring about an escalation of the crisis -- during his talks with the Brazilian ambassador, who is also the president of the UN Sanctions Committee, the Nigerian ambassador, and in his numerous talks with representatives of influential UN members such as Japan, India, EU countries, and with well-known journalists. Calling for a more aggressive and organized approach by our country in attempts to break through the information blockade, Kontic appealed for a stronger offensive by the Yugoslav media in presenting the truth about Yugoslavia and about our country's humanitarian needs caused by the vast numbers of refugees of all nationalities who had found refuge here. Only our reintegration into the United Nations can make a full contribution toward peace in the Balkans, Kontic stressed. With the exception of the official representatives of the American administration, who he did not meet, most of the officials with whom he held talks showed understanding and willingness for the lifting, that is softening, of the sanctions against our country, Kontic said. Sanctions were described as counterproductive and inhuman, as an expression of the international community's inability to influence the resolution of the crisis through political means. The first concrete result of my visit to New York, Kontic said, will emerge in the humanitarian sphere. Due to the hitherto lack of knowledge about humanitarian needs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Under Secretary James Grant promised aid for Yugoslav children to the tune of several million dollars. While waiting for the sanctions to be lifted, Yugoslavia will, more easily than before, be able to secure raw materials for medicines, about which Prime Minister Kontic spoke with Butrus-Ghali, among other things. At his news conference, Kontic expressed pleasure for the timely deployment of UN peace forces on positions around Sarajevo from where the Serbs withdrew, thus preventing the escalation of the conflict. He described the NATO ultimatum as: Knocking on an open door, because back on 6 February Bosnian Serbs and UN Secretary General's envoy Yasushi Akashi reached an agreement on the withdrawal of heavy weaponry around Sarajevo and an agreement on that was later reached by Bosnian Serbs and Muslims. Speaking about a meeting with IMF representatives, Kontic said that this international institution did not change its attitude toward the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but underscored the need to maintain constant contacts with the IMF because of this institution's importance for Yugoslavia's economic recovery and development. The Yugoslav prime minister positively assessed his talks with representatives of our emigrants in the United States, who displayed significant interest in providing help for the stabilization program.
