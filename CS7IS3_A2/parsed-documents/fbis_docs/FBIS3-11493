This process should conclude by 25 March. The final disarmament will take place on 8 April taking into account, as Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta and rebel leader Jose Angel Talavera have reported, the gradual demobilization because some details, like acquiring land and implementing emergency employment programs for Talavera's demobilized men, have yet to be worked out. Government Minister Mendieta reported that a member of the Northern Front will join the Interinstitutional Commission supervising the rebels disarmament in the country's north.
