ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency is today excluding from the RCRA regulatory definition of solid waste certain in-process recycled secondary materials utilized by the petroleum refining industry.

EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective on July 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: The official record for this rulemaking is identified as Docket Number F&hyph;94&hyph;SWF&hyph;FFFFF and is located in the EPA RCRA docket, Room 2616, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.
