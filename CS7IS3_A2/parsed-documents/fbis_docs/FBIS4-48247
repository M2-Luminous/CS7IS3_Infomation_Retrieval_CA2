[passage omitted]. Twagiramungu The CCFDC is headed by the MDR's Faustin Twagiramungu, who, according to the Arusha peace agreements, should have led the transition government (which was to include the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]). However, partly due to the delaying tactics of Habyarimana, the transition government never came into being, although today it constitutes the only legal basis in Rwanda. Yesterday [13 May], Twagiramungu, who himself barely escaped death and was smuggled out of Kigali by the Blue Helmets, presented the viewpoints of the CCFDC. He left no doubt that the interim government, and more specifically the MRND [National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development] and the CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] are responsible for the slaughter of the Tutsi minority and of political opponents carried out by "the Presidential Guard, the army, the gendarmerie, and the Interahamwe [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic militia] ." Among other things, the CCFDC is demanding that the Presidential Guard be disbanded and that the group of extremist army officers be arrested. It is calling for those officers and noncommissioned officers who are not directly involved in the slaughter to "come to the aid of the people and eliminate the criminals." According to Twagiramungu, the interim government has no legitimacy. Not only does its composition violate the Arusha agreement, but according to Twagiramungu, "it does not even comply with the 1991 constitution. The current `president' has not sworn any oath before Parliament, and the parties have never approved their members' participation in government." It is precisely that constitution, which dates from before Arusha, which the interim government is referring to as its legal basis. Patriotic Front Twagiramungu's rejection of the interim government contrasted sharply with his support for the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which according to him "is respecting the Arusha agreements" and "was acting in self-defense "when it resorted to arms again."
