FR940830-2-00077 FR940830-2-00047 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Community Support Program: Cooperative Agreements for Employment Intervention Demonstration Program AGENCY: Center for Mental Health Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), HHS. ACTION: Notice of availability of funds and request for applications. *Â§It is important to note that applications are invited based on the funding levels proposed in the President's budget for fiscal year 1995. However, this RFA is being announced prior to an appropriation of funds in order to allow applicants sufficient time to establish collaboration and coordination and prepare applications. Solicitation of applications in advance of an appropriation will also enable the award of appropriated grant funds in the most expeditious manner and allow prompt implementation and evaluation of promising employment intervention programs for adults with severe mental illnesses. All applicants should understand, however, that final appropriation action will be necessary in order for CMHS to fund any applications. Questions regarding the status of the appropriation of funds should be directed to the program official listed under Contacts for Additional Information in this notice. SUMMARY: The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) announces the availability of demonstration grants to document the effectiveness of programs designed to enhance competitive employment for adults with severe mental illnesses. Funds will be awarded through the Community Support Program (CSP) of the Division of Demonstration Programs of CMHS. This request for applications (RFA) solicits applications for two types of awards: Demonstration Sites and a Coordinating Center. This demonstration program addresses a priority mental health need: the enhancement of competitive employment for adults with severe mental illnesses. A collaborative, multisite approach is essential to test the effectiveness of different employment interventions and synthesize the intervention results. Because of the complexity of the program, requiring substantial programmatic involvement of CMHS staff to facilitate communication and coordination across projects, the cooperative agreement mechanism is being used.
