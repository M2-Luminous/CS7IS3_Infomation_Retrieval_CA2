Today Kilpatrick participated in the signing of a $20 million loan agreement that will be used to finance the purchasing of equipment for the new Panque Hydroelectric Power Plant that is being built in southern Chile. The Canadian official stressed that in his government's opinion "there are no inadequacies whatsoever" preventing Chile's incorporation into NAFTA, and that Ottawa has officially communicated its favorable stance to Santiago. Initial reports indicate that Chile's incorporation could be "relatively quick" because only a few changes "of little importance" would be necessary, Kilpatrick added. The minister said Canadian participation in NAFTA was positive, adding that even though the agreement was extended to include Mexico in January 1994, trade between the two countries had already started to increase. Allen Kilpatrick emphasized the importance of Canadian investments in Chile, which total $3 billion and are mainly concentrated in the mining area. Kilpatrick added that current studies contemplate additional investments of $1 billion in Chile.
