Aleksey Kondaurov told CRIME-PRESS on Thursday that all officers of the former Security Ministry will have to pass qualification tests before getting a new employment, however he denied that this would be a "personnel purge". "If anyone is to be dismissed, this would be done only at his own request or in connection with retirement", he added. The new provisions for the counterintelligence service, which were approved by the Russian president and to who it will directly report, entrust it with the struggle against all types of espionage - economic, political, military and scientific. Besides, the service will fight terrorism and drug trafficking, according to Kondaurov who added that the service will no longer engage in activities alien to counterintelligence tasks. The former Security Ministry anti-organised crime department was transferred to the Interior Ministry, while the investigation department became a part of the office of the Russian prosecutor general. The former KGB investigation prison in Lefortovo was also transferred to the Interior Ministry. The service will consist of four major departments - counterintelligence, military counterintelligence, economic counterintelligence, terrorism and drug fighting, according to Kondaurov.
