Africa's Election"] [Text] Johannesburg, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The international mediation between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha Freedom Party over constitutional difference, which is due to start tomorrow, will have a great impact on South Africa's first non-racial election slated for April 26-28. The ANC accepted Inkatha's proposal for international mediation on March 3 in an attempt to break the deadlock over Inkatha's participation in the election process. However, Inkatha insisted later that the election be postponed if the mediation starts. Because of Inkatha's precondition the mediation has delayed. At the four-way summit among President F.W. de Klerk, ANC President Nelson Mandela, Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini last Friday [8 April], the mediation issue was raised again. Though the problem of the terms of reference for the mediation was not resolved, the leaders decided to go ahead with the process. The government has been lukewarm about the international mediation, fearing it could reopen a range of already-settled constitutional issues. But at the summit it agreed to become a party to the mediations process. The constitutional differences between the ANC and Inkatha focused on the autonomy power of regions after the election. Inkatha favors virtual regional autonomy, while the ANC only agrees to extension of regional powers. The differences made Inkatha more determined than ever to boycott the election process. Inkatha's anti-election campaign has prompted the political fighting between supporters of the two organizations. Last month, 552 people died of political violence in South Africa, of them 310 in Natal-kwaZulu, the stronghold of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. The failure of last Friday's summit marked the end of the road in a long line of efforts to woo Buthelezi into the transitional process and made the prospect for the successful conduct of the poll more gloomy. In such a situation, the beginning of the mediation seems more crucial for breaking the deadlock before the election in two weeks' time. ANC President Mandela said today that he is confident the international mediation can resolve the deadlock over Inkatha's participation in the election process. There are indications here that if the mediation makes progress in settling part of the constitutional difference, Inkatha might contest the regional election. As Inkatha failed to confirm its participation in the election and submit its candidates before the deadline set by the independent electoral commission, it has lost the chance to contest the national election. But analysts said that Inkatha's participation in provincial election could help check the wave of political violence and create conditions favorable to the election. In an interview with XINHUA yesterday, ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus said that the ANC welcomes Inkatha's participation in the election process because it could help stabilize the political situation before and after the election. The ANC spokesman said that Friday's follow-up summit among the four leaders is "really a last attempt" to resolve the Natal crisis and remove obstacles to the election, but a positive outcome is unlikely. Upon his arrival here today, former British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington, one of the seven foreign mediators, declined to make comment on prospects of the mediation. He said he and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger felt honored to have been invited to mediate. It is reported that the terms of the reference for the mediation will be determined once the seven mediators arrive. But ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa today warned against Inkatha's expectations that the election might be delayed once the mediation starts. It is still unknown if Inkatha will stick to its demand for the postponement of election as a precondition for the mediation. If so, the mediation could fail to achieve its objective.
