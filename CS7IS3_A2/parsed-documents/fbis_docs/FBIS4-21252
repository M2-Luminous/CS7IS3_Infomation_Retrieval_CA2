The two men were actually spreading the green stuff out to dry, when the police interrupted the operations, and both of them ran off. But Alleyne, 31, was later apprehended and confessed that he had helped lift bags, containing over 100 pounds of marijuana, from a car. Pleaded Guilty Yesterday, with Sergeant John Hinkson prosecuting, in District "A" Criminal Court "B", the young vendor pleaded guilty and Magistrate Carlisle Greaves ordered him to pay $3,000 in three months, or spend 18 months in prison. According to Alleyne, the stuff had "just come into the island," and he was helping a friend to sort it out.
