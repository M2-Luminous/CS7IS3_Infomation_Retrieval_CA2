Reheating Produces Maximum Efficiency"; first paragraph isan introduction] [Text] 23 Nov 93 (HANDELSBLATT-TL)--So-called combined-cycle powerplants presently offer the most efficient technology for the considerate-of-the-environment "conversion to energy" of fossil fuels. Plants presently in service are today achieving efficiency of about 53 percent. An international team of ABB engineers has now succeeded, by means of a new kind of gas turbine design, in around two years ofdevelopment work, in markedly pushing up the previous optimum value forcombined-cycle plants. The thermal efficiency of the new gas turbines (the ratio of the input fuel energy to the effective output) is 38 percent in solo operation and reaches over 58 percent in the combined-cycle process. This means anaround 10 percent lowering of specific fuel costs. Carbon dioxide emissions are reduced to the same extent. The most powerful version of Th)0*0*0*00T the new turbine generation (type GT26) attains 240 MW and accordinglyhas to be the most powerful gas turbine in the world at present. A 165-MW version is being offered for the 60-Hz market. The gas turbine is the key component of a combined-cycle power plant: In the gas-steam process, an approximately 1200-degree-Celsius hot compressed fuel-air mixture leaves the combustion chamber and sets the gas turbine rotating, which generates electrical energy in a coupled generator. Steam is generated by the over 600-degree-Celsius hot exhaust gases in a downstream waste-heat boiler, and this steam in turn impels the steam turbine. While the steam turbine process has largely been exhausted technicallytoday, gas turbines still offer potential for development. While the efficiency of a gas turbine--of the then BBC installed in 1939 in Neuchatel in Switzerland--was around 15 percent, the most powerful of the turbines in service today reaches around 35 percent. The reason: Thanks to new kinds of materials and optimized blade and vane cooling, in the decades that have gone by, turbine inlet temperatures have been able to be raised from around 800 degrees to over 1200 degrees Celsius. Improvements are possible, even yet, by raising the inlet temperature further. However, substantial outlays have to be made for this that would result in only fractions of a percentage point. Therefore, the engineers at ABB banked alternatively on higher compression and two-stage combustion instead of on higher temperatures. The principal component of the new design is a multistage combustion chamber--the term sequential combustion is also used--in which the more highly compressed air is utilized twice in two turbine stages. Two combustion chambers are connected in series for this "reheating technology." The air drawn in leaves the compressor at about 30 bars (double the norm thus far in power plant turbines) and is swirled intensively with the fuel and ignited in the combustion chamber of the high-pressure stage, and drives the single-stage high-pressure-component turbine. So-called low-NO<inf> x</inf> burners get to be used here. The cooled, expanded, but still oxygen-rich mixture is led into the low-pressure combustion chamber, which operates with similar burner equipment. There fuel is again supplied and swirled and the mixture is ignited automatically and drives the low-pressure turbine stages. The pressure ratios are in keeping with those of conventional gas turbines (15 bars). An especially lean fuel-air mixture having a very high percentage of oxygen is burned in the first annular combustion chamber. The first turbine stage consumes approximately 60 percent of the total fuel required. The air for combustion is compressed beforehand in a 30-to-1 ratio in the compressor by the 22 flow-optimized compressor stages and arrives at the low-NO<inf> x</inf> burners through airflow ducts. There the compressed air is mixed with precisely measured quantities of fuel into an intensively swirling stream before the fuel-air mixture ignitesin the combustion chamber.The especially intensive swirling of the fuel-air mixture is achieved by means of the offset conical half-shells of the burners. The special geometry ensures steady independently "standing" flames in front of the burner members. A total of 30 of these low-NO<inf> x</inf> burners are distributed uniformly over the annular combustion chamber's circumference. Their simple design, in combination with the uniform distribution of the flames, reduces thermal stresses both in the combustion chamber and in the turbine. After ignition, the combustion gases flow through the single-stage high-pressure turbine and release part of their energy here before they are led further into the low-pressure combustion chamber. Advanced blade and vane cooling and the especially uniform temperature distribution--resulting from this annular combustion chamber's geometry--ensure the long life of the high-pressure turbine stage. In the second combustion chamber stage too, the still oxygen-rich combustion gases are led into premix gas burners that operate according to the same principle as the burners in the high-pressure section. The air is mixed intensively with the remaining fuel (about 40 percent). Here too no small flame retention baffles or similar components are required that are subject to heavy wear. This contributes to the machines' high availability and lowers maintenance costs. The cooling air is used in the combustion chambers almost totally as preheated air for combustion, so that cooling and efficiency are optimized equally. The long design of the second combustion chamber aids chemicalNO<inf> x</inf> reduction: A great part of the nitrogen oxides transported by the combustion gases is eliminated in the second stage.Advanced-design gas turbines and combined-cycle power plants have to demonstrate both excellent full-load values and good partial-load behavior. The advantages of multistage combustion chambers, relating to their design, have their full effect here. For one thing, only the first turbine [as written] stage is ignited at start-up. When quarterload is reached, the combustion gases from the high-pressure section have the temperature at which the second combustion chamber can be ignited and slowly flared up. The low-pressure-section turbine is consequently slowly heated when the machines start. The maximum turbine inlet temperature is reached not until full load here, but at quarter load in the high-pressure turbine. Controllable compressor stages aid steady partial-load behavior. No switching process or control action whatsoever are required during start-up. Besides, this technology involves the capability of using oil as fuel if gas is not available, with comparable output data.The design offers additional advantages besides a substantial achievement leap in efficiency: Because the turbine inlet temperature was raised only slightly considering the turbine, the engineers were able to fall back on known materials and proven processes. The substantial improvements in the matters of energy conversion and emission characteristics were realized by intelligently combining already proven techniques. The higher compression in the first turbine stage enables high specific output with a compact design. Thus, with this design one achieves power density not previously considered possible, and the mechanical loading of rotating parts is also relatively low. And the environment benefits too: Compared with a conventional gas turbine (efficiency of around 34.5 percent), gas consumption is reducedby 33,000 tons per year in 6000 hours of operation, and 90,000 tons of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide do not form at all. The lower fuel costs contrast with comparable investment costs per megawatt. There is still development potential remaining because of the disassociation of turbine inlet temperature and efficiency. An order has already come in from the United States: The Jersey CentralPower & Light Company ordered the sister model the GT 24, designed for the 60-Hz market. This turbine, which has an output of 165 MW, is to go into service in July 1996. The researchers in their work were able to build on know-how in multistage combustion chambers and two-stage gas turbines gained by the engineers of the former BBC: Engineers at the Beznau power station in Switzerland implemented as early as 1948 a similar--though technologically very extravagant--two-shaft design. A total of 25 such units were installed, having outputs of between 20 and 25 MW. And a single-shaft two-stage unit having two silo-type [large diameter] combustion chambers connected in series was implemented in 1978 at the 290-MW Huntorf air storage gas turbine power plant northwest of Bremen. The Huntorf power plant is still in service today, just as are nine two-shaft units.
