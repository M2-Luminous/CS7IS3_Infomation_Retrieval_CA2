FBIS3-29770 "dreas036__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-036-A Document Type:Daily Report 23 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Hosokawa on DPRK Issue, U.S. Economic Ties OW2202135694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 19 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2202135694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] At the lower house Budget Committee session held on the afternoon of 18 February, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa commented on the issue of the suspected development of nuclear weapons by the DPRK (North Korea) and explained how Japan will deal with the situation in case the UN Security Council decides to impose economic sanctions on North Korea, saying: 1) It is a matter of course that Japan has to take responsible actions should the Security Council decide to do so; and 2) Japan agrees with the UN Charter and will take responsible actions within the limit of the Japanese Constitution. In this way, he went into more detail than before and disclosed a plan to cooperate with the United Nations in wide-ranging areas to impose economic sanctions on North Korea. At the recent Japanese-U.S. summit talks, the prime minister explained his view regarding the issue of economic sanctions against North Korea, saying, "We will do our best in dealing with the situation within the limits of our law." At the Budget Committee session on the same day, Michio Watanabe asked Hosokawa if what the latter meant by "the law is the Constitution or another law?" In response, the prime minister explained, "What I meant to say was the Constitution." Moreover, Watanabe asked: "We need to revise the self-defense law if economic sanctions are imposed on North Korea. Do you mean to say that you will not hesitate, within the limits of the Constitution, to revise laws needed for crisis management?" The prime minister replied, "We will deal with situations within the limits of the Constitution more than the limits of the UN Charter." In this way, he indicated his opinion that he will revise the relevant laws, including the self-defense law. It seems that Hosokawa -- while keeping in mind the high possibility that the United Nations may carry out a blockade in the waters around North Korea should the Security Council decide to impose economic sanctions on North Korea -- indicated his stand that in addition to taking some measures regarding the issue of remittances to North Korea by Korean residents in Japan, it is possible to start making some contributions to such UN activities. Following the rupture of the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, the United States is strengthening its plan to impose sanctions on Japan. In this regard, the prime minister urged the United States to take a prudent stand. He then explained how Japan will deal with the situation, stressing: "We can make no guess, but must see what kind of measures the United States actually will take. We should try to respond calmly." He explained that Japan will bring the case to the GATT "in accordance with international rules" if the United States actually imposes sanctions on Japan. Takashi Fukaya of the Liberal Democratic Party strongly demanded that the prime minister assume responsibility for an announcement on the idea of introducing a national welfare tax, saying "the problem was the decisionmaking process." The prime minister rejected this demand and said: "It was decided hurriedly, so there might have been a problem with the process. However, nothing is wrong with the fact that the ruling parties' initial ideas were used as a springboard for discussions, and I brought the whole matter to a conclusion on the basis of my own decision." As for the tax system reform, Hosokawa stated, "Efforts to trim unnecessary expenses or to revise the unfair tax system alone cannot support the aging society financially." In this way, he explained his view that a hike in the consumption tax is inevitable. He said this in response to a question by Yoshiaki Matsumoto of the Japan Communist Party.
