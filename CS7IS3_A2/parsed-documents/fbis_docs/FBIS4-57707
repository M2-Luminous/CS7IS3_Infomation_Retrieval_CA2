He stated that nobody in the past few years has the moral superiority to judge the various governments of the past three decades. He said that the time has come to positively fill the gap that separates politicians from military men by building a state national defense policy. [Begin Perez recording] The times of impositions are long gone. We do not believe in a formal subordination based on the authority of whoever signs a decree. We believe the subordination of military men to the political authority is the way a democratic society keeps a legitimate space to implement a military policy with full respect for the Constitution.

He said the strategy of his government's productive modernization plan is to improve national enterprises, enhancing their international competitiveness. Today President Frei met with Army Commander General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte who informed him of a trip abroad he will make soon.
