Colombo said the effects of the ruling were "terrifying" as Mastella explained that within the 30 trillion price tag were the funds in arrears and the costs of an earlier Constitutional Court ruling on the transfer of benefits to the heir of a deceased person drawing a pension. Some 7,000 cases were covered by the December ruling, he said. Tomorrow, the labor minister will confer with the three economics ministers, Budget, Treasury and Finance, and then the "hot potato" will reach the premier's office. "It is obvious that an issue of this breadth will directly involve the premier as well. The matter concerns the government as a whole," added Mastella. He went on to say, "After a meeting with Colombo Saturday [11 June], I thought it might rain. This is not the case. It's a flood." An initial check of the figures involved was enough to make "one lose one's head," he stressed. Also speaking out today on the nation's social security system was Budget Minister Giancarlo Pagliarini who said that the pension system is devoid of ethics, is burdened by pension debt towards the citizens made up of pension benefits already payable of some 3,000 trillion lire (187.5 billion dollars) and must be changed. On the attack in a statement delivered at a conference in Milan, the minister said the present system "forces our children to pay our pensions." In other words, "with the contributions we pay, we are not building our own pensions but a sort of credit towards those who will pay us our pensions." On the transfer of funds from state coffers to INPS, Pagliarini said these transfers in 1994 will come to 74 trillion lire (46.25 billion dollars), "equal to the cost of three tunnels under the English Channel or about 14 percent of gross domestic product." On the side of remedies, the minister said he wanted to see "the removal of all fiscal dis-incentives on pension funds to get them started immediately." Pagliarini also said he would favor a mid-year supplementary budget of five trillion lire (3.125 billion dollars) and noted that a decision along these lines would be up to Premier Silvio Berlusconi. Meeting members of the foreign press here, the minister recalled that the budget deficit target for the year is 154 trillion lire whereas the figure of 159 trillion (nearly 100 billion dollars) has been indicated as more realistic. He also spoke of the prospect of another correction required for the shortfall of up to 30 trillion lire in INPS accounts as a result of the court ruling.
