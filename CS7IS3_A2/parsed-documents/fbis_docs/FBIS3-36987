In a statement he published jointly with current Ingush Vice President Boris Agapov in Nazran today, Aushev pointed out that "the people's will was above all for him." During his meeting with candidates to the new republican parliament which will be re-elected on the same day, Aushev was told that the people will boycott the elections and a referendum on the new Ingush constitution if he refused nomination for president. The statement points out: "We, with respect to the revival of the statehood of the Ingush people, consolidation of the people of Ingushetia in the name of peace and prosperity, having respect for numerous requests, oral and written addresses by workers, elders, clergymen, youth and representatives of all other layers of society and considering it impossible not to meet their wishes, express our consent to fulfil the duties of president and vice president of Ingushetia, if our powers are confirmed at the elections on February 27, 1994." Observers believe that their statement is actually a form of registration for president and vice president. Their opinion was later confirmed by the central election commission chairman, Batyr Taldiyev.
