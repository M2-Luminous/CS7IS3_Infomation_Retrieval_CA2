Standard and Poor's reduction of Turkey's credibility rating from BB to B Plus stirred the dollar value in the banks and on the black market. The value of the dollar varied from 34,200 to 35,150 Turkish lira in the interbank markets when the market opened yesterday. However, the Central Bank's decision to have the Turkish currency bought and sold with an interest of 400 and 600 percent respectively reduced the value of the dollar. The dollar ended up dropping only 150-200 Turkish lira. By yesterday evening the banks were in short supply of Turkish lira, forcing them to sell some of their accumulated dollars. Consequently, the value of the dollar decreased to 34,400 Turkish lira when the money markets closed for the day. Compared with the previous day, the value of the dollar still increased by 400 Turkish lira. Meanwhile, the interest on the Turkish lira fell from 400 to 375 percent. The situation on the black market was no different from that in the banks yesterday. The fall in Turkey's credibility rating in the international money markets increased the demand for foreign currency. The value of the dollar was 33,300 Turkish lira on the black market early the day before yesterday. It increased by 1,200 Turkish lira to 34,500 by noon. But the balances changed by the evening and sales increased. Consequently, the increase in the value of the dollar was only 100 Turkish lira when the markets closed. The dollar was worth 33,400 Turkish lira. The German mark was in a similar situation. It rose from 19,900 to 20,300 Turkish lira. Experts have predicted that foreign currencies will continue to fluctuate over the next few days. [passage omitted]
