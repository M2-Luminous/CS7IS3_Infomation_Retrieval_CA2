[passage omitted] We have also learned that, during this process of refugees returning from Tanzania, local authorities in Tanzania held those persons who had taken part in massacres in detention centers. Detentions also should be carried out in other neighboring countries, notably in Zaire, where there are Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development, MRND, militia, [Interahamwe] ready to massacre those Rwandan refugees who have settled there. Indeed, a considerable number of Coalition for the Defense of the Republic militiamen have gone to Zaire via the border town of Goma, with a plan similar to the one which was just implemented in Rwanda: To exterminate anyone whom the puppet Gitarama government does not want to see alive. This question concerns Rwandan refugees, but also others living in Zaire, notably in the Masisi, Walikale and Rutshuru zones of the Goma subregion. [passage omitted]
