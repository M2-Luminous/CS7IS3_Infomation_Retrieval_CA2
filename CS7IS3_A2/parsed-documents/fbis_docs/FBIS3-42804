The deputies understand that the committee's work may have a real effect not only on the economy but also on policy. It is therefore no accident that 43 Duma members--that is, practically one in 10--expressed a desire to work on this committee. Among them are such notables as Academician Nikolay Petrakov, commentator Vasiliy Selyunin, and Aleksandr Pochinok, who headed an analogous committee in the previous parliament. All factions and deputy groups are represented in the committee, plus a good number of independent deputies. Most are professionals: economists, finance specialists, banking professionals, and entrepreneurs. "At the very first meetings," remarks M. Zadornov, "we agreed that we will try to leave our political leanings and disagreements outside working meetings, and will be guided exclusively by the principles of professionalism and pragmatic assessment of the situation." [Nizamutdinov] And where do you intend to start? [Zadornov] By placing all work into the framework of the law. I mean not just our committee or the Duma as a whole--I mean the work of all organs of state authority in general. For instance: Russia has entered the year 1994 without an approved federal budget. We have had the same situation for the past two years. The state budget was approved on a quarterly basis, in parts, with great procrastination and delays. Meanwhile, the current law on the budget system says that the federal budget is approved for a calendar year, and this is to be done in advance--in October of the preceding year. In other words, a practice of constant violation of the law has already developed, which produces a chain of negative consequences not only in the economic and social but also in the political sphere. A fallacious practice has developed of using the budget as an instrument of political struggle, behind-the-scenes manipulation, and all sorts of abuses. It is unimportant here who is right and who is wrong--it is the economy as a whole that suffers. That is precisely why our committee considers it a priority task to return to the procedure set forth in the law. We have already sent the government a request to submit to the Duma a draft budget for the current year, and stand ready to consider it immediately. [Nizamutdinov] Every normal family tries to plan its budget; even more so the state... [Zadornov] Precisely. But that is the problem--for at least half a year the government works practically without a program. There are no development plans even for two or three years ahead--medium range--let alone long range. The government simply follows events, adopting documents post-datum and dealing with problems on an emergency basis--be it the miners, agrarians, or individual regions. [Nizamutdinov] But if there is no, as you say, normal program, how can we talk about reforms? [Zadornov] What does this mean: "reforms"? Unfortunately, over the past two years we have developed the mass habit of substituting political cliches and incantations for real analysis. The new stereotypes have taken hold not only in the absolute majority of the mass media, but also among many specialists. "Gaydar's departure from the government means a departure from the course of reforms." But this is not so! My opinion is: There are different types of economic policy, each with characteristic features. Gaydar's policy in its pure form, as it was proclaimed at the end of 1991, ceased to exist very quickly. It was basically abandoned in May 1992; the economic policy shifted in the direction of compromise; a balancing act and concessions to individual sectors or regions came on the scene. This has been going on over the entire last year. Now we should wait before we start talking about changing course. Let the reshuffled government present its program; let it support it with concrete budget drafts, a list of priority state programs, and proposed volume of centralized financing--then we can evaluate the course, the type of economic policy chosen by the government. To think that a reformist policy means tight money and a conservative one means handing it out is too simplistic an approach. Is it possible to get by without investment? And debts have to be paid, too. But if this is done sensibly, as a one-time thing, inflation fluctuations will remain within allowable boundaries and it will be possible to attenuate them later. A clearly pronounced inflationary policy is a completely different matter. But it is too early to talk about it now. [Nizamutdinov] If the government announces such a policy, nevertheless, what will the Duma do? [Zadornov] The disposition of forces in the Duma, its blocs and alliances, have not taken a final shape yet. The LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] has its own niche; the Agrarians are pursuing their own goals, which, despite conventional wisdom, far from always and far from in everything coincide with the position of the Communists. The picture is the same on the other side of the political spectrum. There will still be a regrouping of forces. I think there will be quite a few supporters in the Duma for a considerable increase in expenditures, and thus a mutual understanding may develop between the government and the parliamentary majority. Well, we will have to give people the opportunity to find out for themselves that attempts to give in to the demands of individual sectors or regions will not bring positive results. I think, however, that freezing prices and issuing colossal credits is no longer possible now. In any case, in our committee so far the prevailing intent is to follow the road of nursing the budget back to health, gradually easing the tax burden--first and foremost for enterprises in the production sphere, making the long overdue changes in the legislative base that regulates the financial and monetary and credit sphere. [Nizamutdinov] Does nursing the budget back to health mean cutting its deficit? [Zadornov] Cutting the budget deficit is a general task, not a goal in itself. We cannot build the whole economic policy on this basis. For instance, over the entire last year Boris Fedorov maintained a special position in the government. His actions were aimed at containing the deficit by any means possible--sometimes even not quite proper means, not allowing additional money emission. We have to give him credit: he accomplished principally important steps in the direction of changing the type of our economy--removing import subsidies, which used to be immense, and suspending the practice of preferential credits that had been used for who knows what purpose. But at the same time other important directions--for instance, credit policy--did not get the proper attention. These are the issues--investment, taxes, insurance, banking activities, including the Central Bank--that we will be dealing with in addition to budget issues. [Nizamutdinov] You mentioned the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. How are your committee's relations with these institutions developing? [Zadornov] It is too early to tell yet. The previous parliament had a confrontational relationship with the Ministry of Finance. We intend to establish normal working contacts, regardless of who will head the ministry and the Central Bank. After all, it is the Duma that sets the limits on the Central Bank's credit emission, and considers and approves the budget; therefore, normal relations are in our mutual interest.
