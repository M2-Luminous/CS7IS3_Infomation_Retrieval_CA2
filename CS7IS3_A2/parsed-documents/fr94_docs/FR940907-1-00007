FR940907-1-00007 FR940907-1-00002 The National Agricultural Statistics Service estimates 1994 California almond production at 640 million kernelweight pounds, 31 percent larger than last year. If realized, this could be one of the largest crops on record. In order to lessen the impact of this projected large almond supply facing the industry, the Board, at its July 7, 1994, meeting in Modesto, California, recommended establishing salable, reserve, and export percentages for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year by a vote of seven to three. This proposal would require handlers of California almonds to withhold, as a reserve, from normal domestic and export markets, 10 percent of the merchantable almonds they receive from growers during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. The remaining 90 percent (the salable percentage) of the crop could be sold by handlers in any market at any time. The last year salable and reserve percentages were established was the 1991&hyph;92 crop year. Almond production, like that of many agricultural commodities, can vary significantly from season-to-season due to a variety of factors. This in turn can cause wide fluctuations in prices. For example, the Board has estimated grower prices increased from $1.26 per pound for 1992 crop almonds to nearly $2.00 per pound for 1993 crop almonds, when the corresponding estimated shipments for those crop years were 535.9 million pounds and 497.7 million pounds, respectively. The large 1994 California almond crop estimate has caused early speculation of grower prices in the $1.15 per pound range. Such swings in supplies and price levels can result in market instability and uncertainty for growers, handlers, buyers, and consumers. The long term goal of the almond industry is to increase almond consumption and demand, and the Board believes this can be best achieved in the presence of stable and orderly market conditions. The Board believes that the use of the reserve provisions of the marketing order as a supply management tool, in conjunction with other marketing tools available in the order, can assist in accomplishing the industry's goals. While this rule could restrict the amount of almonds which handlers could sell in normal domestic and export markets in the short term, the proposed salable and reserve percentages are intended to promote orderly marketing conditions by avoiding unreasonable fluctuations in supplies and prices and improving grower returns. Further, this proposed rule could help provide market stability during the 1995&hyph;96 crop year by reserving almonds for shipment during that season in the event 1995 production is below trade demand needs. Authority to establish salable and reserve percentages is provided in §981.47 of the order. Section 981.66 authorizes disposition of reserve almonds to certain outlets, including export. Pursuant to §§981.47 and 981.49 of the order, the Board based its recommendation for salable, reserve, and export percentages of 90 percent, 10 percent, and 0 percent, respectively, on estimates of marketable supply and combined domestic and export trade demand for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. The Board's 1994 marketable production estimate of 620.8 million kernelweight pounds is based on a 1994 crop estimate issued by the National Agricultural Statistics Service of 640 million kernelweight pounds, minus an estimated loss of 19.2 million kernelweight pounds resulting from the removal of inedible kernels by handlers and losses during manufacturing. Trade demand is estimated at 556.4 million kernelweight pounds_175 million pounds for domestic needs and 381.4 million pounds for export needs. An inventory adjustment is made to account for supplies of salable almonds carried in from the 1993&hyph;94 crop year and for supplies of salable almonds deemed desirable to be carried out on June 30, 1995, for early season shipment during the 1995&hyph;96 crop year. After adjusting for inventory, the trade demand is calculated at 556.8 million kernelweight pounds. This is the quantity of almonds from the estimated 1994 marketable production deemed necessary to meet trade demand needs. The proposed salable percentage of 90 percent would meet those needs. The remaining 10 percent (64 million kernelweight pounds) of the 1994 crop marketable production would be withheld by handlers to meet their reserve obligations. The percentage of reserve almonds available for export is recommended at 0 percent. Although the order permits establishment of a percentage of reserve almonds that could be exported, export is currently the largest market for California almonds and is not considered a secondary or noncompetitive outlet. Therefore, exports would be included in trade demand and the export market would not be an authorized reserve outlet. All or part of reserve almonds could be released to the salable category if it is found that the supply made available by the salable percentage is insufficient to satisfy 1994&hyph;95 trade demand needs, including desirable carryover for use during the 1995&hyph;96 crop year. The Board is required to make any recommendations to the Secretary to increase the salable percentage prior to May 15, 1995, pursuant to §981.48 of the order. Alternatively, all or a portion of reserve almonds could be sold by the Board, or by handlers under agreement with the Board, to governmental agencies or charitable institutions or for diversion into almond oil, almond butter, animal feed, or other outlets which the Board finds are noncompetitive with existing normal markets for almonds.
