Molina, however, denied that he himself received the death threat, but he did not rule out the possibility that such a threat had indeed been made. According to news agencies reports, Molina was given 48 hours to leave the country, or he will be executed. [Begin Molina recording] I cannot rule out the possibility that the threat, which was uttered by people who oppose peace and the country's stability, might be serious. [end recording] Molina added that despite the threat, he is willing to remain in his post, because he has made a pledge to the people and intends to fulfill it. He also said he will open an investigation to identify the individuals behind the threats -- individuals he said should be considered enemies of peace. [Begin Molina recording] The threats against several Jesuits do not contribute to the peace process whatsoever. Instead, each voice that calls for violence undermines the present trend toward peace. [end recording] A communique signed by the Domingo Monterrosa Command and reported by various news agencies also contains death against the attorney general, the president of the Judiciary Council, Jesuit priests, and Luis Gomez Zarate for his criticism of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.
