The text of the order appointing the new supervisor of the KEYHAN Institute is as follows: In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate Mr. Hoseyn Shari'atmadari, may your successes continue: In view of the resignation of Seyyed Mohammad Asghari and with appreciation for his continuous and concerned effort as a worthy cultural leader, I appoint you, an esteemed public figure with high merit and an unusual record of revolutionary and cultural service from an exalted family of martyrs, as my representative and supervisor of the KEYHAN Institute. KEYHAN is a great institution and has vast capacities. It is necessary to make the best use of this asset for the growth and advancement of the thought, culture, and awareness of the dear nation of Iran. The press in Islamic and revolutionary Iran has a great responsibility on its shoulders to guide thought, explain the truth, and defend against the assaults of foreigners. Indifference towards the intellectual needs of the nation of Iran and indifference to their Islamic and revolutionary aspirations, which is evident in some of the nation's current press, is an evil that will not be forgiven in the judgment of our people now or in the future, and ultimately before the court of God in the hereafter. Rebellion and opposition to these aspirations unfortunately also exists in a number of publications, which abuse the freedoms to which the Islamic Republic of Iran adheres, and this will not be forgotten. KEYHAN is a publication that, praise God, has advanced on the path of growth and interests and has not been contaminated. Even so, this institution is expected to make its positive role as prominent and profound as possible, and to advance all its affiliated publications to the highest level possible. In this great mission, you must ask for guidance, success and help from God and you must make use of the aid of worthy colleagues, consultants, and committed and skilled executive officers. You must earn the confidence of the people by doing good work, speaking the truth, exercising literary courage, employing the powerful Persian language in conveying information, and doing all these things while maintaining the direction of the Islam of Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the principles of the Islamic revolution. You must make the results of your efforts available to as many minds as possible in this talented, outstanding and great nation. May God help you and your respected colleagues and may you receive the special grace of His Holiness, may Almighty God preserve him. 1 Dey 1372 [22 December 1993], equivalent to 8 Rajab 1314 Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i Biography of Hoseyn Shari'atmadari Hoseyn Shari'atmadari was born in 1326 [21 March 1947-20 March 1948] in Damavand and graduated in microbiology from the Tehran University Medical College.
