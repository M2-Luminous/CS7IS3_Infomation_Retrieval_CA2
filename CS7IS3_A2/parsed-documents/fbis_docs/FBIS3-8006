"The ceasefire is going well all over Bosnia-Herzegovina except for small arms fire which is basically insignificant," said Lieutenant Colonel Bill Aikman, spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Earlier, Bosnian Serb forces besieging Sarajevo fired four mortars toward positions of the mainly Moslem Bosnian Army in the southern part of the city and small arms fire could be heard for about five minutes. Aikman said UN military observers enforcing a ceasefire agreement that went into effect last month were immediately dispatched to the region to restore calm. "In Sarajevo, the ceasefire is holding," Aikman said. "As you can see, the people can walk and be comfortable." Since February 20, the deadline set by NATO to launch air strikes against the Serbs if they failed remove their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo or place them under UN control, the Sebs have surrendered 276 cannons and the Bosnian Army has handed in 47, Aikman said. Elsewhere in Bosnia Thursday, UN military observers reported troop movement around the northern town of Brcko, which has come under heavy shelling by the Serbs. Western military sources said some 250 shells exploded Wednesday in the region of Gradacac and Brcko, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Tuzla, while 190 shells rained down on a "confrontation line" about five kilometers (three miles) east of Lukavac, near Tuzla. Automatic gun fire and mortar fire was reported at the front lines, the sources added. "Tension increased with heavy shelling in the morning and in the afternoon" of Wednesday, the sources said. Further west in the town of Bihac, local Moslem troops successfully thwarted an attempt by the Serbs to infiltrate the town while the situation in Mostar, divided between Croat and Moslem troops, was said to be "very calm" Thursday despite five shells falling on the Moslem sector. In central Bosnia, the ceasefire signed Friday by Bosnian Croats and Moslems appeared to have been generally respected. As for the northern town of Maglaj, which is besieged by the Serbs, UN officials were unable to update the situation there Thursday following reports that 4,000 shells had fallen on the city and neighboring towns the previous day. Kris Janowski, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said his agency was still waiting for the Serbs to allow a relief convoy to reach the city. Relief convoys to Maglaj, whose pre-war population of 16,000 was 45 percent Moslem, were suspended in October after two UNHCR drivers were killed just outside a tunnel that leads to the city.
