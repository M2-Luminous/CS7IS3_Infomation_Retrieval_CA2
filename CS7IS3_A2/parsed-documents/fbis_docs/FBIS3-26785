Speaking at a Security Council meeting on the situation in Bosnia, Chen Jian, China's deputy representative to the United Nations, said that the international community should "act very prudently and refrain from taking any hasty action." He said that at a time when the peace process for Bosnia was at a crucial juncture, taking further military actions would by no means help achieve political solution. "On the contrary," he said, "it will only entail negative consequences." With regard to the use of air power in that country, Chen said, China believed it should be limited to the self-defense by the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslav republic. As for the possible serious consequences of the use of air strikes on the safety of UNPROFOR personnel and the humanitarian relief activities in the Balkan country, Chen said that "we cannot but express anxiety and concern." The eventual settlement of the Bosnian crisis, Chen said, should continue to be sought within the framework of the principles set forth by the international conference on the former Yugoslavia and relevant Security Council resolutions and through peaceful negotiations so as to ensure a lasting, fair and reasonable solution that could guarantee the fundamental interests of various parties and could be accepted by all. "The parties concerned in Bosnia and Herzegovina have recently held several rounds of talks," Chen said, and "we hope all the endeavors of the international community will genuinely help promote the peace process towards the political settlement."
