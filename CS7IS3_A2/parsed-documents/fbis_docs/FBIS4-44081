Delors, whose third term ends on January 5, had been asked by Greece to stay on if the 12-nation European Union failed to agree on a successor at their summit meeting here. "I would have preferred for the four new members not to have to witness the sorry sight of my successor's designation," said Delors. He said Europe was in a "serious" crisis. Delors has headed the European Union's Executive Commission since 1984.
