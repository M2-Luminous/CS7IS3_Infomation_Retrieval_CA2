[Hata] Good morning. [Yamamoto] I understand, Mr. Hata, you have long said that you had no intention of becoming a politician. However, Mr. Hata, you are now going to become the chief executive running the state administration. How do you feel at the moment? [Hata] Well, in my career as a politician, I have always tried to challenge my own destiny. In greeting the new situation, I once again keenly feel that heavy responsibilities will rest on my shoulders. Frankly speaking, this is how I feel now. [passage omitted on discussion of various issues such as early enactment of budget bill, dual power structure, tax reform, and Hata's relationship with Ichiro Ozawa] [Yamamoto] As foreign minister, Mr. Hata, you have been directly engaged in dealing with Japan-U.S. relations. You must have a better understanding of the points at issue than anyone else. Do you have any plans to make new proposals for taking concrete measures to reduce the trade surplus or deal with other issues? [Hata] First, it has just been mentioned that Japan-U.S. relations are deadlocked at this moment. I discussed this issue with Mr. Gore, and also with U.S. Trade Representative Kantor in Marrakech recently. We have agreed that each of our two countries has now come to realize wherein lie the points at issue and major differences in our awareness, and at the same time we have come to understand well what each other has to say. However, as has been pointed out just now, it will take some time to arrive at a conclusion because these issues involve individual sectors. In this sense, frankly speaking I felt that they are concerned with macroeconomic issues, too. Therefore, as has just been pointed out, there exist such problems as what measures should be taken to expand domestic demands and to promote imports. However, I feel we should not believe that measures for expanding domestic demands or promoting imports should be taken merely for the purpose of reducing the trade surplus. On the contrary, if we tackle these issues from the viewpoint that these measures will also contribute to the improvement of the people's livelihood, I am sure we will be able to win understanding, and even the other side's understanding. As has been mentioned, these measures should be applicable also to other areas such as European and Asian countries. If they should be applicable merely to issues existing between Japan and the United States, a question will then arise: Why was it necessary for GATT talks to be held recently? I believe that in tackling these issues, attention must be paid to these factors. [passage omitted on Tanaka's remarks on increase in investment] [Tanaka] Incidentally, there is an item on deregulation in the recently-signed document on the items for confirmation in establishing the new coalition administration. However, the expression seems to indicate retrogression as compared with the statement in the Administrative Reform Outlines [ARO] published last February. It merely says that market revitalization should be promoted through extensive easing of excessive economic regulations. No mention was made on the original ARO statement which says economic regulations should be abolished in principle. Does this indicate that there is retrogression in the ARO principle because of various factors such as bureaucrats' influence or pressure from individual industrial organizations? [Hata] No. It is so stated as a brief expression but I believe there is no such influence or pressure. As a cabinet member, I have stated my views at various meetings, including panel sessions on this issue sponsored by industrial circles on some occasions. Executives of some industrial organizations have even called for implementing deregulation, maintaining that they are now determined because they understand that in easing or abolishing economic regulations, some circles are bound to be hit hard but that a society genuinely filled with vitality can never be created without overcoming such difficulties. In fact, just recently I made these remarks at a meeting held about a week or 10 days before my tour to Marrakech. [passage omitted on Uno's remarks on administrative reform] [Yamagishi] I also have something to say. I agree with your opinion. After all, it is not good for the future of Japan if it continues to be the only nation in the world with a huge trade surplus. It is necessary for Japan not only to cut its trade surplus but also to promote a shift from an external demand-oriented economy to a domestic demand-oriented one. Japan is called a nation with high nominal wages but low real wages. Why is this so? It is because commodity prices are high in this nation. In particular, housing and food prices are very high compared with those in Europe and the United States. It is a stark fact that price gaps exist between Japan and other countries. The government needs to promote thorough deregulation to rectify the price gaps. Mr. Hata just explained the policy platform agreed upon by the ruling parties. I receive this platform positively because I believe it has been formulated based on the agreement on the abolition of economic regulations reached when the Hosokawa cabinet was inaugurated. But it will not be easy to promote it. It is certain that bureaucrats will strongly oppose deregulation. In that case, the prime minister will be asked to exercise leadership. I recently met with a senior official of the ruling coalition who is a defector from the Liberal Democratic Party. He said that at the change of cabinet, the new prime minister should obtain letters of resignation from bureaucrats such as administrative vice ministers so that he can dismiss them if they do not give devoted service to the cabinet. I sincerely hope Mr. Hata will exercise powerful leadership. [Yamamoto] Let us again hear Mr. Hata's resolve to exercise leadership as prime minister. [Hata] I totally agree with what all of you have said. I met with the chief cabinet secretary and others this morning. In the meeting, they said nothing would change unless the new cabinet promotes deregulation. They expressed anxiety about the future of Japan's society and economy, and asked me to seriously consider what they said. We are fully aware of what you have pointed out. We also know from experience what will prevent the government from promoting deregulation. Keeping in mind what you have said, we will exercise leadership. [Uno] I am glad that Mr. Hata agrees with us about deregulation. There is another issue coupled with deregulation. That is decentralization of political power. It has been said that the number of regulations should be cut through deregulation, and that of the remaining regulations, those which are related to people's living should be enforced by local governments. What is important in promoting decentralization is to clarify the roles to be played by the central government, local governments, bureaucrats, and the private sector. The government's tasks include tackling diplomatic, security, and financial issues. I hope the government gives more effort to this task. Other issues which can be handled by the private sector or those related to people's living should be taken care of by local governments. I sincerely hope the government will promote decentralization by all means. I believe the former Hosokawa government was considering enacting legislation for deregulation. Also, ruling and opposition parties unanimously adopted resolutions on decentralization at both the upper and lower houses last June. Thus, I hope the new cabinet will continue efforts for decentralization. [Yamamoto] Now, we will move on to the Korean peninsula issue. Mr. Uno earlier used the word Hokusen. It is not the right name. The correct name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Well, we have outlined the main points of the coalition parties' fundamental policies. One of them is that they would abide by UN policies on the Korean issue. Does this mean that the government will give all-out cooperation to the United Nations if it decides to impose economic sanctions against North Korea? [Hata] Generally speaking, yes. However, it is said that the United Nations wants to settle the issue through dialogue while being considerate to the DPRK. I should not comment further on this matter. [Tanaka] The issue of Japan's cooperation with the United States and the ROK [in time of emergency] was also talked about at the coalition parties' policy meeting. But, the discussion became complicated because the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] wanted to include China in the cooperative ties between Japan, the United States, and the ROK. Eventually, an agreement was reached to drop China. Does that mean the coalition does not want China to be involved in critical matters of security because the United States and the ROK are involved? Was the priority order revealed, so to speak? [Hata] No, I do not think so. We are allies bound by the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and U.S.-ROK Security Treaty. As I have been saying, China has the strongest influence over the DPRK when it comes to the issue of nuclear arms development. China does not appreciate the existence of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. After all, we must have discussions with China. I think the meeting did not adopt a resolution on this issue but a chairman's statement was announced instead because of China's influential power. [Tanaka] Japan and the United States talked about the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development when Les Aspin, then U.S. secretary of state, visited Japan last fall. Of late, William Perry came to Japan and you had discussions with him on the nuclear issue. Was the U.S. secretary of defense very much worried about the North Korean nuclear issue? [Hata] Well, I do not think the situation on the Korean peninsula is such that war can break out at the slightest provocation. However, North Korea has to accept the International Atomic Energy Agency's inspections to dispel the suspicion. Otherwise, the suspicion will continue to grow in the international arena. The United States has deployed Patriot interceptor missiles in South Korea to be prepared for possible attack from North Korea. We are preparing for the worst. Fundamentally, however, we want to settle the issue through dialogue. [Tanaka] Is the U.S. Government saying that Japan should clarify how it will deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development? [Hata] No. The United States clearly understands that Japan will deal with the issue within the scope of the Constitution. Also, it is said that the United States is highly assessing the fact that Japan is holding discussions with China and other countries to settle the issue. Therefore, we think that the United States and Japan clearly understand each other's stand. [Yamamoto] It is possible that the United States and the ROK may want Japan to stop the remittance of money to North Korea even if the United Nations does not decide to impose economic sanctions against North Korea. Can you comment on this? [Hata] The United Nations still has not taken up the issue of economic sanctions as a topic of discussion. Therefore, we should not talk about something that is an assumption based on assumptions. Also, I am still only a foreign minister. Generally speaking, however, we will deal with the situation, if anything should happen, within the scope of the Constitution. [Yamamoto] One of the fundamental policies states that the government will be prepared for an emergency case. Does the emergency case mean military action? [Hata] North Korea is saying that economic sanctions will be considered as a de facto declaration of war against it. Probably, discussions were made within this context. [Tanaka] Do you think Japan will have no choice but to take further action to confine North Korean nuclear weapons if the United States says, after the United Nations adopts a resolution, that it has no choice but to assume a clearer stance to confine North Korea's nuclear weapons? [Hata] Well, I should not comment on this matter either. Generally speaking, however, some countries in other regions are succumbing to the temptation of possessing nuclear weapons. Therefore, the nuclear issue, if North Korea has actually developed nuclear weapons, will have an impact on these countries. Not only the United States but also European countries are interested in the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development. Japan, in particular, is North Korea's neighboring country so we just cannot take it easy. We have to say that North Korea, no matter what, should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. [Yamamoto] Now, I would like to ask you about imminent issues. Do you think it is difficult to make a large-scale cabinet reshuffle because budget deliberations have to start soon? [Hata] It is hard for me to comment on this matter because I am not yet prime minister. Generally speaking, the most ideal way is for the ministers who were involved in mapping out the budget draft to deal with this matter. However, since we will be forming a coalition cabinet, I think we have to listen to the opinions of each party. We will deal with this matter by taking these factors into consideration. [Yamamoto] As we have been discussing, the next administration will be confronted with many important tasks. Therefore, some members of Shinseito are of the opinion that you should have a strong cabinet lineup. [Hata] Every party has different opinions within itself. I think the current cabinet is composed of prominent people. However, there are different movements in each party. Therefore, we need to have a firm understanding of the situation to deal with the important tasks if we continue to remain in power. [Yamamoto] The leaders of all coalition parties, except for the SDPJ, are in the cabinet. Do you think [SDPJ Chairman] Murayama will join the next cabinet? [Hata] Again, I can only give you a general opinion. If we become a governing party, then...[changing thought] Originally, we agreed that party leaders would become cabinet members. If they are cabinet members, then we can meet each other every day. [Yamamoto] You can have a party leaders' meeting every day? [Hata] That's right. In that sense, I may ask Murayama to join the cabinet. However, the SDPJ may have its own idea. [Yamamoto] Do you want him to join your cabinet? [Hata] Judging from previous examples, I think you can say that. [Yamamoto] The Hosokawa cabinet had some problems with the chief cabinet secretary. What do you think of the role of chief cabinet secretary? [Hata] It is desirable if the chief cabinet secretary shares the same views as the prime minister. [Yamamoto] You mean he should play a role of supporting the prime minister? [Hata] Yes. The chief cabinet secretary is the prime minister's spokesman. [Yamamoto] They should be on intimate terms. [Hata] That's right. [Yamamoto] Does that mean the chief cabinet secretary will be selected from among the Shinseito members? [Hata] Well, I still am not prime minister yet. I can only answer you in a general way on this matter too. [Yamamoto] You will also have to select a new foreign minister, your successor. It is a very important post. Do you think factions will be an important factor in selecting your successor? [Hata] I do not think so. We are in the coalition so that I should make no bones about such things. However, we need to choose a suitable person for the post. [Tanaka] I heard that many current ministers will remain in their posts. If that is so, then are you going to ask your ministers to take a clear leadership role to promote administrative reform? As has been said before, your cabinet will be calling for free economic activities, in principle, and thereby allowing the private sector to display its own vital power. Are you going to tell your ministers to play a leadership role at each critical moment? [Hata] Needless to say, I have to do that if I am in such a position. As I said earlier, this is an issue which can be done only at the time of administration change. No zoku [group of people concerned with specific issues] exists, and members share the same intention when a new administration is formed. Therefore, that will be a good change to do what you have just said. Also, a direction for decentralization of the government can be set only at that time. [Tanaka] The voters will critically evaluate your cabinet lineup. As prime minister, are you going to tell your ministers how you will evaluate their performance? Did any prime minister give such an instruction to his cabinet members before? [Hata] When I became agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister, I was told to do everything as I wished because I had been doing what I was expected to do. [Tanaka] Are you going to say the same thing to your ministers? [Hata] If I become a prime minister, I will ask my ministers to do their best. [Yamamoto] Since politics is changing significantly, some people, needless to say, may say that the new administration should listen to the people's opinions as soon as possible. What do you think of holding a general election? [Hata] During the previous general election, the voters criticized the closed nature of politics. Another thing is that they wanted to see changes in Japanese politics. Somebody said earlier that nothing has changed. Well, the LDP became an opposition party and former opposition parties became ruling parties. I suppose it appeared strange to the people at the beginning. However, when you look around coolly, you will note that things are changing significantly. [Yamamoto] Does that mean that the next election will be held under the new system? It will not be held under the current medium-sized precinct system? [Hata] Fundamentally, I do not think that we should not restrict the prime minister's right to dissolve a cabinet. In this sense, it is possible that a general election can be held under the current system. However, we survived the previous election so that we have a general idea of what the people want. We need to respond to people's expectations. It is not the time to think about dissolving the cabinet now. [passage omitted on remarks by Uno and Yamagishi] [Yamamoto] Somebody said earlier that you should make a new ministerial post in charge of international relations. What do you think of this proposal? [Hata] Again, I have to speak on the assumption that I am in the position of forming a new cabinet. Anyhow, it will be difficult to do so if we have a double power structure. I know that some people are of the opinion that I should create the new ministerial post. However, I still do not have a clear plan for forming the new post. [Yamamoto] The time is up. Thank you very much for being with us today.
