"It is not only that local authorities have been trying to command Central Bank subsidiaries on their territories. The president's approach is dealing the final blow to the smoldering plans for turning the Bank of Russia into something resembling the U.S. Federal Reserve system with characteristically high autonomy of the regional banks within the system, plans resolutely opposed by the present leadership of the Central Bank". The same newspaper carries an interview with Colonel-General Vyacheslav Trubnikov, the first deputy chief of the External Intelligence Service, who stresses that "as concerns the composition of the world's top league of intelligence services and the place different services occupy in it, we have always been in that league and, I would like to believe, we shall always remain in it. I am sure that should the personnel of our rival services be placed in the conditions in which the Russian Intelligence Service now finds itself, many would not be able to cope. While ours are serving and will continue to serve". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an open appeal of Russian and foreign specialists to the president, government and Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, which reads, "Russia has three key sources of its unique potential for effective development and a sure place among the world's leading nations. First of all, the country has immense reserves of fuel-and-energy and mineral resources, fertile land and other natural riches. Russia's per capita resource potential is twice that of the United States, six times that of Germany and 18-20 times that of Japan. Secondly, Russia has a unique potential in its army of highly-qualified specialists and scientists capable of solving the most complex problems in the field of science, technology and production. And at last thirdly, it has a mighty production base which is second to none in a number of fields. Nonetheless, a striking contrast exists between the country's colossal potential for prosperity and the bleak reality. Regrettably, Russia's economic potential has been used not to ensure its prosperity but to pay the cost of abortive economic experiments". Commenting on the situation in Tajikistan the same newspaper says "eighteen months have elapsed since the end of open civil war in Tajikistan. But the triumph of "anti-Islamists" has brought about no long-awaited stability to the republic. There is no single Tajikistan any more. The republic is divided into dwarfish semi- feudal states with their regional armies and leaders. Incidentally it is not the traditional strongholds of the opposition which are the greatest danger to Dushanbe but the regions where the advent of the new power was greeted with enthusiasm in the not so recent past". NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA centers around the situation on the Korean peninsula: "It is quite possible that the story about the North Korean nuclear potential is another political bluff. When the winner bluffs people tend to believe him. If the bluff is eventually called, the loss will be relatively painless for one side, but the nerves of the less fortunate partners, already strained in the course of the game, might snap, and then more and more faulty moves are likely to be made". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI comment on the same situation: "In the opinion of the majority of the countries no state can be granted "a special status" under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as sought after by North Korea. This is most important not only for nuclear security on the Korean peninsula but also for non- proliferation in the whole world, because precedent might be created which will tempt other states which wish to join the nuclear club". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports that "the presidential staff and the security council are thinking about a merger of the Federal Counter- Intelligence Service and the Main Directorate of Guards of the Russian Federation. If the merger takes place, the new service will probably be headed by Mikhail Barsukov who is now chief of the directorate. FCS Chief Sergey Stepashin is likely to be appointed first deputy". According to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, "the leadership of Georgia believe that the beginning of Russia's peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia will accelerate the settlement of the conflict in the region. That Russia's politicians and military have taken up the settlement of the conflict is, in their opinion, a sing of Russia's peace-making potential for resolving conflicts on the territory of the former Soviet Union". SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA publishes an interview with Army General Valentin Varennikov who refused to be amnestied for his role in the August 1991 putsch and demanded a new trial. The general said in the interview: "I understand that the authorities do not need the trial, they would rather have me agree to the amnesty. On the other hand since I put up a resistance, they undoubtedly feel like teaching me a lesson and demonstrate that all other members of the GKCHP (the State Committee for State Emergency which planned the abortive coup) are guilty. I do not rule out such a turn of events. But I still hope that we have people capable of doing justice impartially, on the basis of law". PRAVDA reports that "while in Irkutsk Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn condemned Communism, the Soviet era and the changes now underway in the country. He said "Gorbachev destroyed the system that was, but it should not have been destroyed. It should have been revivified very slowly from below - beginning with the distribution of plots of land, with the organisation of small workshops and retail outlets". The writer added that "reforms are proceeding without a plan. The deregulation of the prices is robbery, privatisation is playing into the hands of criminals, and it should be dealt with by prosecutors and investigators. We now have oligarchy and not democracy". Solzhenitsyn was also skeptical about the Civic Concord agreement.
