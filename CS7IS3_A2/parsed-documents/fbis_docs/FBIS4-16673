Yours is a key ministry in the social sphere. What do you see as the way to resolve this problem? [Melikyan] Strictly speaking, this is our main task, and it was for this that our ministry was created. In 1993 we succeeded in preventing a further fall in the living standards of the bulk of the population and in avoiding mass unemployment. And yet we cannot speak of any turning point or the start of one. The production slump is intensifying, and stoppages of enterprises and their transfer to a reduced work week are assuming an increasingly mass nature. The growth in nonpayments and the lack of funds in enterprises' accounts have led to a sharp increase in delays over paying wages. It is natural that all this displeases and alarms people and creates social tension. It will be no exaggeration to say that the situation in the social sphere is close to being a crisis situation. [POSTFACTUM] Does this mean that there are no conditions today for implementing an effective social policy? [Melikyan] If I thought that, I would make a proposal to abolish the ministry as being useless or at least tender my resignation. It is possible and necessary to elaborate a policy, but a realistic policy. People both at the top and at the bottom must be clearly aware that there are no miracle-working prescriptions for a rapid and substantial improvement in people's lives. This is above all because society's objective potential and the actual resources which can be used for these purposes have diminished. Until the production slump ends and we surmount the economic crisis, the public loaf will merely diminish in size, not increase. Second point. I do not want to say that the ministry is doing everything it can. We have let slip a great deal and been slow to implement a number of measures. At the same time far from everything depends on us and our work. The resolution of the problems of incomes, employment, and working conditions is determined, in the final analysis, by the overall economic and financial policy that is implemented. Therefore I would formulate as follows my present credo as the minister responsible for a certain area of social policy. First, not to set myself unrealizable goals, not to make promises I cannot fulfill. But to strive for the maximum within the framework of the actual potential and the decisions adopted. Second, to be sure of real, not declarative support for the social measures being taken on the part of the president, the government, parliament, and the organs of power of the republics, the krays and oblasts, and the autonomous entities. Social policy must not be the hostage of political speculation and intrigue or of egotistical regional or corporative interests. We are convinced that in the present grave economic situation the emphasis in social policy must be placed on effective actions in several very important areas that are capable of producing a tangible return within a short time. We have put corresponding proposals to the government. They have been approved in principle. We are now working on specific documents -- draft laws, government decrees, and presidential edicts. [POSTFACTUM] Which drafts, specifically, do you mean? [Melikyan] I will name those that seem most significant. We propose to curb growth in the labor remuneration fund or the consumption fund at enterprises which have wages that exceed the average for industry. I emphasize: curb, not freeze, and introduce this measure temporarily, in conjunction with other measures to suppress inflation and to overcome disproportions in labor remuneration. Further, we propose to introduce a mechanism for curbing growth in the prices of certain most important foodstuffs -- above all, bread, milk and certain dairy products, and meat products, with the exception of delicatessen ones. We deem it expedient to take control of the present practice whereby leaders of state enterprises and of joint-stock companies with state participation receive wages that are exponentially higher than the average wage for the enterprise. The difference can be of the order of 10 times or more, including at enterprises whose financial position is far from good. This rightly displeases working people. The ministry prepared a draft decree "On the Terms of Labor Remuneration for Leaders of State Enterprises on the Conclusion of Agreements (Contracts)." V. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the government, signed our draft. So this payment procedure is coming into force. One of the most "explosive" social problems today is probably that of the delays over paying wages. Before the system of mutual transactions in the national economy is regularized, we propose introducing a calendar sequence of payments, with the exception of wages. These are to be paid by way of a top priority at the rate of up to six times the minimum wage. In the event of a delay in the payment of wages, the labor collective or the trade union has the right to raise the question of dismissing the leader from his post. In addition, we have prepared a number of documents aimed at increasing the monetary incomes of the employed population. These are draft laws on the minimum living wage and on indexation of the minimum wage and a draft government decree on increasing the labor remuneration of working people in the budget-funded sphere. In our country, incidentally, budget-funded working people made up the bulk of that category of the population which lives below the poverty line. This is borne out by the fact that when we at last began paying indexed wages to working people in budget-funded sectors in February, the proportion of the poor population fell from 34 percent (data for January this year) to 17 percent, i.e. it was exactly halved. It turns out that those on low incomes are budget-funded working people and some pensioners. Finally, before the Law on the Minimum Living Wage is adopted, the authorities in the components of the Federation and organs of local self-management are to be recommended to emulate the experience of Nizhniy Novgorod, Voronezh Oblast, and the city of Moscow and put into practice a system of targeted assistance for the most needy citizens. [POSTFACTUM] One gets the impression that far from everyone will support your plans. Some will criticize you for proposing antimarket measures, others for the fact that your proposals will entail an increase in inflation. [Melikyan] We propose to regulate monetary incomes and prices by economic means, not administrative ones, so there is nothing antimarket here. This is the usual practice in any countries where the state seeks to regulate economic life and not to avoid this. This is the practice in countries which we so like to call civilized. Now about the inflationary effect of the proposed measures. I believe that growth in the money supply should not be limited all the time. Restrictions on demand, i.e. a reduction in the demand for output owing to a lack of money, depress production itself, particularly consumer goods production. The limitation of monetary incomes should not be made an end in itself, but their growth should simply be regulated. In general, I am a committed supporter of the idea that the best means of social protection for the able-bodied section of the population is to create conditions so that people can earn. The whole country must not be turned into a social security department, when the population puts its trust not in its own qualifications, activity, and initiative but in social benefits. In addition, the argument over the consequences of our indexation proposals is of an abstract nature at present. We proposed starting the new stage of indexation in March, but this has not happened, although the leadership realizes at the top level that there is no getting away from this. A struggle is being waged between representatives of the social bloc and the financial bloc. [POSTFACTUM] This struggle will be manifested particularly visibly during the discussion of the draft budget in the State Duma. How do you rate the prospects for the budget's adoption? [Melikyan] In my view, the budget does not suit anyone in its present form -- neither political parties nor corporative groupings. Everyone will criticize it, and everyone will seek to extort as much as possible for himself. I am afraid that the budget's passage will drag on for a long time. I do not even rule out the possibility that we might once again be left without a budget, as last year. [POSTFACTUM] It is already obvious that the first three months of this year brought about a production slump on a still greater scale than in any period during the previous three or four years. This will evidently give a new boost to talk of introducing an economic state of emergency. What is your opinion of this? [Melikyan] There is a lot of talk of this, but nobody knows what it means. If this term denotes a rapid response to the economic situation within the framework of the Constitution and the laws, then I am in favor of it. Although, in my view, this is not an economic state of emergency but normal operational work in an economic crisis situation. It is another matter that certain political forces invest this concept with different meaning, when emphasis is placed not on the word "economic" but on the word "emergency." Such forces exist on the extreme flanks of both camps -- both the democratic camp and the opposition camp. Therefore, when the idea of an economic state of emergency is advanced as a smoke screen for pushing a political "emergency," I am against it. This is why it is so important to implement the Agreement on Civil Peace in practice. Knowing the positions of "Russia's Choice" and "Democratic Russia" on the one hand and of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, the Communists, and the Agrarians on the other, I find it hard to imagine that they can reach agreement on anything with one another. Nevertheless, we must move toward accord in the name of the well-being of Russia and its citizens.
