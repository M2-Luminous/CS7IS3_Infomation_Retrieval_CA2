DATES: The publication of this notice in the Federal Register will segregate the public lands described above to the extent that they will not be subject to appropriation under the public land laws. As provided by the regulations of 43 CFR 2201.1(b), any subsequently tendered application, allowance of which is discretionary shall not be accepted, shall not be considered as filed and shall be returned to the applicant. The segregative effect of this notice will terminate upon issuance of patent or in two years, whichever occurs first. ADDRESSES: Detailed information concerning the exchange is available for review at the Pocatello Resource Area Office, 1111 North 8th Ave., Pocatello, Idaho 83201. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Contact Debra Kovar, Realty Specialist, at the above address or call (202) 236&hyph;6860. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of the land exchange is to facilitate more efficient management of the public lands through consolidation of ownership and to benefit the public interest by obtaining important resource values. The public lands to be exchanged are isolated and difficult to manage parcels with limited resource values. The private lands being offered have very important values for watershed/riparian, recreation, wildlife and access that merit acquisition for public ownership. The exchange is consistent with the Bureau of Land Management land use plan, as amended, and the public interest will be served by making this exchange. Final determination on disposal will await completion of an environmental analysis, which will be made available to the public. The value of the lands to be exchanged is approximately equal, and the acreage will be adjusted to equalize the value upon completion of the final appraisal of the lands. Equalization of values will be achieved through acreage adjustment or cash payment by the proponent, whichever is appropriate. The exchange will be subject to: 1. All valid existing rights, including any right-of-way easement, permit, or lease of record. 2. A reservation to the United States of a right-of-way for ditches and canals constructed by the authority of the United States under the Act of August 30, 1890 (43 U.S.C. 945). PLANNING PROTEST: Any party that participated in the plan amendment may protest this action as it affects issues submitted for the record during the planning process.

EXCHANGE COMMENTS: For a period of 45 days from the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register , interested parties may submit comments to the District Manager at the above address. Objections will be reviewed by the State Director who may sustain, vacate, or modify this realty action. In the absence of any objections, this realty action will become the final determination of the Department of the Interior. Dated: September 30, 1994. Gary L. Bliss, Associate District Manager.
