Only some 20,000 worshipers turned out, and when prayers ended about 20 minutes ago, most of the worshipers dispersed." Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 4 March adds that in a conversation with correspondent Aviv Bushinsky, Police Commissioner Rafi Peled said "that the Israel Police reached agreement with the Muslim waqf on the Temple Mount regarding ways to prevent confrontations between the Muslim worshipers and the police forces following Friday prayers. The commissioner noted that this is one of the steps the police took to prevent any violence. The other steps included the closure on the territories, as a result of which only residents of East Jerusalem attended the prayers. In addition, the police deployed massive forces in the Old City. "The commissioner explained that the police decided to remove the Jewish worshipers from the Western Wall plaza for a limited time in order to ensure their safety. He stressed that this measure was taken in a bid to safeguard the Jewish worshipers."
