"It is regrettable that the Hungarian dignitary chose to ignore the Romanian authorities", said Ambassador Traian Chebeleu during a news conference on 8 April, in answering a ROMPRES question. Referring to the same aspect, the presidential spokesman showed that the Romanian authorities were worried by that gesture "that accounts for a very serious brake in the efforts to normalize the Romanian-Hungarian relations and conclude the basic treaty between the two countries," as the Budapest official's behaviour defied the principles of inter-state relations. Referring to the pardoning of the ethnic Hungarians involved in the crimes at Zetea and Dealu, Harghita County, presidential spokesman Traian Chebeleu said it was not complete. It was made in such a way as to have the convicts eligible for parole while the final decision would be made in keeping with the existing procedures by the local court. As regarded the treaty envisaged to be concluded with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Ambassador Chebeleu said it was part of Romania's policy of equal treatment of all states in the territory of former Yugoslavia. The statement of Moldovan Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli, who did not name Romania among the countries that gave the Republic of Moldova support, accusing it instead of failure to fulfil its obligations, was termed as "ununderstandable" by Traian Chebeleu who said the Romanian authorities waited for "the necessary explanation" that would be requested through the Romanian Embassy in Chisinau. The spokesman also said President Ion Iliescu was represented at the funeral of playwright Eugen Ionesco by Romania's Ambassador in Paris, Anton Vatasescu. Requested to deny or confirm an alleged meeting between President Slobodan Milosevic and American General George Joulwan during the Serb head of state's stay in Bucharest, Ambassador Traian Chebeleu definitely denied it: "The meeting did not and could not occur because of President Milosevic's very busy schedule, he said. [no closing quotation mark as received] Romanian President Ion Iliescu will pay a state visit to France over 14-11 April, 1994, presidential spokesman Traian Chebeleu also announced in his news conference. The schedule of the visit includes, apart from talks with President Mitterrand, an interview with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, meetings with Senate President Rene Monory and President of the National Assembly Philippe Seguin, with other politicians. He is also expected to meet at the National Council of the French Employers with representatives of business circles and to visit the GEC-Alsthom works. The presidential spokesman assessed the visit was "a natural moment in the evolution of the Romanian-French relations after the revolution and at the same time it is meant to boost them." Stressing that in the four years after the revolution France has given Romania decisive support in its efforts for rapprochement and integration in the bodies of the European democratic states, Ambassador Traian Chebeleu highlighted that Romania's president attached great importance to the forthcoming political consultations with France, that would cover a wide area of issues, from ways to further develop the bilateral relations and the speeding up of Romania's integration in the European institutions to the current questions of security in our zone and in Europe generally. The visit will have also an important economic dimension, the result of which we hope to be an ever more significant presence of the French companies in the Romanian economy, the presidential spokesman said.
