Speaking in debate on constitutional amendments, he said important breakthroughs had been achieved on the issue following negotiations with the ANC, among others. The government had noticed a fundamental shift in the ANC's attitude as a result of talks, with that organisation realising there would not be a new police or defence force after the elections. The amnesty deadline had been set at October 8, 1990, but it could be revised in the course of negotiations on further constitutional amendments. "The government has a firm commitment to October 8, but in interaction with all parties there can be shifts within the framework of the constitution."
