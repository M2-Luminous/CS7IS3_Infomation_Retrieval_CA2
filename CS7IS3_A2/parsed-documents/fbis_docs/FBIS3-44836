The moves range from tax shifts on retail sales of domestically-made cars to new tariffs on imports. A policy that for years has allowed foreign-funded enterprises to buy duty-free foreign cars will be withdrawn. In addition, controls on institutional car buying, initiated by the Ministry of Finance in the 1970s, have been eased. The ministry said the controls have been lifted to help saloon car makers. The new tariffs are already effective, but regulations on the shifts of saloon car consumption taxes, which constitute two-thirds of the retail car price, are unavailable now. And an official from an automobile trading firm believed the moves would have a major effect but she said it was difficult to predict how situation will develop as the motor market was still in a recession that began in July. The recession, a result of the government's tight-credit policy and anti-corruption drive, is likely to continue until the second half of this year, said industry experts. A senior official with the China Trade Centre for Automobile Imports said imports of foreign-made cars and vans, would certainly be down on last year's 400,000. The official believed tough central government measures would stop the smuggling of foreign-made cars. Customs stations are now required to confiscate smuggled vehicles unconditionally instead of simply imposing fines as they did before. The Ministry of Public Security, the General Administration of Customs and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce issued a joint notice that no driving licence be given to car owners without documents from the firm where they bought the car. In 1993, 100,000 cars and vans were smuggled into the mainland. Business Weekly has learned the government approved the duty-free sale to foreign-funded firms of a third of the 15,000 cars and vans it bought last year. The cars made by the US's General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, are now the last batch of duty-free cars being sold to foreign-funded firms. In 1993, 80,000 foreign-built cars and vans were sold to foreign-funded enterprises duty-free, compared with 50,000 in 1992. This preferential policy is to be cancelled partly because some overseas-run firms profiteered by selling duty-free vehicles to domestic customers. And some foreign-funded firms were set up for no other reason than to deal in duty-free cars. The new policies are also likely to help improve the country's motor pricing system. Just now a Chinese-made car sells for twice the price of the same car made overseas on the domestic market. However, the official said price reform in China was complicated. As the controls on institutional car purchases are lifted, sales of cars are expected to rise. However, as the tight-credit and anti-corruption programmes continue, enterprises' purchasing power will remain low and government departments and institutions will lay out little cash in the short term.
