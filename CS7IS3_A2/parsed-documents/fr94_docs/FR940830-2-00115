FR940830-2-00115 FR940830-2-00057 July 6, 1994. Mr. Richard Rosen, Chief, Communications and Finance Section, Room 8104, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001. Dear Mr. Rosen: I wish to state my opposition to the exception provision offered in the Consent Decree against EPS, Inc. regarding the limited branding of Smart Cards. Sepcifically, the exception will eventually undermine the intent of the Decree to allow for greater competition if allowed to stand without greater clarity. EPS should not be permitted to have a privileged posture on limited branding for cards containing an intergrated chip simply because they are heavily into its innovation. Future growth of this technology will require greater acceptance and access considerations to wit this provision ignores. Make the better and far more universal interpretation that branding of all types of cards is in the greater interest of competition and eliminate this loophole provision. ␣␣␣Respectfully, William R. Kennedy, Board Member, New England Network.
