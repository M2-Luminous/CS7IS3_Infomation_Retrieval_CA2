[passage omitted] In the thick of it all is the UN military mission sent to keep the peace between the rebels and government forces. On the line to Kigali, Robin White asked the UN commander in Rwanda, General Romeo Delaire, how alarmed he was by these developments. [Begin recording] [Delaire] Well, we are concerned that the violence has escalated over the last three days to four days as we have seen more use of weapons, more use of grenades, and of course, we have had the two assassinations that have created enormous amount of reaction in the population, and fear. [White] Is there anything that you can do to get things back to some kind of normality? [Delaire] Well, if you are asking me as the force commander on the UN force, we are deploying with the gendarmerie and police communale [municipal police] all the resources we can to instill in the populations a sense that there is still order.... [White, interrupting] Exactly what are your men now doing? [Delaire] My men are conducting patrols; they are conducting checkpoints to see if there are arms being moved around. They are monitoring all the military installations to ensure they respond to the weapons secure area. They are providing escorts for the RPF and for government officials; they are conducting investigations on any cease-fire violations. They are monitoring, through our civilian police, the judicial actions and investigations by the gendarmerie, and providing technical assistance. [White] Now, are you going to hang on in there or might you just give up and pull out? [Delaire] My God, those are words that do not at all provide for the mandate nor the attitude that the UN has toward these peacekeeping missions. I think we are in a difficult political impasse. I think the people are very concerned because there are extremist elements that are conducting extremist activities. I think that in those circumstances the UN must remain firm and assist and maintain with the local authorities the (?mortigum) of reference points so that the political process can still have an opportunity of succeeding. [White] Yes, but people are beginning to talk of an all-out civil war. In those circumstances, what would you do? [Delaire] Well, the first thing is that the minute there is a significant cease-fire violation by either side, then we do not have a peacekeeping role anymore, because the only reason we are here is that both sides wanted peace, both sides were prepared to implement the peace process and also to respect the peace, and so if there is a civil war, which has the violations of any cease-fire agreement that has been established, then we are no more in a peacekeeping role and my mandate does not exist here any more. [White] But you do not think you have reached that point yet? [Delaire] No, I do not. I think we have some significant concerns. I think that the gendarmerie is being pushed to its upper scale of capability. I think that we are also being committed to put everything we can into this effort be it militarily and politically. But no, I do not say that the road has ended. I think that people are still talking, they still want peace and until this thing collapses, which I still do not see, we are going to hang in there and do our job. [White] Now, presumably the RPF people in Kigali, the capital, must be pretty scared at the moment. Can you guarantee their safety? [Delaire] First of all, they are very concerned, yes and anybody would be who had been sitting here for 56 days waiting for these decisions to be able to permit them to continue the normalcy that was anticipated in the broad-based transitional government. They get more concerned every day. They also get concerned when people who are sympathetic to them are also being singled out and that creates more pressure. I am more concerned about them remaining disciplined as they are, remaining calm as they are, and willing to abide by the peace agreements and the cease-fire agreements that they signed with the government and within the mandate of the UN mission. [White] But can you guarantee their safety? [Delaire] My job is not to guarantee safety. If I wanted to guarantee safety I would need 40,000 troops here. And even at that, to guarantee means that there would be no altercations. My aim here and my mandate is quite clear: It is to provide both parties with the assistance they need to establish an atmosphere of security that they feel essential and confident to move ahead with the peace agreement of Arusha.
