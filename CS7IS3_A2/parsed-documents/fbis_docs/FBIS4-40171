Participating were representatives of the administrations of the CIS countries, politicians, and diplomats. The prospects for Eurasian integration were the subject of discussion. Speaking at the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray stressed that the time had come to think about making the CIS into a confederation of an EEC type. That would not mean the reinstatement of the former USSR. In the EAU--short for Euro-Asian union--every state will be sovereign and independent. However, there is an obstacle in the way, Shakhray said; this is the continuing rise of nationalism in the countries of the CIS, including Great Russian nationalism. He said the key to solving the problem is the establishment of genuine federalism and local self-administration. Marat Shizhirin, deputy head of the Kazakh president's administration, spoke about the mechanisms for the formation of the EAU today. In order to enter the EAU, it will be necessary to hold a referendum or to adopt a decision at the level of a country's parliament. At the same time, the alliance will not allow associate membership. The observation of interstate agreements will be an absolute part of the EAU code. The territorial integrity of the member states of the alliance will be rigidly observed. The main condition for membership in the EAU is the halting of combat actions. All this will create a new impetus for rapprochement of the former USSR's republics, both from a political and economic point of view, the speakers said.
