According to the ministry's report, Ukraine's production slump accelerated with GNP having dropped by 34 per cent and national income by 36 per cent versus the first quarter of 1993. Ukraine's industrial production was particularly hard hit by the economic crisis with industrial output having reduced by 38 per cent and labor productivity by 32 per cent, as compared with the same period of 1993. Over three thirds of Ukraine's industrial enterprises reduced their output. Ukraine's ferrous metallurgy, chemical, petrochemical, oil refining, light, pulp and papermaking industries are listed among those hit worst of all by the crisis. Production of basic fuel amounted to 27.3 million tons of the so-called conditional fuel in 1994's 1st quarter, which was by 4.3 million tons, or 14 per cent, less than a year ago. Primary crude petroleum treatment halved with resultant drastic curtailment of automotive gasoline, diesel fuel and oil fuel production. Production drops affected the bulk of products, manufactured by the chemical and petrochemical industries, such as mineral fertilizers, automobile and truck tires, synthetic resins and plastics. The timber industry's curtailed production resulted in a fivefold reduction in pulp, paper, and cardboard manufacture. Agriculture The vernal sowing campaign is underway across Ukraine. As of early May, collective and state farms sowed spring crops to cover 10 million ha [hectares], which was an increase by 64.5 per cent versus the same date in 1993. 1,145,900 ha were sown with white beet, 592,300 ha with sunflower and 73,800 ha with potato seeds. The situation in Ukraine's animal husbandry remained complicated, though early and promising stabilization trends appeared. Livestock's productivity and fodder supply somewhat improved. Thus, averaged per cow milk yield was 424 kg versus 413 kg in 1993's 1st quarter. However, meat production in slaughter weight dropped by almost a third, same as egg production (by 21 per cent). Ukraine's livestock and poultry capita reduced by 11 per cent. Construction Ukraine's housing, industrial and societal construction decelerated, too. Total dwelling area construction amounted to 967,000 sq. m., which a reduction by 46 per cent versus 1993's 1st quarter. Carriage Industrial and agricultural production curtailment, ruptured economic bonds with partner enterprises in "near abroad" nations, widespread non-compliance with obligations and chronic, acute fuel shortages could not but have a most adverse effect on the Ukrainian transport's performance with its aggregate cargo haul having dropped from 336 million tons in 1993's 1st quarter to 206 million tons this year. Cargo carriage by rail reduced by 35 per cent. Trucking reduced by over two times (52 million tons of freightage were carried). Marine shipment appeared less affected having hauled a total of 6.3 million tons of freightage, which was a meager 8 per cent drop versus the year before. A total of 1.1 b. [billion] passengers were carried by rail, which was an 18 per cent reduction. Finances and Prices Disbalanced finances were an important aspect of Ukraine's total economic crisis. The state budget's deficit reached 8.6 trillion krb. [karbovantses]. Monetary emission totalled 10.8 trillion krb. in the first quarter of 1994, which was 36 times the 1993 figure. Happily enough, inflation rates decelerated from month to month with January's rate of 119 per cent, February's rate of 112.6 per cent and March's rate of 105.7 per cent. Overall price growths in the first quarter of 1994 averaged 1.4 times versus 2.7 times in 1993's 1st quarter. It should be noted that averaged food price growths were not as great as those for manufactured goods and paid services. The latter category's price growths were twofold, as compared with food prices. Prices for meat, butter, eggs, citrus fruits even lowered, though other fruits and vegetables became even more expensive. Children's wear, footwear, books, newspapers, pharmaceuticals and office equipment were particularly affected by price hikes. Transportation services topped the list of most price-hike-affected paid services, primarily due to significantly raised prices for passenger carriage by rail and air (by 2.8 times), followed by health resort and recreational services and barber and beauty parlor services. As of early January, Ukraine's unemployment rate averaged 0.29 per cent of the able-bodied adult population. Relief per jobless individual averaged 169,000 krb. in March versus 100,000 krb. in January. Ukraine's population was estimated at 52.1 million, as of 1 April 1994. The number of deaths exceeded that of births by 75,000 in the first quarter. Consumer Goods Production Consumer goods production reduced by 39 per cent to total 55 trillion krb., of which over 45 per cent were contributed by enterprises under the State Committee for food industry and the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs, which were followed by enterprises under the State Committee for light and textile industries (almost 20 per cent of the sum total).
