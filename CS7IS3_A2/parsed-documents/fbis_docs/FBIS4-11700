Writing in the magazine, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake says that ever since the end of the Cold War, the only superpower has been apprehensive about the potential damage from five countries which choose to remain outside the international community and to assail its basic values. Three of these -- Iran, Iraq, and Libya -- grace the Middle East with their presence. (The other two are Cuba and North Korea.) Lake's article focuses on the advantages of the U.S. strategy vis-a-vis the Iraqi and Iranian threats, known as "dual containment." Lake illuminates Israel's role in the era of peace as assigned by the United States. The strategic cooperation has lost the Soviet enemy, but Israel shall not stand alone. According to Lake, Israel, along with the other U.S. allies in the region -- Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia -- permit the United States to simultaneously contain the Iranians and the Iraqis. Thanks to Israel and the other U.S. friends in the region, the United States can afford to forgo the dubious satisfaction of cooperating with the devil against a greater devil. By the way, the same magazine carries an article by Prof. Gregory Gause from the Columbia University, who presents the theory of those who doubt the logic of dual containment. He suggests seeking channels to Tehran while intensifying the pressure on the peace process participants, in order to foil the Tehran efforts to torpedo the process. The timing of the publication of the National Security Council official's contemplations can hardly be accidental. The weight of his observations differs from that of the lecture on the dual containment policy delivered by his assistant, Martin Indyk, in May 1993. Lake insinuates the peace process dimension into the depth of strategic analysis: Peace between Israel and its neighbors, the senior adviser opines, will deprive Iraq of occasions to exploit the Palestinian suffering and divest Iran of the capability to cultivate chaos in Lebanon. Lakes is careful -- possibly fearing Israeli reaction -- not to include Syria in his vision of the Middle East coalition, although his remarks plainly reveal that his desire to move Syria away from Iran is as great as his aspiration to draw it close to Israel. The United States will have to convince the Arab countries -- the moderates and those on their way to becoming moderate -- that the quadruple coalition will not threaten them or offer them formulas that will tempt them to cooperate, in exchange for overt and active support for the peace process; at the same time, President Clinton will have to pledge assistance to Israel toward reducing risks inherent in a compromise with the Arabs. All this offers Israel an opportunity -- perhaps unique -- to take advantage of its special relationship with an administration which waives a priori the option of playing the game with two elements hostile to Israel and which mobilizes all its strength and influence for the sake of uniformly neutralizing all those who reject conciliation with Israel. Since the end of the Cold War, Israel and its friends in the United States have been searching for a new footing on which the strategic cooperation -- the source of many important advantages in the sphere of defense and public relations -- can be established. Israel's becoming a frontline deterrent base against Iran and Iraq, and if necessary, a base for military action against them, requires a revaluation of the "dual containment" approach. If the Americans manage to create a Middle East NATO after the conflict between Israel and its neighbors is resolved, a new Middle East balance of power will have to be established. The new alliance will justify a generous supply of state-of-the-art technologies, weapons, and intelligence to Israel to ensure its deterrence vis-a-vis Syria. Along with the above, we can expect the U.S. Navy to deploy a floating power off the Middle East shores and to create new jobs in Israel for the benefit of the U.S. troops and equipment. This handsome package, along with the blessing inherent in the termination of the war with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon, must be weighed against the advantages stemming from retaining control over the Golan Heights. The introduction of the peace process in the context of dual containment demands that the U.S. President pull out of the narrow labyrinth of the desire to gratify Israel -- in fact, the Jewish constituency -- at almost any cost. If U.S. weakness contributes to the failure of the peace process, the writings of the most senior national security adviser will become a national indictment against Clinton.
