In its statement published today, PRUC pointed out that local conditions of Bosnia-Herzegovina allow to make air strikes neither limited, nor selective. "The tragedy on a market place in Sarajevo will be repeated over and over again as a result of the strikes," the statement stipulates. A total of 68 people died as a result of the mortar attack on a market place in Sarajevo. Moreover, NATO forces' direct involvement in the hostilities will lead to further escalation of violence and virtually the trigger "internationalization" of the armed conflict which is fraught with unpredictable consequences, the document points out. The PRUC faction stated that if the UN Security Council approves air strikes on Sarajevo, the Russian representative must use his right to veto the decision. PRUC also believes that the Russian president and government should take immediate measures to prevent the Bosnian crisis from turning into a larger war.
