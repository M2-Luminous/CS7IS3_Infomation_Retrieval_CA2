FR940620-2-00014 FR940620-2-00012 Viking proposes to establish an additional delivery point consisting of a 2-inch hot tap, measurement and data acquisition equipment, located in Eau Claire County, Wisconsin. Viking states that the tap would be used to provide an additional delivery point of 512 Mcf of natural gas per day for gas transportation services which Viking currently provides for Northern States Power Co._Wisconsin (NSPW). Viking estimates the cost of these facilities to be $117,750, and states that NSPW agreed to reimburse Viking for the cost of these facilities. Viking further states it would offer the proposed service within the existing certificated transportation entitlement of Viking's FERC Rate Schedule FT&hyph;A. Viking reports that it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the proposed deliveries without detriment to its other existing customers.

National has notified Tenneco and the other co-owners of its intention to use its expansion rights to serve four shippers. Additionally, pursuant to the C&O agreement National has requested that Tenneco uprate an existing compressor on the Niagara Spur Loop Line to permit the transportation of gas from the Niagara import point to an interconnection with National's facilities at East Aurora, New York.

Northwest Pipeline Corporation [Docket No. CP94&hyph;590&hyph;000] Take notice that on June 7, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84158, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;590&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205, 157.211, and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211, and 157.216) for authorization to replace certain metering facilities at its Burbank Heights Meter Station (Burbank Station) in Franklin County, Washington, in order to better accommodate its existing firm maximum daily delivery obligations (MDDO) to Cascade Natural Gas Corporation (Cascade), under Northwest's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;433&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Northwest states that it presently has firm obligations to deliver up to a total of 10,002 Dt per day (at 400 psig) under Rate Schedules TF&hyph;1 and TF&hyph;2, to Cascade at the Burbank delivery point. Northwest further states that the Burbank Station was originally certificated with a maximum design delivery capacity of approximately 8,517 Dt per day (at 400 psig). Since the maximum design capacity of the Burbank Station is less than Northwest's firm delivery obligation to Cascade, Northwest is proposing to upgrade the Burbank Station by replacing the two existing 2 inch regulators with two new 3 inch regulators. Northwest states that it also plans to replace the relief valve and associated valves and piping and to install electronic flow measurement equipment. It is stated that the proposed facility upgrade will increase the maximum design delivery capacity of the Burbank Station from 8,517 Dt per day to approximately 24,670 Dt per day at a pressure of 400 psig.
