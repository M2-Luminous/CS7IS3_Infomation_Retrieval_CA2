Interior Minister German Correa also referred to this subject: [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Minister, is the government facing difficulties over the Stange case? [Correa] No, the government is not facing difficulties. Undoubtedly it is a complex matter but the government is very solid, very strong. A government that enjoys the support of 58 percent of the citizenry can hardly face difficulties. The government, moreover, has received broad support from all sectors of the country regarding this subject -- except the opposition, of course, which has politicized the subject. Undoubtedly, the government has the support of all other sectors of the country. [Reporter] Do you believe the problem will be solved soon? [Correa] I hope the problem will gradually be solved for the sake of Carabineros and the country. [end recording] Regarding debates over decrees, vacations, or other types of leave, Fouilloux said that the government believes there are ethical and moral aspects that make it inconvenient for Gen. Stange to return to his activities. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Are there any legal obstacles to his return on Tuesday, 17 May? [Fouilloux] There is a legal-administrative obstacle. There is no doubt about that. His two months leave without pay -- which he requested and the government authorized -- has not expired. Unless it is suspended or the government decides to cancel it, there is an obstacle. I have reiterated this and Carabinero representatives and even the experts who have been advising Gen. Stange agree. [Reporter] What will the government do when Stange resumes his activities? [Fouilloux] We do not know if he will resume his activities. [Reporter] Is that not definite yet? [Fouilloux] Well, as I have already stated, Gen. Stange has issued a note expressing his desire to resume his activities on 17 May. On the other hand, there are those who do not want him to resume his duties because they say there is an administrative obstacle. We do not know what Gen. Stange will do on 17 May. [end recording]
