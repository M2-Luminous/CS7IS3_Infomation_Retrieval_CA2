This was 18.1 percent more than in 1992. Cases tried numbered 67,473, up 19.5 percent from 1992. These included 7,561 criminal cases, or 10.4 percent of all cases that the procuratorate prosecuted. The remaining 89.6 percent of the cases were accepteed for hearing directly by the courts. I. Strict Punishment According to Law of Offenders Causing Serious Damage to Public Order for the Safeguarding of Social Stability During the year, courts at all levels throughout the province continued a policy of working at multiple tasks at the same time, and working with might and main in light of the province's public order situation. They persisted in the "severe crackdown" struggle, severely punishing all kinds of criminal activities that seriously impair social order. Altogether, the courts heard 8,718 criminal cases of all kinds, 4.2 percent more than in 1992. They tried 8,385 of these cases in which they sentenced 10,128 offenders who had already received due legal process, 38.9 percent of them being sentenced to five years or more in prison, to life imprisonment, or to death (including commuted sentences). (1) Emphasis on Crackdowns Against Major Offenders; Crackdowns Intensified Although social order in the province remained basically stable during 1993, there were numerous problems and the situation remained serious. Courts at all levels consistently made crimes that caused serious disruption of social order the major focus of crackdowns, meting out severe and speedy punishments according to law. During the year as a whole 4,752 offenders who had caused serious damage to public order were sentenced after due legal process, 67.8 percent of them being sentenced to five years or more, to life imprisonment, or to death (including commuted sentences). (2) Active Warfare, Concentrating on Both Recurring and Localized Serious Criminal Activities Courts at all levels diligently enforced the NPC Standing Committee's "Decisions on Banning Drugs," and the programs of the provincial CPC committee and the provincial government in close coordination with public security and procuratorial agencies. In July, the courts concentrated forces for a provincewide battle against drug offenses. The provincial court issued a special document reiterating the necessity for enforcing the NPC "Decisions on Prohibition of Drugs," which clearly provide for conviction and sentencing for the sale of 1 gram or more of heroin. In cases in which less than 1 gram is sold but the circumstances are serious, criminal responsibility may also be fixed. During 1993, courts throughout the province heard 556 drug offense cases meting out sentences in 534 of them. A total of 558 offenders were sentenced for smuggling, manufacturing, selling, transporting, or illegally possessing and illegally growing drugs. Of these, 80.68 percent were sentenced to five years or more imprisonment, life imprisonment, and death (including commutation of the death sentence). People's courts at all levels took active part in the battle against theft, meting out severe sentences to the ringleaders of robber gangs, major thieves, habitual offenders, and fugitives. They also emphasized crackdowns on sellers of stolen goods. The province's court tried 3,042 thieves. At the same time, the courts also actively joined the special battle to roundup "car-jackers and police officers putting up roadblocks to impose fines and fees on motorists." They also cracked down on the plundering of ancient tombs, severely sentencing a number of offenders. In 1993, the provincial court trial committee found one trial court had given too light sentences; it directed retrials. Fourteen of the 19 people sentenced to death in the retrial of 16 cases were mostly "car-jackers and police officer highway extortionists." Criminal activities involving the abduction for sale, and the kidnapping of women and children, and organizing and forcing women to become prostitutes are very serious in some parts of the province. During 1993, people's courts at all levels diligently enforced the NPC Standing Committee's "Decisions on Severe Punishment of Offenders Who Abduct and Sell, or Kidnap Women and Children," and "Decisions on Strict Prohibition of Prostitution," trying 44 such cases and sentencing 101 offenders. (3) Active Participation in Comprehensive Control of Public Order To Reduce and Prevent Crime First was the use of public trials as part of a widespread campaign to provide publicity and education about the legal system; second was emphasis on the omissions of units concerned found in the handling of cases, making judicial recommendations; third was adoption of a policy of educating, guiding, and rescuing offenders who had not yet reached maturity, making education a part of sentences, thereby combining punishment with education. Fourth was greater use, according to law, of probation and public surveillance of offenders whose offenses were fairly slight as local conditions warranted, relying on social pressure to effect reform. Fifth was adjudication, reduction of sentence, or release on parole, according to law, of offenders sentenced to labor reform who showed evidence of repentance and intention to change their ways, or who had performed meritorious deeds. II. Harsh Crackdowns on Serious Economic Crimes; Resolute Punishment of Graft and Corruption During 1993, peoples courts at all levels waged more battles to crack down hard on criminal economic activities, punishing a number of serious economic criminals. A total of 533 economic crime cases of various kinds were heard, 298 of them involving graft and bribe taking. So far 371 offenders have been sentenced after due process, 34.5 percent of them to five years or more in prison, life in prison, or death (including those whose death sentence was commuted). Economic losses amounting to 7,280,600 yuan were recovered for the state and collectives. In July 1993, the provincial court convened a meeting of medium level court judges throughout the province at which, on instructions from the supreme court, it emphasized the need to use sentences in large and important cases as an object lesson in continuing the battle against economic crimes. Law courts at all levels responded conscientiously, sentencing 129 offenders who had committed economic crimes involving 10,000 yuan or more, 22 of whom had committed crimes involving 100,000 yuan or more, and seven of whom had committed crimes involving 200,000 yuan or more. Six of the offenders sentenced were county (or department) level cadres. Courts at all levels made crackdowns on graft, acceptance of bribes, and the diversion of public funds to authorized uses by personnel working in party and government leadership organs, judicial units, administrative enforcement units, and economic control units the emphasis of strict punishment according to law. In hearing economic crime cases, people's courts at all levels made sure to move large and important cases forward on the docket, delve into them, and hear them promptly. In hearing cases, they adhered to two basic principles: one was to make sure of the facts and evidence, positively not issuing any sentences in cases where the facts were unclear or the evidence insufficient. The second was not to wrangle about non-essentials when the basic facts and basic evidence was in hand. They adhered to the principle of "the need for firmness first, prudence second, and handling matters correctly," strictly distinguishing between guilt and no guilt. Although definite accomplishments have been made in the battle to crack down on economic offenses, some problems also exist, the main one of which is that an insufficient number of economic crime cases are being brought to court. During 1993, courts throughout the province received 489 new economic crimes cases, 15.4 percent fewer than during the previous year. This situation does not match the actual economic crimes situation and the intense reaction of the public to economic crimes. The problem of imposing fines instead of meting out punishments has still not been solved. In some cases, the sentences are still too light. If the battle to crack down on economic crimes is to be intensified, matters will have to be handled strictly according to law, these problems diligently resolved. III. Regulation of Economic Relationships According to Law To Promote Development of the Market Economy During 1993, people courts at all levels throughout the province further intensified their economic trial work, regulated economic relationships according to law, ensured smooth implementation of national macroeconomic regulation and control measures, and strove to intensify economic system reform and service to economic development. The number of cases involving economic disputes of all kinds that were heard increased tremendously, breaking the 10,000 mark to reach 11,900 cases. This was a 128.5 percent increase over the previous year. The courts tried 10,749 cases, the amount of money involved in the cases tried totaling 797.52 million yuan. (1) Greater Hearings of Economic Dispute Cases of All Kinds To Promote the Building of the Market Economy System and Maintain the Economic Order Following Supreme People's Court plans to ensure smooth implementation of macroeconomic regulation and control through trial work, courts at all levels throughout the province held more hearings of financial dispute cases. They put special effort into trials for the purpose of clearing up call loans and recovering overdue credit. The resolved payment default and settlement disputes for construction units and construction engineering departments amounting to 27,715,100 yuan, thereby improving construction fund returns. They heard 5,260 cases involving procurement and marketing, property leasing, processing contract, technical cooperation, and patent and trademark disputes, liquidating or recovering 171.75 billion yuan in delinquent payments for goods and services, thereby safeguarding the legal property rights and interests of enterprises and legitimate competition in routine business activities and market exchange. They tried 323 cases involving enterprise contracting, leasing, partnership, bankruptcy, mergers, and economic equity rights disputes, including 12 enterprise bankruptcy cases. They heard 108 economic dispute cases stemming from rural reform and development, most of them rural contract dispute cases, thereby steadying responsibility systems, notably the family output-related contact responsibility system to advance rural economic development. (2) Reform and Perfection of the Economic Judicature System Thereby Further Improving Case Handling Quality and Efficiency The system of placing the burden of proof on those making allegations continue to be applied in the hearing of economic dispute cases. In cases in which the facts were clear and evidence ample, a direct court hearing and speedy solution was tried out. In cases in which the facts and the circumstances were uncomplicated, when simple procedures in accordance with law could be applied, they were applied, and where oversight procedures were required, they were also applied. They improved the mediation of economic dispute cases, the number of cases mediated for the year increasing 72.46 percent over 1992. Courts at all levels paid particularly close attention to trials of major and important economic dispute cases. (3) Improved Service Awareness, Broadening the Service Realm. The first step taken in improving service awareness and broadening the service realm was the establishment of a mediation center for economic disputes for the purpose of mediating disputes before they went to trial. During 1993, such centers heard 4,343 economic dispute cases involving a total of 294.34 million yuan, 3,867 of which were successfully mediated. In August, the provincial court also set up a center to mediate real estate disputes, which heard 63 cases by the end of the year, successfully mediating 37 of them involving 7.15 million yuan. Second was closely linking legal services with case handling in an effort to extend services. Courts throughout the province have set up with 1,179 enterprises a system in which the enterprises designate one or more personnel contact points on economic judicial matters, 1,269 such contact personnel having been designated. Some courts also set up enforcement centers, or some administrative enforcement departments have set up enforcement courts or enforcement offices to provide special services. Very many courts also provided training classes that provide information about the law to persons in charge of enterprises and administrative personnel. These methods have yielded very good social benefits for economic construction. IV. Good Performance of Civil Affairs and Administrative Trials To Safeguard the Legal Rights and Interests of the Citizens and Legal Entities Courts at all levels throughout the province have strictly enforced civil law and policies, actively hearing all sorts of civil cases. During 1993, they heard 33,372 civil cases, 10.54 percent more than in 1992, and they adjudicated 31,771 of them for a 95.2 percent adjudication rate. Civil cases account for more than 60 percent of all cases straight in the courts. Marriage cases, debt cases, and compensation cases account for a respective 66.15, 15.42, and 11.6 percent of civil cases. They occupy first, second, and third place, respectively, among civil cases. Therefore, people's courts at all levels pay close attention to the hearing of marriage, family, and inheritance cases. In the division of property for inheritance, in caring for women and children, and in the apportionment of housing, the courts made sure to protect the rights of women, children, the aged, and those unable to make a living. Second was the hearing of 6,883 cases involving indebtedness, houses, and labor disputes, and payment of compensation for damages, 4,823 of which were adjudicated. This was 22.8 percent more than in 1992. Third was the adjudication according to law of 2,883 personal injury compensation cases, 52 reputation and image rights cases, and 10 intellectual property rights cases. This adjudication promptly resolved conflicts, thereby advancing popular unity for substantial effect on society. Courts at all levels throughout society persisted in the protection of the legal rights and interests according to law of citizens, juridical entities, and other organization. They also adhered to the principle of safeguarding and supervising administrative organs exercise of functions according to law, hearing all sorts of administrative cases. They particularly emphasized large and important cases having a major social effect and about which there were strong feelings from all quarters to promote the development of administrative trial work. During 1993, the province's courts heard and tried 403 administrative cases, 2 percent more than in 1992, successfully adjudicating 390 of them. Of the administrative cases successfully adjudicated, the decisions of administrative organs were upheld in 32.05 percent, overturned in 15.38 percent, partially overturned in 3.59 percent, appeal rejected in 6.15 percent, and the original complain dismissed in 35.64 percent.
