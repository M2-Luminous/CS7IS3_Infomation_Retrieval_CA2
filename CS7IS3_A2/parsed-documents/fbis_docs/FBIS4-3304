Measuring 111 meters in length and 10 meters in width, it is the only bridge linking the Dongxing Development Zone in China's Guangxi with Mang Street, Hai Ninh County, in Vietnam's Quang Ninh Province. The original bridge (named the Beilun He Friendship Bridge) was put into operation after its completion in 1958 and destroyed during a bombing in 1979. Through negotiations, relevant departments from China and Vietnam in 1992 decided to reconstruct the bridge at the same location using the same design and at a budgeted total investment of 1.8 million renminbi yuan shared equally by the two sides.
