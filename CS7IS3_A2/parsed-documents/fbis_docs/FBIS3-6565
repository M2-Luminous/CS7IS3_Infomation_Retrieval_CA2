The two ministers shared the same roof for two days in a beachside Honolulu hotel but spent most of the time conferring with their counterparts from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. No bilateral issues were taken up, Japanese and U.S. officials said. Bentsen and Fujii met one-on-one Friday but chose to skip issues on bilateral trade. "We came here for the APEC meeting," Fujii explained. Yet the shadow of trade disputes loomed every time Bentsen and Fujii faced reporters. How would frictions in U.S.-Japan relations affect the two countries' efforts to build a bridge with other nations in the Asia-Pacific region? That was the first question Bentsen faced at a joint news conference after the APEC conference was over. Bentsen put up an air of optimism, not only on U.S. frictions with Japan but also with China. "I am optimistic that we're going to work these types of concerns out," Bentsen said. On Japan, Bentsen said the United States is working to see what can be done. "We're hopeful that will work out. I think that will be for the betterment of all of us," Bentsen said. Fujii, who stood alongside 16 APEC ministers behind Bentsen at the joint news conference, took no initiative to offer his own views on the subject. When pressed on that point at a separate news conference later on, Fujii again offered no fresh insight. Fujii reiterated that the meeting in Hawaii was about APEC, and not on U.S.-Japan frictions. "We would like to settle Japan-U.S. issues in a cooperative spirit," Fujii said.
