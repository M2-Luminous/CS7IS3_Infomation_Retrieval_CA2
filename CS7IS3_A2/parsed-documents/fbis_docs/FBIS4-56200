This will thus close a process which included the entire nation at the grass-roots level -- an unprecedented popular consultation through the conduit of forms of democracy unlike those frequently imposed as the only form of government by the hegemonic centers of power. On the basis of these considerations involving the conduit of democracy and the clear differentiation of that conduit, the problem to be debated tomorrow by our deputies is directly tied to one of the main challenges -- not the only one -- of our economy: A currency excess nearing 12 billion pesos. This means that there is an enormous surplus between the purchasing potential and the actual supply of products and services available. Technically, when this happens, the purchasing power of the currency drops to such extremes that it is not able to regain its capacity through a rational increase in production. In our case, the shortage of energy, oil, and a series of resources due to well-known reasons, does not allow for a significant increase in production. The excess currency is one of the financial problems of our economy -- not the only one. There are others tied to the collection of currency through diverse fiscal measures also affecting the required financial balance. Measures have been taken regarding this extremely urgent matter, such as the reorganization of the administrative apparatus of the central government. However, in our case, we have to find solutions without implementing shock policies; in other words, without massive layoffs, and acute increases in prices to lower the excess currency and attain a healthy but socially unfair demand. This is what it is all about. We have to adopt the measures needed without abandoning the social character of the function of the state in the economy. Social, not only due to the nature of production but also due to the final beneficiary of the national economy. The deputies have before them an urgent task. This process will probably not end with this special session. It is a matter of taking indispensable steps to redesign our economy on an economically feasible basis without affecting the workers unfairly or massively. The Revolution will not leave anyone abandoned. That is an unquestionable principle.
