Of course it will be possible to pursue Social Democratic policies if Sweden becomes a member of the EU [European Union], in the view of the Social Democratic EU supporters. Yesterday they made public their debate document in preparation for the party extraordinary congress. "It will be harder work and more difficult to pursue a Social Democratic policy in Sweden if we remain outside th EU," Mats Hellstrom, the party's EU spokesman, said. The Social Democrats' pro-EU group is therefore voicing views that are completely different from those of the no-side which made its view public last week. While the no-side believes that membership is a threat to democracy, the yes-side says that membership will save Sweden from the "dictatorship of the market." "First we have to get a Social Democratic government. But that is not enough in itself," Ines Uusman, chairman of Social Democrats for the EU, said. She explained her reasons for making propaganda for the EU somewhat in the manner of Pastor Jansson by comparing the EU to a potato peeler. "Politics is like a potato. It is good and useful, and can be used for many things. But it is more useful if you have a potato peeler. The EU is one such potato peeler." Mats Hellstrom's argument was a little simpler. He talked about the reshaping of Europe. "It is now that things are happening. And we Social Democrats in Sweden are self-confident. We know that we have something to contribute and we want to be involved and exert an influence." To questions of finances the Social Democrats have woolly answers. According to Mats Hellstrom, they do not need to put forward any detailed proposals about how the contribution to the EU is to be paid, not before the government has made it clear how the contributions from the EU are to be allocated and how great the net cost of membership will be. The Social Democratic yes-group is expecting a bill of 10 billion kronor. "The money must come from production," Ines Uusman replied. She gave some clarification by mentioning large farmers and property owners. These will have an "EU duty" imposed on them. "The end result must be neutral from the point of view of the distribution of wealth," Mats Hellstrom. This means that no one should profit from Sweden's becoming a member of the EU. If anyone does profit that profit must be taken from him or her. Mats Hellstrom also thought that the government and the Federation of Swedish Farmers are currently overestimating the profits for farmers. "The contribution from the EU will chiefly go to compensate for price cuts," he said. Leif "Blomman" Blomberg and Kerstin Alnebratt from Goteborg also took part in yesterday's presentation of the yes-program. "Blomman" said that his strongest reason for being in favor of membership is trade union cooperation. Kerstin Alnebratt said that the EEA [European Economic Area] is not enough. "It is not enough to be part of a market." However, the program declares that the biggest tragedy if the Swedes were to choose to remain outside the Eu is that the Social Democratic Party would then lose its membership in the ESP, the European social democrats' party.
