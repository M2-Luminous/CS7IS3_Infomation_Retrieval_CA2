[Zyuganov] The amnesty decreed by the Duma is the victory of reason. However, we must not forget that it is only a first step in the right direction. The second step is to remove from power the incompetent people that are selling off our country. [De Bonis] Will this amnesty benefit Yeltsin or the opposition? [Zyuganov] It will be to everyone's advantage. However, the radical democrats do not want to understand this, and the mass media continues to utter hysterical cries and predict that there will be a bloody clash. I assume that they have still not assessed the political importance of what has happened, but it would be better for them to think this over well. [De Bonis] Immediately after the liberation of the prisoners there was talk of civil war. [Zyuganov] If there is going to be a civil war, Europe will experience terrible hours. Rather, it would be a catastrophe for the entire planet. The Russian ship must travel in calm waters if it wants to berth in a good port. [De Bonis] Let us talk about the economy a little. President Yeltsin has abandoned his shock therapy policy. Was this the victory of the people over the reformers? [Zyuganov] It was the victory of sound thinking over those who tried to destroy Russia. You cannot talk of reforms when the state is falling apart, when half of the factories are not working, when the aged are being humiliated, when culture, the economy, and the moral foundations of our population are being destroyed. Europe will soon realize what the destructive process has brought and what it itself contributed by supporting first Gorbachev and then Yeltsin. [De Bonis] Who is responsible? [Zyuganov] The real author of this policy is the IMF, whose development models were imposed upon Russia as has already happened in Latin America. For the IMF bosses it is a matter of transforming the economy of a country into an economic space to be exploited to its own advantage, and the results to date are: in Yugoslavia their models have led to a ferocious war, in Czechoslovakia the country has been divided into two, in Poland industrial production has fallen by 40 percent. [De Bonis] What are the objectives of the Russian Communists? [Zyuganov] Our objective is to change the course of the shock therapy into a normal evolutionary development of reforms, and to work to bring about a new growth in culture, science, and health. Moreover, it will be necessary to take the appropriate measures to protect the elderly and children. To put a moral brake on the pornography that is rampant in the country and to stop the spreading Americanization, primarily through television. [De Bonis] Are you still against the Americans? It seems that President Clinton looks favorably on a strong Communist Party in Russia. [Zyuganov] We have nothing against the Americans. They have had to take note that there has been a new political situation in Russia since 12 December and they know well that continuing to support the shock therapy would have led to disorder at the international level. For this reason I now prefer a policy of stability. I can no longer support just Russia's Choice (the party close to Yeltsin). More support to Yeltsin could lead to the spread of anti-Americanism, as was the case with Gorbachev. A situation very similar to the "Cold War" situation. We do not want this kind of relationship with the Americans.
