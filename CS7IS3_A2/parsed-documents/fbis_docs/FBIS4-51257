At this point, Fujian People's Broadcasting Station, which has a 45-year history, has already developed into four specialized stations; namely, Southeast Radio Company, Economic Radio, People's Radio, and the Literature and Art Radio, thus satisfying as much as possible the many diversified needs of the masses. The reform of Fujian broadcasting began step by step in 1993. The Southeast Radio Company was the first one to begin broadcasting. Then came Fujian Economic Radio and the Fujian People's Broadcasting Station's Comprehensive News Radio. At present, these specialized radio stations are flourishing and well received by the broad masses of people, to the extent that radio broadcasting, which had been seriously challenged by television programming, shows great vitality again. Fujian Literature and Art Radio, established upon approval by the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, is a comprehensive radio station that mainly broadcasts music, but will also broadcast literature and drama. After beginning broadcasting, it will diligently build a great hall of literature and art to provide the public with a new dimension of entertainment, appreciation, enlightenment, and development.
