The acceptance tests on the antenna for the latter have already been carried out at the Alenia plant in Rome (Via Tiburtina), to the complete satisfaction of the Navy who placed the order. The performance obtained during the tests was better than had been specified by the French-Italian client. The program has therefore been given full confirmation. It provides for the necessary qualification tests on the EMPAR guidance system to be set up and carried out at the Italian center for radar testing and aboard the Italian naval frigate Carabiniere. This is one of the most recent stages in the Italian-French program developed by the Eurosam consortium, which was established in 1989 by Alenia (a Finmeccanica company) together with the French companies Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale and where 50 percent of the personnel is engaged in research. Two other important stages were completed at the end of 1993. The first was the installation of the first Arabel guidance system at the French air defense systems experience center (SESDA) at San Mandrier near Toulon at the beginning of December, after it had passed a series of intensive tests at Thomson-CSF. Here the system was put through a long series of tests in a marine environment. The first experimental prototype of the Arabel electronic-scanning multiple-function radar had already been tried out at the Cel testing center at Biscarosse near Bordeaux, to confirm some technical choices. Another guidance system for the ground version of the FSAF is currently being factory-tested and there are plans to install it in the site shelter next year. The Aster-30 missile was launched for the first time from the Biscarosse center using a real vertical ground launcher on 1 December. The goal of this test was to verify the interaction between the missile and the launcher at the moment of lift-off, the effects on the launching platform, and the behavior of the missile at the start of its trajectory. This first launch of the Aster-30, which was hailed by the French defense minister as being one of the enterprises contributing to the progress of European defense, follows a dozen launches of the Aster-15 that had the goal of ratifying the basic functional systems of the missile; such as the mixed aerodynamic and jet (PIF-PAF) flight, the vertical launch, and the correct trajectory from the initial interception stage for hypersonic targets in grazing flight also at short range. The first concrete realization of the Eurosam FSAF program will be in 1996, with the installation of the self-defense surface-air antimissile system (SAAM) aboard the new French aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle.
