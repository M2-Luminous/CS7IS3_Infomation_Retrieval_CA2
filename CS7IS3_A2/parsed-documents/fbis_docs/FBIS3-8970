We agreed that both political parties ought to contribute to the lessening of tension in Romanian political life, not merely at the parliamentary but also at the local administration level. We also agreed to cooperate with respect to draft bill packages and programs, stated PDSR Deputy Chairman Liviu Maior at a short news conference that followed the meeting. The next round of talks is scheduled for 29 March. PAC Deputy Chairman Nicolae Taran stated that, quote, we established what we could jointly do and how long it would take us to achieve those things. The PAC is a member of the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] and therefore it cannot decide in the name of the CDR, but merely pledge things that it can achieve on its own. However, our position expressed today actually outlined the position of the CDR, unquote, our correspondent Florin Brusten reports.
