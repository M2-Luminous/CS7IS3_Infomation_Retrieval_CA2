Industry Minister Gerard Longuet set the tone almost as soon as he arrived at the ministry. Eight months later, the pace of divestment is accelerating. In the meantime, Philippe Rouvillois, administrator general of the Atomic Energy Commission, became head of CEA-I and proceeded to quash the grandiose dreams of Jean-Claude Hirel. Mr. Rouvillois confirmed the news officially in LES ECHOS on Monday 14 February. Data processing services (Cisi) and medical technologies (Oris and Sopha Medical) will no longer be development axes for a CEA-I whose role henceforth is clearly to be nothing more than a portfolio company. "In the more or less short term, we envisage no longer having majority positions in those companies but retaining interests as a minority shareholder," says CEA's administrator general, evincing an uncanny comprehension of the wishes of his tutelary minister. Cisi, whose "facilities management" division--which completely or partially administers computer and data processing systems for third parties--has already been transferred to a joint subsidiary in partnership with Bull, is far from lacking suitors of its own. And Sagem is keenly interested in the medical technologies. But that still leaves the nuclear technologies and components divisions, which Mr. Rouvillois notes are "two major hubs." Concerning the former, CEA-I here again--under duress--has abjured even a minor role, except perhaps to offer representatives of the state some seats on the board of directors. COGEMA [General Nuclear Materials Company], one of CEA-I's most important investments, escaped its orbit early last summer by linking up with Total, in a move the government fully approved. Mr. Rouvillois also currently is negotiating disengagement from Framatome in favor of the Alcatel-Alsthom group. The proceeds from these multiple divestments could be used, in a best-case scenario, to help semiconductor maker SGS-Thomson--of which CEA-I is a major shareholder--back to vigorous health and support its ambitious plans. Thereby preserving a semblance of utility for a corporate structure which at the moment would appear to have no vocation.
