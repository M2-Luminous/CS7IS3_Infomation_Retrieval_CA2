Yevgenyev: "Inflation Curbed. But..."] [Text] The State Committee for Statistics has prepared some useful data illustrative of the socioeconomic situation in Russia in January-March. Compared with the corresponding period last year the gross domestic product is 17 percent down. The decline in industry is worsening, with production volume in physical terms standing at 75.1 percent of last year's level, the figures for the specific months being 76.9 percent in January, 75.9 in February, and 72.6 in March. According to State Committee for Statistics experts, the structural nature of the production decline became evident in the first quarter. This was manifested by the fact that the scale of it is increasingly determined by effective demand, not by resource potential. As a result, sectors reacted differently to the developing market situation. Whereas gas extraction virtually remained at last year's level, 9-15 percent less oil and coal was extracted. At the same time, production of many of the basic types of machine-building products and a number of light industry goods almost halved, chemical production fell by 25-30 percent, and ferrous metallurgy production fell by 20-35 percent. Food production fell by 10-20 percent. Of the 406 most important types of products included in the special report, 26 saw an increase in production volume and 373 items saw a decrease. Individual production processes were halted at 5,000 enterprises. But whereas at the beginning of the last year this was mainly due to lack of raw materials, supplies, and fuel, the main reason now is different -- problems marketing products (more than 60 percent of all losses). Unfortunately, there is a mounting crisis in the sectors producing consumer goods. Garment production has been particularly badly hit: Production of overcoats, short coats, and skirts fell by 61-68 percent; production of raincoats and jackets fell by 53-58 percent, and production of pants and suits fell by 41-42 percent. Fewer goods were produced for private farms, subsidiary plots, and horticultural enterprises: Production of front-wheel-drive tractors and rotovators fell by 10 percent, and of compact tractors by more than 25 percent. Livestock raising output is falling. According to the data, the volume of sales of livestock and poultry by all categories of farms fell by 13 percent, milk production fell by nine percent, and egg production by six percent. Russia's favorable balance in trade with far-off foreign parts is increasing. Although not so much through increased exports (they rose by 2.9 percent, reaching $8.9 billion), as through a reduction in imports (27 percent down on the first quarter of last year, the total volume being $3.8 billion). As for prices of goods and services, they rose by 44 percent in the third [as published] quarter. This is one of the smallest increases since the beginning of the economic reform. Average pay in March was 160,000 rubles [R]. The disposable income of the population (income excluding obligatory payments), taking into account the consumer prices index, rose by approximately 10 percent over the year. But the incomes of 17 percent of the population (that is, 25.2 million people) were below the poverty line in the first quarter of 1994, while in six percent of cases incomes did not even meet the cost of the basic essential foods, which is set at R37,000.
