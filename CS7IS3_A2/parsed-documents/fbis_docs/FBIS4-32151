It was a short circuit in the conventional equipment and has nothing to do with the reactor's safety. No radiation changes have been registered. The unit was switched on again about noon. It will work at about 50 per cent of its capacity until the turbogenerator is repaired. Three of the six units of the plant are currently in operation. Their capacity totals about 1,600 MW. Units Four and Five are undergoing routine repairs.
