Speaking at the open sessison of the Islamic consultative assembly (majles), he termed the compromising trend of talks between Yasir 'Arafat and the Zionist regime as well as the signing of the Gaza-Jericho compromise deal as gradual humiliation of the PLO leaders and a bitter and regrettable development for the world of Islam and the muslims. "It is crystal clear that the heroic nation of Palestine will continue their fight against occupiers of al-Quds and repulse the usurpers from al-Quds to materialize the divine promises," he stressed. Turning to the victory of the African National congress in the all-race presidential elections in South Africa, Nateq-Nuri described it as a great and sweet event for all nations especially for the people of South Africa. Congratulating the ANC leader Nelson Mandela and the South African nation on the victory, he expressed hope that Iran and South African relations would expand in all fields.
