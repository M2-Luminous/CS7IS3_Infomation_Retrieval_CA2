The solution of the issue now depends on how sincerely the United States, a dialogue partner, works to fulfil its promise. Kang Sok-chu, first vice minister of Foreign Affairs and head of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the DPRK-U.S. talks, declared this in a statement released today as regards ill-boding moves of the United States giving rise to doubt about its willingness to implement the conclusions on simultaneous action reached between the DPRK and the United States in New York. He said: The U.S. side made an official announcement that the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South and the IAEA's inspection are preconditions for the renunciation of the "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and the opening of the third-stage talks between the DPRK and the United States. On March 3, it expressed full support for the decision of the South Korean authorities not to stage the "Team Spirit 94" conditional on the exchange of special envoys between the two halves of Korea. All these are dangerous acts to endanger the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. agreement, which can never be justified. As everyone knows, the DPRK and the United States set no precondition in agreeing on the steps of simultaneous action. The conclusions reached at the New York contact only mentioned the resumption of the working contact for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South as a step for simultaneous action. But it did not touch on the fulfilment of the exchange. Only when the South Korean authorities stop such unreasonable acts as impudently poking their nose into the discussion of the nuclear issue without their own political view or authority to discuss the matter and make a clear turnabout towards seeking national reunification, the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South will be realised. We are also willing to sincerely implement the agreement on the IAEA's inspection for the continuity of safeguards. A group of inspectors of the IAEA began its activities on March 1 and a competent organ of the DPRK is rendering a proper cooperation in its activities. At a time when the agreement has entered the stage of implementation, however, the U.S. side has brought forward again the unreasonable preconditions which it had failed to include in the conclusions, while fully supporting the conditions raised by the South Korean authorities. All this cannot be construed otherwise than factors which may lead to collapse the full implementation of the agreement. As prescribed in the agreed conclusions, unless all the steps of simultaneous action are implemented fully, all the agreed points will automatically go amiss. We have agreed to the inspection by IAEA and the resumption of inter-Korean working contact on the premise that the agency will not take an unreasonable attitude in the course of the inspection for the continuity of safeguards and the South Korean side will not abuse the exchange of special envoys for such insidious purposes as putting brakes on the DPRK-U.S. talks. It is clear that, if the agency and the South Korean authorities bring forward complicated matters contrary to this and the United States gives up halfway the decision to renounce the "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and delay the opening of the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks under an absurd pretext, we can not satisfactorily ensure the IAEA's inspection that has already begun, nor can we pin any more hope on the DPRK-U.S. talks itself. It is high time that the DPRK and the U.S. faithfully implement the agreed conclusions on the steps for simultaneous action published a few days ago, conscious of their responsibilities and obligations in the solution to the nuclear issue. We will watch the future acts of the dialogue partner.
