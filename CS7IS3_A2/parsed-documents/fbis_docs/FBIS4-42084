This morning we offer an excerpt of the interview given by the U.S. President to Pascal Delannoy. The whole interview will be broadcast next Wednesday [1 June] on our station. On that day, Bill Clinton will fly to Europe, where he will take part in the ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the landing in Normandy. This morning's excerpt concerns Bosnia and the possible withdrawal of French troops. What is the position of the U.S. President? [Begin Clinton recording in English with superimposed French translation] The question is: Do you stay, and would a peace agreement be reached if you stayed? I think the French -- and this is quite understandable -- do not want to stay and risk being caught in crossfire. I say you could stay at least until we have exhausted all possibilities of achieving peace, because I think there is a chance for us to succeed, and a chance that both sides will admit that they are unable to continue fighting until the next century and must find a political solution. [end recording] Bill Clinton was translated by Pascal Delannoy who, on behalf of France Inter and France Info, went to Washington to interview the U.S. President with three other journalists from French-language radio stations -- the Belgian radio RTBF, the French-language Swiss radio, and Radio Canada. The interview will be broadcast in full next Wednesday on all these radio stations.
