Apart from talk about the employment of local residents, environmental protection, and other issues, the mention of oil found in this area was casual as it were. Our neighbors, the Russians, intend to utilize this oil in the future by installing a DF-6 test drill. The Lithuanians would not feel anxious if it were not the same site that caused so many emotions in 1986. All intelligent people in Lithuania defended the Curonian Spit against the possible threat at that time. Sensing huge profits, several German firms have submitted their construction projects. Although the final decision has not yet been adopted, Lithuania's fears may be valid. In case of an accident or some other emergency, southwest winds prevailing in this area would float all pollutants toward Lithuania's shores. All this risk would be undertaken only for a meager of oil resources which, according to scientists, equals the two-year processing capacity of the Mazeikiai refinery.
