We should be wise enough to accept and understand each other," says a statement of the Russian president's public chamber circulated here today. "Acknowledging our responsibility for the future of our motherland and considering its interests to be superior to class, corporative, party and group interests, we, representatives of political, trade union, women's, veterans', youth and other public organizations, who have diverse political outlook and social interests, voice our support to the initiatives of citizens, public associations, political parties, the Russian president and the State Duma on the achievement of Civic Accord in Russia," says the document. Members of the public chamber called for the maximum broad use of conciliatory mechanisms in solution of political, social and economic issues. They offered the working group for preparation of the draft agreement on Civic Accord in Russia to take into account proposals voiced during the draft discussion at the public chamber.
