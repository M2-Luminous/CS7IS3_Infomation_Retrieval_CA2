A municipal councils (temporary provisions) bill 1993, was tabled in the National Assembly Thursday. This becomes law, the Georgetown council will be scrapped and an interim management committee appointed by the minister. [sentence as received] The other municipal bodies -- town councils of Linden, New Amsterdam, Rose Hall and Corriverton -- would continue in office until their elections are held, provided these elections are held before July 31, 1994. In the event the elections for the four town councils are not held by the stipulated date, then interim management committees would be required from the same date. But the parliamentary opposition Working People's Alliance wants all five municipal councils to be dissolved. At the final sitting of the house Thursday, the wpa charged that with elections overdue, councils malfunctioning and service to citizens deteriorating, there was a "crisis" in local government. The WPA called for the dissolution of "all local government councils in Georgetown, the towns and throughout the rural community". The party said parliamentary parties should arrive at consensus on the appointment of "interim management councils...to execute the first stage of a programme of municipal rehabilitation". But added that in the absence of constitutional reform to allow a "workable" system of local government, it would be unwilling to contest any elections. Guyana's five municipal councils were appointed by the previous People's National Congress (PNC) government after uncontested municipal elections in 1992. The councils were then asked by the new goverment to remain in office for an extra year ending December 1993, after delays in the election date. A date for fresh municipal elections is still to be set. The Jagan administration has since been at loggerheads with the Georgetown council, saying it has been showing "a growing paralysis and dysfunctioning", and does not have the support of citizens. The National Assembly is expected to resume sitting in the second week of January, when the bill could come up for debate.
