With the approval of the State Council, the province plans to construct five intensive heating and coal gas projects to reduce air pollution. It has asked for loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). At present, the 120 million U.S. dollar loan has been listed among the ADB's reserve projects for 1996. The five projects involve three big industrial cities in the province -- Taiyuan, Datong and Yangquan. They will provide residents with heating and coal gas and will greatly improve the atmospheric environment of the three cities. The scheme will cut out the release of 21,800 tons of sulphur dioxide and 50,900 tons of dust and smoke every year. It will also save the consumption of 1.19 million tons of coal annually. The main industries in Shanxi are coal mining, electricity, metallurgy and chemical industry, which are all pollution intensive industries. Shanxi is rich in coal but severely short of water. Much of the water the province does have is heavily polluted. The control of water pollution is the key aim in using foreign investment. A loan from the French Government amounting to 4.95 million U.S. dollars is expected to be used in control of polluted water in Yangquan city. Another joint project in disposal of waste water containing nitrogen is under negotiation between Shanxi Fertilizer Factory and Germany. The head of the Environment Protection Bureau of Shanxi said that the use of foreign funds in environmental protection would not only solve the problem of money, but also introduce advanced technical equipment and scientific management methods.
