The writer is a researcher of Estonian migrations who is currently a guest researcher at the Migration Institute. The status of the Russian-speaking people in the Baltic countries has been described with terms like: "violation of human rights" and "oppression of a minority." Nevertheless, very little has been known about what these Russian speakers actually think about it themselves, what their experiences have actully been during the changes of the last few years, what are their goals and aspirations. The Russian-speaking people of the Baltics have become, regardless of their own desires, tokens in a political game that has most actively been played by Russian politicians. The report of the Estonian Academy was published at the end of last year. It dealt with the impact that Estonian independence has had, between 1986 and 1993, on relations between Estonians and Russian speakers living in Estonia. The report contained a survey conducted during different years, in which about 1,000 randomly selected Estonians and Russian speakers were asked to give their opinion on various social, political, and economic changes. The survey revealed that, at the end of the Soviet era, 1986, more than half of Estonians felt that relations with Russians were poor. This aptly describes the situation in which the relative number of Estonians as a proportion of the population of Estonia was continuously decreasing, and newcomers were increasingly taking over the really important positions in society. The majority of Russian speakers said that relations were normal, but, deep down inside, they felt that relations between Russian speakers and Estonians were strained. After the birth of the Estonian popular movement the strain emerged into open, public view. The situation was at its worst in 1988, but, since then, it has gradually improved. In 1993 the majority of both Estonians and Russian speakers considered their mutual relations to be normal, or even good to excellent. In the opinion of Estonia's Russian speakers as well as the Estonian majority, their mutual relations have improved during the process that has led to Estonia's independence. They are better in the Estonia of today than they have ever been before. This positive development clearly indicates that both ethnic groups have accepted their changed positions in Estonia's society. It is not possible to consider the Russian speakers in Estonia to be one homogenous ethnic entity. Within their numbers there continue to be various groups with diverse attitudes toward Estonia and Estonian aspirations. Based on these attitudes, the Russian-speaking segment of the population can be categorized into five different groups. The first group is formed by those who have been negative toward the Estonian popular movement and have not wanted Estonian citizenship. Among the 40,000 Russian citizens living in Estonia, this group is a majority. Generally speaking, numerous former party officials and Army officers, who have lost their positions and privileges through the change in conditions, belong to this group. Among other things, they have actively opposed the breakup of the USSR and have supported Russian conservatives. At the present time less than 10 percent of Estonia's Russian speakers belong to this group. The second group is made up of those who have had reservations about Estonian national aspirations, and have not wanted Estonian citizenship. They currently constitute about 15-20 percent of their ethnic group. The third group is made up of the uncertain. Throughout the process leading to an independent Estonia, this group has been the largest. Its proportional size varied between 40 and 50 percent. Only after Estonia became independent did it begin to decrease in size, and at the present its size is around 15 percent. One positive development, however, is that the majority of those who were uncertain have, during the last couple of years, accepted the Estonian aspirations and have decided to link their own futures with Estonia. This fourth group, therefore, regards Estonia with cautious approval. The fifth group is composed of those who have actively supported Estonian aspirations from the very beginning and have regarded their own future to be in Estonia. Thus about 60 percent of Russian speakers view things favorably, more or less. In 1990 this figure was only 30 percent. During the last two years an increasing number of Estonia's Russian speakers have accepted the developments in Estonian society, and want to, themselves, be participants therein. A good example of this were the local elections in October of 1993, when two-thirds of the 27 Russian speakers elected to the Tallinn city board of governors approved of an independent Estonia and supported economic reforms. Nevertheless, a small part of Russian speakers have opposed the development of an independent Estonia right from the start. Numerous pensioners are included in this group, which means that their numbers will gradually decrease in the future. It appears that the rapid progress in Estonia's economy has had its influence on the change in attitudes among Russian-speaking people. Many have noticed how good conditions actually are when compared, for example, with Russia. Zhirinovskiy-style speeches, which are currently arousing fears in Europe, were given in Estonia as early as 1988, and there were many speakers and listeners both. The situation has changed now: Although speakers can still be found, the audiences have withered away to nonexistence. It is clear that, in the future, continued tolerance will be necessary among both Estonians and Russian speakers. Some ill-considered decisions have created unnecessary strain and have retarded progress. An example of such a decision is the outcome of the 1992 Estonian referendum, on the basis of which the Estonian cabinet did not actively endorse the citizenship applications of Russian speakers that had been supportive of Estonian actions. Now that Estonians rule Estonia, they should more actively aid the integration of the Russian speakers. This is important also on the basis of Estonia's own security considerations. On their part, the Russian speakers must learn to actively use the democratic organs of the Estonian state and become accustomed to the role of being a minority, which may well be difficult for members of a great nation.
