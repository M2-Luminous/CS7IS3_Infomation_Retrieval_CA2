Polishchuk: "The Ukrainian People Must Wake Up"] [Excerpt] Petro Talanchuk is a man well known in Ukraine as the rector of the Kiev Engineering College, deputy of the former Soviet Supreme Council, and current minister of education. He won public recognition and popularity during the late 1980's perestroyka. Elected to the USSR Supreme Soviet, Talanchuk assumed a clear democratic standpoint and supported sovereignty and independence of our then Soviet Republic. Soon afterward, he actively espoused revival of the Ukrainian national democratic movement. Having become the minister of education, he has proved to be an energetic leader with a comprehensive program for reforming the educational system. He is 56 years old; an engineer, doctor of technical sciences and professor, and the president of the Academy of Engineering Sciences of Ukraine. He has three children and four grandchildren. Professor Talanchuk is a well-educated man with broad views and willpower. He has his own way of seeing our country's way out of the current crisis. His earnest smile and peasant-like sturdy figure call forth sympathy. Such people are described "as strong as a wall." Would Ukraine survive if it leaned on him? Consider this for yourself. [Polishchuk] By European and world standards, Ukraine is a large state. It is a prestigious and responsible matter to be its president. We are going to the polls, but we do not yet know who will be leading the state -- the president, the parliament, or the government. Their powers are not constitutionally defined. Petro Mykhaylovych, what do you think is the optimum way to resolve this problem? [Talanchuk] Today, the most precious thing for us is time, and we must not waste it. Elections must be held, and the man who is elected will actually encounter misunderstandings. I would like to believe that, no matter who becomes the president, he will manage to come to terms with the Supreme Council, and to constructively resolve these problems, to resolve them quickly, because we no longer stand in one place -- we have started to fall down. Just as we need air, we need to step up reforms. I believe that we can do it best with a presidential form of administration. [Polishchuk] You are talking about stepping up reforms. As a matter of fact, all we have is an economic decline, as in a tunnel, in which one can see no light. Why in Poland or the Baltics the reforms are moving forward, but we seem to be hampered? Is this our Ukrainian peculiarity -- "the inability to build a state"? [Talanchuk] This is a difficult question. As you know, Dovzhenko [famous Ukrainian film director and writer] said: "Regarding great causes, we are nasty people." As I understand it, he had in mind our national consciousness. This is quite objective. Why is that so? Each society develops successfully if it has even a narrow layer of innovative people. These are people who think unconventionally, unusual personalities. They can be found in the rural areas, among the workers, engineers, and the intelligentsia. Let us recall our history. The majority of talented people were persecuted and exterminated. What impact did the 1933 famine and the 1941-45 war have on the Ukrainian people? I read in LITERATURNA UKRAYINA about writers who were tortured to death and I think: "Good Lord, how many!" Our national elite was systematically exterminated. While I was arguing with Americans over our difficulties, and I saw them swagger around, I told them: "I would like to see how your country would have looked if someone had done to you what was done to us." This argument baffled them. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian people must wake up. We have wise people, and together, we are able to develop any socioeconomic model. If we agree, we will only have to act, implement, and not panic. This is a paradox: God gave us good crops last year, we harvested them, and now... we are talking about famine. Can anybody think of anything more horrible? [Polishchuk] Petro Mykhaylovych, how do you see the mechanism for market reforms in line with the social, though illusive, guarantees, to which we were accustomed to under the Soviet authorities? [Talanchuk] Currently, although it is impossible to draw a complete picture of our future state, I can see its outlines. There will be a mix of both planned and market economies, because if someone claims that he will jump into the market economy tomorrow, I do not believe him. This is unrealistic. The level of our people's culture is very low, including legal and production culture. It should be improved by command-administrative methods as well. People have to be nudged into doing good, because they do not know what that means. The Supreme Council and the president should coordinate their actions, assuming that everything that is good for the people must be developed and supported. When we finally create decent conditions for work, an able-bodied society will be able to protect itself, its children, students, and our pensioners, who gave us wealth -- a potential to which we hold on. I do not rule out state support for certain categories of people. But it is nonsense to speak about welfare for all. We have already bombarded the people with delusive promises such that they are already choking. It is time to abandon social demagogy. [Polishchuk] There are currently many discussions about Ukraine's territorial-administrative system. What is your standpoint? [Talanchuk] Based on our historic experience, I support a unitarian state, until we become accustomed to each other. We should introduce a Day of National Accord, in order to abandon the division into followers of Melnyk or Bandera [nationalist leaders during WWII], or communists, to raise common monuments, and to constructively look to the future. It is inadmissible to divide the country. Let us remember: History has given Ukraine a last chance to establish a state. [passage omitted]
