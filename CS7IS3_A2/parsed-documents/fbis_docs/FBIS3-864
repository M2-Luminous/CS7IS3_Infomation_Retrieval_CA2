The national radio pointed out that the "striking off" measure against the general was taken through the implementation of a presidential decree signed in 1985 by Mr. Kolingba himself, who was then head of the Military Committee of National Redress. Under this decree, "the officer struck off the Army ceases to be on the seniority list and thus is not promoted." The decree adds that "any officer who is a candidate in any election or holding any elective office shall be struck off the Army rank." This decision comes a few days after the arrest of several senior officials of the general's party, the Central African Democratic Rally, RDC. These officials were accused of "ordering acts of social tension" in Bangui. After a meeting on 8 March with President Patasse, Gen. Kolingba observed that by these arrests "he was being targeted" and described these arrests as a "very dangerous derailment of the young democracy" in Central African Republic. The general added that he was not to be held responsible for any social disturbances or unfortunate events that might come up in the country."
