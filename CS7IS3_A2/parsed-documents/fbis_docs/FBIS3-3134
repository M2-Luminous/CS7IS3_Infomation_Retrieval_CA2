Members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee from educational circles gathered there and invited Li Lanqing, Political Bureau member of the CPC Central Committee and State Council vice premier, to jointly discuss major guiding principles for education. "I have been assigned to take charge of education for only a year; therefore, I am a `freshman.' As a student, I must first learn. CPPCC members present here today are experts in education. I have come to listen to and learn from you. This is an excellent opportunity," said Li Lanqing candidly in his opening remarks. At once, the atmosphere was enlivened. Members successively took the floor. Vice Chairman Wang Hu of the Beijing Industry University's Administrative Committee called for increased investment in education; Vice President Su Dongzhuang of the Beijing Information Engineering Institute stressed the need to stabilize the contingent of teachers and raise the quality of education; Fudan University Professor Hu Hesheng suggested stepping up efforts to improve the basic subjects taught at schools of higher learning; Vice Chairman Guo Yanjie of the Liaoning Provincial Education Commission called for energetic efforts to promote vocational and adult education; Vice Principal Liu Sifu of Shunnanjie Primary School in Sichuan's Suining city stressed the need to implement the "Teachers Law" to the letter; .... [ellipses as published] As he listened and took notes, Li Lanqing often nodded approvingly. After hearing the speeches, he said: The issues you have just brought up are similar to those I heard during discussions over the past year. Practical problems in education can be divided into three categories -- investment, teachers' remuneration, and their housing conditions. As far as educational investment is concerned, the party Central Committee and the State Council have attached great importance to this issue, and all local governments and relevant departments have exerted great efforts and done a tremendous job. Spending in this year's budget on educational undertakings has increased 18.5 percent over last year, including 81.5 billion yuan from budgetary funds, which is up 19.1 percent over last year. However, it is true that, as you have just mentioned, spending on education is offset by inflation. This problem, which exists not only in educational spending but also the entire state budget, should be studied further. In short, we should gradually increase investment in education in accordance with the requirements of the "Outline for Reforming and Developing Education in China." Speaking on the problem of teachers' remunerations, Li Lanqing said: The principle need to increase teachers' remunerations is legislation. The "Teachers' Law," which was promulgated last year, must be strictly enforced. In view of the problem of the wage default to teachers raised by some members, Li Lanqing said: Last year the Education, Science, Culture, and Public Health Committee under the National People's Congress organized the State Education Commission and departments concerned to conduct an inspection of law enforcement in six provinces. According to their inspection and report, past wage defaults have been basically cleared. What is important now is to forestall the recurrence of defaults and to establish a mechanism to ensure that teachers are paid every month according to their teaching hours. He stressed: All localities which have not cleared wage defaults to teachers are not allowed to construct buildings or purchase automobiles; cadres from coastal areas where wage defaults have not been cleared are not allowed to go abroad or they will face investigation and punishment for violating discipline. In the meantime, it is necessary to strengthen supervision and control over funds for education and to establish and perfect the supervisory mechanism. Except for economically-developed areas, the leadership and management of basic education should be, in principle, taken charge of by county-level authorities and should not be delegated to lower authorities. Speaking on the problem of housing for teachers, Li Lanqing said: If leaders at all levels earnestly place education in the strategic position of priority development, there will be some ways to resolve the problem of housing for teachers. We can practice frugality in some areas, but we must run educational undertakings well and do some practical things for teachers. Li Lanqing also praised leaders from Beijing, Dalian, and other places for their attention to educational work and the methods of actively resolving teachers' housing problems. He said: I asked central and local television stations as well as other mass media to cover the principal measures of various localities in enforcing the "Teachers' Law." It revealed that all localities had some measures to serve teachers in a practical way. Li Lanqing continued: China is now a poor country running the world's largest educational undertaking. In view of this, merely relying on governments at all levels to strive to resolve the aforementioned problems is still not enough for the development of education in China. The key lies first in reform and, second, in encouraging the enthusiasm of all sectors to run educational undertakings. Li Lanqing stressed the need to readjust the macrostructure of education. First of all, we should make efforts to run basic education well and vigorously develop vocational and adult education. Basic education should be conducted in rural areas in line with local conditions. Vocational and technical training should be incorporated into basic education, so as to train skilled peasants to promote the application of science in farming and developing village and town enterprises. In cities, students should be gradually introduced to various specialities after junior middle school, and vocational education of various levels should be vigorously developed so as to cultivate personnel useful to society. This will be the way to become useful persons for the overwhelming majority of Chinese youths. As for higher education, greater efforts should be made in reforming the patterns of running schools, systems, the creation of branches of learning and courses, teaching contents, enrollment, tuition, and distribution with a view to improving teaching quality and the efficiency of running schools as well as meeting current and long-term needs for developing a socialist market economy. Some reforms should be popularized before experimentation, and it is necessary to conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work to enhance everybody's identification with the reform; thus vigorously and steadily promoting educational reform. Meanwhile, we should encourage all institutions of higher learning to supplement one another with their respective supremacy, share resources, advocate a gradual removal of barriers between them, and jointly run shools. Li Lanqing also emphasized the need to strengthen and improve moral education in schools. Xu Zhijian, deputy secretary general of the State Council and persons in charge of the State Education Commission, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Personnel, and departments concerned attended the forum and answered questions the members were concerned about.
