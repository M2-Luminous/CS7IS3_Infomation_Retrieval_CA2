That was the decision made by a conference of labor collectives of ship repair enterprises after Fleet debt, in the opinion of specialists, exceeded R75 billion. Workers have not received wages for three months, many programs have been curtailed, and enterprises have been informed that utilities are to be shut off to the yards for debts. But the Fleet also is in no position to settle the debt even if the action is filed.
