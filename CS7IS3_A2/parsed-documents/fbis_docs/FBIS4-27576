The "Chongju-ham" and "Pusan-ham" are scheduled to hold anti-submarine and logistics exercises jointly with U.S. Naval elements in the East Sea until May 30, then head for the sea near Hawaii to conduct various maneuvers with units from other Pacific Rim countries until July 16. "Rimpac 94" (Rim Pacific Exercise), drawing the participation of South Korea, the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan, is designed to secure major maritime transportation routes in the Pacific Ocean and promote the combined operational capabilities and cooperation of Pacific rim countries. The exercises will cover mobile offensive-defensive battle, command-control-communication, and anti-aircraft, anti-submarine and electronic warfares, and ship-to-ship and ship-to-air firing, and torpedo and missile firing. About 60 military vessels including two aircraft carriers, over 200 aircraft and a 25,000-strong naval force are expected to participate in the biennial exercise, which was inaugurated in 1971. It is the third time for South Korea to participate in the maneuvers since 1990, when it first took part. By joining in the exercise, the South Korean Navy is expected to promote military exchanges with the navies of Pacific rim countries as well as learn advanced naval strategy and tactics.
