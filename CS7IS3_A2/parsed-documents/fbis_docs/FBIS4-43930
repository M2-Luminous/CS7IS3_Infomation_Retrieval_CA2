[passage omitted] The subject was naturally raised this afternoon at the Assembly during a session of questions to the government on current issues. The prime minister insisted on coming in person to explain France's position. Edouard Balladur said: [Begin Balladur recording] This is an operation where force can be used, but with a solely humanitarian aim. This force--I repeat clearly--is not a buffer force, but a force to protect civilians. We will act together with the forces joining with us in such a way that we can contribute from the borders to the security of the people under threat and can enable them to receive help from aid organizations. Under no circumstances will our forces intervene deep inside Rwandan territory, and the operation will be of limited duration. It will end at the end of July. Humanitarian intervention by France in Rwanda is a difficult operation. No one is pretending otherwise--the government least of all. This decision is a serious one. Everything will be done to ensure that French soldiers will not be put in situations where they do not have the means to ensure their own safety. [end recording] So France has really and truly decided to intervene in Rwanda. Defense Minister Francois Leotard even announced this evening-- without waiting for the decision of the UN Security Council--that the operation is to start tomorrow. And, Luc Lemonnier, preparations have been continuing throughout the day: [Correspondent Lemonnier] Yes, Defense Minister Francois Leotard confirmed a few moments ago that the operation would start tomorrow, implying by the same token that the vote of the UN Security Council was a foregone conclusion. This is certainly not jumping the gun, since it is true that it is hard to see how-- despite the reticence of the OAU--the Council could refuse to support Paris' humanitarian commitment, and even less that one of the five permanent members would use its veto. So we already know that Operation Turquoise--that is its code name--will mobilize 2,500 men: 1,000 from France and 1,500 from contingents already stationed in Gabon and Djibouti. It is known that experts have been studying routes between Zaire and Rwanda for more than 24 hours, especially landing possibilities. Two Russian cargo planes arrived in Bangui today, in the Central African Republic, with French military equipment, and sand-colored military vehicles were seen on the runway of the airport, as well as a refueling plane. Finally, the French defense ministere was keen this afternoon to deny reports claiming that French troops entrusted with preparing the mission had already arrived in Rwanda. For the moment, everything is happening on the borders while the UN Security Council vote is awaited.
