This points symbolically to the young age of the organization and the average age of its members. However, the poetic name New Wave has a strictly political implication, which is determined by the formula: New ideas for the society, new elite for the authorities. The Forerunner The "wave" rippled through the political surface of the Lvov area on 15 February of this year. The idea came to Mykhaylo Kosiv and was very simple: to unite the people with democratic views for participation in the election, with no regard to party affiliation or independent status. The project was supported by Mykhaylo Kosiv's colleagues in the parliament--Ihor Hryniv, Viktor Pynzenyk, Taras Stetskiv, and Ihor Yukhnovskyy. Young people--Levko Zakharchyshyn, Yuriy Kolotiy, Ihor Koliushko, Oleksandr Kryvenko, Oleksandr Pavlenko, and others--joined the well-known politicians. For politicians from these circles, the participation of New Wave in the election was determined by two tasks: to get its candidates elected to the Supreme Council and to coordinate the pre-election efforts of the national-democratic center (first of all, New Wave, the NRU [People's Rukh of Ukraine], and the URP [Ukrainian Republican Party]) in order to have as many democratic deputies elected as possible. Out of 11 candidates on the New Wave list, four were elected to the parliament (we do not count Mykhaylo Kosiv, who was officially registered as an NRU member, but do include in this number Ihor Yukhnovskyy, who was nominated by New Wave, although he later left it). The average number of votes given for one New Wave representative was 16,100 (followed by the KUN [Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists]--16,000, the NRU--15,300, the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly]--9,100). Most of the New Wave members who lost the election ranked among the top five candidates in their districts. New Wave has a long "second string," which, in the absence of leaders already elected to the Supreme Council, may play in the local elections. However, it would hardly be correct to give credit for a measure of New Wave's success in the election solely to the organization. The seats were won primarily by those who have well-known political names (with the exception of Ihor Koliushko). That little-known New Wave members who, in terms of their potential, are worthy of a seat, were not elected may be put down as a demerit to the association precisely as an organization. New Wave has virtually failed to accomplish its second task--to consolidate national-democratic forces. As Yuriy Shveda, the chairman of the New Wave secretariat, said in a conversation, the Ukrainian Republican Party resolved to act on its own and, judging by the result, clearly overestimated its potential. Contacts with Rukh were more fruitful; in some districts, the NRU acted in concert with New Wave, although the latter itself compromised more frequently, perhaps even to the detriment of its own interests. In four districts, the Rukh people, while not running their own candidates, did not place the nominees of New Wave on their support list; in another four districts, New Wave and Rukh competed against each other. The election has objectively determined the place of New Wave among the leading political forces of the region: the NRU--292,000 votes, the KUN--239,000, New Wave--177,000, the URP--134,000, the UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian People's Self-Defense Forces]--103,000. These "big five," having won approximately 58 percent of the votes of the total number of the voting electorate and more than 82 percent of the votes given for candidates with a party affiliation, will undoubtedly determine the political reality of the Lvov area in the immediate future. This electoral analysis prompted the organizers to consider the feasibility of New Wave not only as an electoral association, but as a permanent political organization. It was registered on 6 May of this year, and on 9 May, the first convention of the New Wave public organization was held. However, will New Wave be of strictly regional significance? To answer this question, let us add a few strokes to its portrait. The Magnitude and the Direction New Wave is a public organization, but its registration document specifies that it aims to participate in the political process. In the words of Yuriy Shveda, it does not desire to become a party, because party discipline and hierarchy scare away the intellectual elite who do not wish to subordinate their thinking and actions to firm party norms. Finally, the status of a public organization makes it possible for members of parties to participate in it without quitting the parties. Members of the PDVU [Party of the Democratic Revival of Ukraine], the "Green" Party, the Social-Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, and the Union of Officers of Ukraine will run for New Wave in the local election. As of the moment it was founded, New Wave numbered 152 members. The Council, consisting of Mykhaylo Kosiv (chairman), Ihor Hryniv, Ihor Koliushko, Viktor Pynzenyk, Taras Stetskiv, and Yuriy Shveda (chairman of the secretariat--New Wave's working organ), is the leading organ of the party. Rayon organizations have been formed in Gorodok, Kamenka-Bugskaya, Zhidachev, and Dublyany. New Wave allows collective memberships; requests have already been filed by the Union of Architects of Ukraine and the Oblast Association of Handicapped. According to Shveda, in the immediate future the Association of the Left and the Student Fraternities of the Polytechnical Institute and the Forestry Institute may join New Wave. Yuriy Shveda responded thus to the question of whether the organization is to be a mass or an elitist one: "We would like our ideas to spread and enjoy mass support; in turn, this would give us an opportunity to implement our ideas through the parliament. Our attitude toward the qualitative composition of the organization is very discriminating, and we will prevent its penetration by the underclass in every way. This is not to say that the path to the organization is closed for workers or peasants. Admission to New Wave is not made contingent upon one's education and social status." As Yuriy Shveda said, New Wave is a national-democratic organization of a centrist, liberal orientation, although social-democratic views will also be manifested in it. New Wave believes that a transition to capitalism will have to be made sooner or later, and proposes to do it urgently in order to overcome the crisis sooner. Its main programmatic principles are to build up an independent Ukrainian state, develop a democratic society, and carry out immediate, profound economic reforms. It is important that New Wave does not restrict itself to programmatic slogans, but also has substantial studies, in particular, an economic reform program developed under the guidance of Viktor Pynzenyk. As far as the notion of national democracy is concerned, said Shveda, there are organizations that stress the first part of this combination of words, whereas others stress the second part. For its part, New Wave strives to organically combine them. Allies The New Wave leaders count among such the national-democratic organizations with a centrist orientation, primarily Rukh and the Ukrainian Republican Party, as well as the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, which, to the mind of Taras Stetskiv, while based on nationalist ideology, is not an extreme force on the pattern of the national-radicals. Yuriy Klyuchkovskyy, chairman of the Rukh Lvov Regional Organization, and Oleh Pavlyshyn, chairman of the URP Lvov Oblast Organization, fully agree that it is feasible to form a bloc of New Wave-NRU-URP-KUN (with the addition of smaller organizations--the DemPU [Democratic Party of Ukraine], the PZU [Green Party of Ukraine], the SDPU [Social-Democratic Party of Ukraine]). However, attempts to form a bloc have already run into insurmountable obstacles now, before the local election. Yuriy Shveda thinks that the position of the leaders is at issue, their desire for their own organization to be the leader in the bloc. Oleh Pavlyshyn put the problem [word illegible] down to contradictions in attitudes toward certain candidates in elections, but upon reflection noted that competition for the greatest influence, which cannot but occur among the leading forces, is also to blame. Ivan Hubka, chairman of the leadership of the KUN Lvov Oblast Organization, considers Rukh and the URP possible allies, although he complains about misunderstandings during the pre-election coordination of candidacies. As far as New Wave is concerned, to his mind, it does not have a national enough orientation. On the contrary, Rukh leader Yuriy Klyuchkovskyy believes that New Wave has shown itself to be a sufficiently national organization. If we sum up the positions of party leaders, it is easy to come to the conclusion that there are no fundamental obstacles to forming a bloc. However, small differences are frequently impossible to overcome if the leaders are not prepared to compromise for the sake of pooling their efforts. Non-Allies As Shveda and Koliushko said, New Wave will not cooperate with the left (i.e., the Socialists and Communists) and the extreme right (the All-People's Rukh of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party, the Ukrainian National Assembly, the Social-National Party of Ukraine), as a result of ideological differences. The attitudes of the right and the left toward New Wave differ. Yuriy Shukhevich, chairman of the UNA, called New Wave and the PDVU organizations that are hostile to Ukrainian nationalism and, correspondingly, the UNA. Oleksandr Holub, first secretary of the CPU [Communist Party of Ukraine] oblast committee, describes New Wave as a "bourgeois-democratic" organization, but does not rule out the possibility of cooperation, noting that New Wave has bright political personalities. New Wave and the Local Authorities The attitude toward the local authorities is very critical. Yuriy Shveda believes that most local organs of power, especially in the oblast, are organs that have become "self-contained," are not in touch with the public, and look after their own corporate interests in order to keep their positions. To Shveda's mind, the authorities have failed to create conditions for the economic development of the oblast and have turned out to be incapable of the substantive analysis of the condition of the economy and the preparation of programs for its optimum development. Such pronouncements differ from the position of the URP, which has nominated the current chairman of the Lvov Oblast Council, Mykhaylo Horyn, to that position. For its part, New Wave suggests that the voters vote for Stepan Pavlyuk, the director of the Ethnographic Institute and a former Supreme Council deputy. The KUN supports Myroslav Senyk, chairman of the state property fund. Rukh is to make a determination at the next meeting of the regional council on 7 June and choose between the two candidates, Senyk and Pavlyuk. However, the three organizations--New Wave, the NRU, and the KUN--have agreed on the candidate for the position of mayor of Lvov--on Rukh member Vasyl Kuybida. This indicates that the positions of New Wave, Rukh, and the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists are drawing closer and opens prospects for closer cooperation during the election. For its part, the URP has altogether broken away from them; its leadership has resolved in agony (by a vote of seven to five) to support for this position URP member Semkiv, sympathy for whom has, incidentally, also been announced by extreme right radicals. In addition, New Wave has nominated its candidates for the oblast council in 36 districts, and for the city council in 47 districts. New Wave and the Supreme Council Ihor Koliushko responded in the affirmative to the question of whether the members of parliament who ran for New Wave consider themselves its representatives in the Supreme Council. A group of New Wave men--Viktor Pynzenyk, Taras Stetskiv, and Ihor Koliushko--joined the Reforms parliamentary group; Mykhaylo Kosiv joined the NRU faction, and Ihor Yukhnovskyy--the Statehood group. Undoubtedly, New Wave nominees are sufficiently prominent figures not to be lost amid the mass of deputies. There is a different question: Will they proclaim themselves to be New Wave representatives? This may be of fundamental significance if New Wave does not intend to remain a mere regional organization. Prospects Will New Wave remain a regional organization, or will it strive for an all-Ukrainian status? Yuriy Shveda noted that relations are already being established with organizations whose views are close to New Wave in Ternopol, Ivano-Frankovsk, and in the Khmelnitskiy and Zaporozhye areas. Ihor Koliushko believes that the creation of an all-Ukrainian organization is possible primarily on initiative from below rather than from the center, and in the long term such a process is quite realistic. One thing is indisputable: The future belongs to the organization that will be able to unite centrist, national-democratic, and democratic currents in various regions of the state. To date, there has not been such an organization in Ukraine--all political forces are of a monoregional, and therefore marginal nature. Does New Wave constitute an attempt to contradict this rule?
