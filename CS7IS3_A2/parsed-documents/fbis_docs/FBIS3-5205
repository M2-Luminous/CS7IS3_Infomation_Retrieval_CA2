The gathering is the second of its kind, with the first held in Tokyo last year, and is sponsored by the Foreign Ministry. The idea was proposed by former Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and is expected to become an annual event. The aim of the gathering is to establish future-oriented relationships among four nations that were less than friendly during the Cold War era. Participants will tour the National Assembly, the ancient Korean capital city of Kyongju, the truce village of Panmunjom and industrial sites. They will stay two nights at private homes to get acquainted with South Korean customs.
