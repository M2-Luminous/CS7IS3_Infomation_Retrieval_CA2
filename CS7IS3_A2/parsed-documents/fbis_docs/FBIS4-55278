The president said that he has been working with Olechowski for some time, adding: "We have discussed those topics; however, we could discuss phrases." According to Walesa, Poland is not threatened by any attack at the moment. However, a lack of strategy, policy, and vision of the functioning of the states of Central and East Europe could be a threat. The president said that he was not surprised by the Constitutional Tribunal's decision on the dismissal of Marek Markiewicz from the post of chairman of the National Radio and Television Broadcasting Council. He "knew what the law is like and who created it." Walesa said: "It was created by Markiewicz, who knew from me that he would be the chairman, and that is why the law is structured as it is." "However, I thought the courts would view whether everyone in the country is independent and self-governing, and if this really was a balance of power seen in a different way," Walesa added [sentence as received]. In Walesa's opinion, this is not in agreement with the principle of balance, because everyone who has control of the press and television has most of the power, and "may even--as it happened--not broadcast what the president says." The president said that he is convinced he had to recall Markiewicz because he wanted to stress that "there must not be absurd situations whereby a workman has no money for bread and someone else earns 90 million zlotys, thanks to their independence, and the Council is the cause of such financial contrasts." The president expects from every chairmen of the council "harmony and cooperation." Walesa declared himself in favor of wage control in the economy, but, as he said, he did not block the earlier law so that he could sign one that is as "weak" as the new one. "I wanted to force the government to work out ideas tested in the world. So far, I cannot see anything new in this law, and my aim has not been achieved," Walesa said. [passage omitted] Asked if he would take up the role of mediator between the government and strikers, he said that, at the moment, "there is no need for the president to participate in what is happening." A proposal to mediate could be seen as the president "wanting to heat up the atmosphere" and "score points," said Walesa.
