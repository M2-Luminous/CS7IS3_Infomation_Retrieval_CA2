The settlement of Richard von Weizsaecker's succession should not be used for a change of power, Verheugen said before journalists in Bonn on Tuesday evening [15 March]. From the SPD leadership's point of view, a signal for the Bundestag election in October is neither expected nor desired from the vote of the Federal Assembly. The SPD is interested in preserving "several options" for a government formation on the federal level. If the Free Democrats do not vote for Christian Democratic Union [CDU] candidate Roman Herzog on 23 May, this will not induce the SPD to refrain from talks about an alliance after an election victory. In the election of the head of state, however, the Free Democrats have the opportunity to prove their independence, Verheugen said. If liberal political positions are decisive, it should not be hard for the Free Democrats to vote for SPD candidate Johannes Rau if they compare him with Herzog. According to Verheugen, it is still open when SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping will present his "shadow cabinet." This may be done before, after, or at the election party congress in Halle in June. The party chairman does not want a debate or private talks on that. Scharping is not looking for candidates. This is not the right expression. "I would say that he is sorting them out," Verheugen said.
