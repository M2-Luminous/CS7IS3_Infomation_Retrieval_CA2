Oleksandr Yemets said that candidates whom he would like to support (for example, Lanovyy), unfortunately, do not have any chances. The only possible competition is the one between Kravchuk and Kuchma. The nationalities minister stated that he is ready to support any candidate capable of countering Kuchma. "Although I have a great number of critical remarks regarding Kravchuk, the current situation is that no one but he can do that," Oleksandr Yemets said. The same position was voiced last week by People's Deputy Taras Stetskiv, one of the "Nova Khvylya" leaders, in an interview with VYSOKYY ZAMOK.
