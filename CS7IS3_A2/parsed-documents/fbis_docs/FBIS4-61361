"European political processes are too dynamic and sophisticated to be understood and influenced even with UN help. It's good that the Duma is debating the situation round the NATO programme. Russia can't afford to stay aloof to Poland's and other neighbour countries' NATO membership." The ex-president of the ex-USSR doesn't think the European destiny can be determined with the help of a former cold war tool -- or Europe will be in for a new split.
