As North Rhine-Westphalia Economics Minister Guenther Einert explained, this should put an end to the "concept of nothing but the export of goods." The cooperation treaty is the result of a visit paid to China by a delegation made up of 50 representatives of North Rhine-Westphalian companies led by the minister in October of last year. The main points of the agreement are: - The establishment of cooperation between interested companies from North Rhine-Westphalia and appropriate Chinese parties for the development and production of robust, inexpensive, numerically controlled machine tools that are simple to operate for the Chinese market; - The establishment of a technology center for the plants supplying the automobile industry in Wuhan. Under the recent initiative of the North Rhine-Westphalia Automobile Association, which was recently set up, partners will be sought who want to be based at the center and operate on a joint venture basis. - The development and construction of clean coal-fired power plants. The project should involve the participation of power companies and scientific circles. As Einert pointed out, China's coal reserves are estimated to amount to 970 billion tonnes. The growing demand for power on the part of industry, which is expanding, and private households has to be taken into consideration; 120 million people have still to be connected to the public power supply; - According to Einert and Wang Chunzheng, the deputy chairman of the PRC's State Planning Commission, cooperation should also involve joint research projects about structural change in the developed and newly industrialized countries; launching scientific and technical projects; and exchanging information about areas of interest for investment in both countries. The cooperation should be coordinated by a commission, which will meet twice a year and will establish a program for two-year periods. As Einert explained, the cooperation with North Rhine-Westphalia companies should smooth the way to Southeast Asia and provide the Chinese economy with competent partners. The minister thus wants to involve Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, and Hessen in this kind of cooperation and has already started negotiations with them. Wang stressed that the State Planning Commission, which is the top coordinating body for the economic activities of individual ministries and determines a framework for the further development of the socialist market economy, nowadays hardly ever issues "plans of a directive kind." In this respect, decentralization is "well advanced." Since the beginning of the economic reforms in China 15 years ago, one has increasingly gone over from "a principle of commanding" to one of "instructing." Thus, in 1994, only about 4 percent of the country's industrial output is "organized" through directives issued by the State Planning Commission. In addition, Wang has also been seeking longer-term involvement in China by German companies. China has a market of about 1.1 billion people that has to be supplied. Since 1990, industrial output rose by 6 percent in 1990, by 14.2 percent in 1991, and by 21.7 percent in the following year. The Chinese GNP has also risen at a similar rate: The GNP rose by 13 percent between 1992 and 1993 and is expected to increase by about 10 percent in 1994.
