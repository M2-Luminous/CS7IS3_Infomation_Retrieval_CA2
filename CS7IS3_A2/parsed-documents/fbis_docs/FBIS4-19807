Among other things, she asked for higher Hermes [export credit] guarantees to secure private German investments, longer terms for certain commodity credits, and more technical aid in development cooperation. Benazir Bhutto, who has been in Bonn on an official visit since Monday [18 April], promised private investors as much protection as possible. The World Bank and the IMF trust Pakistan, she said. The reforms initiated by her government -- the reduction of debts, the state deficit, and the inflation rate -- are showing first signs of success. In the modernization of Pakistan, priority is given to agriculture, the power supply, development of the infrastructure, and combating poverty, she said. According to Bhutto, because of bad harvests as a result of disastrous storms and because of the armament efforts forced by India, Pakistan is completely dependent on its friends in the Western world. In the conflict with India over Kashmir, she hopes for the "honest broker services" of friendly states like Germany. She affirmed her intention to turn Pakistan into a liberal, democratic state oriented to the market economy, one that might become a model for the Islamic world -- also regarding the situation of women.
