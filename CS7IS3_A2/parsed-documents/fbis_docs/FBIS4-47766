FBIS4-47766 "drafr085_cs94023" FBIS-AFR-94-085-S Daily Report 2 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Election Costs Expected To Exceed Budget Election Costs Expected To Exceed Budget MB0205162394 Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English 2 May 94 p 1 MB0205162394 Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY English BFN [Report by Greta Steyn] [Text] The election was budgeted at R [rand] 1.25bn [billion] in the 1994/95 fiscal year -- almost half the expected budget for housing. But the final bill could be much higher as unexpected spending on security, extra voting days and delays in counting votes add to the cost. The unforeseen R300m [million] bill to bring police allowances in line with the National Peacekeeping Force alone could take the overall costs to more than R1.5bn. A State Expenditure Department spokesman said at the weekend the election had been budgeted to cost R1.25bn in 1994/95 and was included in the spending totals released in March this year. He could not give a breakdown of what was included in the budgeted figure, but said it was possible the additional costs due to extra polling days could be accommodated within this amount. But extra spending on security would probably have to come from the police and defence budgets, not from the election budget. He could not comment on whether the R300m cost of the pay rise to 80,000 police officers, announced by the TEC [Transitional Executive Committe] last month, could be accommodated within the existing police budget. The TEC trebled the election allowance paid to police officers to avert a strike. The daily payment was raised to bring it in line with National Peacekeeping Force members' allowances. It was also annnounced that SADF [South African Defense Force] soldiers deployed to support the SAP [South African Police] during the election would receive a boost in daily allowances from R15,50 to R61,50, but the total additional cost was not disclosed. Economists said the extra security spending, when added to the election's budgeted cost, could take the overall bill to more than R1.5bn. The cost could be put into perspective by comparing the figure to the housing budget of about R1.6bn in the 1993/94 year. The 1994/95 housing budget is expected to be about R2.6bn. According to the IEC's [Independent Electoral Commission] preliminary budget estimates, the election would cost nearly R700m. (The figure did not include security costs.) The IEC said last week a spending update would be given once the election results had been announced.
