Mikhailidhis described the Council's meeting as a great political achievement for Cyprus, because one of the two goals--to include Cyprus in the countries that will participate in the EU expansion--was achieved. The second goal, he said, was establishing a date to begin accession negotiations. Referring to the joint statement of the Twelve, Mikhailidhis said the positions adopted are much more advanced than the ones we have had so far. He added that there is clear reference that human rights for all citizens must be safeguarded without any limitations or distinctions, and that any settlement or solution must be in line with the EU foundation principles. Mikhailidhis said: This means that the Cypriot Government's initial position--that a Cyprus solution must conform to EU principles and will allow us to enter and operate within the community--today has become an EU decision. Discussing the confidence-building measures, the foreign minister said the joint statement clearly holds the Turkish side exclusively responsible and hails the Cypriot Government's constructive stance. On the prospects of the EU accession of Cyprus, Mikhailidhis said January 1995 has already been set as the date to reevaluate Cyprus' application and the entire course for accession.
