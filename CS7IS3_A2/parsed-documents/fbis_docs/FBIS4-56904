FBIS4-56904 "drlat091_b_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 Aruba Haiti Jonassaint Refuses Comment Jonassaint Refuses Comment FL1005200494 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in Creole 1800 GMT 10 May 94 FL1005200494 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio Creole BFN [Text] Senator Bernard Sansaricq says Emile Jonassaint will be sworn in as president of Haiti on 11 May. Sansaricq made this statement before the press, and said that he [not further identified] has the support of the Chamber of Deputies to do this job, especially the support of President Monde. Monde, however, has explained that he gave his opinion on the matter as a citizen, and not as the president of the Chamber of Deputies. Everyone is waiting to see: Will Article 149 be implemented? Will there be a new president of Haiti? Everyone is waiting; meanwhile, the international community is threatening to impose a total embargo on Haiti, which will be lifted only when Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns to Haiti. The embargo will be relaxed only when three officials of the military high command's general staff resign. Only then will the international community infer that the Army has decided to comply with the Governors Island Agreement. The situation within the Haitian legislature, where Sansaricq made this decision, remains very very confused. Emile Jonassaint, whom Signal FM contacted, said he has not been officially informed yet regarding the matter of his installation on 11 May. Jonassaint says he heard about it only in the press and that he will have to make a decision and take a public position -- for he refused to make any statement to Signal FM -- once he is officially informed of the matter.
