More than 8,000 people who had fled Hong Kong to obtain foreign passports had returned to take advantage of the economic boom in 1992, said Deputy Secretary for Security Keith Kwok Ka-keung. "In the event of an economic downturn they could very well pack their suitcases and leave again. It is entirely possible," he said. He did not have figures for the number of returnees last year, but said it was likely to be higher than 1992. Results of a survey on the problem would be released later in the year? Mr Kwok said. Hong Kong University immigration expert Dr Ronald Skeldon said he believed "huge numbers" of emigrants had returned to Hong Kong in recent years and they were not reflected in official figures. Dr Skeldon said the territory should be very aware that an economic downturn would send these people away in large numbers. "The main reason they have come here is for the money they were unable to make elsewhere and if that should change, they will leave," he said. The departure of people who worked in highly-skilled fields would leave a void far larger than that caused by the 1989 Beijing massacre which acted as a catalyst for emigration. Mr Kwok said about 53,000 people emigrated from Hong Kong last year compared with 66,000 in 1992. Economic good times in the territory coupled with an economic downturn in countries such as Australia and Canada were major reasons for the drop. Another cause was a reduced intake from some destination countries. The figures are based on the number of visas issued by consulates in Hong Kong. They do not include immigrant visas issued in other countries which an in creasing number of people are turning to in an effort to bypass the long delays for visas in Hong Kong. Mr Kwok estimated a further 13 percent, or about 7,000, on top of the 53,000 who emigrated last year could have done so with visas obtained outside Hong Kong. That is an increase of about 12 percent from the 1990 figures. To counter the problem in 1989, the Government initiated the British Nationality Selection Scheme which offered British passports to 13,160 heads of households and their dependants. The scheme offered an "insurance policy" to skilled people and kept them working in Hong Kong rather than leaving to get foreign passports. Mr Kwok said it was "a bit risky" to say the scheme had a direct impact on the drop in emigration numbers for this year. But it might have had a stabilising effect.
