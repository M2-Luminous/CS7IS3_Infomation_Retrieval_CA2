Qiao, the first top Chinese legislator to visit Germany, and his wife Yu Wen were greeted at the Berlin Airport by Reinhard Fuhrer, vice president of the Berlin City Parliament. In a written statement released at the airport, Qiao said over the past few years the relationship between China and Germany has entered a new stage of the all-round development owing to the joint efforts of the two sides.
