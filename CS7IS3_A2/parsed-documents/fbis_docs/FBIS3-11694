An 18 March meeting at Planalto Palace was the most sensitive moment on the fragile path of return to democracy, which began when a civilian movement elected Tancredo Neves. The military leadership's reaction to the Judicial Branch and Congress found that Itamar Franco was absolutely willing to play the role of Juan Bordaberry (a former Uruguayan president who in 1973 agreed to military tutelage and was finally ousted in 1976). The military reaction also found that there are no leaders capable of putting out the fire. From now on, government decisions will need military endorsement. The political interpretation that is being made -- though in a restrained, discreet manner -- is that since 18 March, the independence of the branches of government has been put to the test, and that a sudden expression of military support has transformed an unconcerned president into a strong chief of state. Consequently, from a formal viewpoint, there is a president under military tutelage, a Congress with impaired morale, and a judicial branch that is resisting in order to avoid kneeling down. The 18 March meeting was dramatic. Civilian ministers with a seat in Congress were excluded under the pretext of suspicion: The agenda included salaries and, therefore, it was a matter of personal, direct interest to Congress (as if the matter were not also of personal interest to the military). Civilian Household Chief Henrique Hargreaves and General Secretary Mauro Durante began the meeting. The others, only four, arrived later, after pressing calls. The military chiefs gave their message in various forms. Admiral Mario Flores (head of the Strategic Affairs Secretariat -- SAE) outlined the more radical proposals, like closing Congress, replacing STF [Supreme Federal Court] judges, and calling for general elections (not for president). Flores mentioned these proposals as information. If the president had been receptive to these ideas, they would have turned into a formal proposal; if not, they were reports conveyed by the appropriate official. For the military, the episode is a history of treason that began in the negotiations phase before the economic program's issuance. The harshest crisis of this episode occurred on 18 March at Planalto Palace, and the outcome is still unknown. It is not merely a salary crisis but, above all, a crisis that has uncovered the lack of maturity of the current members of the three branches for the full exercise of democracy, and this breach provides room for adventures. The military leadership attempted to convince the economic leadership to convert its salaries on the basis of the URV [Real Value Unit] in force on 15 March. This request was denied after Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso gave assurances that the conversion date for all salaries would be the 30th. In giving that answer to the military, Cardoso was leaning on a previous agreement with the STF, to which the provisional measure enforcing the economic plan was submitted, having been encouraged to go ahead. Information that helped break the resistance of the military, which wanted to move the conversion of their salaries to an earlier date, was the compulsory salary equity embedded in the economic plan's provisional measure based on the mechanism of dates: By setting the 30th as the date for conversion of all salaries, the Executive Branch had in practice increased the duration of the work month for the two other branches by 10 days -- which traditionally pay their salaries on the 20th -- thus enforcing salary equity. The Judicial Branch killed that "egg of Columbus" the economic team believed it had found. After learning that the STF and Congress made the conversion on the 20th, the military felt it should not abide by any previous commitment. They pressured President Itamar Franco, in the absence of Minister Cardoso, to a forceful position, rejecting the claim by STF Chairman Otavio Galotti that he would enforce the Constitution. Galotti availed himself of Article 168 of the Constitution, but this article only sets forth that transfer of executive branch funds must be done before the 20th, without specifying whether salaries must be paid on that date.
