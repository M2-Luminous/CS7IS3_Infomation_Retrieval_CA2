The four are Robert Everton Neil and Robert Gammon, both of St. Elizabeth, Jamaica and Seaford John Singh and Stalinova Singh, husband and wife from Clarendon. All four were charged with possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply along with simple possession. Prosecuting Attorney (Crown Counsel) Adam Roberts said the foursome were part of a sophisticated operation, headed by Neil in the Cayman Islands, with an "origination" in Jamaica. Magistrate Peter Jackson denied bail for the four, despite the pleas from Mrs. Singh that she had six children in Jamaica and needed to care for them. Bail was denied on the grounds the defendents would likely leave the island as they have few local ties, Jackson said. The 352 pounds of marijuana seized by Drugs Squad officers has an estimated street value of US$450,000, said Drugs Squad superintendent Trevor Cutts. Cutts has not ruled out further arrests in the ongoing case and has said he is pursuing leads on how drugs are getting from Jamaica to Cayman.
