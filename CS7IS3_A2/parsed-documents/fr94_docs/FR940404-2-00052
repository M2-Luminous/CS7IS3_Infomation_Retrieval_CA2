FR940404-2-00052 FR940404-2-00036 Stanley Furniture Company, 1/5/94, RF272&hyph;57523 The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed on behalf of Stanley Furniture Company in the crude oil special refund proceeding being disbursed by the DOE under 10 CFR part 205, Subpart V. The DOE determined that the refund claim was meritorious and granted a refund of $2,948. In granting the Application, the DOE determined that ``finishing material'' was not a covered product and, therefore, not eligible for a refund because it was not purchased from a refinery. Stanley's claim was reduced by the amount of gallons claimed for ``finishing material.'' Texaco Inc./Bryan Texaco Station, 1/7/94, RF321&hyph;20013 The DOE issued a Supplemental Order concerning an Application for Refund filed by Petroleum Funds, Inc. (PFI) on behalf of Bryan Texaco Station and Herman Hudson. Bryan Texaco Station was granted a refund in Texaco Inc./Harley's Texaco, Case No. RF321&hyph;340. (October 9, 1991). The DOE received another Application on behalf of Bryan Texaco Station filed by Bill Wilfong. Mr. Wilfong claimed and documented ownership dates that overlapped with those claimed by Mr. Hudson. In response to a request for documentation of Mr. Hudson's ownership dates, PFI informed the DOE that Mr. Hudson did not own Bryan Texaco Station during the period he claimed in his Application. Accordingly, the Supplemental Order rescinds Mr. Hudson's refund and makes PFI and Mr. Hudson jointly liable for repayment of the refund. Texaco Inc./Hicone Texaco, 1/7/94, RR321&hyph;137 The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a Motion for Reconsideration filed by Robert Robinson in the Texaco Inc. Subpart V special refund proceeding on behalf of Hicone Texaco (Hicone). The DOE had previously denied Hicone's Application for Refund on the basis that Hicone was not a purchaser or consignee of Texaco refined petroleum products but rather a consignee for Lee Oil Company (Lee) and, therefore, not eligible to receive a refund in the Texaco proceeding. However, in the Motion for Reconsideration, Hicone presented evidence that the business arrangement between Hicone and its supplier, Lee, was such that Hicone was more similar to an indirect purchaser of Texaco products than a consignee for Lee. The DOE, as a discretionary matter, reviewed the Motion and determined that it should be granted. Accordingly, Mr. Robinson was granted a refund of $314 ($228 principal plus $86 interest) as an indirect purchaser of Texaco products. Texaco Inc./Tabbaa Oil Et Al., 1/7/94, RF321&hyph;14309 Et Al. The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning 14 Applications for Refund filed in the Texaco Inc. Subpart V special refund proceeding by indirect purchasers which purchased Texaco products from Cook & Cooley (C&C), a Texaco jobber located in Long Beach, California. On October 22, 1993, the DOE issued a Decision and Order in the Texaco proceeding which determined that C&C had been injured in its purchases of Texaco products. Texaco Inc./Cook & Cooley, 23 DOE Â¶85,158 (1993). Based on a detailed showing of C&C's costs and prices during the refund period, the DOE concluded that (i) C&C had absorbed the full amount of any overcharges it had incurred in its purchases from Texaco of premium and unleaded gasoline and (ii) C&C absorbed 58 percent of the overcharges for its purchases of regular gasoline. Consequently, the DOE concluded that the indirect purchasers supplied by C&C incurred 42 percent of the impact of Texaco's alleged overcharges in sales of regular gasoline. For their purchases of premium and unleaded gasoline, indirect purchasers supplied by C&C would not have been injured because the overcharges were absorbed by C&C. Regular gasoline constituted 48.3 percent of C&C's purchases from Texaco. In the absence of more accurate data regarding the applicant's purchases, the DOE assumed that regular gasoline also constituted 48.3 percent of the purchases made by C&C's customers. Consequently, the applicants in this decision were granted refunds based on 20.3 percent of their purchases (.42 x .483).
