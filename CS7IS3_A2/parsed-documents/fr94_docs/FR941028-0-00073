FR941028-0-00073 FR941028-0-00009 A commenter representing State regulatory authorities took exception to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of proposed ยง773.26 which would have provided that State determinations of ownership or control challenges be subject to OSM's oversight authority. The commenter asserted that those provisions were duplicative of other provisions of current regulations which provide for OSM's oversight of the States such as 30 CFR parts 733, 842, and 843. He further asserted that the Act established OSM's oversight power over the States and that such power required no reiteration by the proposed regulation. In addition, commenters representing State regulatory authorities argued that, under a system of State primacy, OSM has no authority to act, on a case by case basis, with respect to a particular permit decision by a State regulatory program, other than revoking the State's approved regulatory program. Thus, they questioned OSM's authority to review a State's decision with respect to ownership or control. They also argued that, if OSM review of State ownership or control decisions was done, this would lead to duplication and disruption in the permit application process. While these commenters asserted that the provisions of the proposed regulation should be deleted, they proposed that, if OSM insisted on going forward with the proposed provision or a similar rule providing for OSM oversight of State decisions, the final rule should make explicit that the initial decision of a State regulatory authority with respect to an ownership or control issue would be considered presumptively correct. They also proposed that a standard such as ``gross inadequacy'' should be the standard for OSM to apply to the review of the State decision. OSM disagrees with the commenters' analysis. First, OSM rejects the commenters' view that the proposed regulation is unnecessary since the Act and regulations already provide for OSM's oversight of the States. The provisions of SMCRA such as sections 201, 503, 504, 505, and 521, and the provisions of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR parts 733, 842, and 843 do establish a system of State primacy subject to Federal oversight. Nevertheless, such provisions do not explicitly address every question which could arise in the implementation of the relationship between OSM and the States with respect to ยง510(c) of the Act which, as has been previously discussed in this preamble, invokes significant issues of State primacy and Federal oversight. Further, the implementation of the AVS also invokes issues of State primacy and Federal oversight. Multiple State regulatory authorities and OSM will be making ownership or control decisions at various stages which are relevant to issues arising under section 510(c) of the Act. While the proposed regulation is consistent with the Act and with OSM's existing regulations, the proposed regulation's allocation of responsibilities among the regulatory authorities who will be making ownership or control decisions relevant to section 510(c) of the Act has not been previously part of the Federal regulations. The allocation of responsibilities provides necessary clarification to the regulated community, to regulatory authorities, and to the public. Accordingly, OSM must reject the view that the proposed regulation is duplicative of current regulations. OSM further rejects the view that, under a system of State primacy, OSM has no authority to act, on a case by case basis, with respect to a particular permit decision by a State regulatory program, other than revoking the State's approved regulatory program. A number of provisions of the Federal regulations, including 30 CFR 842.11 and 843.21, are very explicit in providing that OSM can exercise necessary oversight authority with respect to a particular permit without revoking a State's entire regulatory program. These other provisions are consistent with the system of State primacy established by SMCRA. The proposed regulation is similarly consistent. Moreover, OSM has a particularly strong interest in working to assure that ownership or control decisions are made correctly because the fruits of such decisionmaking will be incorporated into AVS. As has been previously discussed, AVS is used across State lines by the various State regulatory authorities and by OSM itself. Accordingly, a decision made with respect to an ownership or control link by one State regulatory authority has the potential to effect the outcomes of permit decisions by many regulatory authorities. Without consistency, there would be chaos. Federal oversight in these matters supports consistency among the various States in the application of the ownership or control rules and the outcomes of the decisions on ownership or control issues. Since these State decisions are ultimately incorporated into AVS, OSM's oversight supports the quality of the AVS.
