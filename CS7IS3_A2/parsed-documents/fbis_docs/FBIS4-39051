Get Running!"] [Text] In Moscow and Moscow Oblast the militia have started "hunting" refugees from countries of the near abroad and certain Arab regions. Organs, following a decree from the Moscow City Government, are to locate citizens in this category and unambiguously "request" that they leave Moscow Oblast. There are currently 6,000 refugees (it is thought) in the city. Not one of them is registered, since there is no relevant legislation covering this. These people are not even entitled to look for work or seek hospital treatment. Consequently, they are often forced into crime in order to earn money for food. Incidentally, the other day the Russian Federation president's Human Rights Commission prepared a report, which nobody has as yet examined, on the need to grant automatic Russian citizenship to any refugee who requests it.
