Tsai] [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan will work together with a European bank to strengthen ties with East European countries, the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund under the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced Wednesday [20 April]. A spokesman for the fund said that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Taiwan and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was signed in St. Petersburg, Russia Tuesday [19 April] during the bank's third annual meeting. Taiwan Representative in Belgium Lu Chao-chung and Bank President Jacques de Larosiere inked the MOU, under which the fund pledges to earmark U.S.$20 million to help finance economic reform projects in East European countries, he noted. Both sides agreed to the cooperative ties in February when Governor Samuel Shieh of the Central Bank of China met with de Laros in Paris, he added. The first loan project will go to an airport navigation system in Riga, Latvia, he pointed out. The spokesman pledged that the fund will provide more financial assistance to East European countries in line with the government's strategy to promote cooperation with that part of the world. Established in 1988, the fund plays a key role in supplying financial and technical assistance to developing countries friendly to Taiwan.
