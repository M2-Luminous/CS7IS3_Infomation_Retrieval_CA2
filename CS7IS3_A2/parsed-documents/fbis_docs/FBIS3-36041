Under the directive of oblast administration head Aleksandr Belyakov, 219 volosts have been formed to replace 230 village soviets. Executive power in them will be exercised by headmen [starosta]. The oblast administration is also receding into the past: It is being transformed into the government of Leningrad Oblast. The head of the administration becomes chairman of the Council of Ministers and simultaneously governor, while his four deputies are elevated to the rank of vice premiers. Instead of departments, ministries are now being created. For the time being the territory of Leningrad Oblast will retain administrative rayons to be led by the rayon administration. But the new government does not rule out the possibility that they will in time be transformed into uyezds.
