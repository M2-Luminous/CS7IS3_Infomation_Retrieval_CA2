Tiimann said the dismantling of the Paldiski reactors is the only military issue under discussion at the negotiations "on which (the delegations) have been working closely together." "To date, everything has proceeded as planned and in accordance with agreements," Tiimann claimed. Russia has more than once announced that it is prepared to start removal of nuclear fuel from Paldiski already in April and complete it by June. Tiimann said all possible safety and security measures will be taken during the operation, which is the reason why the dates and the route will not be made public. Russia plans to use for transporting the fuel new, TK-18 type containers, which have never before been used for this purpose. The authorities are going to test the containers in March to find out if they meet safety standards.
