Shunevich, first deputy commander of border forces of Turkmenistan, was on the line. "Remember how during our meeting last year I showed you a file of officers' applications requesting either transfer to a new assignment in Russia or discharge? Well, in the last two or three weeks it has `slimmed down' noticeably. Many officers have pulled their applications...." I can well understand the emotion and feelings of Vladislav Aleksandrovich. "Last year's" discussion was held about two months ago, and there has been a diametrical change in the mood of the chief of staff, who can finally dispense with the daily persuasion of each officer who had submitted an application that he stay on. The situation has been changed abruptly for the better by the agreements on dual citizenship and the status of servicemen of Russia's border troops on the territory of Turkmenistan which have been concluded between the two countries. Turkmenia's Russians have acquired dependable guarantees of protection of their rights, social primarily. It should be specified immediately that the situation of Russians, and of the so-called Russian-speaking population in the republic also, had been and remains the most favorable, perhaps, among the several tens of millions of their kinsmen who by the will of fate found themselves overnight citizens abroad. It would be fitting here to pay tribute to the political intuition and purely human sensitivity of President Saparmurad Niyazov. Whereas in other regions of the former state politicians have succumbed to the nationalist narcotic, from which their "withdrawal" continues, the Turkmen leader adopted as one of the first enactments of his presidential activity an edict according to which infringement of people's rights on the basis of affiliation to another nation or religion was deemed to be a heinous crime. Somewhat later this was emphasized in the constitution and reflected in criminal legislation. The problem of citizenship, which is painful for some former Soviet republics, has been resolved here in such a way that a substantial portion of the population did not even know there was one. All those resident in the country at the time of adoption of the Citizenship Act were deemed to be citizens of Turkmenistan, if the individual so desired, of course. The introduction of the Roman alphabet as the official Turkmen language has not been forced. True, the requirement of the compulsory knowledge by leaders of the top tier of the language of the indigenous people has brought about quite a significant reduction in the number of Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians in various echelons of power. But this feature has not caused serious complications: Many of those formerly sent by Moscow "to reinforce the personnel" have happily returned to their native hearths. Local former authorities have, on the other hand, no less successfully adapted to the changed conditions, having moved into entrepreneurial structures. The benevolent relations between representatives of all nationalities, which had taken shape over decades, have been preserved at the social level. And even today in even the most savage store skirmish for scarce commodities you will not hear offensive comments of the "Go to Russia and buy it there..." type. "Ours is an international work force," K. Khomutov, technician of the Ashgabat Akhal Airline, shares his thoughts. "Initially, after the republic had gained independence, there were those who wished to argue about who owed whom more and attempts to drive a wedge between us and the Turkmen. But Ilyas Berdyyev, chief of the Turkmenavia Administration, reacted promptly. He declared strictly that professional and businesslike qualities would, as before, come first for him, and he must be given credit for having kept his word in practice. We are working calmly and have no intention of leaving." "The situation in the country is, in fact, calm, society is not split, and tranquillity and benevolence reign," V. Cherepov, ambassador of Russia in Turkmenistan, agrees. "Nonetheless... there is an exodus of the Russian-speaking population. I consider it an entirely natural process. It began a while back, at the start of the 1970's, and the increase in migration following the disintegration of the Union is perfectly explicable: People have a certain feeling of estrangement from their historical homeland, relatives, and friends. And there are, in addition, transport and currency barriers and difficulties over children's tuition in Russian higher educational institutions. The children are taking in their old folk. Having completed their service, servicemen are leaving. And despite the very warm, friendly relations between our two countries, it was important to put the resettlement process on a legal, controlled basis. We have managed to do this as a result of the signing of the agreements on dual citizenship and the status of Russian servicemen." "Vadim Georgiyevich, we shall be revealing no big secret if we speak of the difficult path toward the signing of the document on dual citizenship and migration...." "No, certain `hidden reefs' emerged. Fortunately, President Niyazov is a politician who knows how to move toward a compromise, and arrogance is alien to him. At the most decisive hour, when it seemed that the Turkmen side would not agree with a most important point of the agreement, Saparmurad Atayevich went for the jugular, so to speak, of the two edicts he had issued previously. They concerned questions of the sale of privatized housing and the transfer of financial resources. "So the almost 400,000 Russians of Turkmenistan have acquired the opportunity to hold dual citizenship and resolve the problem of a move to Russia in civilized fashion. The parties have undertaken to put migration under state control--to facilitate the emigrant's privatization of his residence, the transportation of his personal effects, and the conversion of money earned by honest labor--and to help him fend for himself in his new location. Important also is the legal aspect in the day-to-day life of the Russians of Turkmenia who are acquiring citizenship of Russia. Although they are required to comply fully with the laws of the country of residence, they are entitled, in the event of a disagreement with a decision by the local law enforcement authorities, say, to appeal to a court of the second state. "Yes, the Turkmen leadership once again demonstrated the balanced nature of its approaches in domestic and foreign policy and an aspiration to act in the channel of international law. As we know, this step has evoked ambivalent evaluations among its CIS neighbors. Whereas Askar Akayev, president of Kyrgyzstan, decided to propose that parliament make an amendment to the constitution allowing of the possibility of the adoption of dual citizenship, his Uzbek colleague, Islam Karimov, has once again publicly repeated his proposition to the effect that a person with dual citizenship is a person without a homeland, in whom the feeling of patriotism has atrophied. I would very much like in response to quote artless lines from a letter of the economist Galina Mamedova from the oblast center of Tashauz addressed to the newspaper TURKMENSKAYA ISKRA: `15 years ago I married a Turkmen boy and came to live in Turkmenistan. This was not the near abroad at that time, and both I and my parents living in Yaroslavl Oblast and numerous relations scattered throughout Russia remained within one country. We could meet several times a year. But then this happened--the big country fell apart. And people such as I automatically found themselves estranged from the motherland and their near ones and dear ones. On the other hand, I have become attached to Turkmenistan and I consider myself a citizen of this state, my family is here, and my children were born here, yet I shall continue to be a daughter of Russia. A restless heart was being torn in two.... "`It is impossible to convey in words my feelings following the signing by Niyazov and Yeltsin of the agreement on dual citizenship! Now, a citizen of Turkmenistan with all the rights of this country and Russia on my side also here, it has not rejected me, I can live with redoubled energy and rejoice in each new day....' "And the new day in Russian-Turkmen relations is being prepared today even. Work on draft agreements on the avoidance of dual taxation, interbank relations, and mutual legal assistance is under way. "The times demand the restoration of all the severed ties in new soil--equal cooperation. We cannot live without one another--these words from a once-popular song are highly pertinent," V. Cherepov says.
