Therefore, the Kyonggi Provincial government plans to inoculate 22,000 cows and dogs in northern Kyonggi Province. On 25 February, a neighborhood meeting was held in 553 places to discuss measures against rabies and a propaganda campaign on the prevention of rabies was conducted. Meanwhile, the Domestic Animal Sanitation Research Institute in the Agricultural Promotion Agency recommended to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries that the northern district in Kyonggi Province be designated as the first district for the prevention of rabies. It was learned that rabies broke out in the Chorwon and Hwachon area last year, too, and that raccoons and wild cats that came to the villages to find food infected the dogs and cows by biting them in a fight. The provincial government also requested the military units to shoot these animals to death as soon as they are found, and handed down a directive to each county and city to slaughter the infected cows and dogs.
