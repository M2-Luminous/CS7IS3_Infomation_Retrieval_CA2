FBIS4-60242 "drnes099_l_94009" FBIS-NES-94-099 Daily Report 21 May 1994 ISRAEL Leaders, Others Comment on Capture of al-Dirani Leaders, Others Comment on Capture of al-Dirani Aim of Operation Reported TA2105083094 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 0700 GMT 21 May 94 TA2105083094 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Hebrew BFN [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] [Text] Israel hopes that last night's operation will shed a little light on the fate of captive navigator Ron Arad. According to Israeli intelligence data, the last person known with certainty to have held Arad prisoner was Mustafa al-Dirani. In the assessment of Israeli officials, al-Dirani turned the navigator over to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in exchange for money. The captive navigator's fate has been unknown ever since and no information has been received on this matter. In this sense, the aim of last night's kidnapping operation was to glean more information that could help reveal Ron Arad's location. Al-Dirani was captured by a commando force for interrogation purposes and in the future he could conceivably serve as a bargaining chip. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin decided to approve the operation with the recommendation of Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq, the head of the Shin Bet, and other senior security officials. On Thursday [19 May], the matter was brought before the Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs. The ministers were asked to maintain total secrecy. Not all the cabinet ministers knew about the operation, even after it had taken place this morning. A senior political source said that if al-Dirani's interrogation corroborated the information Israel already possessed according to which Ron Arad had been turned over to the Revolutionary Guards, Iran would no longer be able to deny any connection to this affair. Approximately one month ago, in the framework of a conference in Bucharest, I asked Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati why Iran continued to hold navigator Ron Arad prisoner? [Begin recording] [Segal, in English] Why is your country, Iran, still holding the Israeli POW Ron Arad? [Velayati, in English] I do not know how much this is related to the present discussion that we have, but I catagorically deny that there is any prisoner from Israel in Iran. Jerusalem says that last night's operation proves to the Israeli people and all the families that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the government continue their efforts. The soldiers risked their lives and carried out a raid against a tough target hundreds of kilometers from Israel in a difficult area under Syrian control north of the Beirut-Damascus road. Officials in Jerusalem said that this proved that Israel was doing everything to help its soldiers held captive behind enemy lines.
