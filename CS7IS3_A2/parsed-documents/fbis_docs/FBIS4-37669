Sifi said that France's view of Algeria takes into account the closeness of existing Algerian-French and Algerian-European cooperation and the situation in the Euro-Maghreban region. He explained that cooperation, whether between Algeria and France or Algeria and Europe, serves the interest of both sides. In the economic field, Mokdad Sifi indicated that the results of his visits to France could be embodied in comprehensive cooperation. In this regard, he said that the renewal of French loans to Algeria, which amount to about six billion francs will serve the interest of Algeria just as it will serve the interest of French investors. On the other hand, Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi, who was received immediately after his arrival in France by President Francois Mitterrand, announced that the latter had stressed continuing French and European support [for Algeria] in the political and economic fields. Regarding his talks in Brussels, Mokdad Sifi told the press before leaving Brussels for Paris that he has sensed the desire among the European partners to bolster cooperation with Algeria and provide their contribution so that Algeria can get out of the crisis as soon as possible. What can be deduced from this first foreign visit of Mokdad Sifi in his capacity as prime minister is that Europe has confirmed its readiness to release the loan of 200 million ECUs. In principle this will take place next September or before the end of December. The satisfactory results also include the need to set up a mechanism for swift negotiations with the aim of concluding a new partnership agreement to take the place of the 1976 agreement. This will be an agreement aimed at establishing a free trade area similar to what is currently under negotiation with Morocco and Tunisia.
