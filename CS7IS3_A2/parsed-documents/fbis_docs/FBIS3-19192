What is your reply to that? [Borrelli] We are quite happy. Rather, I do not know how to interpret this excessive agitation on Mr. Berlusconi's part. It may lend itself to several interpretations, not all of them consistent with an entirely calm conscience on the part of the agitated person. I repeat, we are happy. The prospect of a recourse to the CSM does not worry us. It seems clear to me, however, that the judicial initiatives of the District Attorney's Office are a matter of concern to those who believe themselves to be the subject of them. [Buccini] Actually Berlusconi said something different from that. First, he attacked an unnamed magistrate. Now he is directly attacking your deputy, Gherardo Colombo, adding that the aim of the Publitalia investigation was to attack a political adversary during the election campaign, and is urging that the situation be remedied, to "take control of the situation in which Colombo is playing a leading role..." [Borrelli] I consider it disgraceful to place a political interpretation on judicial initiatives which, apart from anything else, have been ratified by not one but three assistant attorneys and approved by the chief attorney. I deplore being dragged into these petty exchanges, but I am obliged to respond once again to defend my office, my magistrates, and the truth... This is not the first time that political intentions have been attributed to magistrates, with the sole aim of undermining their authority in order to defend those under investigation. I note that the unknown magistrate mentioned by Mr. Berlusconi in earlier remarks has now been named. This man, Gherardo Colombo, deserves respect for 20 years of service in the judiciary, during which time it has never been possible to level any charges of partiality or lack of independence at him. [Borrelli ends] Blow after blow, the battle between Fininvest and the Attorney's Office came to a head after Silvio Berlusconi's latest attacks broadcast on the evening television news. But throughout the day there was a heavy atmosphere in the office in Milan. Initially, Saverio Borrelli was cunningly evasive: "What statements by Berlusconi? I would say there was some shouting, rather..." Then he began to issue a response. And his tone grew sharper by the hour. [Buccini] Berlusconi talked about a system of justice working according to the clock and said: In any case, I am here to guarantee that such things do not happen again. He really has a grudge against the prosecuting attorneys, do you not think? Are you afraid that an attempt is being made to trap you in a corner? [Borrelli] I do not know whether that is exactly what Berlusconi said. But anyone aiming to prevent the prosecuting authorities from exercising their penal activities, to influence their timing and methods, is someone who has in mind a prospect opposed to that of the law-based state, a state in which everyone is answerable to the law -- not only ordinary citizens, but also the so-called powerful. [Buccini] But Berlusconi says that you took action on the basis of events that happened years ago. Why did you act right now? [Borrelli] I must just say that this is not true. In the investigation in question the events date up to mid-January 1994. [Buccini] A year ago you were under attack from [former Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi, and now it is Berlusconi's turn. The faces have changed, but not the nature of the polemic. Why? Are you really sure that your conscience is clean? [Borrelli] We have suffered many such attacks in the past, too. The truth has been distorted. Attempts have been made to attribute political intentions to initiatives taken to ascertain the truth. I reaffirm my complete confidence in the independence and honesty of all my prosecuting attorneys. As for myself, all kinds of things have been said about me. First, I was suspected of being a League supporter, then a sympathizer of Orlando's Rete, and last of being a communist or cryptocommunist... [Buccini] Be that as it may, there is no question that your office is again under attack at present. You requested a transfer to the court of appeal. A few days ago your deputies urged you to stay on, in a letter in which they forecast further difficult times for the prosecuting authorities. Do you not think that you could meet their request? [Borrelli] I am thinking about it. I will not conceal from you the fact that this letter had a profound effect on me. But it is not an easy decision. [Buccini] Why not? [Borrelli] Because... partly because, if I do stay on, there is a danger that I will be accused of being the deliverer. And I do not believe, and have never believed, in deliverers.
