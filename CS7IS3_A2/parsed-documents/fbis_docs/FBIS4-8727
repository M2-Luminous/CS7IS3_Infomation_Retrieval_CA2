FBIS4-8727 "dreeu074_c_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-074 Daily Report 29 Mar 1994 CZECH REPUBLIC Deputies on Potential Russian Threat, NATO Deputies on Potential Russian Threat, NATO AU1504123394 Prague DENNI TELEGRAF in Czech 29 Mar 94 p 3 AU1504123394 Prague DENNI TELEGRAF Czech BFN [Report by Ivo Zaloudek: "According to Deputies, We Should Counter the Potential Threat From Russia by Joining NATO"] [Text] We should counter the potential military threat in the event of undemocratic developments in Russia with efforts to join NATO as speedily as possible. At this time, however, the danger is not imminent. Vladimir Suman (Civic Democratic Alliance), chairman of the parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, and deputy chairmen Jan Kasal (Christian and Democratic Union- Czechoslovak People's Party) and Pavel Tollner (Christian Democratic Party) agreed on this answer. "The Czech Republic has satisfied the political conditions for joining the Alliance," Suman said and added: "I am convinced that if a real threat arose, our army would defend the sovereignty of the country. The quality of army morale is a different matter, and we will have to do a lot of work in that area. Most of the people in the supreme command are doing their best in this respect. We do object, however, to some actions of the defense minister -- one instance is the practical execution of the special assessment [screening] in the army." Jan Kasal said: "I am troubled by the idea that in the mind of some Russian politicians, our republic has not ceased to be a component of its sphere of influence, but since Ukraine and Slovakia are located between us and Russia, it is not necessary to see Russia as the direct potential enemy and aim the training of the army in this direction. Nevertheless, it would be wrong if the Defense Ministry published these matters in a completely open manner, and therefore, as I am not a member of the Defense and Security Committee, I myself do not have access to any details." According to Pavel Tollner, the danger on the part of Russia is based, above all, on its economic instability -- one example is the issue of "economic" refugees. "The potential military threat depends on the development of the political situation in Russia, which no one can predict," Tollner said. A deputy of the opposition Czech Social Democratic Party, Stanislav Gross, also perceives the danger from Russia as potential, and he believes the entry of the Czech Republic into NATO is a solution. Left Bloc Chairman Marie Stiborova, on the other hand, declared: "If any major and broader based conflict arose, neither armies nor arms would help." According to Stiborova, we should not join NATO "because if there were problems coming from Russia, they would be augmented by the expansion of the Alliance as a counterbalance to something else, like Russia, for instance."
