FR941110-0-00230 FR941110-0-00016 VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis A. Introduction We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all long term care facilities are considered small entities. However, individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any final rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside a metropolitan statistical area and has fewer than 50 beds. As described earlier in the preamble, OBRA '87 mandated extensive revisions to the Medicare and Medicaid requirements for nursing facilities. Under the previous system, long term care facilities were required to meet a set of requirements called conditions of participation. Each condition of participation included groups of standards, and standards were made up of separate elements. Enforcement was based on the level of the requirement for which a deficiency was cited. For example, condition-level deficiencies in a SNF resulted in the initiation of termination procedures and/or a denial of payment for new admissions. However, if only standard-level deficiencies were found, a plan of correction was required with no further immediate sanctions. Conditions of participation later became Level A requirements, and standards and elements became Level B requirements, as the result of a preliminary effort to dismantle the hierarchy of requirements as mandated by OBRA '87. We revised the requirements that long term care facilities must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs on September 26, 1991 (56 FR 48826). These requirements focus generally on actual facility performance in meeting residents' needs in a safe and healthy environment, as compared to prior requirements which focused on the capacity of the facility to provide appropriate care. As of October 1993, there were 10,512 facilities certified for both Medicare and Medicaid (dually participating), 939 SNFs certified only for Medicare, and 4,974 NFs certified only for Medicaid. HCFA data indicate that 7.3 percent (1,141) of all long term care facilities surveyed in 1992 were found to be deficiency-free. Facilities in full compliance with the participation requirements would not, of course, be subject to the enforcement remedies contained in this final rule. Six and one-half percent (1,021) of the surveyed facilities were found to have at least one Level A deficiency and would have been subject to denial of payment for new admissions and/or termination under the former enforcement rules. However, the number of involuntary terminations of long term care facilities for calendar year 1992 was 53 (29 SNFs/NFs and 24 NFs), less than one-half of one percent of all participating facilities. This figure demonstrates that most of the facilities identified during a survey to have at least one serious deficiency can and do correct deficiencies to avoid termination. The majority of the facilities surveyed (86.2 percent) were determined to have no Level A but at least one Level B deficiency, a finding that usually would allow the facility to continue to participate for a longer period of time while taking corrective action. The intent of the OBRA '87 legislation was to provide the Secretary and States with the authority to impose timely, alternative remedies on noncompliant facilities that, under the previous enforcement process, had no incentive to promptly correct deficiencies and maintain lasting compliance. Our proposed rule (57 FR 39278, August 28, 1992) delineated the process we would use to survey, assess, and enforce facility compliance with all participation requirements. It is clear that a large number of small entities will be affected by adoption of these procedures, and, as intended by OBRA '87, a substantial number of those entities are at risk of some remedy if they are noncompliant until they make changes in their operations to meet certification requirements. Therefore, we have prepared the following analysis which, in combination with the rest of the preamble, is intended to conform to the objectives of the RFA. We are not preparing a rural impact statement since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not have a significant impact on the operations of substantial number of small rural hospitals.
