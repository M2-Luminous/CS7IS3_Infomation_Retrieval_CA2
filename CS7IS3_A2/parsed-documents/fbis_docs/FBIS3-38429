FBIS3-38429 "drweu022_i_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-022 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Feb 1994 FRANCE Defense Ministry Announces Saudi Arms Deals AU0102154794 Paris AFP in English 1448 GMT 1 Feb 94 AU0102154794 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Paris, Feb 1 (AFP) -- France and Saudi Arabia have reached three arms agreements worth about nine billion francs (1.5 billion dollars), the French Defence Ministry announced on Tuesday [1 February]. The agreements, under discussion for the past four years, are for modernisation of warships and maintenance of missiles and radar systems, and should provide about 9 million hours of work for French industry and shipyards over the next six years, the ministry said. The ministry said the three contracts had required a final go-ahead from the Saudis, and that go-ahead had been confirmed by Second Deputy Prime Minister Sultan Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz Al Sa'ud to French Defence Minister Francois Leotard. The French announcement said that the confirmation was "the first concrete act resulting from the two countries' desire to strengthen their cooperation" after the visit to Riyadh by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur last January 8-9. "The work and services needed for maintenance and modernization of the frigates and of anti-aircraft defence equipment will be undertaken as of this year, after payment of the first down- payment", it said. An authoritative source said that to win the contracts, France agreed in its financial proposals in early January -- for the first time -- that the contracts did not need to be paid for at once, in the light of Saudi Arabia's cash position. The rate at which the jobs will be carried out reflects the "schedule of Saudi payments," which will be spread out over time, the source said. The three Franco-Saudi contracts are: 1) The ROH contract, worth 3.5 billion francs, calling for modernization of four 2,000-tonne frigates and of two 10,000-tonne tanker resupply ships sold in 1980 (Sawari 1 contract). The renovation will be done in Toulon, on the southern French coast, by Direction des Constructions Navales (DCN). The crews will remain on the six ships during the work, during which some equipment and on-board arms systems will also be modernized. 2) The SLBS maintenance contract, worth 3.4 billion francs, a follow-up on the 'Al-Thaked contract of 1984 for supply of short-range Crotale-Shahine ground-to-air missiles and of 30-mm bitubes. French manufacturers will supply spare parts and technical assistance. 3) The Shola maintenance contract, about 2 billion francs, for pyrotechnic kits (firing systems) intended for the short-range ground-to-air missiles already acquired by the Saudis. The program will make it possible to replace several hundred pyrotechnical propulsion lots relating to already delivered missiles, and includes technical assistance.
