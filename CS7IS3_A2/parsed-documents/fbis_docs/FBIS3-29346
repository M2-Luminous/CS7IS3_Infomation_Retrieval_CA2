The protagonist himself did not appear, thus arousing various observations. Rumors have been continually disseminated on Kim Il-song's intensified personal involvement in administration and politics, on barriers of receipt of foreign currency (Office No. 39 in the party's financial and accounting department)--the source of money for Kim Chong-il, and on Kim Chong-il's accident groundlessly spread in Beijing -- thus indicating stumbling blocks on the road of his succession to power. The atmosphere in North Korea is quite the reverse. In an editorial carried in NODONG SINMUN--the party's organ--on 16 February, the North Korean Workers' Party emphasized "the single-hearted unity with Kim Chong-il as the center," thus flatly rejecting such rumors. In addition, various events celebrating his birthday were held in North Korea and overseas. A banquet hosted by the party Central Committee was held on the evening of 15 February, a soiree by youth and students in Pyongyang and a soiree by the Ministry of People's Armed Forces was held, and receptions were also held. In addition, awards and citations were given to economic and educational circles on the occasion of Kim Chong-il's birthday. Meetings to resolve loyalty to Kim Chong-il were held by workers' organizations, including workers trade unions, agricultural workers' trade unions, and womens' leagues, as well as by youth and students. On 16 February, a national meeting of the juvenile corps was held in Pyongyang Gymnasium. The meeting urged the juvenile corps members to strengthen the "movement to learn from the youth of Kim Chong-il." North Korea's overseas missions also held events marking his birthday as usual. However, Kim Chong-il himself did not attend any events marking his birthday. Thus, the people have doubts as to his personal condition. Experts in North Korean affairs, however, do not attach importance to his failure to appear. Kim Chong-il participated in his 50th birthday celebrations in 1992. He attended, with President Kim Il-song, the celebrations held in the Kumsusan Assembly Hall on the very date of his birthday. He also saw a mass game, "With the party forever," held in Pyongyang Gymnasium by youth and students in Pyongyang. All this seemed to have been prompted by the custom of treasuring every 10-year mark. Kim Chong-il did not personally attend any birthday celebrations last year, either. His participation in a few political events, including the 8th Congress of the Socialist Working Youth of Korea held in February, encompassed all of his movements. In addition, there was no report on his activities during the month of February in 1991, not to mention his attendance in birthday celebrations. Proceeding from this, we will be able to confirm the changes surrounding Kim Chong-il only after seeing if Kim Chong-il attends the meeting to mark the 30th anniversary of publication of the socialist rural thesis--a political event to be held soon--and the Supreme People's Assembly meeting, which is usually held in March or April.
