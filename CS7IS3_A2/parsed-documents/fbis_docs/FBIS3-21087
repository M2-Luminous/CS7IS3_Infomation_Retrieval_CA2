This decision has paved the way for a Common Agreement which, at the time of writing, was imminent. Under the co-decision-making process resulting from the Maastricht Treaty, the European Parliament must give its agreement to the Council's decision in order that the Fourth Framework will become a legal reality. The Belgian Presidency can be satisfied that it has, by and large, ensured agreement on the new research programme under its Presidency. This was its declared aim as far as R&D was concerned. The significance of the achievement can be judged by the budget agreed to which, at 12 billion ECUs, comes close enough to the Commission's proposed budget of 13.1 billion ECUs. In addition, the terms of the Council Agreement also provides for an assessment, by 30 June 1996 at the latest, to determine whether an extra one billion ECUs can be provided, depending on prevailing economic and other circumstances at that time. This formed the basis of the compromise engineered by the Belgians. The Ministers also agreed on a formula for sharing the overall budget out among the different activities and specific programmes. They also agreed to a budget of 875 million ECUs for the Joint Research Centre (JRC). The Commission's original proposal called for just over one billion ECUs. The issue of how much of the JRC's work should be exposed to open competition was however left undecided. The Presidency advocated a figure of 16.5 percent while Antonio Ruberti, the EC Commissioner for Research, favoured something of the order of 17-20 percent. He thought that exposing the JRC to the open market was positive, believing that it would improve the standard of its work and promote cooperation with other European research laboratories. The Ministers essentially stood by the agreement taken at the Summit meeting of the European Council of Ministers in Brussels on 10-11 December, which made provision for a budget of 12 billion ECUs which could be raised to 13 billion ECUs by means of the reserve fund. In principle then, 5.9 billion ECUs should be available between 1994-1996, with the remainder, 6.1 billion ECUs set aside for 1997-1998. Regarding the sharing out of the Framework's budget, Ministers have increased the amount for the research programmes (activity 1) by 0.5 percent. This has been drawn from activity 4 (international cooperation). 0.5 percent has also been added to the energy research programme, most of this being used to pay for carrying out inspection work at nuclear power plants in Central and Eastern Europe. Information technologies/communications has been increased from 15.65 percent to 16.10 percent; however, that for communications technologies has been reduced from 5.70 percent to 5.25 percent. Life Sciences: The sum for biomedical research has been cut by 0.10 percent, benefitting agriculture and fisheries research, which has had its budget increased from 5.6 percent to 5.7 percent. Energy: The percentage for non-nuclear energy has been increased from 8 to 8.2 percent as well as the percentage intended to improve safety conditions for nuclear fission (from 3.15 to 3.45 percent). The Fourth Framework is divided up into four areas of activity: -- First Activity (Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Programmes); -- Second Activity (Cooperation with Third Countries and International Organisations); -- Third Activity (Dissemination and Application of Results); -- Fourth Activity (Stimulation of the Training and Mobility of Researchers).
