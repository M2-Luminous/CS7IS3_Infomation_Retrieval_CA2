The news analyst goes on: The "NSL" is an anti-national, anti-reunification evil law that denies reunification, blocks dialogue and opposes improvement of North-South relations. The Kim Yong-sam puppet group, however, is trying hard to avoid repealing the "NSL", turning a deaf ear to the strong demand of the people at home and abroad. This vividly reveals its despicable intention to maintain the notorious "NSL" and continue seeking North-South confrontation and further strengthen the "civilian" fascist dictatorship. The Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors said they would "reexamine" the question of repealing the "NSL" when "North-South relations have been improved", while maintaining such anti-reunification evil law as the "NSL" and putting the brakes on dialogue and reunification in every way. This virtually means that they do not intend to scrap the "NSL". The ill-famed "NSL" in South Korea must be scrapped without delay. Otherwise, the "civilian" regime will inevitably bump into stronger protests of the people and meet its disgraceful end.
