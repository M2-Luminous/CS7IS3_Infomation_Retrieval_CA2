Comrades Lu Rongjing, Wang Taihua, Liu Guangcai, Du Cheng, Tu Yijin, Yang Duoliang, Wang Sheyun, and Hou Yongtong attended the meeting, which was presided over by Comrade Fang Zhaoxiang. Fu Xishou's report is composed of three parts: first, concerning the economic situation in 1993; second, concerning this year's economic work; and third, opinions about propaganda work in the economic field. While talking about Anhui's economic situation since 1993, Fu Xishou said: Anhui enjoyed fairly rapid development in 1993. Despite economic fluctuations, Anhui has achieved its goal of maintaining rapid economic growth. As a result, Anhui ranks high in economic growth among all provinces in China. Bumper agricultural harvests and overall improvement of the rural economy have effectively supported the rapid growth of the national economy. Industrial production, which has increased by a large margin and enjoyed a large expansion in overall economic performance, has played a role in spurring rapid economic growth. Fairly good results have been achieved in the construction of infrastructural projects, adding more strength for economic development. In line with rapid economic growth, Anhui's incomes have remarkably improved, as have the incomes of its urban and rural residents. Important progress has been achieved in reform and opening up. The national economy has become more market-oriented. As a result, economic development is further invigorated. While talking about this year's economic work, Fu Xishou stated: Generally speaking, the basic tasks for this year's economic work are to deepen reform, promote development, and maintain stability by seizing opportunities and by doing our job in a thorough manner. Efforts should be made to ensure that reform, development, and stability will coordinate and promote one another. To achieve good results in performing this year's work, he put forward the following requirements: We should have a full understanding of current favorable opportunities and make good use of them. We should try in every possible way to maintain good momentum in our economic growth. Major efforts should be made in optimizing economic structures and enhancing economic performance. Particularly, we should rely on scientific and technological progress in a bid to manufacture more products with less input. In carrying out this year's reform, we should continue to concentrate on changing the management mechanism of state-owned enterprises; on actively exploring effective methods to establish a modern enterprise system; on accelerating reform in finance, taxation, banking, foreign trade, foreign exchange, planned investment, and other fields; and on establishing a macroeconomic control system that meets the needs of a market economy. More efforts should be made to carry out reform. With new breakthroughs in reform, we can achieve greater economic development. We should discover in a timely fashion and pay great attention to the problems cropping up during the course of reform and economic development so as to maintain stability of the overall situation. Concerning how to carry out the current propaganda work in the economic field, Fu Xishou put forth the following opinions: First, it is necessary to uphold the correct guidance of public opinion so as to steer Anhui people's enthusiasm and creativity to the drive of reform and economic development. This year's reform is unprecedentedly large in scale. We should have a clear-cut stand in publicizing and supporting reform. We should provide effective ideological guarantees and a fine public opinion environment for the introduction of major reform measures. Second, it is necessary to establish and give publicity to Anhui's new image. In doing so, the people of Anhui should seize opportunities, deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, and speed up economic development. In addition, we should also try to do a good job on the propaganda and ideological front. We should have a good command of the overall situation, persist in seeking truth from facts, and neither overestimate nor underestimate our capability. We should make more efforts in giving publicity to Anhui's achievements and progress. Third, we should actively explore new methods for carrying out propaganda work under a socialist market economy. In light of the central work and important plans of the party and government, we should effectively organize large propaganda campaigns and enhance our ability in organizing such campaigns. Meanwhile, we should pay attention to in-depth publicity. Particularly, we should be good at scooping out economic news which are of important significance of the times. Continued efforts should be made to publicize our excellent enterprises and quality products. Fourth, leaders at all levels should pay great attention to propaganda and ideological work, and should support such work with real actions. More than 570 comrades heard Fu Xishou's report. They were party secretaries and propaganda department heads of all prefectures and cities; directors of all county-level propaganda developments; responsible persons of relevant units directly under the provincial government; responsible persons of universities and large enterprises; and responsible comrades who attended the provincial meetings on radio and television work, cultural work, foreign propaganda work, press and publication work, and work concerning provincial federations of literary and art circles.
