FR940725-1-00059 FR940725-1-00010 Editorial changes are also proposed for the lead-in to paragraphs (b) with no substantive change. Current paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) would be redesignated as (b)(2) and (b)(3), respectively. Proposed paragraph (b)(3) would add more specific requirements if gated flap positions are used. Proposed paragraph (b)(4) is the same as current paragraph (b)(4). Proposed paragraph (b)(5) is the same as current paragraph (b)(5) except for changes in trim speed to V REF and the allowance of a two-handed control. Use of two hands is considered appropriate because the pilot does not need to change power settings. Proposed paragraph (b)(6) is current paragraph (b)(3). Proposed paragraph (c) could change the speed range for maneuvering capability from ``above V MO /M MO and up to V D /M D '' to ``above V MO /M MO and up to the maximum speed shown under §23.251.'' This change is considered necessary because a range of speeds can be chosen as V D /M D . Reference to §23.251 would ensure a flight demonstrated speed instead of a design speed. Proposed paragraph (d) would change the speed that must be maintained for power-off glide from 1.3 V SO to V REF . Section 23.147␣Directional and Lateral Control This proposal would make minor revisions to §23.147(a) and add two new requirements in proposed paragraphs (b) and (c). The flaps retracted configuration for §23.127(a)(4) would be consistent with the proposed §23.67. Proposed §23.147(b) would add a test for the condition when, during enroute climb, an engine fails and a time delay of two seconds occurs before the pilot takes corrective action. The intent of this proposed change is to test for a likely operational scenario and to ensure a satisfactory result. Proposed §23.147(c) would test for the failure or disconnection of the primary lateral control. This paragraph requires that the airplane exhibit adequate dihedral effect throughout the airplane's operational envelope to ensure continued safe flight and landings if a lateral control disconnects. In addition, this requirement provides compatibility with the relaxed requirements of proposed §23.177(b) (see proposal for §23.177). Section 23.149␣Minimum Control Speed This proposal would clarify §23.149, add a V MC in the landing configuration, and provide the procedure for determining a ground V MC . Current §23.149(a) would be revised in the proposal by making clarifying and editorial changes with no change in requirements. Section 23.149(b) would be revised by making clarifying changes and deleting the reference to lesser weights in paragraph (b)(4) because the range of weights is covered in §23.21. Proposed §23.149(c) specifies the requirement for a V MC in the landing configuration for WAT and commuter airplanes. This proposed new requirement is necessary for airplanes in this category to provide a V REF margin above the V MC determined in the landing configuration. (See proposal for §23.73.) The new §23.149(f) proposes the requirements for determining a V MCG for commuter category airplanes, at the option of the applicant, to comply with §23.51. (See proposal for §23.51.) Section 23.153␣Control During Landings This proposal would revise §23.153 to reference landing speeds to V REF and to reorganize the section. Section 23.155␣Elevator Control Forces in Maneuvers Proposed §23.155 would make changes to the power and gradient of the stick force curve. Proposed §23.155(b) specifies the maximum continuous power for the test instead of allowing a power selected by the applicant as an operating limitation. This revision would eliminate a power specification that is unnecessary and would simplify normal operations for the pilot. Proposed §23.155(c) addresses stick force gradient to ensure that stick force lightening is not excessive. The FAA will issue advisory material on acceptable methods of compliance.
