FR940719-2-00113 FR940719-2-00062 B2.3 Justification of Level of Accuracy The precision of the impact estimates is measured by the size of the smallest program effect that could be detected as statistically significant at the .05 level with 80 percent power with a given sample. This is the ``minimum detectable effect.'' Exhibit B.4 shows the minimum program effects on several different outcomes that would be detectable under the optimal sample allocation shown in Exhibit B.3. 20 The top panel of the exhibit is based on the conservative assumption that the lease-up rate for the experimental group will be 20 percent; the bottom panel assumes a 40 percent lease-up rate for this group. 20 The estimates in Exhibit B.4 assume an educational attainment rate of 50 percent and an employment rate of 70 percent in the absence of assistance. They also assume mean earnings of $7,488, with a standard deviation of $7,087 in the absence of assistance (based on the earnings of low-income adult women in the National JTPA Study sample), and 30 percent sample attrition between random assignment and follow-up. As shown in Exhibit B.4, if the lease-up rate for the experimental group turns out to be 20 percent, we can be confident of detecting a program-induced increase of 7 percentage points in the educational attainment rate of children in families who lease up in the Section 8 control group_an increase of 14 percent in the proportion receiving a high school diploma or GED. 21 A 6.4 percentage point increase in the employment rate of adults who lease up in the Section 8 control group would be detectable with 80 percent power, as would a $992 (13 percent) increase in their earnings. 21 The figures in Exhibit B.4 are minimum detectable effects on families who successfully lease up, not on the entire treatment group. Because a much smaller proportion of the experimental group is expected to lease up successfully and receive assistance, effects on assistance recipients in this group must be much larger to be detectable. With a 20 percent lease-up rate, the minimum detectable effects on educational attainment and earnings are both about one-third of the control mean for this group. The smallest detectable effect on the employment rate of MTO assistance recipients will be about 16 percentage points. The final column of Exhibit B.4's upper panel shows the minimum detectable differences between the impact on the regular Section 8 group and the impact on the MTO group. If the MTO lease-up rate is 20 percent, differences in impact in the 21 to 32 percent range would be detectable.
