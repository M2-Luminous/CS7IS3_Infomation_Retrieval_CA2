The spokesman said scientific U.S. and European circles emphasize that the mysterious disease that U.S. and British servicemen caught in the Gulf war could be traced to the intensive use by American forces of uranium-coated projectiles mounted on tanks and antitank aircraft. An official spokesman for the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health recently admitted nuclear radiation was detected in tank and truck chassis north of Kuwait City, the Iraqi spokesman noted. This is in addition to reports published by U.S. circles, like the Nevada-based RURAL ALLIANCE [name as received] about attempts by the U.S. Department of Defense to suppress the side effects of these substances on the crews manning U.S. tanks and aircraft to avert insubordination. The Iraqi spokesman's statements are in reaction to an allegation made by Senator Donald Riegle before the Senate yesterday that, in the late '80's, a U.S. firm sold Iraq the biological substances that it might have used in the war. The U.S. senator's contentions are yet another silly and pointless attempted whitewash to deflect attention and influence the course of investigations. The senator, the spokesman added, might have sought to bring the real explanations to light and used his legal powers to bear instead of lying to Congress and the U.S. public.
