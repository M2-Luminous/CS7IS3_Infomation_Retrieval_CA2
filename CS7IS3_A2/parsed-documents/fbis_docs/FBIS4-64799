The first Finnish military delegation returned this afternoon from the observation trip, which is part of the CSCE agreement. Finland has previously made a few smaller assessment visits to individual units in the areas near Finland. Our correspondent Ritva Saila met the delegation when it returned. [Begin Saila recording] The equipment in the Kantalahti-Alakurtti area is of such a caliber that Finland could be quickly cut in two in case of a crisis. It has been said that the bridges and dams on the Kemijoki river could be destroyed in a moment. Near the area of Salla, only a few dozen kilometers from the border, there has for years been a motorized infantry division of 6,000-7,000 men. However, in the last few years equipment in that area has increased. According to international information, a couple of helicopter regiments have been moved there from Central Europe, mainly Germany. It is said that they have 200 helicopters, including the fastest helicopter gunships in the world, the Mi-24. The Finnish military delegation that returned today from the Kantalahti-Alakurtti area and its leader, Colonel Tauno Ylanne from the headquarters of the northern defense area, are not prepared to confirm this Western information. [Ylanne] It is likely that this information is untrue because, according to our observations -- or should I say we did not observe this, but we only checked the information that the Russians have given in the CSCE process -- we compared that information. Quite simply I could say that in my view the main thing is that we did not observe such -- in the area where we moved -- such military activity that would somehow be contrary to the CSCE agreement, different from what the Russians have announced. [Saila] Col. Ylanne stressed that the equipment in Alakurtti corresponds to the information given by Russia. [Ylanne] According to our observations, what they have announced is more or less true. [Saila] Are they defense or attack weapons? [Ylanne] They are military weapons, and of course you can use them for both purposes. [Saila] Could you in some way consider these as a threat to Finnish security? [Ylanne] No. In my view the arms as such cannot be viewed as a threat to Finnish security, especially as we have such friendly relations at the moment. [Saila] It has been said that more troops are going to be moved to that area; is that true? [Ylanne] Well, the aim of our trip was not to find out about that, but our aim was to observe military activities there at the moment and during the time we were there. [end recording]
