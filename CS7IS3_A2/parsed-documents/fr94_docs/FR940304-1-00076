FR940304-1-00076 FR940304-1-00014 a. General Analytical Comments Discount Rates The Department's plans to use a 7 percent discount rate in the standards' analyses drew more comments than any other issue. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 6; Public Citizen, No. 7 at 4; Wayne Goode, No. 8 at 1; Ohio Sierra Club, No. 11 at 1; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 5 and appendix; Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 1; Citizens Environmental Coalition Education Fund, Inc. No. 18 at 1; California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 2; Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 3; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1; Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 2; Champaign County (IL) Board, No. 36 at 1; Washington Gas Light, Inc., No. 37 at 2; George Smith, No. 38 at 1; Lone Star Gas Co., No. 39 at 2; Florida Energy Office, No. 42 at 2; Sierra Club, No. 43 at 2; Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 7; Helen Satterthwaite, No. 67 at 1; Warren Widener, No. 78 at 1; and Martin Frost, No. 80 at 1). 7 Most of the comments asserted that the 7 percent rate was unjustifiably high, while several stated that a 7 percent or even higher rate was an appropriate rate for the various analyses. 7 Comments on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking have been assigned docket numbers and have been numbered consecutively. Commentators seeking a higher rate focused on consumer impacts, while those advocating a lower rate generally pointed to societal benefits. These different perspectives are not easily captured in a single discount rate. The Department has reconsidered the issue, and has decided that multiple discount rates, with each pertaining to a different perspective, are warranted. These different rates (i.e., consumer, commercial and societal) are used to capture the impacts of the standards on different constituents. The consumer and commercial rates are used to calculate life-cycle costs for purchasers of residential and commercial products, respectively. The social discount rate is used to calculate the net present value of standards for the Nation as a whole. Separate rates, therefore, were used for the consumer sector, the commercial sector (since fluorescent lamp ballasts are purchased primarily by commercial firms), and for society as a whole. This discussion will describe the derivations of the consumer, commercial and social discount rates that were used in the different analyses. 1. Consumer discount rate. On November 17, 1989, DOE published a final rule for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, freezers, and small gas furnaces (54 FR 47916, November 17, 1989), hereafter referred to as the November 1989 final rule. In the November 1989 final rule, DOE selected a 7 percent discount rate, based on a methodology derived from the Court of Appeals decision, Natural Resources Defense Council v. Herrington, 768 F.2d 1355, 1406 (D.C. Cir 1985). As discussed in the November 1989 final rule, the applicability of the court decision changed somewhat with the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;514). The Tax Reform Act phased out the deductibility of interest paid on consumer loans. Based on the revised methodology, DOE calculated a range of discount rates that consumers incur; this range is from less than 1 percent to slightly more than 15 percent. As explained in the November 1989 final rule, DOE selected 7 percent for the analysis for purposes of that rulemaking proceeding because it was near the mid-point of the potential consumer discount rates. In addition, DOE believes that the approach is reasonable in that it was related to the opportunity cost of money for purchasing consumer durables. As such, it was justified in terms of alternate consumer purchases that are foregone in order to finance the purchases of appliances. In a subsequent final rule on energy conservation standards for dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers (56 FR 22250, May 14, 1991), hereafter referred to as the May 1991 final rule, the Department restated that the 7 percent rate was near the mid-point of the range of consumer finance rates for the purchase of appliances. It was further stated that if the Department could obtain data on the methods that consumers use to purchase appliances, it could develop a weighted-average, real, after-tax finance rate to use as a consumer discount rate in the analysis. In its comments on the September 1990 advance notice, Whirlpool Corporation offered estimates of consumer financing of purchases of its equipment: 40 percent of retail sales are paid in cash; 35 percent use credit cards; 25 percent use retailer loans. These figures excluded new home construction, which accounts for approximately 25 percent of Whirlpool Corporation's total sales. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1&hyph;2 and Appendix 1.) While Whirlpool Corporation represents only one source of data, the Department has no reason to believe that Whirlpool Corporation's customers differ from those of other manufacturers, and, therefore, accepted Whirlpool Corporation's estimates as representative. These numbers were applied to the real, after-tax finance rates that are incurred by consumers, as reported in the November 1989 final rule. Those rates were estimated to be just over 3 percent for appliances purchased as part of a new home (whose finance rate is a tax-deductible mortgage interest rate), to slightly under 1 percent for cash purchases, to more than 15 percent for credit card purchases.
