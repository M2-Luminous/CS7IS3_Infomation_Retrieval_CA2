One of the reasons for this fall is the deepeening of reform and the widening of opening to the outside world which has lead to a number of students seeing their ability to earn money in the Mainland and chances to fully exploit their talents there. In past years, some people felt that there was no role for them in the Mainland and that intellectuals were not adequately rewarded. Going abroad, therefore, was seen as a way out of this situation. Now, many people originally planning to go abroad question why they need to do so since there are now ways to employ their talents at home. Another reason for the drop is the increasing rise of expenses involved in going abroad to study and the difficulties faced by foreign countries in taking so many Chinese students. Some of the foreign countries which in the past had taken in many Chinese students have now adopted restrictive measures in light of depressed economies and social problems. Despite the fall in the number of students going abroad at their own expense, students with post-graduate qualifications constituted 27 percent of such students. In 1993, however, the ratio increased to 36 percent and in the first half of last year, among the students going abroad from Beijing University, Qinghua University and the Beijing Medical Sciences University, those with post-graduate qualifications made up over 40 percent.
