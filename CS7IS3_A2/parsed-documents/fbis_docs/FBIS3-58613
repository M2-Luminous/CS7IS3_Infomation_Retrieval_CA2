The left hoped to convert a try into a goal after the nine "wise men" of France's constitutional court cancelled the key part of a controversial education bill that had revived the country's long-running "schools war." The Paris demonstration was originally planned to protest the new legislation which granted unlimited use of public funds to the country's private, mainly Catholic, schools. But the court slapped it down, ruling that the central article of the bill was unconstitutional because it upset the balance between the state and private school systems. A crowd of between 300,000 and 350,000 was expected to march through the city for most of the day on Sunday, grouping teachers, students and parents' associations, trade unions and freemasons as well as socialists and communists. Organisers hired 66 special trains and 1,800 buses to bring demonstrators into the capital from the provinces. The court ruling was the left's first victory over conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur since it was heavily defeated in legislative elections last March. Socialist Party leader Michel Rocard is eager to capitalise on the win as his party prepares for a series of conferences aimed at building a broad centre-left coalition ahead of next year's presidential elections. Rocard termed the ruling a "victory" for the left and renewed his calls for a big turnout on Sunday. Balladur, who had come under fire from both left and right after the education bill was rushed through the senate last month in the middle of the night, beat a hasty retreat after the court ruling. Government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said it would be "imprudent" to submit a new education bill for the moment while Education Minister Francois Bayrou called for "dialogue" and said he wanted to "restore the self-confidence of the state education system." One reason for going ahead with Sunday's demonstration was the difficulty of calling it off at short notice, but Balladur will be carefully watching the turnout and hoping that the cancellation of the law will dampen enthusiasm. It was undoubtedly a reversal for the prime minister but this was preferable to being forced to defend an increasingly indefensible corner, analysts said. Although Balladur has been consistently popular in opinion polls since become prime minister in April, the schools law was definitely unpopular, with most people believing that additional funds for private schools could only come at the expense of the public school system. Polls this week showed that 50 percent of the French thought the law was wrong against 34 percent who approved of it. Another poll said that 40 percent supported Sunday's demonstration, with 21 percent against and 30 percent undecided. Socialist President Francois Mitterrand waded into the controversy on Thursday, attacking Balladur for his "unfortunate initiative" and cheering on the left. Worse still, the bill was also criticised on the right. Jacques Chirac, leader of Balladur's own neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) party and a rival to the prime minister as possible candidate in 1995 presidential elections, said he "understands perfectly" that there were "reservations" about the way the bill was voted. Former conservative prime minister Raymond Barre strongly attacked it as "a signal blunder" and called for a new parliamentary debate. National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin weighed in with an ode in praise of the secular education system. Balladur counterattacked, allocating 440 million dollars for urgent repairs in state schools while arguing that the bill was an "act of fairness" and "an election promise that had to be kept." That cash will still be spent, amid general relief in the government that the constitutional court got it off the hook.
