For the first time since December 12, this created a basis for joint actions of the two branches of power in implementing the economic reform. Glazyev believes that "the work of the government does not correspond exactly to the political course, outlined in the presidential address to the Federal Assembly." Substantiating his point of view, he cited numerous facts of privileges granted by the government to some enterprises and industries, of mistakes made in the sphere of economic restructuring and the implementation of the privatization programme. Instead of supporting science-intensive industry on a priority basis, it was nearly ruined: The reduction of output reached the catastrophic level of 90 per cent. This is true of microelectronics and precise machine-building. According to Glazyev, it is necessary to insist on the adoption of laws, which will simplify the tax system and make it more rational, establish order in the sphere of tax collecting and toughen criminal responsibility for the violation of the currency and customs legislation. In this case the state will have enough strength for supporting priority industries.
