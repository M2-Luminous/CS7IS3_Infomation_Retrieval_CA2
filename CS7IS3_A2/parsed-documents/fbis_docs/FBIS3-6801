During the alert, all major commanders and staff officers should stand by within easy access to communications, and leaves and outings of all officers and men will be controlled. An officer said the alert is to ensure firmer security preparedness as President Kim Yong-sam, the supreme military commander, is making an overseas tour at a time when a tension is building up on the Korean peninsula following the breakup of Panmunjom talks. President Kim leaves the country on March 24 to embark on an official visit to Japan, which will be followed by his tour of China. "Apart from the special alert, the special military preparedness order issued earlier for a period until the end of this month, will be extended for the time being," the officer said.
