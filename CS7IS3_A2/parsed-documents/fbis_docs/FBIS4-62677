But the opposition can hardly now exert influence on the decisions adopted by the ruling Agrarian majority. Especially since everyone is aware that the people who are screaming most loudly about the loss of the republic's independence are those who are least interested in it. They are mainly people who favor unification with Romania and who regard Moldavia's joining the CIS as another major obstacle to realizing their secret dream. However, the question of the CIS should not be viewed solely in black and white. It is far more complex. Among its opponents are also people who are not dying to join Romania, but who are afraid that a powerful country like Russia will dictate its political and economic will and turn Moldavia into a satellite. "That is the mentality of small countries," I was told by economist A. Muravskiy, an Agrarian deputy. "They differ from large countries in their pathological sensitivity to any encroachment on their rights." The so-called "Westerners," seeking a panacea to all ills in the opposite direction to the east, also take a suspicious view of the CIS. But many economists believe that the Republic will be unable to break into the Western market in the near future. For instance, during the first two months of the year imports from the wider world were quadruple the amount of exports. Moreover, the bulk of the deliveries were paid for in hard currency. Paradoxically enough, it is easier for Moldavia to get closer to the West via the eastern market. Experts think that Western investors regard it as a kind of bridge in that direction. So, however you look at it, the CIS may be a case of bleak or longed-for necessity, but necessity nonetheless. Based on the results of the first two months of the year Moldavia's foreign trade turnover with CIS countries totaled around 75 percent, with Russia remaining the main player. It accounts for almost 62 percent, followed by Ukraine (8.5 percent) and Belorussia [Belarus] (2.3 percent). But here too the balance of trade is by no means in Moldavia's favor. Imports exceed exports by 137 million leu, of which gas shipments from the Russian Federation make up the lion's share. Joining the CIS means hope for Moldavia -- according to the corresponding article of the treaty -- of freer movement of goods, services, money, and manpower, coordinated money-credit and tax policy, and more acceptable customs duties.... However, what is for some people a long-awaited and for others an unwanted decision will not per se instantaneously ease the situation. That is already clear to even the staunchest supporters of the Commonwealth -- people who have gotten over the period of naive romanticism, when it was thought that all that was needed was to sign the treaty and the economic wheel would turn toward stabilization. The political train has gone a long way, crushing the old economy. Time will tell whether it has gone forward or backward, but the fact that different realities have taken shape is indisputable. Just as something else is also obvious: A new economy has not so far emerged to go with them. At the moment losses are being calculated. Moldavia has been left without an industry. Whereas a few years ago it accounted for 67 percent of the budget, last year the figure was only 9.3 percent. And the slump has not stopped. Orientation on the agro-industrial complex alone is depriving the republic of any hope of ranking as a developed country. Even the CIS itself still looks pretty vague and unsteady. So it will hardly prove possible rapidly to restore the severed ties. And it is the loss of these ties that Moldavian Premier A. Sangheli sees as one of the main reasons for the current crisis, added to the vast material losses that the Republic sustained owing to its refusal to ratify the treaty in the first place. This refusal not only cost Moldavia a large sum of money, but also brought about the early resignation of the former corps of deputies and the government. The election winners have come to power; and rapidly signed the treaty. The first step has been taken. It is still hard to say whether they have won or had victory thrust upon them, although a policy of interest and compromise does seem to be replacing the policy of confrontation in Moldavia. However, it is too early to say whether this is the end of the story. There is probably more to come.
