At a press conference, Green spokesman Carlo Ripa Di Meana announced his group has issued an official protest to the Lower House speaker, claiming that a mandate to Berlusconi would violate current laws on conflicts of interest and appealed to the president "to reflect with all his wisdom to avoid an intolerable moral and political distortion." Ripa Di Meana also claimed that Scalfaro, in private consultations with Green party officials, acknowledged that the March elections which swept Berlusconi's three-way coalition to victory were "unequal." "I quote directly, unequal," he repeated, referring to Berlusconi's ownership of the country's three largest private television networks, controlled by his Fininvest Group. Pierluigi Capone, an attorney for the Greens, asserted that Berlusconi, being in control of three nationwide TV broadcasters, stands in violation of a 1957 law on conflicts of interest. He said "the army of Fininvest employees and officials who are filling up the Lower House" are in the same position. Separately, Democratic Left Party Secretary Achille Occhetto said a mandate to Berlusconi "raises serious concerns" because "the Fininvest owner would assume political power and, at the same time, enormous economic power, especially power over information, something that has no equal in other countries." Occhetto wondered whether "democratic guarantees will be respected, beginning with the right to information" under such conditions. "We must prevent Fininvest from acting in the service of the executive," he added, claiming that the guarantees offered by the president are certainly part of his duties but not enough to guarantee plurality in mass media.
