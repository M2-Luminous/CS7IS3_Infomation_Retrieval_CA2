"In Nairobi they will continue to work on Somali issues," department spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters at a news briefing. "There is a small number of essential personnel who remain behind in Mogadishu to carry out a lot of the necessary work we do in liaison with the U.N. mission," McCurry said. Since Thursday, there have been some serious inter-clan fightings in Mogadishu between the Aidid faction on one side and a coalition of clans on the other side, according to the spokesman. Over the weekend, some of the gun battles occurred in areas directly adjacent to the U.N. mission compound in Mogadishu. "The compound was not the target of any of the fighting that occurred over the weekend," McCurry said, "but stray rounds have hit the compound, resulting in some injuries," that included a U.S. civilian working for a U.N. contractor in Somalia. There are some reports that there have been some resumption of shelling in Mogadishu today. The United States has also issued a very strong travel warning, urging American citizens not to travel to Somalia.
