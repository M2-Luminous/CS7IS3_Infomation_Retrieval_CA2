FR940303-1-00027 FR940303-1-00007 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [IL83&hyph;2&hyph;6284; FRL&hyph;4845&hyph;6] Federal Highway Funding Assistance Limitations and Emissions Offset Requirements; Illinois AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule; withdrawal; cancellation of the public hearings. SUMMARY: On January 24, 1994, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) published a proposed rule proposing to impose sanctions on Illinois under the discretionary authority granted USEPA under the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (amended Act) for failure by the State to meet its commitment to adopt and submit a basic and enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision as required by the amended Act for the Chicago and East St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas. The Illinois General Assembly passed the legislation required to support such a SIP revision and on January 18, 1994, Illinois Governor Edgar signed the legislation. Because of this favorable action, USEPA is withdrawing the January 24, 1994 proposed rule initiating the process to impose discretionary sanctions. The USEPA is also canceling the previously announced hearings scheduled for March 2, 1994, in Chicago and on March 4, 1994, in Collinsville. DATES: The public hearings scheduled for March 2, 1994 and March 4, 1994 are canceled. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Francisco J. Acevedo, Environmental Engineer, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (5AR&hyph;18J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 886&hyph;6061. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 24, 1994 (59 FR 3540), USEPA published a proposed rule proposing to impose sanctions on Illinois under the discretionary authority granted USEPA under section 110(m) of the amended Act for failure by the State to meet its commitment to adopt and submit a basic and enhanced motor vehicle I/M SIP revision as required by the amended Act for the Chicago and East St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas. The USEPA had notified Illinois by letter dated December 30, 1993, of its finding that Illinois had failed to submit the required SIP revision. The Illinois General Assembly subsequently passed the legislation required to support such a SIP revision and on January 18, 1994, Illinois Governor Edgar signed the legislation. Because of this favorable action, USEPA is withdrawing the January 24, 1994, proposed rule initiating the process to impose discretionary sanctions. The USEPA is also canceling the previously announced hearings scheduled for March 2, 1994, in Chicago and for March 4, 1994, in Collinsville. This withdrawal terminates the discretionary sanctions process initiated by the January 24, 1994, proposed rule. The mandatory sanctions process under Section 179 of the Act initiated by USEPA's December 30, 1993, finding that Illinois failed to submit the required SIP revision is not affected by this action. Under that process, USEPA must impose sanctions within 18 months of that December 30, 1993, finding of failure to submit unless Illinois adopts and formally submits a complete I/M SIP revision within 18 months of that failure to submit finding. Dated: February 22, 1994. William H. Sanders II, Acting Regional Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4981 Filed 3&hyph;1&hyph;94; 12:12 pm] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
