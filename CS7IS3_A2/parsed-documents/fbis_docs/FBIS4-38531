FBIS4-38531 "drsov105_g_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-105 Daily Report 31 May 1994 WESTERN REGION Belarus Authorities Seen Cracking Down on Critical Media Authorities Seen Cracking Down on Critical Media PM3105151594 Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 31 May 94 p 2 PM3105151594 Moscow IZVESTIYA Russian BFN [Aleksandr Starikevich report: "Belorussian Authorities Review Their Attitude to Press"] [Text] Minsk -- The scenario of the presidential elections scripted by the ideologues of the Belorussian [Belarusian] "party in power" ["Partiya vlasti"] is now being played out. The government has dealt the first blow against the mass media. The latest statement by Vladimir Zametalin, the Belorussian prime minster's press secretary, was wholly devoted to the biggest circulation opposition newspaper SVABODA [Freedom]. IZVESTIYA has managed to secure a xerox of Zametalin's original statement. "Formally opposed to the development of democratic processes in the republic, nationalistically minded political forces are attempting to raise their public profile through the methods of discrediting the policy of state organs, slandering state leaders, and whipping up hysteria in the period of the campaign to elect the first president of Belorussia [Belarus].... The greatest activity in the creation of conditions of civil confrontation is being displayed by a newspaper with a title clearly at odds with its basic tendency -- SVABODA. The newspaper...is continuing to act as the political cutting-edge of national extremism in the republic.... The constant search for unverified, so-called `compromising' materials against the most constructive, influential, and prestigious people has become the rule for the paper's creative conduct and thematic direction.... Taking into account numerous requests from citizens...the Government considers it its duty to revise relations with this publication in the interests of consolidating stability in the state...." The press secretary's statement conveys the atmosphere being created in the republic by the republic authorities on the eve of the elections sufficiently clearly. The powers that be [vlastnyye strktury] are seeking to neutralize anyone belonging to the opposition to the "most constructive and prestigious people" (read -- Prime Minsiter Vyacheslav Kebich) for the period of the election campaign. In the case of SVABODA, they have acted simply. The paper's chief editor Igor Germenchuk told IZVESTIYA's correspondent that the "Belorusskiy dom pechati" publishing house has refused to print, and the Ministry of Communications to circulate, the "awkward" newspaper. At the present time the editors are exploring the possibility of publishing the newspaper outside Belorusssia. To this it should be added that in the state radio two radio stations have been disbanded: "Belaruskaya maladzezhnaya" ["Belarusian Youth"] and "Krynitsa" ["Source"]. The propaganda apparatus set up by the Belorussian Government does not provide for such "oases of democracy." Journalists have only to wait to see who will be the next victim of the "revision of relations."
