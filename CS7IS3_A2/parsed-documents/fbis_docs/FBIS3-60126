He said that this agreement breaks the circle around the coca market. He added: "It will now be possible to take the products from the central markets to the different departments of greater consumption. This will help consumers because prices will fall." He also said that branch markets will be established to allow producers to take the coca there directly. He said: "This will not affect middlemen, it will only serve to open up free marketing in the different parts of the country." Tarqui indicated that during the meeting held on 6 January important progress was made in favor of coca growers, but that there are still several points pending on which the government must provide answers to the COB by 25 January, so that both sides can study them together on 3 February. He said: "The regulation for marketing coca was approved, although some additions based on agreements for the Chapare region of Cochabamba must still be made. The only thing left to be done now is to promulgate the law based on the agreements reached with the government minister (German Quiroga)." He added that another important point of progress was the government's full acceptance of the issuance of a supreme decree for marketing coca. Regarding the pending points, Tarqui said that the government asked that the revision of Law 1008 on controlled substances, which coca growers have demanded be made permanent, be left pending. Tarqui recalled that as a result of Law 1008 many peasants were subjected to abuse and attacks "because coca and cocaine are in the same bag." He said that the decree on the participation of peasants is also pending. Decree 22270 establishes the "equal" participation of peasants and officials of the National Committee for Alternative Development (Conadal), the Regional Committee for Alternative Development (Coredal), and the Local Alternative Development Committees (Colodal). Tarui added: "We are demanding that equal participation in this case be maintained. That is, five government representatives, five peasant representatives, and one official who in this case would be the government minister."
