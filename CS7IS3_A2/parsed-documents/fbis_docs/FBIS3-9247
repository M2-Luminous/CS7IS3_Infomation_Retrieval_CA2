He used to work as a teacher of mechanical engineering. At the constituent meeting of the Ilinden OMO [United Macedonian Organization], held on 14 March 1990 in the town of Sandanski, he was elected deputy chairman of the organization. Later, after the Ilinden OMO split, he was elected chairman of the extreme right wing. [Veleva] Mr. Kostadinov, what are the aims of the Ilinden OMO? [Kostadinov] During the four years since its formation, the Ilinden OMO has campaigned for the granting of national rights to the Macedonians. We are entitled to seek our rights, and not to be oppressed by those who want to ensure that the voice of a Macedonian declaring that he is a Macedonian is not heard. What we have been subjected to was a genocide and an assimilation. So far, over 150 of our people have been beaten by the authorities. Where is Bulgarian democracy going? Their propaganda describes us as riffraff, as crazy people, and yet we have winegrowers, tractor drivers, engineers, and teachers among our members. You media people incite the violence that the government and the authorities are practicing against us. What you are doing is covered by Bulgaria's Penal Code. The Ilinden OMO is a defender of national minorities, and whoever tries to prove that Macedonians are Bulgarians is waging propaganda for war in the Balkans! [Veleva] However, according to the Constitution, Bulgaria is a one-nation state, so on what basis do you claim that a Macedonian national minority exists? [Kostadinov] Look here, it is distinguished by its own culture, its own mentality, its own peculiarities, spirituality, and needs, in that it does not want to live oppressed by these Bulgarian policies and propaganda. This is what I mean. [Veleva] How do Bulgarian policies oppress you? [Kostadinov] Our population lives in a state of stress and neurotic fear. Old women still cover their heads with black scarves. What are we to say about this? How can I allow myself in my life to bear candles and flowers, and then you come along and beat me about the head. This is madness! [Veleva] Is your home village within the borders of Macedonia or Bulgaria? [Kostadinov] Within the borders of Macedonia. [Veleva] In which language are you speaking at the moment, Mr. Kostadinov? [Kostadinov] Language?... Look here now, we will not come to blows about the language. What language do the people of Radomir speak? I listened to some Ukrainians talking, and I understood them better than people from Radomir. We did not borrow the Macedonian language from our neighbors the Serbs or the Bulgarians, because we in fact gave our neighbors their written language. Macedonia was never occupied by the First or Second Bulgarian Kingdoms. Our language is the oldest in this region. [Veleva] Who created the Macedonian language? [Kostadinov] My God! You... I am sorry that I cannot speak to you as melodically as my grandmother and grandfather did. I at least have heard comments from old people who have been in Bulgaria and said that the people there did not understand their language. Are you trying to provoke me now? As long as this nation has existed, it has spoken its own language. Did you send textbooks to Preslav? Did you send us the alphabet? Did you open schools in the sixth, seventh, and eighth centuries? Why do you pick on these matters? [Veleva] Who is your favorite author? [Kostadinov] Krustyo Misirkov, who speaks in the Macedonian language. Read his book; if you do not have it, we will send you a copy so that you can find out what he writes. His book was published in Sofia and then forgotten. You see now, bans and harassment have existed for more than 70 years. Our politics have remained the same. [Veleva] How many members does your organization have? [Kostadinov] In Pirin Macedonia [part of Bulgaria] there are 400,000-500,000. As regards how many members we have, we cannot tell you, because we do not want to. However, 70-80 percent of the population of Pirin Macedonia support us, but will not say so under the risk of fear. We simply want to avoid bloodshed. [Veleva] In your view, does a Macedonian nation exist, and who created it? [Kostadinov] So far four uprisings have shed rivers of blood for the Macedonian nation and the Macedonian state. You should ask our ancestors whether they were a nation of puppets of various foreign propaganda. The Macedonian nation was born at the same time as the Bulgarian one -- at some time in the 12th or 13th centuries, or so I have read. You did not give us our letters, nor teachers, nor books and culture, and you borrowed your language from us. We now want to save this region from becoming a second Bosnia. [Veleva] What were the nationalities of Cyril and Methodius, Kliment Okhridski, Gotse Delchev, and Yane Sandanski? [Kostadinov] They were all Macedonians, no question of it. It is ridiculous to say that Gotse Delchev was a Bulgarian. Our grandfathers remember him. You must have read Peyo Yavorov's memoirs. You suggest Yane Sandanski was a Bulgarian? That is preposterous! What can we say about this? [Veleva] From where does your organization derive its funds? [Kostadinov] Let the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] and Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] say where they get their millions and their fine technical equipment from, let the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization [VMRO] say how it is financed, and then ask me this question again. We get our finance from companies. We are now entitled to ask the Bulgarian Government for money. [Veleva] Why does your program include the words "withdrawal of the Bulgarian occupation forces from Macedonia"? [Kostadinov] What do you mean, why? We know that in 1912 Macedonia was divided between three states. If Macedonia had been Bulgarian, then Bulgarian politicians would not have dealt with it the way they did; if it had been Greek, the Greeks would now be offering us a helping hand. The same goes for the Serbs. Macedonia represents spoils of war for Bulgaria, and the more territory we annex, the more of our country we will lose, and the sooner we will start a war to grab more territory. [Veleva] Why do you constantly talk about possible bloodshed? [Kostadinov] The propaganda is leading toward this. Relations are deteriorating. You should give up this propaganda and grant us our rights. [TRUD editorial note] (The interview is reproduced without editorial intervention.)
