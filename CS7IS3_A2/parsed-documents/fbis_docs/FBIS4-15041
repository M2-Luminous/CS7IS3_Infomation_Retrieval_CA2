The conference was devoted to the Partnership for Peace program and Russia's participation in it. This is part of what the deputy minister said: [Begin Churkin recording] For us, the issue is whether the Partnership for Peace program fits our own ideas and our own concept of pan-European partnership. I'd like to recap on the two possibly fundamental elements of our idea of pan-European partnership. First, development of Euro-Atlantic interaction through the transformation of the CSCE into an effective pan-regional political organization, and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council into a structure for military-political cooperation that is independent but closely linked to the CSCE. The aim is to coordinate the efforts of NATO, the European Union, Council of Europe, West European Union and CIS towards strengthening stability and security, peacekeeping and protection of national minorities' rights in Europe. Second, growth of cooperation under North Atlantic Cooperation Council auspices, enlisting the neutral states of Europe, including to put into effect the Partnership for Peace program, on the basis of equal rights and conversion of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council into an independent body with a small secretariat. The North Atlantic Cooperation Council could become a pan- European laboratory for peacekeeping, greater military openness, and conversion of military industries. I wish to point out that our concept is broader. In our view, and this is explained by our positive opinion of the idea behind Partnership for Peace, it fits fairly well into our own Russian concept of how pan-European partnership should develop and in which directions the process to strengthen European security should move. What isn't the Partnership for Peace program? It is not a new international treaty imposing new obligations on its members. When Russia joins the program, it will not be accepting any new legal obligations in respect of NATO, just as NATO will not be taking on any new obligations in respect of Russia. Therefore, the question sometimes asked of whether this will drag us into something we don't want can be very simply answered: since there are no obligations we cannot be pulled into anything against our will.
