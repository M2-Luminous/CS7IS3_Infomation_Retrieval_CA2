The so-called "secret constitutional amendment" was disclosed a few days ago by a Hong Kong newspaper. "Guided" by the British Hong Kong Government last July, the paper disclosed, the British Privy Council amended the "Letters Patent," the constitutional law of Hong Kong, without informing the members of Hong Kong's Legco. The original provision on the formation of Legco, that is, 3 ex-officio seats, 8 appointed seats, and 39 seats returned by elections was amended to 20 seats returned by direct elections, 30 returned by functional constituencies, and 10 returned by the election committee. This attempt by the British Hong Kong Government in the "constitutional amendment" is quite obvious, that is, offer constitutional grounds to Legco to adopt Patten's "constitutional reform" for the Legco elections in 1995. Otherwise, the legislation on "constitutional reform" adopted by Legco without relevent amendments made to the "Letters Patent" could be regarded as a "violation of the constitution." Fully confident that his "constitutional reform" will be adopted "intact," Mr. Patten made preparations in advance in the first half of last year and completed the "constitutional amendment" process in a bid to implement his package after its adoption by Legco. However, Patten neglected two points: First, he has said volubly that the 1994/1995 elections should be "fair and open" and that "everything will be ultimately determined by Legco." When China and Britain started negotiations on the 1994/1995 elections, he also threatened that even an agreement between the two sides must eventually be determined by Legco. How could the formation of Legco in 1995 be determined by an amendment to the "Letters Patent" before Legco has made a decision on the 1995 electoral package and before Legco has debated the said package? Legco's deliberations on the 1995 elections would then be meaningless. Patten knows quite well that the "Letters Patent" is not an ordinary document which can be willfully amended. Moreover, the above amendment has been adopted by the Privy Council and signed by the British Queen. This "constitutional amendment" move by the British Hong Kong Government is indeed mysterious. Why did they do it so stealthily and in secret? This is diametrically opposed to Mr Patten's "open" motto! No wonder Legco members feel they are being cheated. We can see more clearly that the governor's "democracy" is but a soap bubble which can be easily pricked. Second, Patten has all along refused to admit that the foreign ministers of the two countries had reached agreements and understanding on the number of directly elected seats for the 1995 elections in letters exchanged in early 1990. Later, although the British side reluctantly agreed to take the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and understanding reached between the two countries as the basis of the talks between the two sides, the British side never abandoned its "three violations" stance, which included its refusal to abide by the agreements and understandings reached between the two governments. This was precisely the reason which led to the termination of the talks. Nevertheless, 20 seats returned by direct elections, 30 returned by functional constituencies, and 10 returned by the election committee set out in the constitutional amendment to the "Letters Patent" and adopted by the British Privy Council are identical with those set out in the agreements and understandings reached between the Chinese and British foreign ministers in their letters exchanged in early 1990. We would like to ask: Since the British side does not admit that the two countries had reached agreements and understanding on the number of directly elected Legco seats in 1995, why has it amended the "Letters Patent" in this way? Thus, it is clearly obvious that the British side knew well whether or not the two governments had reached agreements and understanding on the 1995 elections and the question of convergence with the Basic Law. Mr. Patten's negligence of these two points has thrown him into a predicament. In the face of discontent and condemnation from within and outside Legco, he put on a show, saying that it was but "a storm in a teaspoon" in an attempt to turn a big problem into a small one and a small one to nothing. However, no matter how experienced Mr. Patten is in playing the tricks of a politician, his high-sounding words of "openness and fairness" and striving for "democracy" for Hong Kong people collapse by themselves. Moreover, his perfidy and violation of the agreements and understandings reached between the two governments will be exposed to the public. "Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet." This is a misfortune which no politician who think himself clever can evade.
