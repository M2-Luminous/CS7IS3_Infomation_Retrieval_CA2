FR940426-2-00014 FR940426-2-00005 United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews: Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee AGENCY: NAFTA Secretariat, United States Section, International Trade Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Review for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee to review issues raised by the May 6, 1993 and December 17, 1993, decisions of the binational panel that reviewed the final countervailing duty determination and the determination on remand made by the United States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration in the matter of Certain Softwood Lumber Products from Canada, Secretariat File No. USA&hyph;92&hyph;1904&hyph;01. This Request was filed with the United States Section of the NAFTA Secretariat on April 6, 1994. SUMMARY: On April 6, 1994, the Office of the United States Trade Representative filed a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee to review decisions dated May 6, 1993 and December 17, 1993. In May 6, 1993 decision, the Binational Panel remanded to the International Trade Administration on several grounds. In the December 17, 1993 decision, the three-person majority ordered Commerce to find certain programs non-specific and to find the stumpage subsidies non-market distorting. This finding effectively required Commerce to determine that neither program represents a countervailable subsidy. The NAFTA Secretariat has assigned file number ECC&hyph;94&hyph;1904&hyph;01USA to this Request. Copies of the Request and the Panel decision are available from the NAFTA Secretariat. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James R. Holbein, United States Secretary, NAFTA Secretariat, suite 6021, 14th and Constitution Avenue, Washington, DC 20230, (202) 482&hyph;5438. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Chapter 19 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace domestic judicial review of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports from the other country with review by independent binational panels. When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel is established to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether it conforms with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination. Under Article 1904.13 of the Agreement, where a Party alleges that a binational panel has seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, has manifestly exceeded its powers, authority or jurisdiction or that a member of the panel has materially violated the Code of Conduct established pursuant to Article 1910, and further alleges that any of these actions have materially affected the panel's decision and threaten the integrity of the panel review process, that Party may request that an Extraordinary Challenge Committee be established under the procedure set out in Annex 1904.13 of the Agreement. Under Annex 1904.13 of the Agreement, the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada established Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Extraordinary Challenge Committees (``ECC Rules''). These ECC Rules were published in the Federal Register on December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53222). These Rules were amended in the Federal Register on February 8, 1994 (59 FR 5910). The ECC Rules give effect to the provisions of Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement with respect to Extraordinary Challenge Committee proceedings conducted pursuant to Article 1904 of the Agreement. The ECC Rules are intended to result in decisions typically within 30 days after the establishment of the Extraordinary Challenge Committee. The Extraordinary Challenge Committee proceeding in this matter will be conducted in accordance with these ECC Rules.
