To keep pace with the growing integration of electronic components (larger packages with increasingly numerous connections at an increasingly fine pitch), SRPI, a subcontracting company based at Redon [northeast France], has recently invested "several millions of French francs [Fr]" in a surface mounting line for fine-pitch SMC's. The main element in this line is the Fuji FIPIII machine, which is capable of assembling everything from chips using the 1005-format (1 x 0.5 mm) to QFP's [quad flat packs] at 0.3-mm pitches with 0.025-mm precision and TAB [tape automated bonded] and SMC connectors. SRPI is the first company in Europe to acquire this machine, and the second in the world (after an American GSM [Global System for Mobile Communications] terminal manufacturer). With this investment, the French subcontractor is betting on the future. Few companies outsourcing work are currently looking for subcontractors capable of assembling SMC's at 0.3-mm pitch (SRPI has some requests for component assembly at 0.4 mm and 0.5 mm), but the natural trend toward increased miniaturization and complexity of electronic products means that this ability is a strategic advantage. SRPI should generate revenues of over Fr120 million this year (including its non-electronics activities) and is predicting growth in the region of 15 percent in 1994. Between November 1992 and February 1994, the company will have invested some Fr10 million in its industrial production facilities.
