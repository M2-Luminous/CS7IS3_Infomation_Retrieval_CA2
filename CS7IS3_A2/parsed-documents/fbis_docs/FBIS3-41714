And anyway, where was he from, this homeless man of Moscow by the name of Shabunov, an older man, 40 years of age according to his passport? When no pulse could be determined, pressure dropped and convulsions increases, he was immediately subjected to resuscitation. Cholera means--forgive me for the coarse but necessary details--endless diarrhea, which dehydrates the body so much that end come in just a few hours. It looks like the doctors were able to bring Shabunov back. But in Kaspiysk (Dagestan), they weren't able to save the patient. And in the republic hospital in Makhachkala, they are not caring for a 4-month infant with the same diagnosis. Just in July and August of this year 17 patients and vibrio carriers were registered; these cases are associated with cholera imported from India, Pakistan and Turkey. We'll talk about imports a little later. In the meantime persons returning from shopping tours with their ``acquisition'' have homes in very many places--Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnodar, Makhachkala, Naberezhnyye Chelny. And besides cholera, typhoid fever, which we haven't seen in our country for a long time, has made its appearance. Eighty-seven persons were hospitalized for it in Volgodonsk, Rostov Oblast. Specialists from the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight limited their information to the indicated cases. But the geography of the infection and the list of patients are more extensive. We possess data indicating that local medical workers in Astrakhan and Barnaul discovered anthrax agents in food products. Some people have already contracted the disease. The situation with this infection recalls especially clearly the ``Solovyev effect'' with which we began our discussion--a doctor's behavior in extreme circumstances. A peasant family in the Astrakhan town of Dianovka was forced to slaughter a sick calf. The local veterinarian could be diagnosed with a lack of knowledge or conscience, but he deemed the meet to be fit for consumption. A few days later those who slaughtered the animal and sold its meat heard of their unconditional diagnosis--anthrax. A quarantine was announced in Dianovka. And in another town as well--Tundrikha, Altay Kray. Here also they slaughtered a sick animal and sold the meat uninspected. Efforts are being made to save the sick. Cattle, sheep and horses are undergoing mass vaccination. The financially strapped sanitary-epidemiological oversight agency contained the epidemic of the terrible disease. But in this case millions of rubles were spent on medicines, vaccinations of animals, and disinfection. The term ``negligence'' is often applied to trading in uninspected infected meat. But does that tell the whole story? Do we say anything about the social causes that encourage some to sell and others to buy meat that is now as precious as gold? It's probably a little cheaper when it doesn't bear a seal of inspection. Why not risk your health if you didn't have to buy it, and you got it free? When misfortune comes to our door, contrary to popular wisdom we lock it, and rather tightly. But aren't we acting a little too late? After all many things can and must be foreseen. The same goes for imported infections. Given the present openness of borders, and the scale of goods traffic, we should have adopted the corresponding law protecting Russian Federation territory from importation of diseases by people, animals and plants long ago (most other countries have such laws). But in our country this law just now being written in response to a government decree, which was itself adopted in May, just before lightning struck. Nor is it any news that migration and refugees represent a potential source of all kinds of diseases. And of course, we are well aware of the general ecological situation, particularly when it comes to water, about which even our recently initiated ``Retsept'' subsection has written on several occasions. We've already cited a figure: Half (!) of Russia's inhabitants drink water that does not meet hygienic requirement, water that is simply unfit to drink. And this after all is the primary source of intestinal infection, cholera in particular. As it became known, the person that died in Kaspiysk fell ill because he drank untreated water. Accidents with water supply lines have grown more frequent, and water treatment has worsened due to the absence of reagents and disinfectants. The epidemiological service is still managing to somehow keep the situation under control through constant laboratory monitoring and continual inspections. But it no longer as the money for reagents, or to pay for electric power. All of these are the misfortunes of civilized cities. But throughout Russia there are thousands of towns without water purification facilities or sewage systems. In the meantime cholera vibrio was detected in open-air water basins last year, and is being detected currently as well. Such that the biblically simple and so ancient a truth has real meaning to the Russian Federation today: Never drink untreated water! And wash fruits, vegetables and your hands thoroughly. The drowning must save themselves, as the saying goes. The danger of infection is becoming especially acute under the conditions of our uncontrolled trade. In our impassable mud. We've written about this in ``Retsept'' in the past. Let me add that sometimes it seems that sanitary oversight doesn't see what we see. But at our request they gave the figures for fines imposed for dirt and other violations: Last year--39,000 rubles, and in one quarter of this year, R128,000. And this is throughout all of Russia, even with the current rate of inflation. Sanitary oversight is of course trying, but violators are hardly frightened by its only weapon--fines. I am certain that the situation requires new forces, other approaches. It's strange that in our democratic times we have lost the truly democratic institutions that operated and did good things in times past. Public citizen's movements occur in many countries. Were our active common citizens to come together under public health physicians locally, they could clean up our streets and stores under their leadership. And with the support of a local peace officer (at least one, for insurance!). It would be a sin for the public health physician to earn bruises for defending our health. But things like this have happened. And one other thing. We have justly condemned the method of struggle that had been so fashionable in years past: A call to heroism is usually made when there is no order or system. Still, the actions of doctors today are in fact heroic, they are restraining the epidemiological situation at the same time that in Moscow there are only just a few kilograms of special soda for intravenous infusions, and when there are not enough salt solutions and other--let me emphasize that!--of the simplest, most elementary resources. You can't reduce the number of persons without permanent residence (it's increasing) or eliminate migration of refugees overnight. But all of these people simply have to undergo disinfection procedures. The older generation can remember the medical checkpoints that were present in all Moscow terminals. But today transport workers sadly admit that they can't, there's no money. A couple were recently added to the only other one in the city. Not much. And anyway, how are you going to force all of the homeless to undergo personal cleansing? Cholera and mushrooms don't seem to be related. But mushrooms are another misfortune hanging over our heads. Once again, like last summer, people are dying from mushroom poisoning. In Tambov Oblast there were 46 victims and 8 fatalities. In Voronezh Oblast there were 52 poisonings and 1 fatality. In Lipetsk--23 victims, 4 fatalities. A dubious theory about radionuclides, pesticides and heavy metals trapped by mushrooms, obviously having its origins in the widely read writing of Veronika Mavrikiyevna, is still circulating among the people since last year. All last winter scientists conducted research on the subject, but science has been unable to confirm Mavrikiyevna's theory. Everything is simpler and more frightening: People died and are now dying from toxin produced by the death cup. And there's more. A selective inspection revealed those same death cups in the one out of every 8-10 baskets brought home this summer mushroom gatherers. Specialists are sounding the alarm. A guide for mushroom gatherers drawn up by the Scientific Research Institute of Nutrition of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences is published below at their request. And in conclusion I would like to address readers who may be shocked by the expression ``infection [zaraza]'' I have been using. We have forgotten this ancient, age-old term, and substituted it by the foppish euphemism ``infection [infektsiya].'' However, I think that the harsher word ``zaraza'' fits the alarming situation in Russia better today. [passage omitted: Safety precautions for mushroom gatherers]
