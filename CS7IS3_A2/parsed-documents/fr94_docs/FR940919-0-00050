FR940919-0-00050 FR940919-0-00015 Therefore, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, 40 CFR part 268 is corrected by making the following correcting amendments: PART 268_LAND DISPOSAL RESTRICTIONS 1. The authority citation for part 268 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 6905, 6912(a), 6921, and 6924. 2. Section 268.7(a) is revised to read as follows: §268.7 Waste analysis and recordkeeping. (a) Except as specified in §268.32, if a generator's waste is listed in 40 CFR part 261, subpart D, the generator must test his waste, or test an extract using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, Method 1311 in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication SW&hyph;846, as incorporated by reference in §260.11 of this chapter, or use knowledge of the waste, to determine if the waste is restricted from land disposal under this part. Except as specified in §268.32 of this part, if a generator's waste exhibits one or more of the characteristics set out at 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, the generator must test an extract using the Extraction Procedure Toxicity Test, Method 1310 in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication SW&hyph;846, as incorporated by reference in §260.11 of this chapter, or use knowledge of the waste, to determine if the waste is restricted from land disposal under this Part. If the generator determines that his waste displays the characteristic of ignitability (D001) (and is not in the High TOC Ignitable Liquids Subcategory or is not treated by INCIN, FSUBS, or RORGS of §268.42, Table 1), or the characteristic of corrosivity (D002), and is prohibited under §268.37 of this Part, the generator must determine what underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in §268.2), are reasonably expected to be present in the D001 or D002 waste. (1) If a generator determines that he is managing a restricted waste under this part and the waste does not meet the applicable treatment standards set forth in Subpart D of this part or exceeds the applicable prohibition levels set forth in §268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d), with each shipment of waste the generator must notify the treatment or storage facility in writing of the appropriate treatment standards set forth in Subpart D of this part and any applicable prohibition levels set forth in §268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d). The notice must include the following information: (i) EPA Hazardous Waste Number; (ii) The corresponding treatment standards for wastes F001&hyph;F005, F039, wastes prohibited pursuant to §268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d), and for underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in §268.2), in D001 and D002 wastes if those wastes are prohibited under §268.37. Treatment standards for all other restricted wastes must either be included, or be referenced by including on the notification the applicable wastewater (as defined in §268.2(f)) or nonwastewater (as defined in §268.2(d)) category, the applicable subdivisions made within a waste code based on waste-specific criteria (such as D003 reactive cyanides), and the CFR section(s) and paragraph(s) where the applicable treatment standard appears. Where the applicable treatment standards are expressed as specified technologies in §268.42, the applicable five-letter treatment code found in Table 1 of §268.42 (e.g., INCIN, WETOX) also must be listed on the notification; (iii) The manifest number associated with the shipment of waste; (iv) For hazardous debris, the contaminants subject to treatment as provided by §268.45(b) and the following statement: ``This hazardous debris is subject to the alternative treatment standards of 40 CFR 268.45''; and (v) Waste analysis data, where available. (2) If a generator determines that he is managing a restricted waste under this Part, and determines that the waste can be land disposed without further treatment, with each shipment of waste he must submit, to the treatment, storage, or land disposal facility, a notice and a certification stating that the waste meets the applicable treatment standards set forth in subpart D of this part and the applicable prohibition levels set forth in §268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d). Generators of hazardous debris that is excluded from the definition of hazardous waste under §261.3(e)(2) of this chapter (i.e., debris that the Director has determined does not contain hazardous waste), however, are not subject to these notification and certification requirements. (i) The notice must include the following information:
