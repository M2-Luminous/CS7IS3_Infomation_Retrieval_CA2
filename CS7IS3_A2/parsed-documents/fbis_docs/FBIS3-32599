"I do not believe the country's positive image abroad has been harmed. Undoubtedly the Codelco affair is significant and serious, but it is hardly fair to see it as some sort of collapse. It would be a gross exaggeration to do so. As I see it, Codelco is not broke and the country is operating normally." Krauss categorically stated that no human rights have been violated in Chile, contrary to what a U.S. Department of State report has claimed. "Human rights are most definitely respected in Chile. I do not believe that any Chilean or foreigner who truly knows how things are here could say that human rights are violated in Chile. Any resident of this country who may feel that his or somebody else's human rights have been violated is free to go to court." Krauss explained that in any democratic state violations must be reported to the courts, not to the government.
