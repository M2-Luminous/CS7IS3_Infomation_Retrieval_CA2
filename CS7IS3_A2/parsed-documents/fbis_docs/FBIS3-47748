Kerry, member of the External Relations Committee of the Senate of the United States [title as received], who is here for a visit to Vietnam. Also present at the reception was Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai. During the reception, Senator Kerry highly appreciated the results of meetings between U.S. delegations and Vietnamese senior officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and some offices concerned. He said these meetings were of important significance aimed at contributing to strengthening the mutual understanding and promoting the normalization of the Vietnam-U.S. relations. He noted that on the MIA issue the two countries had engaged in a process of complete cooperation, and that cooperation had brought about good results. The Vietnamese Government and people, he also noted, have tried their best to cooperate with the U.S. in the search of American servicemen missing in action in the Vietnam war as well as in the supply of information on the MIA issue. For his part, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet appreciated the positive support of Senator Kerry and many other Americans of good-will for the normalization of the Vietnam-U.S. relations for the sake of peace, stability and development in Southeast Asia, as well as their cooperation in the MIA issue, which, he said, will contribute to the promotion of their bilateral relations. The Vietnamese leader reaffirmed that Vietnam's consistent policy on the MIA issue was to do its best for the humnitarian purpose. He held that should the MIA issue be settled well, it would create mutual understanding and trust for the settlement of other issues relating to the interests of the two countries. P.M. Vo Van Kiet asked Mr. Kerry to convey to the U.S. President Vietnam's viewpoint that it was time for the two countries to have a new decision on bilateral relations, and the earlier the Vietnam-U.S. relations are normalized the more favourable conditions would be created for the development of the cooperative relations in various fields in conformity with the interests of the two countries. The Vietnamese prime minister also asked the U.S. senator to convey his new year greetings to the U.S. people. Yesterday, Chairman of the National Assembly Nong Duc Manh also received Senator Kerry. Mr Kerry expresed his pleasure over the meeting with the NA chairman and considered that event very important, ushering in opportunities for cooperation between the Vietnamese National Assembly and the U.S. Congress. He thanked Chairman Nong Duc Manh and the Vietnamese authorities for their hospitality for him and his party, and said that his Vietnam visits had left him fine impressions on the land and people of Vietnam. Speaking to his guests, Chairman Nong Duc Manh expressed his hope that the results of the visit would contribute to strengthening the mutual understanding between the two legislatures and the people of Vietnam and the U.S. Prompted by the humanitarian spirit and profound sympathies towards families of Americans missing in action in the Vietnam war, the Vietnamese National Assembly and people would in their capacity continue their cooperation with the U.S. side in the settlement of the MIA issue. The U.S. guests had working sessions with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and representatives of the Vietnam MIA office. To continue his Vietnam visit Senator Kerry left here this afternoon for Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang City.
