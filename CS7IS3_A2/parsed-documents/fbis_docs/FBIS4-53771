Since the council had decided to hold hearings in local cities in early June to explain the several choices in tax system reform, the MOF, which serves as the council's executive office [jimukyoku], mapped out the draft to be used as a base of discussion. It is expected that opposition parties and other organizations will oppose the proposal because a 7-percent tax increase is incorporated, as did the national welfare tax proposed by former Prime Minister Hosokawa. It seems that lively debate will also be held in the council regarding efforts to trim expenditures, on the assumption of increasing taxes later through administrative reform and as to how much a tax increase will improve the government's welfare services. According to parties concerned, the proposal will call mainly for an increase in the consumption tax to either 1) 7 percent in two years; 2) 7 percent in three years; or 3) 8 percent in two years. These choices will be offered on the assumption that the government will continue to have a 5.5 trillion yen tax reduction even after this fiscal year by uniformly reducing income and resident taxes by 20 percent. Either way, the proposal is designed for an actual tax increase that exceeds the scale of tax reduction. Of the choices, it seems that the one to increase the consumption tax to "7 percent in three years," which was a tax increase rate of the national welfare tax concept, will serve as a base of discussion at the council. However, the MOF--in addition to proposing the idea of increasing the consumption tax to 8 percent as a case for significantly increasing a source of revenue on the assumption that expenditures are related to welfare services -- is studying the possibility of submitting a proposal designed to increase the consumption tax rate to some 10 percent as an example of further increasing financial resources. It seems that among other things, the ministry will explain, for each choice, how much revenue will be generated, how to secure a source of revenue to make up for a shortfall that will be created as a result of the planned tax reduction, and what the future financial situation will be like. Under the national welfare tax concept, which was proposed out of the blue, only about 800 billion yen, even if inflation is taken into consideration, would have been allocated for welfare expenditures although it would have made some 3.5 trillion yen in tax revenues after tax reduction. Because of this, some people criticized the concept, saying it is an idea far from improving the welfare system. Regarding the fact that the MOF worked out these choices, a senior MOF official said: "A consumption tax rate of less than 7 percent is not enough to secure financial resources to cover a shortfall from the tax reduction." However, it is expected that opposition parties and other organizations, which oppose increasing taxes above the 7-percent rate of the national welfare tax, will demand the government keep down the tax rate. It seems that the proposal to set the tax rate at 7 percent will become an actual base of discussion. After explaining the proposal, the Tax System Research Council plans to listen to people's opinions at the local sessions, slated to be held on 7 and 10 June. The TSRC plans to reflect opinions of the people in its recommendation, which will be prepared by the end of June.
