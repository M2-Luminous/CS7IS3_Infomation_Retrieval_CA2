In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT al-Dali stressed that Sanaa has -- thus far -- not complied with the cease-fire resolution. Despite its promises to UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi and its talk about accepting the formation of a cease-fire committee, yesterday morning it shelled residential areas of Aden to terrorize the inhabitants. He said that Sanaa is fully aware that it -- and it is the one escalating the fighting, thus inviting the the Security Council to impose the toughest of sanctions -- is not entitled to accuse the Arab states or Aden of exposing the region to the threats of a large-scale war, as Aden has until this moment been calling for peace and for halting the fighting. On the results of his visit to the United States, he stressed Washington's and the United Nations' interest in a stable situation in Yemen, in the implementation of Resolution 924, and in giving the parties the opportunity to comply with it.
