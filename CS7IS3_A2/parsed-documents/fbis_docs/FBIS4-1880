Entitled "Transcend MFN [Most Favored Nation] Status -- Trade With China and U.S. Interest," the book is co-edited by James Roderick Lilley, former U.S. assistant secretary of defense and former U.S. ambassador to China, and Wendell L. Willkie II, former acting deputy secretary of commerce. Its chief authors include Dave Lampton, president of the All-American Committee for U.S.-Chinese Relations. The book reviews the complicated economic, strategic, and human rights issues facing U.S. decision-makers today. In addition to their speeches today, the editors and authors stressed in the book that the United States should see further in handling U.S.-Chinese relations. The resolution of human rights and trade issues should be separated. They indicated that almost all countries in the world, regardless of their human rights conditions, enjoy MFN status granted by the United States. If the the United States were to apply MFN status as a weapon with which to threaten China, this would run counter to U.S. interests. It Does Not Pay for the United States To Upset China Democrat Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote a preface to the book in which he discusses the importance of U.S.-Chinese relations from four angles. In the preface, Hamilton indicates that political stability in China is in line with U.S. interests, whereas upsetting the Chinese Government or dividing China is not in U.S. interests. A Chinese Government that has rallying force, is highly efficient, and is concerned with the well-being of its people is in line with U.S. interests because in this case the international community does not have to provide the 1.2 billion Chinese people with clothing, food, housing, transportation, employment, and medical services and care. Economically, China's economic development has improved the people's material life, and at the same time has promoted gradual political democratization. All these changes are in line with U.S. interests. The United States should offer a helping hand to China in its economic modernization and reform; in turn, the United States will benefit. The Memorandum of Understanding on Market Access signed between the United States and China, the Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights Protection, and the consideration in accepting China's application to restore its GATT membership, are all useful apparatuses to guarantee mutual benefit and interest in U.S.-Chinese economic relations. From the angle of security, a militarily powerful China that does not pose a threat to regional peace is in line with U.S. interests. The best way to prevent a tense situation in the region and to control the arms race is to unfold multilateral regional security talks aimed at increasing transparency, establishing mutual trust, and encouraging military restraint. In addition, the United States needs to adopt a cooperative attitude with China in controling the proliferation of biochemical and guided-missile weapons and in limiting nuclear tests. From a diplomatic angle, a China that continues to work hard with the United States and other countries to resolve complicated world issues in the wake of the Cold War is in line with U.S. interests. China is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. That China should make positive contributions to the resolution of international problems is far better than otherwise, and better still than creating additional trouble for the international community. To promote global peace and stability, to prevent the further worsening of nature's ecological environment, and to crack down on drug production and trafficking, the United States should win China's support as best it can. The Old, Amended Act Is Out of Date In the preface, Hamilton also indicates: From a long-range view, U.S. decision-makers should not cancel China's MFN status. The Jackson-Vanek amendment, which sets out guidance on granting MFN status, and the practice of extending MFN status conditionally, were policies and measures formulated in different times which aimed to achieve different policy goals. Time has passed and circumstances have changed. What U.S. political leaders should consider today is transcending China's MFN status and formulating a sound policy capable of protecting and promoting U.S. national interests. In the book, Lampton, president of the All-American Committee for U.S.-Chinese Relations, reviews the importance of U.S.-Chinese relations, and indicates the reasons for the difficult situation the U.S. Government faces on the issue of human rights. He said: The United States must acknowledge the tremendous social and political changes underway in China. If the United States hopes to promote its value concepts effectively, it should add fuel to China's engine, not try to shut off the fuel pump. However, should the United States regard China's MFN status as some kind of hostage, it will never control the direction of development in the situation. This being the case, the United States should formulate a realistic, sustained, and constructive policy toward China. Directing his remarks at some people in the U.S. Government and Congress who say there is need to selectively sanction China's state-owned enterprises, Lampton indicates that the practice of sanctioning or selectively sanctioning China's state- owned enterprises would be wrong and would not work because the U.S. Customs would find it very difficult to tell which products are those of state-owned enterprises and which are not. Furthermore, the raw materials and semifinished goods of many of China's state- owned enterprises are supplied by enterprises in the private sector of the economy or by foreign-funded enterprises. If the United States were to partially cancel China's MFN status, this would lead inevitably to the Chinese side's taking retaliatory action in trade. Then where would the United States find new markets for its wheat, aircraft, electronics, telecommunications, and power-generating equipment?! It Is Wise To Talk Less About Human Rights From Now On In the book, James Roderick Lilley, former assistant secretary of defense and currently director of Chinese Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, indicates that the United States has been deeply involved in Asian affairs for a long time, thus guaranteeing peace and security in Asia. The greater the pressure the Clinton administration places on China concerning the human rights issue, the tougher will be the Chinese stance and the smaller the concessions it will make. Should China's MFN status be cancelled, the United States will pay a very high price in international issues, and the foundation for peaceful cooperation and competition between the United States and China will be jeopardized. Ambassador Lilley indicates that in the Asian Conference on Human Rights held in Bangkok in March 1993, 38 out of 39 countries were for the human rights position of China and Indonesia. If the United Sates were to cancel China's MFN status, this move would compel the Asian countries to lean toward China and to keep their distance from the United States; consequently, U.S. influence in Asia would be reduced and the fruits of U.S. diplomatic efforts over the years would go down the drain. Should such a scenario surface, it would be tragic. This being the case, if the Clinton administration does not want to cancel China's MFN status, it should stop its all-too- frequent verbal condemnation of China. Furthermore, it should not overemphasize the human rights issue from now on.
