In this connection, however, the ministry denied a report by DIE WELT, claiming that this loss in payments would have already its full effect on the federal budget in 1994 and would require an addendum to the budget. Rather, it is true that Iran currently has problems with repaying short-term Hermes-covered trade loans on time. Meanwhile, DM420 million of that have been recognized as losses and compensation has been paid to the German creditors. The total amount of DM4 billion will be "refinanced" from short to medium-term loans by a German banking consortium -- as this has been done in the past -- so that one cannot speak of a specific risk to the budget for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, it is a fact that Iran has serviced its medium and long-term loans punctually so far and is, therefore, not to be considered a bad debtor, it was noted. In the view of experts, Iran's short-term payment problems are primarily due to oscillating oil prices, as well as the country's temporary great need for imports. [passage omitted]
