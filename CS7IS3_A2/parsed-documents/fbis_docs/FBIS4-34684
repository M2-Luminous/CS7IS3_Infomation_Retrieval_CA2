We are also normalizing activities related to the supply of agriculture products. In all the cantons, with the exception of Figaro and Cevallos, the situation has normalized. The reports from Figaro indicate that it is no longer a peasant protest but that political agitators have taken over. We have been told that the Figaro and Cevallos municipal council presidents are the ones inciting against the government. The agriculture sectors are not protesting.
