SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the Michigan Department of Transportation, (MDOT), is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for alternative alignments for a bypass of US&hyph;31 from I&hyph;196 north of Holland in Allegan County to I&hyph;96 north of Grand Haven in Ottawa County. The proposed project is approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) in length and is needed to alleviate the traffic congestion across the Grand River crossing in Grand Haven and to address operational deficiencies on US&hyph;31 in Ottawa County as a result of increased population and commercial development. It is also intended to improve service in this developing area in northern Allegan and Southern Ottawa Counties. Alternatives under consideration include: (1) Taking no action to improve this section of US&hyph;31 other than routine maintenance; (2) mass transit; (3) reconstruction of existing US&hyph;31 within the existing right-of-way; (4) controlled access boulevard on existing US&hyph;31. within the existing right-of-way; (4) controlled access boulevard on existing US&hyph;31 alignment; (5) construction of a second bridge for local access across the Grand River in Grand Haven; and (6) bypass alternative east of existing US&hyph;31. Scoping of this project began in 1990 and included: meetings with local jurisdictions and representatives from the Townships, cities, counties and the US&hyph;31 Advisory Committee. Letters and a scoping document describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate federal, State, and local agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interests in this proposal. Although no agency scoping meeting is planned at this time, a pre-study meeting will be held in the near future to provide the public an opportunity to discuss the proposed action. A public hearing will also be held. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the hearing. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is scheduled for completion in September, 1996, and will be made available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearing. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources are requested to be cooperating agencies on this project. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments, and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.
