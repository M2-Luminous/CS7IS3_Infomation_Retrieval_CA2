Maj. Gen. Abubakar, who was represented by the director of administration at the Defence Headquarters (DHQ), Maj. Gen. Adamu Dyeri at this year's enlightenment campaign for soldiers, noted that AIDS was a threat to the security of any nation. He noted that about 80 percent of AIDS cases spread through sexual intercourse and urged organisers of the campaign to intensify efforts at educating soldiers. The director- general of the Ministry of Defence, retired Maj. Gen. Olu Bajowa who was the chairman on the occasion, said that most AIDS cases fell within the age range of 20 to 49 years while most service personnel fell within that age bracket. He noted that the "high morbidity and itinerant nature of military duties" increased the potential risk of contracting the deadly disease by service personnel. Maj. Gen. Bajowa urged the Armed Forces to "establish well-defined programme and policies for controlling the spread of HIV infection in the military and for caring for those who will be affected." Highlights of the event included video shows on AIDS and distribution of condoms to all the officers and soldiers. The Armed Forces AIDS campaign was launched in 1991.
