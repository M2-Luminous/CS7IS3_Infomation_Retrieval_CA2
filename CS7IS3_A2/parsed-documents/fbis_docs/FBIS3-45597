As the sons and daughters of the Chang Jiang-Hai He areas marched into the new year with high morale, Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and vice premier, came to Anhui to inspect and investigate how the province was preparing for certain major reforms the state is soon to launch. Over a period of several days, Vice Premier Zhu and his entourage, in the company of Anhui Provincial Party Committee Secretary Lu Rongjing and Governor Fu Xishou, braved chilly winds and snow to visit some grass-roots units and rural households and discuss reform and development with the cadres and masses. Conduct on-the-spot checks of grain prices. As the saying goes, "food is of paramount importance to the people." People in urban and rural areas are ill at ease with the recent increases in grain prices. Vice Premier Zhu's concern for the masses could be observed from the fact that, as soon as he arrived in Anhui, the first question he asked was: "What is the price of grain in Anhui?" When told that the provincial party committee and government had taken timely measures to stabilize grain prices, he praised Anhui for having set a good example for the whole country. To check that measures for holding down grain prices had really been implemented, he sampled two grain stores in Hefei. When he visited the Wangdacheng village grain station in suburban Hefei, the station manager told Vice Premier Zhu that his station still could make a small profit because he bought hybrid rice at 0.64 yuan a jin and sold it at 0.68 yuan. The vice premier asked with concern: "Do you need state subsidies then?" The manager replied firmly: "Not a penny from the state." Vice Premier Zhu nodded with approval, and said: "I think that when a business is properly run, and when it is willing to concede some profit, grain prices will not rise dramatically and the people will be satisfied." It was getting dark and the provincial leaders asked Vice Premier Zhu to return to his residence to rest. But Vice Premier Zhu insisted on visiting another grain store. So he and some aides came to a grain store on Jinzai Road and chatted with the workers who were about to go home. "How much does your grain cost?" "For nonglutinous, long-grain rice it is 0.78 yuan per jin; and for hybrid rice, 0.75 yuan per jin." "What was the price before June?" "It was 0.56 yuan per jin." "Why has the increase been so steep?" "I can't help it, the prices I had to pay were high." "It seems that when there are too many middlemen, the high service charge they collect jacks up grain prices." Vice Premier Zhu continued: "The current increase in grain prices is abnormal. It was jacked up by middlemen. Our food departments must play a major role at this time and take the initiative in regulating the market." A municipal leader immediately instructed the leader of the food bureau: "Provincial and municipal authorities have made a ruling. You should put up a notice tomorrow stating that the price of each jin of grain is 0.70 yuan, not 0.75 yuan." "You can rest assured, Vice Premier Zhu, that we will hold down the prices." All the onlookers applauded. Conduct on-the-spot checks on tax officers. Taxes are the country's financial pillars. To understand the preparations being made for the implementation of the new taxation system, Vice Premier Zhu made a surprise visit to a taxation office under the city taxation sub bureau while visiting Anqing. Tax officers did not expect Vice Premier Zhu's visit. They were surprised but pleased, and gathered around him. In a round of applause, Vice Premier Zhu greeted everybody and asked: "The new taxation system will start on 1 January. Do you all understand the system?" The officers answered together: "We basically understand it because training classes have been held." "Then let me just test you. The first question is: Will the consumption tax cause price rises?" The officers immediately replied: "No, no. This question was discussed on yesterday's television program." Governor Fu Xishou, who accompanied the vice premier's visit, smiled and said: "No wonder you are all confident of your answer." "Let me ask you another question. The past practice of collecting product tax, business tax, and value-added tax is being changed. Now a single value-added tax will be collected. Do you understood this?" A young graduate from the Shanghai Jiaotong University said confidently: "Yes." "Those of you who are university graduates please raise your hands." Many hands were raised immediately. Vice Premier Zhu was pleased and said: "You are young and possess high educational qualifications. It seems you have studied the new taxation system rather well. I feel relieved about that knowing the new taxation law goes into effect on 1 January." Vice Premier Zhu asked a woman chief at the city taxation bureau: "The new taxation system will be implemented soon. Have preparations been completed?" "Basically there is no problem. We have just received 7,000 receipt books, which will be distributed soon to the officers in charge of the task." "Can you distinguish counterfeit receipts from genuine receipts?" An officer immediately replied: "The new receipt is water-marked and can be distinguished from a fake one the moment it is placed under a fluorescent lamp." "Is there any difficulty when separate organizations and personnel are introduced for separate state and local taxation tasks next year?" "We will abide by organization and distribution." "It is rational to separate backbone services." "Subordinates should obey their superiors." Vice Premier Zhu nodded satisfactorily. Before leaving, he joked: "My salary next year will all depend on you all then." A round of applause immediately broke out in the room. Seeking proposals personally. Investigation and study is one way to formulate plans. During his stay in Anhui, Vice Premier Zhu held discussion meetings wherever he went to hear the ideas and suggestions of grass-roots cadres and masses on reform measures. On the afternoon of 20 December, the usual silence of the Langxie Study on the Langxie Hill was broken and the atmosphere in the meeting room became lively. Vice Premier Zhu made a special trip to attend a discussion meeting in Chuzhou city, the "granary" of eastern Anhui. He sought plans and ideas from city and county cadres on the issues of grain purchases and sales as well as reform of the taxation system. Provincial party secretary Lu Rongjing, who presided over the meeting, said: "Vice Premier Zhu's main purpose in undertaking day and night schedules during his current visit to Anhui is to hear directly your opinions on the grain issue. Please feel free to voice your opinions." As soon as the provincial party secretary stopped speaking, city and county leaders vied to voice their opinions. They spoke on Chuzhou city's grain production, achievements, and difficulties, and forwarded their proposals. When Vice Premier Zhu heard the city had purchased all its wheat and 91 percent of its grain for this year, he smiled and said: "The crux of whether grain prices can be held down lies in whether state-run food departments have controlled grain supplies. We can only control and stabilize the market once we have controlled 80 percent of grain supplies. How can state-run food departments control grain supplies? Closing the market does not seem to be a good way. I think purchasing should be done mainly by state grain enterprises. Individual proprietors may also purchase, but the purchase price must be within a range determined by the state. The government will intervene and adopt measures to check that prices exceed state standards. We must not allow grain prices to rise. Of course, state purchase prices must be reasonable, and the state should not purchase grain once it controls the majority of supplies. What do you think of this method? Will it work?" "Yes, yes." When the manager of the city's grain, oil, and food company reported that the company had been formed out of the city food bureau, Vice Premier Zhu asked for details of the company's operations. He said: "There is no choice but to reform the grain system. Is it possible to divide food departments into two parts, with one part involved in purchasing, processing, and wholeselling, while the other part does sales? Otherwise, grain will not be procured and sales will not be properly managed. The burdens for food departments will then be increasingly heavier. Yesterday, I saw two grain shops in Hefei city. The city has allowed the village to run one of them, the operation of which has been separated from state-owned food departments. It has thrived very well without any losses. The prices of grain have also been held very low. The other state-run grain shop is doing its own purchases in counties and selling its hybrid rice at 0.75 yuan per jin. When asked to lower the price to 0.70 yuan per jin, it said this was impossible as it would incur a loss and require subsidies. This must be changed." "This method is good." Vice Premier Zhu's thoughts received unanimous consent. Frank discussion pushed the meeting to a climax. Vice Premier Zhu asked many questions and participants put forward their ideas and proposals in a steady stream. Occasionally, Vice Premier Zhu jotted a note or nodded in agreement. "All your opinions are very good. We must safeguard the peasants' enthusiasm for grain production while taking the capability of urban residents and peasants in grain-poor regions into consideration. After hearing comments from you comrades, we have now got a basic idea of the situation. I hope you will continue to come up with some feasible methods." "Thank you for your trust, Vice Premier Zhu." The discussion meeting went on for nearly two hours, almost without people realizing it. Vice Premier Zhu did not show any fatigue, and he then allowed the Chuzhou city taxation bureau chief to sit at the main table....
