In a statement today, Ghawshah said that the council discussed at its preliminary meeting last night the working program of the authority and the basics of its responsibilities. Ghawshah added that the council also discussed the progress made so far in Gaza and Jericho and the tasks the council should undertake quickly in the autonomy area. Ghawshah said that Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, member of the Palestinian National Authority Council, submitted a working paper on the formation of the authority and its tasks, although she had earlier announced her refusal to take part in the council. Dr. Ghawshah said that 'Arafat has decided to appoint Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, an independent democrat from Hebron in the occupied West Bank, as a member of the council. He will be the 19th member in the 25-member council. Once the working program is discussed, the remaining six members of the council will be appointed, the ministerial portfolios distributed, and the council members will take the constitutional oath, Ghawshah said. He expects 'Arafat and the Palestinian leaders to enter Jericho before 5 June, unless unexpected developments occur. He added that the council will hold its first official meeting today after the members residing abroad arrive. Last night's meeting was attended by Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department; Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], PLO Executive Committee member; and Salim al-Za'nun, alias Abu-al-Adib, acting chairman of the Palestine National Council. These three are not members of the Palestinian National Authority Council.
