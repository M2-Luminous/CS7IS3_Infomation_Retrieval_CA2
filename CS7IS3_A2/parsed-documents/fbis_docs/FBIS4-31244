[Bugaj] Our place on that stage has remained unchanged for a long time now. On the other hand, the Democratic Union [UD], which used to occupy the center position, has now clearly moved to the right, while the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] has moved at least to a center position. [Sroczynski] Are you trying to say that you are now the most left-oriented party? [Bugaj] Indeed, that is what we are. With one reservation, however: that the political scene in Poland is, as a whole, somewhat right-oriented. [Sroczynski] There was a time when you hoped to win over a proportion of the National Trade Union Alliance [OPZZ] deputies who were members of the Democratic Left Alliance Parliamentary Caucus. These calculations did not materialize.... [Bugaj] The SLD leadership is firm and, as you saw for yourself during the budget vote, it decided to expel from their parliamentary club anyone who dares to vote against their instructions. However, there are many people there who articulate the issues which were on the agenda during the election campaign. On the other hand, there are also the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] activists delegated to operate in the trade unions. I do not know what their proportional numbers are. [Sroczynski] The differences which already existed between you, Waldemar Pawlak, and Aleksander Kwasniewski have deepened since the time when you negotiated with them the possibility of your joining the parliamentary coalition. Why is that? [Bugaj] We have not noticed any marked changes in their stand on social and economic issues. Nor do we conclude from Mr. Kolodko's public statements that such changes are about to take place. The second area in which we have reservations about their positions concerns questions of personnel appointments: An increasing number of figures from the past have been appearing on the scene. The third bloc of contentious issues entails relations with the President's Office. The president's actions can hardly be defined as constructive. Why was the situation allowed whereby certain ministries come directly under the president's decisions? Why was the concept of a "presidential ministry" created at all? There are also certain matters on which, it seemed, there were no appreciable differences between ourselves on the one hand and the SLD-PSL bloc on the other. I am thinking here of our proposal for a constitutional referendum. By now it is more and more often that we can hear them say: We do not know.... Let us wait and see.... [Sroczynski] How do you assess the opposition in the Sejm? Do you not think that it is weak and contributes very little? [Bugaj] Indeed, it is weak. There are two reasons for its weakness. First, the coalition is far stronger because it commands a large number of seats in parliament; second, despite the many accusations being leveled against it, the coalition is relatively well consolidated. On the other hand, the opposition, which is to be found both on the left and the right side (although I do not quite know where to place the Confederation for an Independent Poland), is certainly rather weak. That is why it has a very limited chances of standing up successfully to the government and opposing its plans. [Sroczynski] Perhaps the Sejm itself is too weak? [Bugaj] If you are referring to the political elites' level of competence in discharging their brief, I would agree with that proposition. It is equally true of the parliamentary parties representing the government coalition and the opposition. [Sroczynski] We will soon see the launch of the presidential election campaign. Consequently, we can surely assume that there is much discussion in your party on your future candidate for the president's office. In your opinion, who should run for the presidency from your group? [Bugaj] I would like to see a candidate representing a center-left orientation, and, most importantly, offering a guarantee of a serious attitude to the discharge of his duties and an unconditional respect for the constitution. So far, a candidate combining these qualities has not materialized. However, I am still hopeful that we will find him. [Sroczynski] What do you think of the chances of candidates proposed by the right wing? The right is, after all, about to become consolidated and create a united confederation. [Bugaj] I have become accustomed to situations whereby, if you hear a public statement from the right-wing camp on a Monday, you can be certain that it will be disclaimed on Tuesday, that something entirely new will be announced on Wednesday, and that by Thursday it will be back to the original Monday statement again. Consequently, I cannot tell with any certainty what will happen in the right-wing camp in the near future and, to tell the truth, I am not particularly interested. [Sroczynski] But let us assume that every major political group nominates its own candidates to the office of president. Who will stand the best chance then? [Bugaj] I believe that in the first round the chances will be even, and by the second round the presidential election will become a lottery. [Sroczynski] In other words, you believe that certain related political groups should come to an agreement and nominate their presidential candidate jointly? Would your party be willing to participate in such an agreement? [Bugaj] I hope so.
