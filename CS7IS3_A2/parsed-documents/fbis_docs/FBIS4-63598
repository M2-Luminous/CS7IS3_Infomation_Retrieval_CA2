The president spoke in the run up to his visit to Moscow scheduled for June 1-4. Moscow officials believe that in connection with North Korea's readiness to secede from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, the situation must be discussed at a multilateral conference with the participation of Russia, China, the United States, Japan, North Korea, South Korea and representatives from the United Nations and IAEA. Welcoming this proposal, the Korean president said that since at this stage and in connection with its nuclear aspect measures are being taken jointly by the United Nations and the IAEA, this proposal should be regarded taking into account possible developments of the situation and the position of other interested sides. "Probably, it will take some time to realise whether the conference suggested by Russia will be a means of the settlement of the problem," Kim Yong-sam said. He pointed out that this problem is of great importance for peace on the Korean Peninsula, in the north-east Asia and in the whole world. He believes that Russia is abiding by a principle position, coming out against the creation of nuclear weapons in North Korea, and therefore, upcoming talks at a summit level in Moscow will make it possible to discuss ways of cooperation between Russia and South Korea in this direction. Asked by ITAR-TASS what message the South Korean president would like to give to his North Korean counterpart, taking advantage of this interview, Kim Yong-sam pointed out that if North Korea really wishes peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula, firstly, it should stop nuclear developments and secondly, begin an open dialogue with the south, rather than attempt to resolve Korean problems through the United States only. The termination of the nuclear programme would be both a means of survival for North Korea itself and a way of ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula, Kim Yong-sam said.
