FBIS4-48361 "drafr095_d_94022" FBIS-AFR-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique Peace Process Said Facing `Difficult Times' Peace Process Said Facing `Difficult Times' MB1605154594 Maputo MEDIAFAX in Portuguese 16 May 94 p 2 MB1605154594 Maputo MEDIAFAX Portuguese BFN [Article by Carlos Cardoso and Arnaldo Abilio: "Difficult Times"] [Excerpt] The Mozambican peace process is going through what local observers call "difficult times." On 13 May, reliable sources told MEDIAFAX that Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [FADM] instructors, who have already arrived in Boane, had gone on strike as their salaries have not been paid. The most recent UN Security Council resolution on Mozambique refers to the existence of problems regarding payments. One of our reporters went to Boane on Saturday. Lieutenant Colonel Julius Raimundo, head of the FADM Boane Center, confirmed to us that there had been an "interruption" of work by the instructors, and that the issue had been referred to other authorities. MEDIAFAX is still investigating the issue. The latest UN Security Council resolution on Mozambique is causing controversy. Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana yesterday spoke to us about an issue which the government describes as strange: the resolution includes definite dates for concluding the process of confinement, demobilization, and formation of the FADM, "while the dates for all that are still being discussed in Maputo." Hunguana said the dates mentioned in the resolution had not been proposed by Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance]. Hunguana has also confirmed the West is "reigniting pressure" to make Joaquim Chissano accept a cabinet arrangement with Renamo before elections are held. The minister did not disclose which countries are applying the strongest pressure. He only added that the pressure now includes the argument that Mozambique should adopt the South African model of a government of national unity (GNU). Hunguana noted that "in South Africa the elections were the culmination of the liberation struggle against apartheid. One could say the elections marked South Africa's 25 June. [Mozambique's independence day]. For us that date is history." Hunguana reiterated that the government is opposed to the idea of a GNU. Chissano has stated time and again that if he wins the polls he wants his hands free to form a government in line with the election results and in a manner that gives him the best guarantees for stability in the country. Lately Renamo has been proposing a pre-election arrangement. Richard Edis, British ambassador to Mozambique, has already told the Mozambican press that his government favors a pre-election solution without doing away with the elections. Another British diplomat told MEDIAFAX last week that that was still his government's position, although it was not applying pressure along the lines of "either GNU or no money." There is a great deal of speculation in Maputo that most of the pressure is coming from Portugal. Asked to comment on the role being played by the Portuguese authorities on this issue, a reliable source told MEDIAFAX that in 1990, when the Rome talks between the government and Renamo had just started, the Portuguese Government "systematically" spoke about the need for a "system of pre-guarantees" because Renamo was "a group representing different interests." The source said the "system of pre-guarantees" became clearly defined in a plan for a transitional government, the first pre- election arrangement proposal for the Mozambican process. A government delegation that includes several of the negotiators of the Rome peace accord with Renamo left for Rome last night. They are: Ministers Guebuza, Hunguana, and Mazula, Ambassador Francisco Madeira, and a military man linked to the formation of the FADM. Teodato Hunguana told us that the visit to Rome was not because there was a new government in Italy, but because of the "importance of relations we have with Italy." [passage omitted]
