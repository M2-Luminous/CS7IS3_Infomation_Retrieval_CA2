The head of government, however, is still 9 percent behind Scharping (35 percent), who lost 2 percent. According to the poll, 31 percent of the voters would vote for the CDU/CSU, which is 1 percent more than last week. The SPD, on the other hand, would lose 2 percent, but would still have the support of 44 percent of the voters. With 6 percent of the votes, the Free Democratic Party of Germany would exceed 5 percent for the first time in weeks.
