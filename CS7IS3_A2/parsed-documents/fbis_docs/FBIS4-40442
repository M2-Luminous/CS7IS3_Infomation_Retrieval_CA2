Kozin: "Petr Symonenko: 'Privatization Will Be Halted'"] [Text] A meeting of journalists was held in Donetsk Saturday with V. Chuprun, a candidate for the post of head of the oblast soviet and the present chairman of the oblast soviet of people's deputies. Seats next to him in the presidium were occupied by P. Symonenko, first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine [CPU]; A. Kiyashko, acting chairman of the political council of the Socialist Party [SPU]; and A. Gurbych, chief of the Donetsk Oblast press administration. "The soviet must have executive authority." "The reason for soviet authority is to reflect the interests of the people." "The main figure is the working person, and not the speculator." "We have had enough destruction." "If a professor becomes a janitor or departs, this is a failure of the state." "Land must not be turned into a commodity. Land must be state property." "Physicians now receive a wage at a level that is lower than required for biological survival..." That which we had occasion to hear at the meeting was rather predictable. The press of the whole world knows that staunch communists are enemies of healthy (and unhealthy, in their understanding) sensations; therefore, the measures that they organize always proceed smoothly and sensibly. There was no personal criticism of the contenders in the preelection campaign. There was a criticism of ideas that were alien to communists, there was criticism of the policy of the top leadership, and there was talk that someone, somewhere, was "passing" something to someone and interfering with normal living. A substantial part of the questions was addressed to Petr Symonenko, CPU leader. Speaking about the results of the elections to the Supreme Council, he noted that there were numerically enough left-wing forces in parliament to block any antipopular law or decision. It is impossible now to disregard a party for whose representatives more than 10 million persons voted. However, it is impossible to claim that a victory was won and that authority was gained. As an example, P. Symonenko cited these figures: "Thirteen out of the 23 permanent commissions of the Supreme Council are headed by representatives of right-wing forces." The first secretary of the CPU Central Committee shared the anxiety of a number of journalists about the increase in the threat coming from extremists of ultranationalist organizations, he talked about this with the current president, and he reported to those assembled that this question will be raised sharply in the future. The journalists received information that the coal industry is now at the level of 1954, and that 56 percent of the GNP is the production of the agro- industrial complex... P. Symonenko was asked: In the event that the CPU is successful in the elections to the local councils, do you plan to undertake efforts to change the pace and character of privatization? This was the answer: Privatization has an antipopular character. An analysis of it will be made. Privatization will be halted. The journalists also heard from the conference participants that it was difficult for the Communists and their left-wing comrades to get through with a word of truth on the republic's television screens. The parliamentary newspaper GOLOS UKRAINY deals with the life of the regions in a way that is unbalanced and not objective. But the situation will be corrected, inasmuch as the Supreme Council commission on the legislative guarantee of freedom of speech and the mass media is now headed by V. Ponedylko, a decent person and a member of the CPU from Zaporozhye. The two-hour meeting ended in a didactic way. The presidium called on "comrade journalists" to summon the citizens of the oblast to come to the ballot boxes on 28 June, for the local elections have far more than just local significance. Besides the great and selfless love of the people, perhaps it is only this summons that is common in the positions of all participants in the election skirmish, from both the right and the left. However, this division in Ukraine is very conditional and is different from the main civilized world. In fact, none of those who are "from the right" are above us. There are right-leftists, left-leftists, and extreme leftists, and those for whom statehood is above all things. However, it seems that this has no bearing on the subject of the meeting that was held, and since this is the case, let us all vote!
