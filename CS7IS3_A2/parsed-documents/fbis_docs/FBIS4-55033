We interviewed Laszlo Egerer, leader of the National Security Office's Constitutional Protection Directorate, on the background to the appearance of the successor to the former Arrow-Cross organization [Hungarian fascist organization during the Nazi period]. [Egerer] Arrow-Cross and National Socialist parties operated in Hungary from 1935, mostly following Ferenc Szalasi. The establishment of the Hungarist Movement coincided with the launching of the National Socialist Hungarian Party in March 1938. Pal Teleki's government dissolved it but, under German pressure, it again became legal under a different name and, as the Arrow-Cross Party, it came to power on 15 October 1944. After World War II, afraid of reprisals for the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by them, many members of the Hungarist Movement emigrated to various countries of the world. After emigrating, representatives and sympathizers of Arrow-Cross power established regional groups -- in Australia, Canada, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Western Europe -- of the Hungarist Movement. Their activities were mostly limited to publishing their internally circulating journal, UT ES CEL [ROAD AND GOAL], and to organizing local events. Personal conflicts, rivalry, and dissent by the leaders and the membership characterized this movement from the beginning. From 1945 to 1975, former Arrow- Cross leader Arpad Henney headed the movement, having been appointed by Szalasi as his political successor. After Henney's death, Imre Tatar Tarjanyi, who was living in Germany, became the movement's leader and kept this role until autumn 1993. At the time, he was a parliamentary deputy for the Arrow-Cross Party. [Correspondent] We have arrived at the present. How has the Hungarist Movement been reorganized? [Egerer] After the change of the regime, the Hungarist Movement's emigre organizations made contact with extreme right-wing groups in Hungary so as to make Hungarism legitimate as a political line, and to rehabilitate Szalasi's Arrow-Cross dictatorship. After 1990, many elderly activists of the movement came to Hungary and personally tried to do something to achieve these goals. In the course of this, the Hungarist Movement's representatives from Australia, Canada, and the United States made contact with Istvan Gyorkos, the leader of the illegal extreme right-wing organization the Hungarian National Front [Magyar Nemzeti Arcvonal], who was accepted as the domestic representative and maintainer of Hungarist traditions. The international and domestic media coverage of the criminal proceedings launched against Gyorkos in 1992 played a part in this because this introduced him to the extreme right-wing emigre groups. Through his contacts, Gyorkos often received financial support from Western emigres to establish the Hungarist Movement in Hungary. In addition to this, extreme right-wing Hungarian propaganda publications -- UT ES CEL -- and reprinted books of the ideologists of Hungarism -- Szalasi, Istoczy, and Marschalko -- were often sent to Gyorkos and other extreme right-wing activists for further circulation. [Correspondent] When did Albert Szabo appear? [Egerer] He returned home on the instruction of the Hungarist Movement's Australian group. Szabo has dual Hungarian and Australian citizenship. He held discussions with Gyorkos a number of times on coordinating the operation of the extreme right-wing groups and on presenting them as a united movement. However, the Hungarian branch of the Hungarist Movement was not formed because of its poor organization, lack of social support, and mainly the individual ambitions and rivalry between Gyorkos and Szabo. In the autumn of 1993, the Hungarist groups operating among emigres in the West jointly declared that they were appointing Istvan Gyorkos as leader of the movement because the former leader Tarjanyi, living in Germany, could not carry out the work of directing the organization. Szabo did not accept this, tried to compete with Gyorkos, and established the World National Popular Rule Party. In spring 1994, the foreign groups of the Hungarist Movement made Gyorkos and Szabo understand that they would only continue to support them financially if they appeared as a united movement in political life. It can be attributed to this and to the lack of success in the election campaign that the establishment of the Hungarian wing of the Hungarist Movement was announced on 27 April 1994. This was primarily a symbolic act, as only 11 people signed the minutes that registered the establishment. In spite of their loud statements about the broad social support for their "movement," the number of their sympathizers does not even extend to a few hundred. The vast majority of people belonging to this movement are not clear about the ideology or history of Hungarism, have a low intellectual level, and primitive opposition to Gypsies and Jews, and chauvinism dominate their views. On 28 April 1994, on charges of conducting extremist propaganda activities, the police instituted criminal proceedings against Gyorkos and Szabo -- who call themselves the leaders of the Hungarist Movement in Hungary -- on the well-grounded suspicion of incitement against the community in violation of Paragraph 269 of the Penal Code. [Correspondent] No proceedings have been initiated started against Gyorgy Kemal Ekrem, who appeared at the movement's gatherings together with the other two people. Why not? [Egerer] In view of the facts known to us, the well-founded suspicion of incitement against the community under Paragraph 269 of the Penal Code was not raised in his case.
