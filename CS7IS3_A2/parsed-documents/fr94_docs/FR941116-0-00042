FR941116-0-00042 FR941116-0-00007 14 CFR Part 73 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ASW&hyph;13] Amendment to Time of Designation for Restricted Areas R&hyph;2403 A and B; Little Rock, AR AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends the times of designation for Restricted Areas R&hyph;2403 A and B, Little Rock, AR. The U.S. Army has determined that the present published times of designation for the restricted areas do not accurately reflect their actual times of use. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, February 2, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steve Riley, Military Operations Program Office (ATM&hyph;420), Office of Air Traffic System Management, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;7130. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Rule This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the times of designation for Restricted Areas R&hyph;2403 A and B, Little Rock, AR, respectively from ``May 1 through August 31, daily 0700&hyph;2100 local, other times by NOTAM,'' and ``September 1 through April 30, Saturday 0700&hyph;2100 local and Sunday 0700&hyph;1700 local, other times by NOTAM.'' to ``by NOTAM 24 hours in advance.'' Following a review of its special use airspace, the U.S. Army, Camp Robinson Joint Air Space Committee, determined that it has a continuing requirement for the restricted areas; however, the current published times of designation do not accurately reflect the time the airspace is required for military use. This action amends the published times for the restricted areas to reflect actual use and to provide more lead time notification via NOTAM 24 hours prior to activation. It does not change the existing boundaries, or the type of activities currently conducted within R&hyph;2403 A and B. Because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public is not particularly interested, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Section 73.24 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Environmental Review This action amends the times of designation of the restricted areas. It does not change the existing boundaries, or the type of activities currently conducted within R&hyph;2403 A and B. Accordingly, this action is not subject to environmental assessments and procedures as set forth in FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts.''
