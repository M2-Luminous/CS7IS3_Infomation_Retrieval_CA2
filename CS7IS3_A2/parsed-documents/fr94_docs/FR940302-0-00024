FR940302-0-00024 FR940302-0-00011 40 CFR Part 180 [PP 1F4016 and PP 2F4053/R2039; FRL&hyph;4756&hyph;8] RIN 2070&hyph;AB78 Pesticide Tolerances for Cyromazine AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule establishes tolerances for residues of the insect growth regulator cyromazine ( N -cyclopropyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine) and its metabolite melamine (1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine), calculated as cyromazine, in or on leafy vegetables (except Brassica) at 10.0 ppm and in or on cucurbits vegetables at 2.0 ppm. This regulation to establish maximum permissible levels for residues of the insecticide was requested pursuant to petitions submitted by Ciba-Geigy Corp.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of March 11, 1992 (57 FR 8658 -8659), EPA issued notices which announced that Ciba-Geigy Corp., P.O. box 18300, Greensboro, NC 27419, had submitted pesticide petitions (PP 1F4016 and PP 2F4039) to EPA proposing to amend 40 CFR 180.414 by establishing tolerances, under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the insecticide cyromazine ( N -cyclo-propyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine) plus its major metabolite melamine (1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine) in or on the raw agricultural commodities leafy vegetables crop group at 10.0 ppm and cucurbit vegetables crop group at 2.0 ppm. There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to these notices of filing. The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. A discussion of the toxicological data considered in support of the tolerance as well as a discussion of the risk of cyromazine and its metabolite melamine can be found in a rule (FAP 2H5355/P344) published in the Federal Register of April 27, 1984 (49 FR 18120); in the Notice of Conditional Registration for Larvadex 0.3% Premix, published in the Federal Register of May 15, 1985 (50 FR 20373) and in the proposed rule regarding the establishment of a tolerance for residues of cyromazine and its metabolite melamine, calculated as cyromazine, in or on mushrooms at 10.0 ppm in the Federal Register of June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34972). A chronic dietary exposure/risk assessment for the proposed use on cucurbit vegetables and leafy vegetables (except Brassica) based on tolerance residue levels of 2.0 ppm and 10.0 ppm, respectively, was performed. This chronic analysis compared exposure estimates to a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.0075 mg/kg/ body weight/day based on a no-observable-effects level (NOEL) of 0.75 mg/kg body weight/day and an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL is based on a 6-month dog feeding study which demonstrated decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin levels. The Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution (TMRC) from established tolerances for cyromazine utilizes 30% of the RfD for the overall U.S. population. With the inclusion of leafy vegetables (except Brassica) and cucurbit vegetables, dietary risk is raised to 60 percent of the RfD. Therefore, the contribution of the leafy vegetables (except Brassica) and cucurbit vegetables tolerances takes up an additional 30 percent of the RfD. Further, with the inclusion of the leafy vegetables (except Brassica) and cucurbit vegetables, the estimates for the total percent RfD occupied for infants aged less than 1 year and children 1 through 6 years of age become 44% and 66%, respectively. Since the exposure estimates are based on theoretically maximum residues, and are typically overestimates of actual exposure, and since they do not exceed the Reference Dose, the chronic dietary risk of cyromazine does not appear to be of concern. The nature of the residue in plants is adequately understood for the purposes of these tolerances. An adequate analytical method, high-pressure liquid chromatograph with UV detection, is available for enforcement purposes in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II). There is no reasonable expectation that secondary residues will occur in milk, eggs, or meat of livestock and poultry since there are no livestock or poultry feed items asssociated with this action. Based on the information cited above, the Agency has determined that the establishment of the tolerance by amending 40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought and capable of achieving the intended physical or technical effect. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by these regulations may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
