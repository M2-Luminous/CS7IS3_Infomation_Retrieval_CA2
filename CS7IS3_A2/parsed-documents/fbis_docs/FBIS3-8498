For the government, the adoption of the budget in a certain sense signifies a vote of confidence in the policies it is following. However, this vote is also an occasion for considering certain problems and the main directions of the government's activity in 1994. First, one should stress that the present government was elected by the National Assembly on 30 December 1992 on the basis of its declared program at the time, which in its principal directions remains in force even now, insofar as no party or parliamentary group in the majority coalition (after having been publicly invited to do so on two occasions in recent months) has so far declared that it wants any adjustment to the government program in terms of retracting or amending any of the main directions for the national economic and domestic policies that were formulated on 30 December 1992. In this connection I am bound to state firmly that several statements by certain of our opponents are completely groundless; these statements claim that the process of restoring land titles has stopped and is being blocked throughout the country; that certain basic restitution laws are about to be repealed; that preparations are being made to settle accounts with members and sympathizers of the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces], and so on. These are propaganda ploys. The government has never considered doing this, and will never allow such things to be done. They are wasting their time in trying to scare people with such bugbears as the possible restoration of the old nomenklatura to leading posts in state service and the enterprises, the restoration of the old labor cooperative farms, an alleged plot against private business, a realignment of foreign policy, and an assault against the judiciary. Many criticisms can be leveled against the government, and it will accept them; nevertheless, the government is bound strictly to observe the laws and the democratic principles of the political system embodied in the Constitution -- the principle of the separation of powers, preservation of human rights, and so on, based on which a democratic political and economic reform is being carried out in the country. Against the background of the adopted 1994 budget and the continuation in force of the government program of 30 December 1992, I must state that during the coming spring months the government will concentrate its efforts in the following fields: 1. Improving the administration of state property and privatizing this property according to the law and the specific program approved by the National Assembly. This will be achieved by tightening the state's requirements relating to the existing supervisory boards of state companies by consistently applying Council of Ministers Decree No. 17 of 1994 and directly linking the remuneration of the board members with the financial and economic results achieved for each quarter by the enterprises under their supervision. A considerable number of privatization transactions have already been initiated. In 1994 it is planned to privatize 320 state enterprises, using the existing, mainly market methods of privatization. When the National Assembly completes the second reading of the mass privatization program (often referred to as the social privatization program), which has a schedule with a deadline of August this year, a further 507 enterprises will be privatized. These make up almost 40 percent of the total capital held by the existing state companies. All this will be one of the main prerequisites for a turnaround of the national economy and starting the economic revival. 2. The government is drafting a scheme of incentive measures for private business (which will not have a negative effect on the state budget and not involve any granting of public money either directly or indirectly.) This scheme will include a package of measures to stimulate the domestic markets for a number of industrial and agricultural products, measures for encouraging exports, measures to provide low-cost credit facilities for small and medium-sized businesses through the relevant fund formed under the international programs that have been worked out, and so on. The measure will be directed more toward private businesses in the production sector, because so far those with private capital have mainly preferred to invest their money in trade and other forms of middleman activities, which does not help to increase the GDP. I have often stated publicly that the government has given and will continue to give a helping hand to representatives of private business who, while pursuing their normal desire for profit and furthering their personal interests, commit themselves to sharing the fate of the people around them and help to achieve specific tasks of nationwide importance. 3. The government is working on additional measures in the field of social policy during the period of the structural reform. For example, additional compensation will be provided for consumers of thermal energy in the larger towns, in connection with the sharp rise in the cost of this service. Every quarter, pensions will be indexed in line with the expected consumer price index, not according to the index of the preceding quarter, and the state system for monitoring prices of essential goods will be extended in scope. 4. Now that the budget has been adopted, as of today a system of measures takes effect that is designed to free the country from its relative financial isolation that it has suffered until now. This will be achieved by resolving the problems regarding the necessary payments of settlement, with a view to finalizing the interim agreement on the foreign debt that has already been signed, increasing the inflow of foreign investments, providing state help for those wishing to enter new foreign markets, and so on. 5. One of the government's main tasks will be to restrict inflation further, bringing it down from the 64 percent experienced in 1993 to 40-45 percent or lower in 1994, which will be a step toward the financial stabilization of every Bulgarian family. I consider that all the foregoing clearly outlines the directions of the government's activity in 1994. Some people continue to stake their bets on a confrontational, black against white conception of the political situation and the country's political future. Such a primitive use of a formula that is already outdated for Bulgaria does not lead to the development of a stable state policy during the period of transition. I think that, at the present political juncture and in the present difficult economic situation, a neutral, broadly based government of experts without any party bias is best able to preserve political and social equilibrium and lead the country to a brighter future. Our government has demonstrated that it can work on a professional basis, and it will continue to work with all the political forces that have constructive attitudes and are able to suggest pragmatic solutions in the general national interest and for Bulgaria's prosperous future.
