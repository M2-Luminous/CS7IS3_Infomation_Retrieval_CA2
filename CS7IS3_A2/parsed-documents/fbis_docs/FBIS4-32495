Among other things, I asked the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] prime minister designate [Gyula Horn] about this after yesterday's MSZP congress. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] [passage omitted] We know that this government has to take very tough economic steps to sort out the country's economy. When do you think these steps have to be taken? Can steps of this nature be delayed? [Horn] [passage omitted] The difficulties are just ahead of us. By difficulties I mean the country's extremely serious crisis, because that is what we are talking about. The financial burdens and financial liabilities are enormous. The next government's room for maneuver is extremely narrow. There is a lot we do not yet know, and I have to admit I am afraid that the next government will be surprised at a lot of things. [Correspondent] What kind of surprises are you thinking of? Do you think the outgoing government has not given sufficient information? [Horn] When we studied the documents we asked for and which were promised by [Prime Minister] Peter Boross, we found that the documents did not give a realistic picture of 1994, especially of what can be expected in the second half of 1994 and what obligations fall on the next government, which is the successor of the previous government in this sense. We are not supposed to break any law or agreement made by the previous government. [passage omitted] At the same time, we want to speed up and widen the opportunities in international relations which, in our view, can help realize the tasks of modernization. Very urgent meetings and international negotiations are indispensable for this with partners such as Germany or Austria, or -- of a totally different nature -- with Slovakia. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] [passage omitted] It was five years ago that you, with Alois Mock, cut through the Iron Curtain. [passage omitted] I could say there is something symbolic in your becoming prime minister in Hungary five years after this. But I think it will be quite difficult to surpass that achievement. Am I wrong? [Horn] [passage omitted] I am interested in only one thing -- that we fully meet our commitments toward the electorate, the country. [passage omitted] We would like to achieve prosperity for the 10.5 million strong Hungarian nation [magyarsag] living within our national borders, whether they voted for us or not. This is our mission. [passage omitted] [end recording]
