FR940526-0-00038 FR940526-0-00016 Kentucky proposes to delete 8:030 section 1(4) (a) and (b), and 8:040 section 1(3) (a) and (b), which contain a listing of the required permit application forms and the location at which they may be obtained. Since the information contained in these subsections is generally duplicative of information currently set forth at 405 KAR 8:010 section 5(1) (c) and (d), the Director finds that the proposed deletions will not render the State's program less effective than the Federal regulations. 2. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 2 Kentudky proposes to revise subsections (3), (4) and (5)(a) (405 KAR 8:030 only) by deleting cross-references to 405 KAR 7:020 dealing with the definitions of terms. Inasmuch as the Director previously approved the deletion of 405 KAR 7:020 and the relocation of the definition of terms regulations to the specific regulation chapters in which terms are used (57 FR 45295, October 1, 1992), the Director finds that the deletion of these cross-references will not render Kentucky's program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations. Kentucky proposes to delete Subsection (6), which requires a statement identifying any pending permit applications, as well as any current or previous coal mining permits held during the preceding five years by the permit applicant or of an owner/controller of the applicant. Section 507(b)(3) requires that the permit applicant identify any permits held or previously held by the applicant and any pending permit applications. The Director agrees with the commenter who asserted that SMCRA requires that this information be supplied by the permit applicant. The Director acknowledges that the information concerning pending applications is requested in Kentucky's permit application. A question in a permit application, by itself without an accompanying regulation, does not satisfy the statutory requirement of 507(b)(3) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of section 2(6) would render that portion of the Kentucky program less stringent than 507(b)(3) of SMCRA and cannot approve the deletion of this requirement. Kentucky proposes to add subsection (11) which requires the permittee to notify the State immediately of any changes in the permittee's address, if changed at any point prior to final bond release. Kentucky also proposes to add a new subsection (12) which: (1) Requires the permittee to submit updates of certain information within thirty days of the effective date of any such changes, (2) discusses the effect of failure to provide the updates, and (3) provides for suspension of the permit, after opportunity for hearing, for failure to provide updated information upon request. While there are no direct Federal counterparts for these provisions, the Director finds that the proposed revisions will assist Kentucky in having the most current information on the applicant and will not render Kentucky's program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations. Finally, Kentucky proposes to delete former subsection (12) which required the applicant to submit required information on appropriate forms which were incorporated by reference in section 1(4) which also has been deleted. These forms are now among those forms listed at 405 KAR 8:010 section 5(1) (c) and (d). Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of subsection (12) will not render the State's program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations. The Director notes that on September 23, 1991, he found subsection (12) to be less effective than 30 CFR 778.13(j) to the extent that subsection (12) did not require the use of a format prescribed by OSM for the submission of information required under 30 CFR 778.13 and 778.14 (56 FR 47907, September 23, 1991). Consistent with the Director's findings, he required Kentucky, at 30 CFR 917.16(f), to amend its program. Since that 1991 finding, the Director has approved 405 KAR 8:010 section 5(1)(c). See 58 FR 3833, January 12, 1993. As stated above, 405 KAR 8:010 section 5(1)(c) includes the forms of former subsection (12). Therefore, the Director is amending his required amendment found at 30 CFR 917.16(f) to delete any reference to subsection (12) and replacing that reference with 405 KAR 8:010 section 5(1) (c) and (d). 3. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 3 Kentucky proposes to revise subsection (5) by deleting a cross-reference to the definition of ``small operator'' in KRS 350.450(4)(d). Since this cross-reference is duplicative of the one contained in 405 KAR 8:001 (106), the Director finds that the proposed deletion will not render Kentucky's program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations. 4. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 4 Kentucky proposes to revise subsection (2) regarding the information required to be submitted with the permit application if the private mineral estate to be mined has been severed from the private surface estate. As revised, subsection (2) is substantively identical to the Federal rule set forth at 30 CFR 778.15(b). Therefore, the Director finds that the proposal is no less effective than the Federal counterpart.
