Currently, 122 countries, including the United States, are CITES Parties. The Convention calls for biennial meetings of the Conference of the Parties that review its implementation, make provisions enabling the CITES Secretariat in Switzerland to carry out its functions, consider amendments to the list of species in Appendices I and II, consider reports presented by the Secretariat, and make recommendations for the improved effectiveness of the Convention. COP9 will be held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 7&hyph;18, 1994.

A Federal Register notice published on July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38112), requested information and comments from the public on animal or plant species the United States might consider as possible amendments to the Appendices.
