At two rounds of talks, the coalition executives confirmed that the ruling parties will stick to a policy accord reached before the formation of Hosokawa's cabinet last August, said Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] Secretary General Wataro Kubo. They also shared the view that an early Diet (parliament) approval of the overdue fiscal 1994 budget is the top priority for the next government and that the new administration should formulate a budget for fiscal 1995 featuring speedy improvement in lifestyle, Kubo told a press conference. He said the representatives from the ruling parties ironed out differences on such key issues as political reform, economic reform mainly through deregulation, Japan-U.S. relations and administrative reform and decentralization. They, however, failed to agree on two issues of immediate concern -- Tokyo's stance toward the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and tax system reform. If an accord is reached among them, the coalition parties will nominate Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as their single candidate for the premiership to succeed Hosokawa, who abruptly decided on April 8 to resign over dubious financial matters and a Diet business deadlock.
