Japan "would be able to extend a helping hand to North Korea if the history of the operations of its nuclear facilities were revealed to verify whether plutonium is clandestinely stockpiled," Kakizawa told a house of representative panel on cabinet affairs. The foreign minister also expressed readiness to give economic aid, including funds to finance construction of light-water nuclear reactors, if Pyongyang is forthcoming in divulging data on the history of its nuclear reactors. He also reiterated Japan's resolve to seek the deletion of an "enemy clause" from the U.N. Charter in the process of ongoing discussions on reforming the framework of the U.N. Security Council. The charter has described Japan, Germany and other states defeated by the Allied Forces during World War II as enemy states -- a description that has embarrassed these U.N. member states, now seeking to contribute to global peace.
