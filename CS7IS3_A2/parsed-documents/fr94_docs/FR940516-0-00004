FR940516-0-00004 FR940516-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;59&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8912; AD 94&hyph;10&hyph;05] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes Equipped With Pratt & Whitney JT9D&hyph;3 and &hyph;7 Series Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. This action requires inspections of the forward lower engine mount bolts for migration and damage, inspections of the bolt bushings for damage, torque checks of the nuts installed on these bolts, and correction of any discrepancies. This amendment is prompted by reports of migration of the bolts that attach the forward engine mount universal block to the engine lugs. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent migration of the bolts out of the engine lug joint, which could result in loss of the engine from the strut. DATES: Effective May 31, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May 31, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before July 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;59&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register , 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tim Backman, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;120S, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2776; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Five operators of Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D&hyph;3 and &hyph;7 series engines, have reported cases of migration of the bolts that attach the forward engine mount universal block to the engine lugs. Investigation of the most recent case, which occurred in February 1994, revealed that an engine mount bolt's self-locking nut was missing and the bolt had partially migrated out of the forward engine mount universal block to engine lug joint. The bolt migrated approximately one inch inboard, so that the bolt retainer device sheared and the bolt head came in contact with the thrust reverser air supply duct; this caused the duct to be chafed, dented, and cracked. The reason for the missing self-locking nut has not been determined. A similar incident was reported in 1982. During troubleshooting of the fan thrust reverser, one operator found an engine mount bolt that had migrated due to the loss of the self-locking nut. Like the most recent case, the reason for the missing self-locking nut was not determined. Prior to this incident, two other operators had reported migration of this same bolt after the loss of the nut and washer. If the bolt were to completely migrate out of the joint, the engine could separate from the strut. Separation of an engine from the strut could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;71A2269, dated April 14, 1994, that describes procedures for repetitive inspections of the forward lower engine mount bolt for migration and replacement of the nuts if bolt migration exists. It also describes procedures for inspecting the bolts and bolt bushings for damage, replacing damaged bolts and bushings, installing new nuts and modified washers for these bolts, and torque-checking the nut. The FAA also has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;71&hyph;2192, dated March 2, 1984, that contains procedures for installing steel retention brackets. Installation of these brackets will improve secondary retention of the two bolts that engage the universal block at the lower forward engine mount. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent complete migration of the forward lower engine mount bolt out of the joint, which could result in the separation of the engine from the strut. This AD requires repetitive visual inspections of the bolt for migration and replacement of the nuts if bolt migration exists; inspection of the bolts and bolt bushings for damage, and replacement of damaged bolts and bushings; and a torque check of the nut. These actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;71A2269, described previously. Operators who have previously installed steel retention brackets, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;71&hyph;2192, as well as nuts having part number NAS1805 and certain modified washers, are permitted to conduct the repetitive inspections for bolt migration at longer intervals than operators without these items installed on the airplane.
