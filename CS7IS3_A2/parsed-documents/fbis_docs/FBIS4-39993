However, this difficulty, thank God, does not go beyond the framework of laws and the Constitution. Within the framework of legislation and the Constitution, we coordinate all of the issues connected with interparty passions and with interparty struggle, as well as regional issues--in particular, the Crimean issue, a very complicated issue for us today. We work in a way so that Crimea can understand that simple norm, recognized by the world community, that it has no right to violate the territorial integrity of the state and alter its borders. We enjoy the support of the entire international community. I hope that the Crimean leadership will assume responsibility in order to bring the processes within the framework of the Constitution. I, as the president of Ukraine, and the government act this way. We shall continue to act this way and tackle all issues proceeding from law and the Constitution. However, I emphasize again that the Crimean leadership has no right to step over the red line, which I mention. This is a violation of our state's territorial integrity. Well, I cannot say that we have a full understanding with Crimea. The problems are very complicated, but the information that is available to me, and I would like to share it with you, proves that there is a growing understanding among people--not at some level of power structures, but among people--and that the policy conducted by the Crimean leadership can lead to complications. Such understanding does exist. People, seeing these problems, these hotbeds, as we call them--both Karabakh and the Dniestr region, where it also happened, and Yugoslavia today. Thank God, the issue is being somehow tackled today. It can be solved step by step in Abkhazia where blood is being shed, where innocent people, women and children and those who have nothing to do with these conflicts, die and become refugees. People see this, and I think it will influence the Crimean leadership's policy and the actions. For our part, our actions will be adequate for the situation; however, we will by no means allow the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine's borders to be violated. We say this openly and sincerely, and I am telling you this while I am aware of the fact that the Crimean issue is a painful issue for every person living today in Ukraine. We have been able to follow the road of peace, tranquility, and accord, although there is certain pressure exerted on us from outside. We have internal problems as well. So far we have been unable to achieve civil accord as far as building and developing our economy, our political and power structures, and power institutions are concerned. The previous Supreme Council had been working for four years. It failed to solve issues that needed to be solved at the constitutional level. It failed to adopt the Constitution. Ukraine is one of the few countries of the former USSR which has no constitution today. We are going to hold the elections without a constitution. We are going to hold the elections without relevant laws to regulate relations between the local and central bodies of power. We are going to hold the elections with no clear idea of the plenary powers of the bodies of power to be elected and the structure of that power; no idea of what will be its responsibility to the budget of Ukraine or the responsibility of the lower-level bodies of power to the higher-level bodies of power. We have no idea whether that vertical subordination system exists or does not exist. Today, we see that it can be destroyed. This will seriously endanger the arrangement of power in the state, and power is the lever by which all institutions in all areas of life are created: in legal, economic, political, and diplomatic areas, and so on. That is to say, we must have constitutional and legislative norms to hold the elections, and we are going to hold them without those norms. This is unique, and it is not by chance that at the Supreme Council I appealed to the deputies and told them that today they.... [Kravchuk pauses] because this is exclusively within the competence of the Supreme Council to create the structure and to pass the laws on both the power structure and the elections. The president has no such plenary powers. Therefore, the Supreme Council of Ukraine will naturally have to assume all responsibility for what we are doing today toward that end. I believe that the deputies understand this, and there is no exaggeration whatsoever at this point. Perhaps we shall manage--I mean at the Supreme Council they will manage--before the elections are held, to make some corrections and some amendments to the laws that will regulate relations and create the power structure. As you know, there will be presidential elections, too. Strictly speaking, these elections, if we had a new constitution and laws.... [Kravchuk pauses] I was then speaking at the Supreme Council and saying that it is true that new power institutions had to be created to comply with the new constitution. But if this is not done, I am convinced that these elections will not bring better conditions or big changes in the economy and in politics all of a sudden. On the contrary, they distract people from fulfilling their [word indistinct]. I will use my own activities to illustrate this. This is the seventh election during the past four years that I have run in. Just imagine, the seventh election over four years. This means that I have been elected twice a year. Not appointed, but elected by people. This is the situation, and effort and energy are spared toward that end. [sentence as heard] For example, I am a functioning president, and I cannot abandon my office duties today. Who will perform them for me? There is no vice president. The Constitution clearly stipulates that I have no right to pass my powers to anyone else. For example, if I go on a trip to some oblast, and the levers of power.... [Kravchuk pauses] And it is necessary to sign documents here, or to meet representatives of other states who visit Ukraine. For example, next Tuesday [14 June] I am to fly to Luxembourg to sign a document on partnership and cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union. This will be done for the first time ever, and by this I mean to say that those who claim that Ukraine conducts a policy of isolation, self-isolation, well, this is just untrue because Ukraine has been recognized by the whole world. If we said earlier that it was recognized by 50, 60, or 70 states, then today I say that the whole world has recognized Ukraine. Ukraine joins the European community, the European Union with the rights of a partner. This is a fact, and this will be done next Tuesday on 14 June. We signed the most important political and economic documents with Russia and other CIS countries. We signed a treaty on friendship and cooperation with Russia in 1990. A new, full-scale treaty between our states is being prepared now, and I hope that it will be signed after we solve yet another acute problem for Russia and Ukraine: the division and the status of the Black Sea Fleet. We have also made some progress here. Therefore, the fact that Ukraine conducts some policy of isolation or self-isolation is a pure invention, indeed, a deliberate invention. Ukraine is represented at international organizations. Official representatives of other states, including high-level representatives, visit Ukraine every day. You know, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel recently visited Ukraine. I mention the recent times. Is this self-isolation? Another thing is that the problems are solved in an acute manner and with difficulty. However, this is not our fault, or it would be more correct to say, not only our fault. There are problems in other states, and it is not easy to solve them, and everyone today is engaged in solving acute issues. Sometimes we have to act as a fire-fighting team instead of implementing a program step by step and consistently, a program which neither internal nor external factors influence seriously, but even if they do, these factors can be easily averted.
