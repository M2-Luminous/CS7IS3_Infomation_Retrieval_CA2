Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks during his recent inspection of rural areas of Sichuan, a major agricultural province in China. The countryside of China is undergoing a transformation from bare subsistence to a comparatively wealthy lifestyle, and from traditional to modern agriculture, according to Wen. Two major strategic tasks lie before the development of agriculture and the rural economy, namely, the guaranteeing of a sufficient supply of agricultural products and the stable growth of farmers' income, Wen said. He pointed out that to reach the two targets, rural reforms must be deepened to develop the rural economy in line with the overall planning and requirements of establishing a socialist market economic system. Above all, the initiatives of farmers must be protected and mobilized and the status of agriculture as the foundation must be strengthened to guarantee its stable development, he noted. Policies in favor of the development of major agricultural products, mainly reasonable price and purchasing policies, must be stipulated; high-efficiency and high-yield agriculture must be developed, relying on science and technology; and the government, collectives and individuals must all increase investment in agriculture to strengthen its comprehensive production capability, he said. To increase farmers' income depends fundamentally on the overall development of the rural economy and the improvement of the rural economy's comprehensive efficiency, he pointed out. He stressed that reforms must be deepened to realize the two major targets. The official also stressed the importance of market machanism in the distribution of resources agricultural production and the supply of agricultural products. On the other hand, the government must enhance the macro control of agriculture, mainly through economic and legal methods, to support and protect agriculture, improve the stability and prosperity of the market and better protect the interests of farmers and consumers, he said. While the summer harvest is in sight, the late-stage management of wheat must be strengthened and at the same time the preparatory plowing for late spring crops must be stepped up, Wen Jiabao pointed out. Purchase funds for the harvest must be guaranteed to lay a solid foundation for a harvest for the whole year, he noted.
