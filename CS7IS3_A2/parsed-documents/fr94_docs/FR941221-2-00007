FR941221-2-00007 FR941221-2-00005 [Docket 40&hyph;94] Foreign-Trade Zone 116, Freeport, TX; Proposed Foreign-Trade Subzone, Fina Oil & Chemical Company (Oil Refinery), Jefferson County, TX (Port Arthur Area) An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Foreign-Trade Zone of Southeast Texas, Inc., grantee of FTZ 116, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the oil refinery of Fina Oil & Chemical Company (subsidiary of Fina, Inc., affiliate of Petrofina, SA (Belgium)), located in Jefferson County, Texas (Port Arthur area). The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on December 13, 1994. The refinery complex (1,457 acres) consists of 4 sites located in Port Arthur and Jefferson County, Texas: Site 1 (1,244 acres)_main refinery complex located along the Neches River at State Farm to Market Highway 366 and 32nd St., Port Arthur; Site 2 (19 acres)_West Port Arthur Tank Farm (564,000-barrel capacity), owned by American Petrofina Pipe Line Company (subsidiary of Fina, Inc.), located at Roosevelt and 53rd Streets, Port Arthur; Site 3 (194 acres)_refinery expansion site, located adjacent to the refinery at State Farm to Market Hwy 366, Port Arthur; Site 4 _Sun Marine Terminal-Nederland tank storage facility, leased storage (1,278,500-barrel capacity), along the Neches River in Nederland, Texas. The refinery (150,000 barrels per day; 470 employees) is used to produce fuels and petrochemical feedstocks. Fuels produced include gasoline, jet fuel, gas oil, diesel fuel, fuel oil, residual fuels and naphthas. Petrochemical feedstocks include methane, ethane, butane, benzene, toluene, xylene, propane and propylene. Refinery by-products include sulfur, petroleum coke and asphalt. Approximately 77 percent of crude oil (88 percent of inputs), and some feedstocks and motor fuel blendstocks are sourced abroad. Zone procedures would exempt the refinery from Customs duty payments on the foreign products used in its exports. On domestic sales, the company is seeking to avoid duties on fuel used in the refinery and to choose the finished product duty rate on certain petrochemical feedstocks and refinery by-products (duty-free). The duty on crude oil ranges from 5.25¢ to 10.5¢/barrel. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve the refinery's international competitiveness. In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790&hyph;50808, 10&hyph;8&hyph;91), a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. Public comment is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is February 21, 1995. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to March 6, 1995.). Copy of the application and accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations: Office of the District Director, U.S. Customs Service, 4550 75th St., Port Arthur, TX 77642 Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, Room 3716, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th & Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230 Dated: December 13, 1994.
