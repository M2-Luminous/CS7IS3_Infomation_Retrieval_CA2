The Japanese Government will hold a meeting of cabinet ministers in charge of economic affairs early next week to discuss specific action programs to promote Japanese imports, increase public investment, and cut the trade surplus. The idea is being floated of sending a special envoy to the United States right after the specific action programs are mapped out. The government wants to prevent any U.S. sanctions on Japan from decisively worsening bilateral relations. But the government is struggling to come up with specific measures which might represent a trump card and help break the impasse. The restoration of the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act is regarded as unavoidable. Japan's Responses In a bid to break the deadlock in Japan-U.S. framework talks, the government has decided to speedily design a package of measures focusing on four areas -- government procurement, competitive policy, the promotion of imports, and deregulation. A senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] official said on 19 February that "we can present vision for the macroeconomics area." The government has suggested the possibility of increasing the 430-trillion-yen "Basic Plan For Public Investment." The Japanese Government promised the United States in June 1990 it would spend that figure on public investment. Every government ministry and agency has begun studying a package of firm measures. The "Basic Plan For Public Investment," to be implemented between 1991 through the year 2000, was agreed between Japan and the United States at the structural impediment initiative talks. The idea is quickly surfacing that the government should set the public investment increase to be incorporated in the fiscal 1995 budget while promoting debate among the ruling coalition parties on a sweeping reform of the current tax system. Its subsequent plan to increase public spending should then be speedily presented to the United States. Ways to expand "the government procurement action program," which was decided by the cabinet on 4 February, will be studied. In the particular area of government procurement of telecommunications gear and medical equipment, the government will adopt a comprehensive appraisal system under which consideration will be given to the function of some items, in addition to their price, when choosing among final tenders. The government is likely to look at the possibility of reducing the level of procurement spending that government-controlled organizations are obliged to announce publicly in early January each year. At the framework talks on competitive policy, the United States strongly urged Japan to "address noncompetitive practices by Japanese enterprises." The government is expected to examine the possibility of strengthening the Fair Trade Commission's inspection function and rigorously enforcing the Antimonopoly Law. In a bid to prevent a recurrence of bid-rigging, the government will also examine ways to expand public works projects subject to open competitive tender. The government will consider additionally constructing foreign access zones, expanding permanent exhibitions of imported housing, and creating information centers to help foreign firms eager to export to Japan. The government will study integrating the current customs clearance and import procedures into a single procedure and increasing the number of imported goods exempted from import inspections. It is highly likely that the government will relax the import certification and standard system for automobiles, which the United States lobbied for strongly at the framework talks. The government will study ways to expand access to loans extended by government-backed financial institutions for enterprises starting business following deregulation. In the financial area, the government will establish a public hearing system to deal with complaints filed by foreign-affiliated insurance companies. It will also introduce an insurance brokerage system. Future U.S. Moves In reaction to the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks, the U.S. Government quickly reached a consensus on taking a hard-line trade policy toward Japan. The U.S. Government, which has already begun taking action to impose sanctions on Japan over the mobile phone issue, will announce on 17 February a set of new trade measures against Japan centered on restoration of the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. Influential Republicans and Democrats in Congress support a tough stand against Japan and the Congress will start full deliberation of a bill against Japan on 22 February, once the current recess is over. The U.S. Government has harshly criticized Japan for rejecting objective criteria to gauge the openness of the Japanese market. At the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks, the United States presented a compromise proposal under which "Japan would maintain its trend of import growth." The Japanese side showed no intention of compromising with the United States and flatly rejected the U.S. compromise, saying: "We cannot go along with the U.S. proposal to set numerical targets." Tokyo's rejection of objective criteria has reinforced criticism of Japan in the United States. Even American champions of free trade, including Trade Subcommittee Chairman Gibbons of the House Committee on Appropriations, have begun to think "we have no choice but to take a hard line against Japan." Small businesses and labor organizations that previously criticized President Clinton's trade policy, now intend to support his administration. The Clinton administration is being cautious about "imposing actual sanctions on Japan" in order to avoid further clashes with Tokyo. The National Economic Council (NEC) is in charge of mapping out a package of concrete trade measures against Japan and the U.S. Government will make a decision on 17 February. The U.S. Government is trying to apply the maximum pressure on Japan, and this is likely only to heighten tensions in Japan-U.S. trade relations.
