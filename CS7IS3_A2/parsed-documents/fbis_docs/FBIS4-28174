A source here who is well versed with North Korean affairs said he obtained the gruesome information from a former Chinese resident in Pyongyang who he said felt unsafe and fled to China. The execution, according to the source, took place at the parade ground of Kang Kon General Military Officers School, more correctly a training institute for Kim Chong-il's body guards, located at Sinsong-tong, Sunan district, Pyongyang. The condemned officers, mostly company-grade officers assigned to the officers school, were taken to the parade ground one by one, where executioners poured gasoline on them and set them afire in the presence of about 1,000 mobilized residents and party officials, the source said. Among the witnessing residents were the families of the condemned officers, who were made to stand in front rows, he said. The Chinese resident who witnessed the execution became so angered at the cruelty that he sent a letter to Beijing authorities to inform about the incident. But, the message was detected in a postal inspection, and North Korean security officers had since tailed and checked him often. "This made him feel unsafe in the North and flet to China recently," the source said. He said that whenever an officer was excuted by burning, the mobilized people, acting on the initiative of party officers, shouted "pan-yokja" or traitor and threw rocks at them. When the rumors spread among people later that the excution by burning was personally ordered by Kim Chong-il, the superintendent of the military school had disappeared, the source added.
