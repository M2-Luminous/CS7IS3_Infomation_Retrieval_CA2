These organizations tried to murder Jews in the past, are continuing to do so, and will pursue their attempts in the future, the prime minister told our correspondent Shmu'el Tal upon leaving a meeting of the Labor party bureau. Mr. Rabin nevertheless pointed out that in recent weeks, the number of terrorist attacks had dropped to a certain extent. The prime minister said that Jordan was demonstrating a readiness to reach a peace treaty with Israel and this was greatly facilitating the negotiations between the two countries. The very discussion of the elements of a peace treaty was important in itself, Rabin said, and one should hope that within the framework of these efforts, steps would be taken to strengthen normalization between the two countries -- for example, with regard to free movement and the Elat-Egypt highway. As for the negotiations with Syria, the prime minister said that the gaps between the parties' positions were still large and he did not expect a breakthrough or what he described as a miracle.
