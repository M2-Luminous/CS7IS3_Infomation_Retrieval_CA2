Matthew Moonieya said IEC officials and international observers had been sent from Umtata to the area to resolve a dispute over counting. "We have a problem, but it's not a big problem," he said. He said the IEC had originally not authorised any counting stations in the district. Four were later established but owing to a failure in communications were not staffed. Pan Africanist Congress officials were, however, insisting that the counting be done there and did not want the boxes moved. An attempt late on Sunday to take the boxes to Queenstown to be counted was unsuccessful. Mr Moonieya said he did not know how many votes were involved, but there had been 82 voting stations in the district.
