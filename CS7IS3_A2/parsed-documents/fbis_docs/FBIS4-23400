The aim is to hinder the peace process. Of the various actions that have been carried out, the following are the most relevant: Huambo Province: On 3 June 1994, the city of Huambo was once again bombed by two Su-22 formations at 1104 and at 1334. The aircraft dropped 16 napalm and phosphorous bombs, destroying several houses, and killing and wounding a large number of civilians. Lunda Province: On 3 June 1994, two Su-22 formations bombed Canfunfo at 1105 and 1205, killing and wounding many people. In all those raids, the Luanda air force hit mainly hospitals, schools, and defenseless civilians. Bie Province: On 2 and 3 June 1994, the MPLA-PT air force dropped bombs over its own defensive positions in the city of Bie [Cuito], killing and wounding many government troops and civilians. Intense clashes have been taking place in the city of Bie since 26 May 1994, when enemy forces once again violated the unilateral cease-fire declared by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] on 20 September 1993. In view of all those provocations, UNITA has no option but to defend itself. [Issued] Huambo, 3 June 1994 [Signed] Army General Arlindo Chenda Isaac Pena Ben-Ben
