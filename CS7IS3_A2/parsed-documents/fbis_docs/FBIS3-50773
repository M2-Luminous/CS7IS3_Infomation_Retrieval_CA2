This represents the highest production figure in the past few years. This record production is proof that the Santiago de Cuba thermoelectric plant can produce more than it has in the past. In 1993 there were times when the plant only produced 30 megawatts per hour. The success of the plant is due to the workers efforts and maintenance work on several of the units. The quality and speed of the work earned the workers the outstanding workers banner. The Antonio Maceo Thermoelectric Plant has six electricity-producing units. At this time, maintenance work is being done on Unit No. 4. According to the schedule, this maintenance will be completed in May 1994.
