Kuznechikov: "Has the Ukrainian National Bank Capitulated Again?"] [Text] Reliable sources reveal that the National Bank of Ukraine, heeding arguments of the Cabinet of Ministers, allocated around four trillion karbovantsy for the stabilization fund. It is believed that the stabilization fund will be used to ensure timely payment of pensions and wages. It is highly probable that part of the funds will be used to pay of debts to agriculture and to increase the working capital of a number of enterprises, including those in the woodworking branch. All that is fine. However, from the same sources indicate that those trillions were hardly stored in the basement of the National Bank. Which means... Exactly. Serious apprehensions appear that the printing press was once again put to work. If that is the case then it is easy to imagine the catastrophic consequences of another emission. "Greenbacks" will rise sharply, while Ukrainian "candy wrappers" will go down. It is not unlikely that in a week or so a dollar will fetch 60,000 karbovantsy, if not more. It is not difficult to guess what unlimited opportunities will appear for foreign investors wishing to participate in our ill-starred privatization. Unless the government introduces protective measures they will be able to buy-up the country for a song. All of it--down to the last bolt. It is true that some of the optimists are nurturing the hope that occasionally even those sources worthy of attention can be wrong. Meanwhile the dollar to karbovanets exchange rate in Kiev is already one to 59,000. Unfortunately the predictions are coming true.
