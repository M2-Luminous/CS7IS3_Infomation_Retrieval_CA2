FR940613-2-00097 FR940613-2-00059 The FAA issued a Federal Register Notice on April 22, 1993 announcing its intent to prepare an Environmental Document (possible Environmental Impact Statement) and to hold a May 26, 1993 scoping meeting. At the scoping meeting no significant impacts were identified. Some concerns were expressed over possible noise, floodplain and wetland impacts. The airport sponsor indicated that any impacts would be mitigated below the level of significance as an integral part of the development. The FAA issued a subsequent Federal Register Notice on February 17, 1994 announcing the availability of the Draft Environmental Document and provided additional opportunity for scoping comments for the refined listing of the major, associated and indirect development projects, incorporating items scoped originally and those newly identified as part of the UPS proposed development. Notice was also given for a March 22, 1994 public hearing with written comments being received until April 6, 1994. Based on the analysis found in the Final Environmental Assessment and the results of the public hearing, the FAA published a May 2, 1994 Federal Register Notice that it intended to issue a Mitigated FONSI/ROD for the proposed development depicted on the Airport Layout Plan. The FAA received a letter from the Illinois Department of Agriculture (IDOA) stating their concerns with respect to farmland impacts. The FAA addressed IDOA's concerns in a June 2, 1994 letter. On June 3, 1994, the FAA approved the Record of Decision (ROD). A copy of the Mitigated FONSI/ROD is available for review at the FAA-Chicago Airports District Office (address identified above). Copies of these documents will also be available for review locally at locations which have not yet been determined. These locations will be specified in a Public Notice or upon request of the Chicago Airports District Office (telephone number identified above). Questions may be directed to the individual named above under the heading, FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Issued in Des Plaines, Illinois on June 6, 1994. Louis H. Yates, Manager, Chicago Airports District Office, FAA, Great Lakes Region. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14291 Filed 6&hyph;10&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
