[Peres] Good morning. [Zissowitz] We are speaking with you in Oslo following your meeting last night with Yasir 'Arafat. Let us first talk about his explanations, which the prime minister termed far-fetched. Is that how you would describe them? [Peres] Professor Hayim Weizmann used to say that silence is golden. In other words, there is no doubt whatsoever that this utterance was unnecessary, damaging, and infuriating, but words are hard to take back; one can only explain them and apologize, which is what Mr. Yasir 'Arafat did. Before entering the news conference, the main point on which I insisted was that he reiterate the following three commitments: that he remains faithful and loyal to the Declaration of Principles and has not deviated from it, that he calls for an end to the use of any form of violence and terror, and that all disputed issues in the future will be settled through political rather than any other means. He said all that, and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter witnessed it. Of course, I cannot tell you that I am pleased about the whole business. Indeed, as the prime minister said, it was a mishap -- and a regrettable one at that. In our meeting, 'Arafat explained to me that he had been arguing with the Iranians and telling them: You talk about jihad. So, what have you done with this jihad? I believe he has learned his lesson with regard to the future. [Zissowitz] The recurring impression is that Yasir 'Arafat says certain things when he signs agreements, meets with Israelis, and shakes their hands, and totally different things in closed rooms. [Peres] There is yet another test. To the best of our knowledge, neither Yasir 'Arafat nor the PLO leadership have lent their hand to the resumption of terror since the Oslo agreement 10 months ago -- and this is also a fact. Of course, the verbal mishap remains, but as far as we know, in the field they have remained faithful to their commitment. [Zissowitz] Nevertheless, they have not canceled the clauses in the Palestinian Covenant calling for Israel's annihilation. [Peres] Confusion persists on this issue. They canceled them. The PLO leadership officially announced that the Palestinian Covenant is not in effect for all practical purposes; they used the word inoperative [last word in English]. Furthermore, 'Arafat said they will cancel them when the PNC [Palestine National Council] -- which has the constitutional right to do so with a two-thirds majority -- convenes, but at the moment they are unable to summon the PNC. In our meeting in Cairo, he reiterated his commitment to cancel them when the PNC holds its first session in Gaza. Hence, we cannot say that they have not abided by their commitment. I believe they have a real problem to convene the PNC and to muster a two-thirds majority, because there is no doubt that both the Arab world and the Palestinian world are very divided. What is exceptional about the PLO's position is not that they succeeded in mobilizing the entire Palestinian world but that this is the first time the Palestinians have renounced the path of violence, the path of the mufti of Jerusalem, and turned to a path of compromise and dialogue. [Zissowitz] We occasionally get the impression that we rush to forgive 'Arafat and forget what he says and what he does not say, such as when he refrained from denouncing the terror attacks in 'Afula and Hadera. [Peres] My dear friend, only God forgives; people can just pass judgment and remember. We do not forgive anything, and we remain watchful in all spheres -- both the declarative and the factual ones -- as well as with regard to his efforts to repair the damage when there is a deviation, as in the current mishap and his efforts to amend it. Indeed, he went out of his way to amend it. Having said that, I do not want to justify anything. Still, we take note of all these events, and we know the precise nature of the partner with whom we signed an agreement. I repeat: In practice, they have not deviated from what was agreed. [Zissowitz] Now that you mention terror, there was an attack yesterday near Netzarim. The terrorists fled into al-Shaja'iyah and the Palestinian policemen certainly did not pursue them. This creates an entirely new situation in the field in everything pertaining to fighting terror. [Peres] Look, the Palestinian police is also being tested, and it knows it. It realizes that if the police force proves ineffective, nobody will support it. In other words, the Palestinian police needs outside financial support and must build its credibility in order to continue the negotiations. Numerous major tests lie ahead of it, and I have reason to believe that it will really make a supreme effort. [Zissowitz] Do you also have reason to believe that the Palestinian policemen will join the efforts to thwart terror and arrest those who perpetrate it? [Peres] I have no doubt about it. They do not have to do it for us, but for themselves. [Zissowitz] Sir, 'Arafat also talked about the discussion of the fate of Jerusalem in the permanent arrangements. [Peres] No, he did not talk about what we agreed. You know, the whole business of a letter is a fiction. [Zissowitz] Did you ask him why he said he had a letter and on what basis he made such allegations about you? [Peres] I think.... [pauses] Why should I explain anything? I only know that there is no such letter and that this was an unfounded allegation. As for Jerusalem, there is an agreement which says that it is not included in the Gaza-Jericho accord and that it is not part of the autonomy area. When we proceed to discuss the permanent arrangement, they may raise the issue for the agenda, just as they may raise any other issue. If you remember, the late Menahem Begin also said that the Palestinians may raise any issue. Our agreement, however, says that the question of Jerusalem is not connected to Gaza and Jericho and is outside the timetable pertaining to the autonomy. As for the permanent solution, they may raise whatever issue they want. [Zissowitz] In the debate about the permanent arrangement in Jerusalem, will Israel be prepared to show some flexibility? [Peres] No, my position on the question of Jerusalem is clear and totally inflexible. I say that Jerusalem is closed from the political point of view and open from the religious one. In other words, from the political point of view, there will be no compromises and Jerusalem will remain Israel's united capital. We will not turn Jerusalem into Berlin; there is no way we are going to build or allow others to build walls in it. From the religious point of view, the Israeli Government proved to be the only government to have given worshipers of all faiths free access to pray in the city without any intervention. I believe one of the greatest achievements -- historically, not just diplomatically -- is the fact that the Vatican signed an agreement with us on mutual recognition with the status of Jerusalem being what it is: a united Jerusalem. You know, this is the kind of event that happens once in 2,000 years. We would like to reach a similar agreement with the Muslim world. From the religious aspect, everything is open; from the political one, everything is closed. [Zissowitz] I would like to ask you a question on an entirely different issue. The State Comptroller's Office annual report issued yesterday shows that governments come and go but things remain the same and corruption is rampant. [Peres] What corruption are you talking about? [Zissowitz] You may not have heard all the details of the report, but the State Comptroller's Office uncovered corruption in all government ministries. [Peres] It is not a matter of rampant corruption but of human weaknesses. A person with wings, like an angel, has not yet been created. In my opinion, a government should not be judged by whether its members make mistakes or are corrupt but by whether it fights corruption and mistakes. I believe this government is determined to fight any occurrence of corruption, nepotism, mistakes, and errors. [Zissowitz] Mr. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, I thank you very much.
