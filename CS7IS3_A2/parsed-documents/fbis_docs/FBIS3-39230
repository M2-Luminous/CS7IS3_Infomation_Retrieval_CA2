It cannot be "considered as retaliation or as the desire for military action." It is part of a political process for a solution by negotiation. This was stated by German UN Ambassador Detlev Count Rantzau on Monday [14 February] at the emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Bosnia in New York. If the unauthorized weapons systems have not been withdrawn within 10 days, the use of force is "unavoidable" in reestablishing peace. NATO has threatened to carry out air strikes on the Serbian heavy weapons around Sarajevo if they are not withdrawn or put under UN supervision by 21 February. The German UN ambassador referred to the latest massacre of innocent civilians in Sarajevo. "These crimes must stop," Rantzau demanded. Germany has made every effort to alleviate the suffering of the victims. Almost 400,000 refugees have found refuge in Germany, which is twice as many as in all other European countries together. According to Rantzau, German humanitarian aid amounts to 612 million marks. It is unacceptable that the relief convoys are constantly hindered and helpers are threatened and attacked. According to the UN ambassador, the Federal Government advocates a territorial solution, which ensures the physical and political survival of the Muslims as a nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This implies, above all, a "satisfactory territorial solution," including access to the Sava river and to the sea. The town of Mostar should be put under the administration of the European Union. The German Government has offered to provide an administrator for Mostar. The UN ambassador noted that Bonn supports further close cooperation between the United Nations and the European Union. The German government also welcomes an "active, strong role" by the United States. Russian support of the peace efforts will be of great importance. The peace negotiations in Geneva will be continued. They cannot be successful without the political will of the three parties to the conflict. One cannot find a political solution against their will. Germany will provide as much support as possible toward the efforts for peace and stability, the ambassador added.
