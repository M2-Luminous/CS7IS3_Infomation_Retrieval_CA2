FBIS4-37413 "drnes119_g_94002" FBIS-NES-94-119 Daily Report 19 Jun 1994 Sudan Foreign Minister on U.S. Relations, Hala'ib Foreign Minister on U.S. Relations, Hala'ib JN1906095294 Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic 19 Jun 94 p 24 JN1906095294 Amman AL-DUSTUR Arabic BFN [Report by Muhammad Dalbah] [Text] Tunis -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih has ruled out his country's participation in the multilateral talks at the present time. In an interview with AL-DUSTUR while attending the 30th Organization of African Unity [OAU] summit, the Sudanese foreign minister said that Israel is supplying the rebel movement in southern Sudan with weapons. He said: We call for ending foreign interference. He added: How can you ask me to hold negotiations with you while you stab me in the back and harm me? He said: If there is a genuine approach to peace and noninterference in the affairs of others, and if there is to be coexistence, then all causes for harm, war, and sedition must be eliminated. Only then, can we hold dialogue within a political body of scholars, intellectuals, and others. Until then, it is impossible to think about that. On the southern Sudanese problem and the rebellion led by John Garang, he said that foreign assistance comes from across the Sudanese-Ugandan border where he has a very narrow strip of a few km long. There are contacts with Uganda on not having any party carry out actions that harm the other party, or offering any kind of services that facilitate the passage of weapons or other things. This will help expedite the attainment of peace. On the relationship with the United States in light of the visit by U.S. Envoy Melissa Wells to Khartoum, Abu-Salih said that at one time the West, in general, was prejudiced against the present Sudanese government. He said: I believe that this was the result of false information. He added: Our people have never wished to antagonize the West and have never boycotted it. Our people believe that there should be many fields of cooperation with the West such as cooperaton in development, economy, science and technology, and other fields. We refuse any kind of high-handed approach, domination, or interference in Sudan's domestic affairs. In view of the misleading information, the West, at one time, adopted a pressurizing stand toward Sudan by not holding any talks or dialogue with the Sudanese government in order to remove it. Abu-Salih accused the British government of giving the United States an erroneous picture about Sudan. He said: The United Kingdom did a lot to spread rumors and disseminate misleading information that distorted Sudan's image and portrayed Sudan in a bad light. That's why the dialogue with the Americans is aimed at giving a true picture about Sudan in terms of its cooperation with others. Abu-Salih said that dialogue was initiated following the visit by the U.S. UN Envoy Madeleine Albright to Khartoum earlier this year. This means that there is someone who is now willing to listen. The mere holding of a serious dialogue makes us hopful of reaching some formula for cooperation with a major country like the United States. Abu-Salih said he believes the pressure the United States and the West used to put on Sudan had to do with Sudan's stand on the Arab- Israeli conflict. He said: I will speak frankly. The Americans used to believe that we would lead the Arab and Islamic opposition, and all those who oppose a settlement with the Israelis. That's why they placed us on the terrorist list. Abu-Salih said that Albright emerged from her visit with a good impression. He said Albright discussed with Sudanese officials her belief that Sudan harbors terrorism. We told her that all these accusations are baseless. This impression can only be enhanced through further dialogue, contacts, and visits. Abu-Salih said: The Sudanese, by nature, are against terrorism. We can wage war against you, but we will never harm innocent people. Abu-Salih added: The Americans used to think that the camps that we have for training the popular defense to support the Sudanese Army were camps for training foreigners to destabilize other countries. Abu-Salih said his government challenges anyone to prove that a single foreigner was trained in Sudan. We are hurt when others interfere in our affairs. Therefore, we do not interfere in the affairs of others. He referred, in this context, to the relationship with Iran. He said the United States and other Western and non-Western nations speak about Sudan as if it were under Iranian control or a base for Iran. This is not true. Our relationship with Iran is similar to our relationship with any Western country, and that is all. However, it is totally untrue to say that Sudan is under the control of Iran or in the grip of Iran. Perhaps, I would not be revealing a secret if I said that our relationship with Iran was sometimes weaker than our relationship with some Western nations and that our cooperation with some Western nations was greater than that with Iran. Abu-Salih added: The visits of Albright and then Melissa Wells represent the beginning of dialogue between us and the Americans. The visits were made at a time when we asked the neighboring states, such as Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia, to observe the implementation of peace. Of course, we consult with the U.S. ambassador in Khartoum and with the neighboring states to achieve this purpose. He added that he had asked the Americans about how to come up with a realistic formula for unity in Sudan that can be protected and maintained and how to please all Sudanese within the context of equality, sovereignty, justice, and no discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, and tribal affiliation. He said: In order to reach this formula, we have made many concessions. This is why we asked for not using the terms secular and nonsecular. We are about to prepare our document on sharing of power and resources and providing everything for the citizens to ensure success. Abu-Salih explained that Sudan had asked the Americans to benefit from their experts regarding the federal system and to give Sudan a plan and a model to enable it to arrive at this formula in a multilingual, multiracial Sudan. We want to maintain the Sudanese identity and we want citizenship to be the basis of participation. However, the movement that is led by Garang, which is linked to foreign powers, does not wish to see a solution through. On the relationship with Egypt in light of the dispute over the Hala'ib region, the Sudanese foreign minister said the relationship should be distinguished and integral, even a relationship of unity. However, this cannot be achieved without removing the differences between the two countries. He said there are three issues that should be addressed: The first has to do with Egypt's occupation of Hala'ib. The Egyptians do not like to talk about this issue. We are talking about a triangle and this means a piece of land. However, the Egyptians are talking about parallel 22, which is not an expanse of land. The area of Hala'ib amounts to 36,000 square km. According to the Sudanese foreign minister, Hala'ib is Sudanese land because there are Sudanese tribes in it that use a non-Arabic language. No one in Egypt speaks any language other than Arabic. Hala'ib is also considered a Sudanese electoral constituency. They told us that they plan to have two constituencies at Hala'ib. However, Egyptian legislators and lawmen talk about the annexation of Hala'ib. This means Hala'ib is a usurped piece of Sudan. Had it been Egyptian territory, it would have been part of Egyptian constituencies a long time ago. The question of Hala'ib was raised in 1958, but the late Egyptian President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir froze the issue at the time after showing understanding of the situation and withdrawing the Egyptian troops. Abu-Salih revealed that the Egyptian military presence in Hala'ib had taken place with Sudan's approval as Sudan has given Egypt 10 observation posts there, and that the Egyptians are now occupying these 10 posts. Abu-Salih stressed that Sudan accepts any Arab mediation or arbitration, or the referral of the issue to the International Court of Justice because we have a right to that area. Sudan is not made up of Hala'ib only. Sudan's area is around 1 million square miles. But what has pained us is that Hala'ib has been taken by force. We are against such a method and this issue must be settled. He said he changed his mind about submitting the Hala'ib issue for discussion at the OAU summit after some African countries advised him that it would be better if other parties do not intervene between Sudan and Egypt. He said: We withdrew the issue but insisted that there should be negotiations and a solution, and that Hala'ib is Sudanese. Abu-Salih said that following the meeting between Egyptian President Husni Mubarak and his Sudanese counterpart 'Umar al- Bashir, the two countries' foreign ministers were charged with studying the issue and proposing a solution. He said that he went to Egypt seven times to discuss the issue with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, who, as yet, has not paid a single visit to Sudan. He stressed that, for sure, this issue is one of occupation. We do not want to exacerbate the situation. But, like so many others, we do not want to keep Hala'ib under occupation. The Hala'ib issue might lead to many things. It may bring about war. However, he said that both parties act in a calm manner although there are Egyptian and Sudanese troops in the area. Abu-Salih said: The second issue deals with the Sudanese opposition. The Egyptians say that Egypt is the mother of all and that they cannot refuse any demand. However, Abu-Salih said that this does not mean that everyone should be given the right to write in the opposition press, participate in its actvities, or finance it. He said that this issue in Egyptian-Sudanese relations is a secondary issue. The Sudanese minister said that the third and very important issue is that of trust between Egypt and Sudan. Abu-Salih stressed that there is no trust between the two sides. Egypt does not trust the ruling regime in Sudan and says that it is a regime which represents the Islamic National Front. We also do not trust them. Abu-Salih said that had it not been for the Sudanese people's support for the ideas and concepts of the present regime in Sudan, which have been discussed in more than 25 conferences on political, social, peace, and economic issues, the present regime in Sudan would not have remained in power. Abu-Salih sharply criticized they way in which Cairo deals with the regime in Sudan. They say that this is al-Turabi's government or the regime of Hasan al-Turabi, and speak only about Egypt's interests, Egypt's history, and Egyptian sacrifices. This means they do not trust us, and we also do not trust them. Had they wanted relations to retun to normal, they would have exchanged visits with us. They want us to hold discussions and dialogue with them but they refuse to have such discussions in Khartoum or in any other Arab or nonArab country? They do not want to discuss things with us. He said: There is no doubt that Egyptian officials are under the illusion that the Sudanese government might collapse at any moment. They will deal with the government on which they can impose their will. But, we say that our government is there to stay and will fight. This also means that there will be rivers of blood if this government does not fall.
