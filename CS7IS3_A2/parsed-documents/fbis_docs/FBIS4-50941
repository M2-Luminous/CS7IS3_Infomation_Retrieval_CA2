During the meeting, Zhang Zhen said: Taiwan has always been a part of China, and we do not allow the pursuit of "Taiwan independence" or the so-called "one China, one Taiwan." Any attempt to achieve "Taiwan independence" or "one China, one Taiwan" will fail. During their cordial talks, General Zhang Zhen expressed his appreciation of Cote d'Ivoire's one-China policy, namely that it only recognizes the PRC Government as the sole legitimate government representing China. Zhang Zhen pointed out that all disputes should be resolved through friendly negotiations. Zhang Zhen stressed that the Chinese Army is the people's army, which always serves the people's interests, and that China's national defense policy is of a defensive nature and is absolutely for self-defense. He added that the assertion of the so-called "China threat" spread by some Western people is groundless. The general hoped for the continuous development of the friendly relations between the two countries and the two countries' armed forces. Among those present at the meeting were General Chi Haotian, state councilor and defense minister; and Lt. General Li Jing, deputy chief of staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
