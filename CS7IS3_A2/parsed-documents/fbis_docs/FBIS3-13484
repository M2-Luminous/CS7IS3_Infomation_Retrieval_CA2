The chairman of the PNCB has been removed from his current post and appointed as an officer on special duty, while Major Salahuddin Ghazi, the director general of the Antinarcotics Task Force, has been temporarily appointed as chairman of the PNCB [sentence as published]. In view of the large funds provided to the PNCB and wide powers given to it, one would have rightly expected that the board would play a very important role in checking smuggling and growth of narcotics menace. The PNCB has not only miserably failed in achieving the targets and objectives, but some of its officials have also been found to be involved in narcotics trade. Several domestic and foreign agencies have vehemently criticized its performance. Under these circumstances, even the general public was questioning the justification for the continued existence of the PNCB in view of its miserable performance despite such a formidable amount of money invested in it. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has taken an important step by disbanding the PNCB, which was an inevitable step in the interest of the nation and the country. However, the new task force set up to control narcotics smuggling needs to be made so effective that its solid performance in eliminating the drug smuggling should by itself become visible to the public. A close watch should also be kept on the officials of the task force, so that they remain free of all the shortcomings, weaknesses, and corruptions that led to the dissolution of the Pakistan Narcotics Control Board.
