In a statement issued on the Cyprus issue, Mrs. Papariga maintained that the United States, Britain, and Turkey are not interested in a specific way out of the problem. She noted: It is more to their benefit that Cyprus remain as it is, with a sort of a de facto partition, so they can intervene for their own interests in the region. Mrs. Papariga stressed that what we need in Greece today is pressure on the government to change its direction on the Cyprus issue. Commenting on Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's meetings in the United States on the Cyprus issue, Mrs. Papariga said: Alas, if we stay with President Clinton's assurances, particularly when we know his more general [words indistinct] role in the Balkans.
