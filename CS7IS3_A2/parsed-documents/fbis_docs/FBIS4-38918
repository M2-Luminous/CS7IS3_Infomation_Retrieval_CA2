The tension has worsened because Azerbaijan's military units continue to fire on the Armenian defense positions on various parts of NKR's front line. The enemy side violates the agreement for a cease-fire from time to time. Obviously, Azerbaijan's Military Command Headquarters is unable to control all of its military forces. The Armenian positions in [place-name indistinct], Tauz, and Lernak in Mardakertskiy Rayon; Shuraabad, [place-name indistinct], and Gyullyudzha in Agdamskiy Rayon; and Karakhanbeyli in Fizulinskiy Rayon were fired on with various types of arms today. The Armenian side refrained from returning the fire. Considering Azerbaijan failed to sign the agreement in Moscow to end the confrontation, the NKR Defense Army is convinced that enemy units will launch a wide-scale attack very soon. Undoubtedly, that will be disastrous for Azerbaijan. Furthermore, the international community will realize that Azerbaijan's leaders and nationalist circles wish to deliberately worsen the situation in the region. [passage omitted] No serious incidents occurred on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan until this afternoon. That has been the case for the past few days. We wish to hope that the relatively peaceful situation will continue to exist and [words indistinct].
