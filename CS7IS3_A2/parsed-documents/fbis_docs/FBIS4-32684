Ilic: "Claws of the Turkish Beys"] [Text] Over the last 10 years and especially since the disintegration of the SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], southeast Serbia has lived in a tense and unpleasant shadow of the frantic Islamization of the neighboring Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. This is an assessment that can be heard ever more frequently in this region and also in the reports of the leading international agencies. In the last three years Turkey has been acting more and more aggressively toward Macedonia, taking advantage of its poor economic position and the blockade from the south. The aim is to conquer the territories in the south Balkans that the Ottoman Empire lost some 70 years ago, correspondents of REUTER and the French papers write from Skopje. According to these papers, the finale of the Turkish plan is to build a railroad to Albania through Macedonia, which would close the "green" circle around Serbia and open the possibility of a military-transport route toward Kosovo, Raska, and Montenegro. It is also rumored that businessmen from Ankara and Istanbul are offering $200 million in nonrepayable investments to the FYROM Government to see "the Islam Express" roaring down the Macedonian railroad tracks in six months' time. All this envisages Skopje's meek consent to the realization of this project because this former Yugoslav republic is, due to the big credits it took from Turkey during the time of gaining its independence, financially and politically incapable of resisting this demand. The national parties in FYROM admit that the Turkish beys have with this bought the tacit approval of the Macedonian officials, whom they have grasped in their claws for a long time. They have even managed to secure a 24-hour Turkish language television program in the middle of Macedonia as well as renovation and revival of the Turkish schools in Western Macedonia, where the majority of children do not speak the language of sultans at all. By 2005 the Muslim population is expected to form the majority population in Macedonia. There are more pupils of the Islamic denomination in the first grades of primary schools than of other denomination now, the statisticians and those well acquainted with the situation in FYROM claim. Behind all this, naturally, lies a question: Will Turkey, with a demographic explosion of the Islamic population via our southern neighbor, try to recapture what it lost in the Balkan wars and will it, with the railroad, by the end of the year be knocking on the doors of southeast Serbia, too? "It is realistic to expect something of the kind. For the Turks have never overcome their loss of the Balkans. They have left sizable traces here and we can thus expect first the attacks of their propaganda and then of the remaining state 'machinery,' concretely in Toplica and the region around Vranje, Pirot, Leskovac, and Nis, where numerous geographical localities are still registered under their [Turkish] names," Prokuplje historian Bozidar Cevori says. According to him, history knows of cases of rapprochement of the Turks, the Albanians, the Sandzaklians [the residents of Sandzak], and the Turkicized Montenegrins with the aim of Islamizing the southeast and other parts of Serbia. Here, the construction of the railroad through Macedonia could give fresh impetus to the realization of Allah's ideas. The pretensions of the Turkish beys and landowners should evidently not be taken lightly as [Bosnia- Herzegovina President] Alija Izetbegovic himself has announced that this is part of the long-term plan of the resettlement of approximately 4 million Muslims from Turkey in the homes of their grandfathers and great-grandfathers.
