The regulations require all foreign exchange receipts--except those held by foreign-funded enterprises and domestic individuals-- to be sold to designated banks. Foreign loans and foreign exchange for debt repayment must also be handled by the banks. If foreign exchange is needed for import, export and other purposes, it can be purchased at the banks. The regulations, which take effect on April 1, are aimed at consolidating the country's foreign exchange in the banks to ensure sufficient supplies for converting renmenbi under current accounts. The official reaffirmed that the country will keep the foreign- exchange swap market, where foreign funded ventures can continue to buy and sell their foreign exchange instead of at the banks.
