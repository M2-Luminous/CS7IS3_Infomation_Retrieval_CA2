ACTION: Notice of deletion of the Monroe Township Landfill Superfund Site from the National Priorities List (NPL). SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region II announces the deletion of the Monroe Township Landfill Superfund site in Middlesex County, New Jersey from the National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL is appendix B of 40 CFR part 300, the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated pursuant to section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended. EPA and the State of New Jersey have determined that all appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented and that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate. Moreover, EPA and the State of New Jersey have determined that remedial actions conducted at the site to date remain protective of public health, welfare, and the environment. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 3, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. John Osolin, Remedial Project Manager, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region II, 26 Federal Plaza, room 747, New York, New York 10278, (212) 264&hyph;9301. ADDRESSES: Comprehensive information on this site is available only at the following addresses: Monroe Township Municipal Complex, Perrinville Road Jamesburg, NJ 08831, Phone: (908) 521&hyph;4400. Jamesburg Public Library, 229 Gatzmer Road, Jamesburg, NJ 08831, Phone (908) 521&hyph;0440. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The site to be deleted from the NPL is: Monroe Township Landfill Site in Middlesex County, New Jersey. A notice of itent to delete for this site was published December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63551). The closing date for comments on the notice of intent to delete was January 3, 1994. EPA received no comments and therefore has not prepared a Responsiveness Summary. The EPA identifies sites which appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and it maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund (Fund)&hyph;financed remedial actions. Section 300.425(e)(3) of the NCP states that Fund-financed actions may be taken at sites deleted from the NPL in the unlikely event that conditions at the site warrant such action. Deletion of a site from the NPL does not affect responsible party liability or impede agency efforts to recover costs associated with response efforts.
