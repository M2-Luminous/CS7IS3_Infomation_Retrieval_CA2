Supposedly, the Constitution must be respected. Therefore, this system should already have been implemented -- as established by the Constitution itself -- and planning, organization, and execution of the electoral processes, referendum, or other type of consultations begun, as well as the maintenance and custody of a single registry of the peoples' identity and a registry of acts that modify people's civil status. It all looks great in theory but in practice we find that we are in the wake of an electoral process -- nothing less than presidential and congressional elections -- and there is not enough time left to implement this entire mechanism. What can be done about it? Fulfill the terms of the Constitution word for word as some maintain, although this may entail that in the end -- now that election day is almost here -- one component or another of the electoral system will not function? Or should we, as others propose, amend the new Constitution not more than three months after it was promulgated to temporarily suspend the enforcement of the new electoral system and thus let the National Electoral Board be in charge of the next elections? This, too, entails many risks. What would happen if the Constitution Committee were to approve the proposed constitutional amendment but the plenum were to reject it. If there is little time left now, as of April -- which is when the issue will be debated -- there will be even less time. But supposing the plenum approves it, this constitutional reform would have to be submitted to a referendum -- under what system? -- if it is not sanctioned in two successive ordinary sessions with a favorable vote, in each case, more than two-thirds of the legal number of congressmen. Neither alternative seems the most convenient or feasible. The thing then would be to find a solution within the Constitution. This solution is in a very brief final and transitory article, the 11th, that states: "Constitutional provisions that demand new and greater public expenditures will be applied progressively." Won't the establishment of the Electoral Process National Office and the Identification and Civil Status Office demand "new and greater public expenditures?" If the answer is yes, then there will be no other choice than -- as the Constitution itself says -- to interpret (one of the power's Congress has) the law in order to establish that these two components of the new electoral system be "progressively" established after the 1995 elections. In the meantime, the National Electoral Board would be responsible for the development of the presidential and parliamentarian elections. Another final and transitory article, the 10th, states: "The law establishes how the offices, officials, and servants of the Civil Status Registry of local government and of the Electoral Registry will be incorporated into the Identity and Civil Status National Registry." Well, all we need is a law stating that this step should take place after the next elections. These are two other subjects that legislators and Constituent Assembly members can discuss.
