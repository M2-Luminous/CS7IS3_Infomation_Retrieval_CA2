First Deputy Chairman of the Ukrainian State Committee on Nuclear Power Nur Nigmatullin told Interfax-Ukraine that the document was supposed to be supplemented by inter-governmental agreements. "They have been drafted and are under discussion but the deliveries will not arrive until the agreements are signed," Nigmatullin explained. The fuel will be supplied at a price of $600,000 to $700,000 per fuel element for VVER-1000 reactors as compensation for warheads that will be sent to Russia for destruction. The Ukrainian nuclear power stations need 550 elements a year. Nigmatullin said that the fuel supplied as compensation will last three to four years. "At the moment the Ukrainian nuclear power stations have a supply of fuel until May of June 1994," he added.
