Provocations with small arms on most lines of the front in the zone operations of the 5th Corps and the General Command of the Croatian Defense Council of this region, and sporadic treacherous and indiscriminate shelling mark the last 24 hours. The chetniks shelled the outskirts of Cazin last night. In this way they directly supported members of the Abdic's traitor paramilitary army, who have been launching attacks with anti-aircraft and anti-armor weapons on all lines of separation throughout this period. In the broad area around Pecigrad they tried to penetrate our lines with infantry and infiltrate subversive-terrorist groups.
