Muslims have so far failed to observe any of the existing cease- fire agreements, the Herzegovina corps command said, adding that Muslims will probably try to take advantage of the deployment of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in the area of Gorazde to provoke the Serbs and to accuse them of attacking the force of the international community. The most intense fire is coming from the center of the town. Muslims are using mortars, anti-aircraft weapons, and snipers, the Herzegovina corps command insists. Despite orders from its high command, the Serbian side has been forced to respond to the Muslim attacks. The Herzegovina corps command insists that there is no truth in the Muslim claims that Serbian fighters have been pounding the Gorazde urban area with artillery weapons. Late yesterday afternoon, NATO planes overflew Serbian positions on the Gorazde front but at permitted altitude and did not engage in any combat activity.
