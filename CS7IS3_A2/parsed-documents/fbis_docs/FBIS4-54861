The sample (1,287 respondents) was formed so as to correspond to the composition of the adult population of the Slovak Republic in terms of sex, age, nationality, level of education, size of community of residence, and region. The data acquired in the research suggests that citizens' interest in participating in the early parliamentary elections increased during the past month. Whereas in March 72 percent of eligible voters said that they would definitely or probably participate in the elections, their proportion in April was 76 percent. The greatest difference between individual regions of Slovakia as regards participation in the elections is between Central Slovakia, where 74 percent of those questioned said that they would definitely or probably participate in the elections to the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR], and Bratislava, where 86 percent of respondents declared their interest in going to the polls. Asked which political party or movement they would vote for, those adult citizens of Slovakia who would definitely or probably participate in the elections replied most frequently that they would cast their vote for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. The most striking changes compared with the preelection situation in early March concern precisely this movement, which has strengthened its leading position since the last poll. At the same time, it increased its lead over the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], which holds second place in the distribution of current electoral preferences. Differences among individual regions of Slovakia regarding the estimated electoral gains of relevant political forces are not statistically significant in the case of the SDL, the Alternative of Political Realism [APR], the Slovak National Party [SNS], the Democratic Party [DS], and the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia [SDSS]. As far as the HZDS is concerned, support for the movement in Central Slovakia is higher than in all other regions. Characteristic of the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] over the long term is its relatively numerous electoral base in East Slovakia. In view of the fact that approximately two-thirds of citizens declaring themselves of Hungarian nationality will give their votes to Hungarian political parties, the estimated electoral results of the coalition partners Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] and Coexistence in individual regions of the Slovak Republic depend to a decisive degree on the representation of ethnic Hungarians in the region in question. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |March 1994 |April 1994 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |HZDS |24 |32 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |SDL |14 |13 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |KDH |8 |8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Coexistence/MKDH |9 |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |APR |-- |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |SNS |5 |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |DS |4 |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |SDSS |2 |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Green Party of Slovakia |3 |2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Association of Workers o-|-- |2 | |f Slovakia | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Alliance of Democrats |3 |2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |National Democratic Part-|-- |2 | |y-New Alternative [NDS-N-| | | |A] | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other parties |15 |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Do not know for whom the-|13 |12 | |y will vote | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Note: Data in percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: SU SR--Public Opinion Research | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Electoral preferences are cited only for those political entities that would receive in April at least 1.5 percent of the vote of adult citizens of the Slovak Republic who are either determined to vote or will probably vote. The APR and the NDS-NA did not operate as independent political entities at the time of the March poll (2-10 March), while the Association of Workers of Slovakia had not yet declared itself a political entity.
