"My government was created last May to deal with a difficult phase of transition," Ciampi said during a press conference held after a meeting with Austrian Chancelor Franz Vranitzky. "The decision to hold new elections (27-28 March) puts an end to this transitional period and I have no intention of being a candidate during the elections." Ciampi has been running a caretaker government since the dissolution of parliament earlier this month. His decision not to run in the elections comes as Italy's political parties are trying to forge alliances ahead of the elections. Left-wing parties had been looking to Ciampi as their possible candidate for the post of prime minister.
