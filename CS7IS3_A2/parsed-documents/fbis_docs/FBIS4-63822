At the same time it was proposed to start drawing up a broad program of cooperation between Russia and NATO that would be based on these parameters and to sign the outline document as soon as this program is ready. In the political sphere, Russia proposes the creation of an effective mechanism of mutual consultations on the entire range of problems of European and world security, which would operate both on a regular basis and in emergencies. Such a mechanism would be a practical step on the way to the formation of a long-term system of collective security and stability in Europe under the aegis of the CSCE. In the military sphere, Russia is ready to develop cooperation with NATO and partners in such areas as coordinating joint military activities, peace-keeping, transparency in military planning and military activities, and personnel training. It also expects to establish partnership relations in other areas, such as disarmament and arms control, conversion, nonproliferation of mass destruction weapons, and protection of the environment.
