The Palestinian News Agency WAFA said 'Arafat and Anderson discussed the latest developments in the Middle East peace process, especially the Palestinian National Authority's takeover of its tasks in the Palestinian land. The discussion also dealt with the Palestinian Authority's responsibility for reconstructing Palestine and the international community's responsibility to help in this task. The Palestinian News Agency said the head of the Scandinavian Countries Council expressed his support for the Palestinian National Authority with all means to enable it to implement its tasks. Informed sources here expressed their belief that announcing this meeting, which might have taken place in 'Arafat's home, aims to counter reports on the seriousness of 'Arafat's illness. Informed Palestinian sources affirmed that a suite has been booked for 'Arafat at the Medical City in Jordan and that 'Arafat will be moved there in the next few days for treatment and necessary medical tests. It was announced yesterday that 'Arafat had suffered a severe ailment that kept him at home and halted his activities.
