In addition, the Government of Azerbijan or any of its instrumentalities will have no control in the actual selection of participants. Fellows are identified through a merit-based, open competition and a rigorous selection process implemented by ACTR/ACCELS, IIE, IREX, and the Soros Foundation, in conjunction with USIA, professional associations, and U.S. faculty from the four academic fields. Semi-finalists in all disciplines will take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Candidates for degree programs in business administration will take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), and candidates for degree programs in economics will take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Candidates for the law program must have an undergraduate law degree from their home country. Fellows are matched with universities by selection committees composed of graduate admissions officers and faculty in the appropriate disciplines. Placements are determined according to Fellows' academic interests and needs. Fellows may not choose their own academic placements.
