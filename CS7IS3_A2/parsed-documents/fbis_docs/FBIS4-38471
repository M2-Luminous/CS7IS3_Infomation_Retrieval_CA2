At the alliance's headquarters in Brussels on Friday the republic's Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev put his signature to the program's framework document. Kazakhstan's embassy in Brussels noted that the republic was the second nuclear state, after Ukraine, to give official support to the initiative put forward by the NATO countries' heads of states and governments. This has taken place soon after Kazakhstan's accession to the treaty on the non- proliferation of nuclear weapons and this, Almaty believes, is clear confirmation of Kazakhstan's firm political desire to strengthen international security and stability. Speaking at the signing ceremony, K.Saudabayev expressed the hope that the implementation of the Partnership for Peace concept would make it possible to rule out the emergence of any grounds for new confrontation after the ending of the Cold War, would create real possibilities for a smooth transition to an atmosphere of stability, mutual trust and cooperation throughout the world and would ensure firm guarantees for the security and territorial integrity of Kazakhstan. Acceding to this initiate, he stressed, opens up before the republic broad prospects for military-political, economic and technical cooperation with NATO in the sphere of setting up a modern army in accord with democratic principles and world standards, for conversion of the defense industry and for participation in peacekeeping operations under UN aegis. The minister said that the importance of Kazakhstan's accession to this program is that it contains a stimulus for the further development of economic reforms, transition to a market economy and the construction of a law-based democratic state. Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister had a conversation with Sergio Balanzino, NATO Deputy Secretary General.
