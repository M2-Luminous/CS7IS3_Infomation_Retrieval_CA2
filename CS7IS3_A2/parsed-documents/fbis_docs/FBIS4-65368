It was decided to shut down the second unit of the nuclear power station when a leak was discovered in the reactor's cooling circuit. Slightly radioactive evaporating water is dripping through the cooling circuit's valve casing. The valve cannot be separated and repaired while the power station is running so the unit will be frozen for the duration of repairs on the valve. The leak was discovered in the early hours of this morning when the station's operators noticed that the insulation in the valve casing had become moist. The Center for Radiation and Nuclear Safety was informed of the fault in the morning. The reason for the leak is not known.
