The symposium was attended by representatives from several Central China provinces; Chen Yaobang, State Planning Commission vice minister; and Wang Shengtie, provincial party committee standing committee member and provincial vice governor. Chen Yaobang and Wang Shengtie delivered speeches at the symposium. The symposium concluded: Central China possesses boundless economic development potential. At the symposium, representatives from Hunan Province, Hubei Province, Henan Province, Anhui Province, Jiangxi Province, and Wuhan City joined economic experts from the State Council Development Research Center, the Chang Jiang Water Conservancy Commission, the State Planning Commission, and other state departments concerned in exploring and discussing a new Central China development strategy. The symposium participants held: The five Central China provinces have always been China's key agricultural commodities production bases and have been rich in energy resources, raw and processed goods and materials, labor resources, and advanced and convenient communications systems as well, thus being of strategic importance to the country's economic development. Exploitation and opening up of Central China will be an inevitable result of China's coastal opening up. The exploitation and opening up of Central China will not only provide the country's industrialization with an important guarantee but also promote rejuvenation and development of the country's hinterland, thereby enhancing the country's national economic reserve strength. The symposium participants maintained: Located in the middle and lower reaches of the Chang Jiang and along the Chang Jiang, Hubei should strive to firmly seize the excellent opportunity at the moment to learn from Shanghai's Pudong by simultaneously opening up to the outside world and domestic regions and simultaneously making full use of foreign and domestic resources; open up more overseas and domestic markets; expeditiously carry out multilevel, multichannel, and omnidirectional opening up; encourage areas where conditions allow to develop faster and relatively prosperous areas to assist relatively backward areas; bring into full play the radiation role of each and every key city and key development zone; energetically develop a regional economy; speed up regional industrial structural readjustment; and further improve regional economic quality with an eye to pressing ahead with the economic development of the entire Chang Jiang Valley. The symposium also disclosed: The state will this year draw up a regional economic development plan aimed at boosting the economic development of Hubei Province, Henan Province, Hunan Province, Jiangxi Province, and Anhui Province.
