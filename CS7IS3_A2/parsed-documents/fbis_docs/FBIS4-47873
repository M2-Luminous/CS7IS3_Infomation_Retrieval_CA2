FBIS4-47873 "drafr087_c_94026" FBIS-AFR-94-087 Daily Report 5 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Orange Free State's Patrick Lekota Orange Free State's Patrick Lekota MB0505102294 Johannesburg SAPA in English 0849 GMT 5 May 94 MB0505102294 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Bloemfontein May 5 SAPA -- A linguist and rugby fan, the Orange Free State's new premier Patrick "Terror" Lekota this week launched his regional leadership with an emphasis on economic development and racial reconciliation. A veteran African National Congress leader who served 13 years in prison, Lekota, 45, is believed to enjoy fairly wide acceptance among whites in the Free State, a region the ANC won with an electoral landslide. "He is an accepted Freestater. I think whites trust and respect him," said University of the Orange Free State [UOFS] political science head, Prof Daan Wessels. Lekota tells of his hurt over the lack of understanding between black and white, and of a deep desire for racial harmony in the Free State, which he says is the region best suited for reconciliation. He speaks English, Afrikaans, Zulu, Sesotho, Tswana and Xhosa, and wants everyone to learn each other's language to foster mutual understanding and cross cultural bridges. Fluent in Afrikaans, he sees "die taal" [Afrikaans] as an important part of SA [South African] history which should not be lost. And he wants the provincial rugby side to win the Curry Cup at least every five years, hoping his plans to develop the Free State economy will keep its best players from leaving for greener pastures. "He is a level headed guy who will be able to attend to all the different communities in this region," said Hennie Strydom, professor of international law at UOFS. A white policeman saluted Lekota this week when he visited the new provincial legislature in the historic fourth raadsaal, and the Free State's first black leader was first to complain about the removal of the busts of SA's former white rulers. He is said to be embarrassed about the nickname "Terror", which comes not from a violent past but a schoolteacher who admired the way he terrorised the defence on the soccer field. There is no bitterness or embarrassment about time spent in prison, almost a third of his life, which he describes as a duty. "I am in prison for the sake of peace for our country," he once wrote in a letter to his daughter. Born on 13 August 1948 on a farm near Senekal, the eldest of seven children, the young Lekota was raised by his grandfather before moving to Kroonstad aged 11 to join his migrant worker parents. He was sent by his father to a Catholic high school in Matatiele, Transkei, later matriculating at St Francis College in Durban where he came into contact with influential anti-apartheid activists like the late Black Consciousness leader Steve Biko. He worked as a teacher and court interpreter after school to raise money for further studies, and with help from the Catholic Church enrolled in 1971 to study social work at the University of the North, where he was elected to the students representative council. In 1972 Lekota was barred from further study following a class boycott over the expulsion of an SA Students' Organisation (SASO) leader, and he returned to Durban to become national organiser of SASO. Charged under the Terrorism Act in September 1974 for organising pro-Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] rallies to celebrate Mozambican independence, he was sentenced to six years on Robben Island, his first of several spells in prison and detention. Like many Black Consciousness adherents, Lekota's experiences with ANC leaders on the island saw him shift towards non-racialism. He was released at the end of 1982 and the next year elected national publicity secretary for the United Democratic Front [UDF]. Lekota was detained in 1984 before the tricameral parliamentary elections, which the UDF opposed, and in 1985 charged with high treason for his alleged role in civil disturbances and rent boycotts in the Vaal Triangle. The ensuing 42-month Delmas treason trial landed him back on Robben Island in December 1988, but he returned triumphant a year later after his 12-year sentence was overturned on appeal. The unbanning of the ANC in 1990 saw Lekota appointed its convenor for southern Natal and later that year as northern Free State organiser. He was elected to the ANC's National Executive Committee in July 1991 and subsequently to its National Working Committee where he headed the Intelligence Department, and the ANC's elections commission from mid-1992. Lekota married a Zulu woman, Cynthia Shange, while in Pretoria Central Prison in 1975, and has four children ranging from three to 19 years old.
