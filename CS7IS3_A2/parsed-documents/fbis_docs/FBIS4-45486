Allegations that pupils are turning to crime and prostitution to pay for experimentation or to finance addiction will be voiced by members of the National Association of Head Teachers meeting in Eastbourne. A recent study in the Northwest indicated that six in 10 14- and 15-year-olds had the opportunity to try drugs, and there is increasing concern that primary schoolchildren are becoming involved. The plea for a co-ordinated campaign of education about drugs and measures to combat their illicit trade among children coincides with a government review, headed by Tony Newton, Leader of the House of Commons, to clarify national policies on the issue. One source said: "There is concern we reduce to an irreducible minimum, the proportion of children taking drugs. Education [about drugs] is part of the national curriculum and the question is how effectively it can be taught in schools, who should be doing it, and in what form." Martin Saunders, a primary school headteacher from Stoke-on-Trent, said yesterday: "I have evidence of at least one child drug-dealing at the age of eight in this city. There is increasing evidence that young people are involved in crime to obtain finance to buy drugs. I have social and welfare officers talking to me about young people being involved in prostitution to pay for drugs." Mr Saunders said many heads were worried that their schools would get labeled as problem schools and lose pupils, and therefore money, if they talked openly about drugs. Drugs education experts are angry that the Department for Education last year dropped central support for health education co-ordinators. Alasdair Cant, training manager for Release, the national drug advice service, said the biggest increase in calls in the last 18 months had involved children aged 11 to 14. "We have seen them coming into drugs, not just hearing about it from older brothers or sisters, but being in a group where substances are being taken or experimenting themselves." But no overall policy meant that "in one area, one school will do one thing and another something completely different. It is confusing for parents and students." More schools are using former drug addicts to talk to children. Drug educators, including the Advisory Council on Alcohol and Drug Education, believe that teaching about illegal drugs should be closely integrated with teaching on more socially tolerated drugs. Liverpool education authority and Merseyside police last week launched a new initiative attempting to develop consistent policies, including a recommendation that all serious incidents in schools should be reported to the police. David Barrie, the city's assistant director of education, said that exclusion from school should be used only as a last resort. "We are not saying drugs are trivial. But where a young person is excluded, he or she can get into far more serious trouble." The Education Secretary, John Patten, last week decided to drop his suggestion that drug trafficking might be a reason for excluding pupils, leaving decisions to heads and governing bodies. But David Hart, general secretary of the NAHT [expansion not given], said most questions about dealing with drugs came from secondary school members, and most involved grounds for excluding pupils. "It sends a bad message to the rest of the pupil community. It says you can get away with sampling drugs or trafficking in drugs on school premises or during the school day."
