One is the run-up during which groups with low political tolerance try to intimidate one another, as well as other parties whose tradition of tolerance is perceived as weakness. This has already begun, the process already marked by events such as the Johannesburg massacre, the intensification of communal violence in kwaZulu/Natal and on the East Rand and -- on a decidedly lower key -- the breaking up of NP [National Party] and DP [Democratic Party] meetings. Next is the polling period when intimidation is likely to intensify (especially if the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] stays out of the election and the very act of voting becomes a public political statement). Confusion and panic are possible at the polling stations, where most voters have absolutely no experience of the process. Attempts to interfere with the polling process are possible, while tensions could be created by people marching in large groups to cast their vote, out of a sense of insecurity. A period of over-exuberance could threaten public order immediately after the results are made known. It would be exacerbated if the ANC should register the kind of runaway victory that could encourage some of its supporters to press for a scrapping of the power-sharing mechanisms of the interim constitution. It is possible elements of the disadvantaged classes will have totally unrealistic expectations and will stream into the suburbs to claim their houses, swimming pools and cars. And the losers could seek to give forceful expression to their rejection of the outcome. Finally, a phase of disillusioned anger is almost certain, and this could occur after the military reservists have been demobilised. Chris de Kock and Charl Schutte, of the Human Sciences Research Council, examine this question in depth in an empirical study of the question of violence over the elections. They note that posters promoting voter literacy pose the question: "Why vote?" then answer: "Education, housing, jobs and peace." They ask if the compilers are ignorant of the theory of rising expectations or whether they want to pass on a subtle message stimulating such expectations. "Whatever their reasons, there can be little doubt they are doing an elected transitional government a great disservice. Expectations of immediate gratification in terms of housing, education, work and peace are being aroused in the largest segment of the South African population." They say no transition government could meet such expectations in a short period, which will cause high levels of frustration and aggression to be exploited by enemies of the transitional government. "One should also not lose sight of the fact that the black population in particular, after a decade of ungovernability and not paying for services and alternative structures, will not recognise the authority of a transitional government that does not 'deliver the goods' overnight."
