During a meeting with the Veterans Association, Candido Palmero, first secretary of the PCC in the agricultural province of Havana, said several cases have been uncovered. Greater emphasis will be placed on those who enriched themselves at the expense of the state. Explaining the need for Decree Law 149, Palmero noted that the struggle against impunity has become a task of the people and it will not be implemented in haste. Referrring to cases of illicit enrichment already uncovered, he cited the case of a citizen whose eight different kinds of transportation and a large amount of money were confiscated. Decree Law 149, promulgated by the executive at the request of the Cuban assembly, is among the first official actions against the so-called money hoarders, individuals who outrage the citizens because of their accumulation of resources obtained in a questionable manner. The need to adopt measures against these individuals was a continuous proposal during the workers' assemblies, meetings held in all work places in the country in the early months of 1994. Palmero noted that it is the people who have complained about those who, according to Havana's newspaper TRIBUNA, "filled their coffers through speculation, theft, and shady deals."
