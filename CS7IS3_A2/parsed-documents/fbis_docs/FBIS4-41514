[Hryb] It is certainly difficult for us to maintain the sovereignty that we achieved then, especially from an economic point of view. However, which of our neighbors finds things easy? Even though all changes call for some effort, we are not going to give up our independence. [Graczyk] However, there remain increasingly fewer attributes of it. [Hryb] So far we have not lost anything -- we have our own territory, borders, and Constitution. The official language is Belarusian. In fact, we also have our own economy -- a meager and limping economy, but it is still our own, independent economy. We have already adopted a packet of sovereign legal provisions and international agreements, concerning, for example, human rights. Belarus is the first country in the world which had strategic nuclear weapons on its territory and abandoned them voluntarily. Does this not prove the sovereignty of our Republic? [Graczyk] What about the presence of Russian troops? [Hryb] It is an historical necessity; it is our historical legacy that we cannot evade. We cannot demand that our neighbor all of a sudden withdraw all of its troops. To where should it withdraw them? We have signed a bilateral agreement in which we consider this state of affairs to be only temporary. Actually, apart from the Baltic states, no one treats this issue that rigorously. We must understand Russia, which is not to blame for this situation. The CIS is, in a way, like a family which exists only thanks to the art of compromise. This also holds true for relations with our eastern neighbor. [Graczyk] What are these concessions all about? [Hryb] We agree to the dates for withdrawing troops which have been proposed by the Russians and we provide assistance in transit; the Russians sell us energy resources at lower prices. We are all but forced to use that source. Perhaps other sources will emerge in the future; however, for the time being we must live and cooperate somehow. We are realists. [Graczyk] Is this desire to be embraced by Russia dictated by common sense? This is at least how the agreement on merging the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems is interpreted. [Hryb] Signing this agreement does not at all mean a combination of the monetary systems. This would be possible only after the Supreme Council ratifies the agreement or after appropriate amendments to the Constitution are made. For the time being, nine articles of this agreement have come into force; they concern, among other things, taxes and tariffs. Personally I am an advocate of integration; however, the integration should not be achieved with such great steps. [Graczyk] What will be the next step? The military and financial steps have already been taken. [Hryb] The agreement on collective security, which was signed in Tashkent, is not a military alliance. It merely envisions cooperation between members states of the CIS in the area of armament; our Army will not survive without it. Since the arms industry of the post-Soviet states is strongly decentralized, we are practically required to cooperate with each other. For the time being, there is also no uniform ruble zone. Both in Belarus and in Russia many milieus are against this concept. However, I must concede that it would be much easier for us if we bought energy sources for instance, for the same prices as the Russians buy them. Right now they sell oil for $80 per ton, whereas they offer the same amount of oil to their own enterprises at $40. It is obvious that this affects the cost of production. Aside from that, it is first of all Russia that constitutes the market for our goods. We will not sell them in Poland or in the West. [Graczyk] The Baltic states, which until recently were also strongly tied to Russia, are facing similar problems. Even though they achieve various results, they are still trying to reform their economies. [Hryb] I do not agree with the statement that we were in a similar situation as the Baltic states. First of all, Soviet authority came to Belarus in 1917, not in 1939. This is a quite important difference. Second, our economy was more dependent on Russia and other Soviet republics. Third, after the war we did not have reserves of gold or hard-currency deposits abroad. Regretfully, it must also be noted that Western states have all along treated the Baltic states differently than they have treated us. [Graczyk] Why has Belarus not even tried to embark on a reform program? Why has it chosen to return to Russia instead? [Hryb] It is not true that we are giving up on reforms. We merely believe that haste is inadvisable in this case and that it can be very dangerous. We do not have any guarantee that if we implement reforms and destroy some branches of the economy, such as agriculture, for instance, we will find someone who will feed us on the following day. The attempts to privatize agriculture have failed in Lithuania and the land is now fallow. We believe that people who live in the countryside should themselves choose a method of working: they can be farmers, lease holders, or they can remain collective farmers. Before we destroy anything, we should build something new, and only then should we decide what is to be done with the old structures. [Graczyk] However, the privatization of agriculture is very slow and land has been leased to only 3,000 people. [Hryb] No one can be made to do anything by force. Whenever I visit collective or state farms, I ask people if any of them want to lease land from the state. No one ever does. Why? First, it is a new phenomenon; second, it is difficult; third, it yields profit only after some time. The lease holder can then only count on himself because the state, unfortunately, provides him with too little assistance. Now, on a collective farm he is guaranteed low but still sure wages and assistance from his fellow workers. [Graczyk] Many investors, including foreigners, would be interested in private activity. However, they are discouraged by the fact that no reforms are being implemented. So far less than $550 million has been invested in Belarus. [Hryb] We have already registered more than 1,000 foreign companies and joint-venture companies. Privatization is rather slow because we cannot afford the costs of restructuring. Belarus has probably the largest budget sector among all the republics of the former Soviet Union -- we maintain 2.5 million senior citizens and we subsidies to 2.2 million people who were victims of the Chernobyl catastrophe. Thus, almost half of our society is maintained by the state budget. These circumstances force us to carefully consider all contingencies before making any changes. [Graczyk] Do you not fear that the price for this caution may be, in the long run, the state's independence? [Hryb] People will always judge the government; they will compare the present living standards with the previous period. In that period their lives were undoubtedly easier. Thus, they are now beginning to blame both the government and independence for this fact. [Graczyk] Therefore, the solution to this problem is the establishment of a Belarusian-Russian confederation? [Hryb] So far the issue of political structures with Russia or other CIS states has not been discussed at all. We are only discussing economic cooperation. However, I must concede that there are also people who are dreaming about more than that and who are striving to achieve it. [Graczyk] It seems that Belarus is the only country in this part of Europe which does not believe that Russia is trying to conduct an imperial policy. [Hryb] We cannot complain about the cooperation with our eastern neighbor; we manage to successfully resolve many problems. Russia has more important tasks today than building an empire; the most important task for it is to overcome the crisis and improve the economy. [Graczyk] The Belarusian opposition claims that Minsk's decision of whether or not to join the "Partnership for Peace" depends directly on Moscow. [Hryb] We support this American idea; however, we do not conceal the fact that it needs some finishing touches. Your suggestion that we depend on Russian in this area does not correspond to the truth. The most important problem for us is first of all money. After joining the "Partnership" we would have to spend $5 million a year to implement it. This is the only reason why we have not yet signed the document. [Graczyk] Soon you will cede your powers as the head of state to the first Belarusian president. What will be -- in line with the Constitution -- the mutual relations between him, the parliament, and the government? [Hryb] These issues will be finally decided after the elections. We would like the new president to be able to take part in discussions on this subject. Along with political scientists, we are seeking to find the optimum distribution of power. We are realists, after all.
