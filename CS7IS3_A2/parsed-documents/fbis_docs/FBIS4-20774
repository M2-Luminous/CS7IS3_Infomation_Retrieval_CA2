After prolonged confrontation, the Pakistani Government and the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) chief, Mr. Amanullah Khan, have patched up. Though ideological differences over merger with Pakistan and "azadi" (freedom) remain, a tacit agreement has been arrived at between them on a policy of "non-interference." Sources said Islamabad's role in getting Mr. Khan released in Belgium (he was arrested at the instance of India) helped in arriving at the understanding. The absence of confrontation between the JKLF and the Pakistani Government in the early months of 1994, unlike in earlier years, is an expression of this compromise. Relations between the JKLF and Islamabad had soured after Pakistan began providing material and moral support to groups such as the Hizbul Mujahideen and others which favour merger (of Kashmir) with Pakistan. After the "launch" of militancy by the JKLF, Pakistani intelligence found that the group had a mind of its own and would not budge from its pro-independence stance. As a result, the JKLF was sidelined in the Kashmir valley, its supply of arms and ammunition was also cut off to the benefit of pro-Pakistani outfits which followed the "line" of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan. The JKLF then adopted an increasingly confrontationist attitude towards Islamabad. This was reflected in numerous marches to the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The killing of JKLF cadre by Pakistani security forces resulted in a hardening of its approach towards Islamabad. In fact, at one time Mr. Javed Ahmed Mir, acting chief of the JKLF in the valley, had announced that a joint struggle for independence would have to be waged against both New Delhi and Islamabad. The JKLF-Pakistani equation, punctuated with accusatory statements, has been relatively quiet this year, the sources say. With most of the "actions" against the security forces in the Kashmir Valley being carried out by groups such as the Hizbul Mujahideen, the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and the Al Barq, the striking capabilities of the JKLF have been badly affected. On the other hand, Pakistani intelligence agencies are aware that the Kashmiri sentiment is still, by and large, with the pro-independence JKLF and not with the groups propped up by it. It is these realities, the sources said, that have made the JKLF and the Pakistani Government aware of the mutual benefits of having a non-confrontationist relationship.
