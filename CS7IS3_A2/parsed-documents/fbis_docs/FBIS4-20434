The China Electronics Corporation (CEC), which covers 62 subsidiaries at home and abroad, has total assets of 7.78 billion yuan ($894 million). ``It is impossible for small enterprises to ward off the pressure from foreign competitors, who will be allowed easier access to the Chinese market after the country rejoins the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),'' said CEC President Yu Zhongyu. China is expected to be admitted to the world trade body this year. Electronics is one of its four pillar industries along with motors, machinery and construction. China began operating large-scale electronics companies in the 1980s. But none of them have had the business capacity of CEC, which is expected to generate income of 5 billion yuan ($570 million) this year. By 2000, CEC could control 45 per cent of the domestic integrated circuit market, 30 per cent of the VCR market, 15 per cent of electronics switching system and 10 per cent of cellular telephone, said Yu. Meanwhile its annual income is expected to hit 20 billion yuan ($2.29 billion). The company will focus on the development of micro-electronics and telecommunications products and gradually set up six major manufacturing and trade bases around China. The bases could change the old structure under which many small enterprises competed against each other. Top government officials fear the lack of co-ordination between domestic firms will put China's electronics market at a disadvantage against foreign rivals which will pay lower tariffs when the country rejoins GATT. China's tariff level has still to be trimmed to conform to GATT demands. Yu said, CEC would co-operate more with international companies in key sectors such as micro-electronics, telecommunications, computers and systems engineering. As Yu put it, the CEC will shoulder the construction of ten national major projects, such as the super-scale integrated circuits projects and mobile communication projects. CEC is also involved in the huge task of constructing the Three Gorges Dam. The company will soon help organize a grand exhibition of telecommunications products, which are to be chosen for the Three Gorge Dam project.
