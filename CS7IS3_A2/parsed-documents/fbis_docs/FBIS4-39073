Senic mentioned that the Turkish president has manifested his best intentions, underlining his support for the integrity and sovereignty of Moldova. In Senic's opinion, all the assertions Demirel has made will be treated only as an impulse toward mutual understanding. At the same time Senic mentioned that the deputies had already received the project of special juridical status for the Southern regions and the Socialist Unity faction supports it. We do not consider that the visit of the Turkish delegation will in any way influence the adoption of this status for President Demirel arrived after the status had already been defined stated Senic.
