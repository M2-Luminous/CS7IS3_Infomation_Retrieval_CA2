ANC Southern Natal Regional Secretary Sbu Ndebele said Monday was "a sad day for the Zulu-speaking people of South Africa", because it saw the Zulu monarch taking a "radical decision" which had not been tested by popular vote. He said King Zwelithini had singled out IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi as "God's gift to the Zulu people", which was an "inconceivable position" since royalty was not supposed to be politically aligned. "The majority of the king's subjects do not belong to the IFP. The Zulu nation is not a single, monolithic bloc united in its support for a partisan political policy," he said. The ANC was currently drafting its own proposals for the Natal provincial constitution and the monarchy would "take pride of place" in that constitution. The ANC charged that Mr Buthelezi had used the king for party political purposes, adding that the ANC would entrench the king's independence in a provincial constitution "so that his place doesn't depend on the whim of the governing party and the king will be enabled to play a unifying role to all the people". On Monday King Zwelithini told State President F W de Klerk at a meeting in Durban that acceptance of the Zulu nation, as it existed in the 1800s, was not negotiable. He said the Zulu nation was a sovereign one and could not be overruled by the interim constitution. Mr de Klerk said he did not regard the king's claims as secession and said the government would officially respond to them on Thursday.
