Diplomatic sources in Lusaka say Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola and the principal mediator of the peace talks, was able to bring the two sides' views closer on the formation of the police. The same sources said yesterday that the two sides had reached an agreement that the police will be a state administration organ. Over the past few days, Alioune Blondin Beye has held separate meetings with the two sides to bring their stands closer on the issue of the police. What now remains to be discussed are national reconciliation, the future UN role, UNITA's active participation in the government, and the second round of presidential elections. One thing is clear, though, the riot police will have to be banned. It is expected that the parties will today begin to discuss specific principles connected with the national police and its formation modalities. Regarding the riot police, there is nothing to discuss. This wing of the MPLA-PT army which Spain formed, in violation of the Bicesse Accords, will definitely be banned in the interest of peace.
