Radio Mozambique Journalist Emilio Manhique reports: [Begin Manhique recording] Moreover, Aldo Ajello presented a brief report on the outcome of investigations into allegations that the government was training 1,000 soldiers in area two, Nampula Province, and the discovery of an arms cache in Inhamizua, Beira. Ajello said the allegation that the government was training soldiers was a misunderstanding and noted that the government had requested -- in conformity with the cease-fire rules -- to use the area as a transit center for its troops and was duly authorized by the commission; and because of this there is no violation. He added that at present 600 soldiers are confined in the area and are scheduled to leave for Angoche and Namialo assembly areas within the next 10 days. The Cease-Fire Commission has decided that as of now the use of transit centers must be subjected to a number of rules -- namely, the center cannot accommodate more than 150 people for more than 10 days. The centers may have 48 permanent members to grant logistical assistance and other tasks. On the second allegation concerning the arms cache in Inhamizua, Beira, Ajello said the commission sent to the area to investigate the issue interviewed witnesses who confirmed the existence of weapons in the area. The witnesses said the weapons were carried by the police. Ajello said when the police were approached on the issue, they said they had no authority to speak with the investigation team, an attitude which Ajello described as correct. Thus, in conformity with the rules, the issue was transferred to the National Commission for Police Affairs, Compol. Commenting briefly on the two issues, the UN special representative in Mozambique urged the two sides to adhere to regular ways of dealing with these problems before leveling accusations in the press. He noted that this environment does not help create a climate of trust since it poisons the atmosphere. Ajello said he expects the sides to learn a lesson from this issue. Concerning the investigation into the alleged sexual abuse of children by UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] children, Ajello said the investigation is complete and by the end of next week a report on the issue will be presented. On the issue of the appointment of two advisers, who will work with the UN representative in Mozambique, Ajello said he expects much from Oscar Monteiro and Andre Thomashausen, who will assist him in all legal issues related to the implementation of the General Peace Accord, particularly in building up trust between the sides. On General Mateus Ngonhamo's allegation that General Lelio Goncalves is an office general, Ajello said it was not polite of Ngonhamo to have attacked him after he left the country. He said he has great admiration for Goncalves, whom he described as an excellent officer. Ajello said one of Goncalves' great qualities was to do his job, adding that he did not also try to become a political leader and did not make any statement before his departure. Ajello, who views Ngonhamo as an excellent general, suggested that he should do the same, because, quote, politics is not his job, unquote. [end recording]
