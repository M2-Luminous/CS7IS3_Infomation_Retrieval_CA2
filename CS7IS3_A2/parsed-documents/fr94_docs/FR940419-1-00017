FR940419-1-00017 FR940419-1-00006 II. Summary and Explanation of the Regulation Under the proposed regulation, an employer who has received an OSHA citation must submit to the OSHA Area Director an abatement certificate, which states whether or not the violation has been abated, as documentation of abatement. The proposed regulation would also require an employer who has received an OSHA citation to submit an abatement plan, where the Area Director requests one by such means as a note on the citation, which sets forth a schedule for the implementation of abatement measures. Under the proposal the employer would also submit progress reports, which explain what measures have been taken, if any, in the process of achieving abatement, when the Area Director requires them. The proposed rule would also require employers to affix tags on equipment noting that a citation has been issued. Paragraph (a), Scope and Application This regulation applies to all industries covered by the OSH Act, including general industry, construction, maritime, and agricultural employers. The specific identification of the major industrial groups, in this section, is intended to make this fact clear. Paragraph (b), Definitions Only those terms of the definitions paragraph which were felt to need further clarification are included in this section. Abatement date. The date by which the employer must abate a violation depends on the stage to which a case has progressed. This definition sets forth the various ways an abatement date is determined. Circumstance (1) refers to the date actually set forth in the citation, where the citation item has not been contested. As explained in Section I, this date applies even if it is with the fifteen-working-day period normally available for the filing of a notice of contest. Circumstance (2) is self-explanatory, as it refers simply to adding to the final order date either the amount of time in days initially specified for abatement on the citation or, if that period was modified by the Commission or its judge, the amount of time so modified. Circumstance (3) refers to a date for abatement ``expressly set forth'' by the Commission, or a Commission administrative law judge. The phrase ``expressly set forth'' refers to a date certain or to a set number of days from the final order date specified date. Circumstance (4) refers to a date set in a PMA final order. The term (PMA) refers to a petition for modification of the abatement date described in Section 10(c) of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 659(c). A PMA final order results either from OSHA's approval of an uncontested PMA or the Commission's approval, modification or rejection of the employer's request for additional time in order to complete abatement. Circumstance (5) refers to settlement agreements signed by OSHA and the employer, and, in some cases, employees or their authorized representatives. As in circumstance(3) the phrase ``expressly set forth'' refers to a date certain or to a set number of days from the final order date or other specified date. Abatement plan. As the definition implies with its reference to ``outlining a schedule for the implementation of measures to achieve abatement'', an abatement plan required by a citation will specify the requirement for and the frequency of ``progress reports.'' Generally, abatement plans and progress reports will be associated with multi-step or long-term abatement. Citation item. A citation item is a single instance of a violation. For example, a citation may contain ``Item 1'', alleging that the employer has one machine in violation of 29 CFR 1910.212(a)(1) because it was not guarded. A citation may also list several violations of the same standard under the same citation item, for example ``Item 1, instance a'', and ``Item 1, instance b''. ``Item 1, Instance a'', and ``Item 1, Instance b'', etc. are all separate ``citation items'' within the meaning of the proposed regulation. Final order date: The date a citation becomes a final order is the date on which a citation becomes effective. The major ways a citation can become a final order are detailed in the definition. The first category is that of an uncontested citation. If there is no contest by either the employer or the employees, the citation becomes a final order automatically, fifteen (15) working days after the date the employer receives the citation and proposed penalty, pursuant to Section 10 of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 659.
