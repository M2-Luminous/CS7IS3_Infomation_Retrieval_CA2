Armenian armed forces have had to suspend combat operations after sustaining heavy losses in battles on 5-7 March. Armenia has once again returned to discussing a ceasefire, but the prospect of a ceasefire does not suit some separatist forces, the document says. They demonstrated this once again on 12 March, the day when Rasul Guliyev, the Chairman of the Azerbaijan Supreme Soviet, was meeting Armenian representatives. Grad launchers and tanks fired on Azerbaijani positions in Agdam Rayon and also on the settlement of Ashala Seidakhmedli in Fizuli Rayon. Azerbaijani forces did not succumb to this provocation and to preserve conditions essential for peace talks did not return fire.
