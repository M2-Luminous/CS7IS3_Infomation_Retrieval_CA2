Cuba has carried out "a social project for more than 30 years. It has overcome imbalanced trade situations and all those misconceptions about one's worth," Robaina stated. Over the past years, according to the foreign minister, the Cuban Government has made important reforms, above all in economic aspects. Such reforms are not contrary to the revolution, because the word itself signifies change and "this country has been changing and revolutionizing since I learned how to reason." Robaina told the Mexican newspaper that over the past months "we saw the need to decriminalize the dollar and we did so. In agriculture we decided to turn over the state lands to the people so that they could make them productive." He added that in the future they might make other decisions "which cannot even be conceived now, because life dictates necessities and one must have a fresh and agile mind to adapt to new circumstances, no matter how hard it may seem." The Cuban foreign minister said that "the same generation that staged the Moncada attack has headed the attack on the new times, which demonstrates its revolutionary capability, its constant renewal, and the profound, enriched, and expert thinking of a group that is capable of directing changes without losing the essence." Robaina reiterated that Cuba is not willing to lose any of its achievements. He stressed that "our independence, our sovereignty, and our capability to speak with our own voice cannot be modified." Personally, he said, he would like to be able to emerge from the difficulties soon, "so that reason will prevail once and for all and the United States will lift the economic, commercial, and financial blockade to which we have been subjected." The foreign minister explained his wish to request that "the pressures be lifted, so that we can rejoin a more fair and equitable world economy, so that our people can again enjoy the standard of living which it had before the special period, and so that it can achieve much more."
