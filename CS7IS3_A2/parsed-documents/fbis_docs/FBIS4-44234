The two officials and Liberals Party Chairman Nikolaos Rolandhis will participate in a hearing between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot political parties that will be held before the political committee of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly. In a statement made to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation shortly before leaving for Strasbourg, Matsis said the presence of the Greek Cypriot parties was necessary, since Turkish Cypriot leaders have also been invited. He added: In this way, the Greek Cypriot parties will be able to present the current reality 20 years after the continuing occupation. Matsis said the political committee's meeting will basically deal with the introduction of Lord Finsberg's report on the Cyprus issue, adding that within the framework of this evaluation, views will be expressed on the overall Cyprus issue and the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. Khristofias noted that the belief of all parliamentary parties is that nonparliamentary parties should also have been invited to express their views to the committee, since Turkish Cypriot parties that participate in the pseudoparliament have been invited. He said this was not accomplished and added that several parties have sent their positions in writing. Khristofias stressed that an effort will be made in Strasbourg so that the Council of Europe does not set a precedence because of the official invitation to the pseudoparliament. He described as a weak point the fact that during the hearing each party is only allocated 10 minutes to express its views on the CBM's and the Cyprus issue in general. An interparty parliamentary delegation is in Strasbourg under House of Representatives President Alexis Galanos to participate in the work of the Council of Europe parliamentary assembly's summer session. Deputies Takis Khatzidhimitriou, Dhoros Khristodhoulidhis, Rina Katseli, and Nikolaos Rolandhis are part of the delegation. The assembly's meeting opened yesterday and will conclude on Friday.
