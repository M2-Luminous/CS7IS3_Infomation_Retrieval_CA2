Manufacturers cannot meet the demand for equipment. Network operators and service providers are struggling hard to keep up with the mass of subscribers in the D-networks. Hardware prices are plummeting. The extent of the continuing boom has evidently surprised all parties involved. In the spring of 1992, Deutsche Telekom proudly pointed out that the number of subscribers to mobile services in the whole of Germany -- adding all services together -- amounted to one million: 600,000 in the analogue C-network, over 360,000 in the paging services Cityruf (Citycall) and Eurosignal and a few thousand in the first PMR regions and the old B-network. At the time, about a year and a half ago, the Federal Republic, with its analogue C-network confined within national borders and barely eight mobile telephones per 1000 inhabitants, was an underdeveloped mobile market. Today, these figures seem to date back to another era. Germany has climbed to the top of the world's market with its two digital networks, technologically as well as in terms of subscriber numbers. In no other mobile markets are growth rates as enormous as here. Around 800,000 subscribes populated the D-networks at the end of October. In addition, 800,000 more Germans use mobile phones in the analogue C-network. With a population of 80 million, this amounts to 20 mobile phones per 1000 inhabitants. If one adds up the totals of mobile subscribers in Germany including paging services, PMR, satellite and mobile data, the two million limit has long been passed. Within 18 months, the mobile market within Germany has doubled -- and thus changed fundamentally. There are several reasons for this boom -- the extent of which surprises even the experts. One source of the increase in subscribers is the backlog created during the 1980s. The restricted C-network, and terminal prices which were extremely high compared with other countries, kept the market artificially small. And the D-networks came into operation a year later than originally planned. During this year (mid-1991 to mid-1992) the mobile market grew much more slowly than before -- many subscribers were waiting for digital mobile services. Plummeting prices for mobile phones are another phenomenon. Today, in Germany you can buy a mobile phone for about DM500 [German marks] -- subsidised by network operators and service providers who are hell-bent on flogging their wares, cost notwithstanding. First generation GSM terminals, according to the German head of British manufacturer Orbitel, Klaus Angermuller, "will practically be given away for free soon." And Kalevi Kaartinen, managing director of Nokia Mobile Phones Deutschland, states: "The Germans create English conditions, but with German thoroughness." Similar comments are heard from the managing director of service provider Unicom, Stefan Sieber: "We now have a situation in our market that took the English five years." Problems for Service Providers Manufacturers are complaining about the minimal profit margins achieved with mobil radio telephones. Bundling is weakening the business foundation of dealers and service providers. They are selling terminals below purchase price: their margins have to come from premiums tied into the SIM cards and subsequent call volumes. But this calculation has not turned out as expected. The cheaper mobile phones are being sold over the counter and are being bought by private customers. And they are using them significantly less frequently than professional users. The result: Not only the hardware profits, but also the commissions from call volumes are far too low. Most service providers made their calculations assuming about DM200 per subscriber per month (including the basic charge) but, so far, nobody is actually realising this margin. "We are in danger of simply maximising our losses with increasing numbers of subscribers," complains the managing director of a well know service provider. But falling prices and profit margins do not seem to deter newcomers. More and more firms from other industries hit by the recession are constantly looking for salvation on the mobile market. The consumer electronics sector jumps onto the mobile train as do office equipment and computer dealers, petrol stations and car dealers. And the mass marketers' golden hour has already arrived -- mail order companies, department stores, supermarkets. Mobile phones can be obtained at every corner. Consumer electronics manufacturer Grundig is starting to market cards for the D-network through its car hi-fi dealers. Its partners is service provider D-plus, in which Grundig is a 25 percent shareholder. In the near future Grundig is also planning to enter the market with its own mobile phones. Leading computer multiples Vobis and Escom are also hopeful. For the past few weeks they have been offering cards and terminals for the D-networks. Escom is selling Motorola terminals and D2-cards according to Gorbachev's maxim: "If you are too expensive, life will punish you." Vobis is coming along with a wide range of equipment, featuring, amongst others, the brand new pocketphone from Orbitel -- and D1-cards. The problem is that the more the marketing people from other industries want to benefit from this booming market -- and put their money on rapid, uncomplicated turnover of mass product mobile phones -- the lower the quality of consultancy and service. D-plus managing director Hansjurgen Roesch: "The more consumers are lured into the networks without sufficient advice and service, the higher the number of potentially dissatisfied clients later on." The result will be high cancellation rates and lots of swaps from one service provider/network operator to the next -- increasing the cost but not the profit below the line. "And this," says Roesch, "cannot be in anyone's interest." All 13 service providers are currently operating. But the industry is certain that by the end of 1994, the first few will have given up. It is predominantly the traditional mobile dealers who are about to drown. They are complaining about more customers, more demand for advice and consultancy services, but less money in the till. Lower hardware margins and their aggressive rivals constitute a serious challenge. "Although at the moment, there are no mass casualties in the dealer environment," warns Harald Koester, managing director of service provider proficom, he is certain that this will happen. And for his colleague, Kai Uwe Ricke, son of Telekom's chief Helmut Ricke and head of service provider Talkline, the real price battle is yet to come. The industry's view of the future is equivocal. On the one hand, everyone is hoping for profits from a vigorous start to the mass market. On the other hand, even 18 months after the opening of the D-networks in Germany, there is absolute chaos behind the scenes. And many of the problems which will become acute next year have not yet been solved. For example, airtime billing with the network operators is done "manually". Online connections between the data processing systems of network operators and service providers will only be introduced from early next year. "Let's hope", comments an insider, "that before then there will be no more European roaming agreements." Because these are presently dealt with bilaterally between individual roaming partners -- a "homespun" solution requiring massive amounts of staff. Meanwhile, service providers are waiting for network operators to introduce data over GSM services. This, they hope, will provide a new stimulus to the market and the opportunity to distinguish themselves from the others. Individual tariff structures are one key mechanism through which some service providers are already trying to establish themselves. But this requires considerably more processing capability than is provided by service providers' current management and billing software. Without large investments, nothing is possible at all. E-Plus And, as if service providers and dealers did not have enough problems already, the next player to enter the market is E-plus -- the third big network operator. In the first few months of 1994, the PCN operator (the network is marketed as E1 in Germany) will launch service in two densely populated areas of the new German "Lander". By the end of 1994, E-Plus chief Herbert Brenke is hoping to have covered the 17 most important economic centres in Germany. The main emphasis of the E-Plus rollout lies -- as requested by the Federal Ministry for Post and Telecommunications, who awarded the licence -- in the new German Lander. They are supposed to have 88 percent coverage by the end of 1995 -- serving essentially 100 percent of the population. The chaotic market already creates more than enough problems for Brenke. His company does not intend to distinguish itself from the D-network operators in terms of hardware prices. The PCN handsets used in E-Plus are technically little different from GSM terminals. Motorola, for example, will offer its new MicroTAC in an almost identical form to its current PCN version in the United Kingdom. In Germany, it will be available with the start of E-plus. The price, according to Motorola manager Georg F. Langheld, will be based on that of the GSM terminals. Call tariffs will also prove an ineffective weapon in the battle over mobile phone customers. Until now, D1 and D2 have kept their airtime prices artificially high. If E-Plus offers lower rates, then its two GSM rivals will be able to follow suit without problem -- especially as upgrades of their network infrastructure can now be achieved much more cheaply than two to three years ago, thanks to the worldwide availability of GSM. It is particularly difficult, according to Brenke, to set up a sales network. Service providers and dealers are too busy solving their existing problems. "What they need least of all now is another network operator," says a market expert. Mobile dealers are not therefore particularly willing to busy themselves with E-plus at the moment. Brenke will almost certainly have to strengthen his own service provider -- the 14th on the German market -- more than was planned originally. The sole cause for optimism in the industry at the moment concerns growth rates. In the five months from March to August 1993, the number of D-network subscribers doubled from some 300,000 to almost 600,000. And in September the growth rate increased even more, to a record 106,240 new subscribers within a month. The industry is expecting to reach one million subscribers in the D-networks by the end of this year. Monthly growth rates of 100,000 and more new subscribers for 1994 are already almost taken for granted. PMR and Mobile Data But a lot has happened in Germany within the last few months, not only within the GSM and PCN sectors. Two more mobile markets are beginning to become noticed in public: PMR and mobile data. While Telekom -- or, more precisely, its mobile daughter DeTeMobil -- is already active in both these markets (Chekker in PMR, Modacom in mobile data), private competitors are moving in. The new licensees for regional PMR networks in urban areas ("A" regions) have joined up and formed two nation-wide competitors: RegioNet and Terrafen. With four regions only, Sprintel (a subsidiary of Swiss company Swissphone) is trying to keep up. The networks for these already exist -- except for Sprintel -- and the fight for market share is ongoing. Meanwhile, DeTeMobil has founded an association, the Funkfachhandels Organisation (TFK), which builds up and markets Chekker networks outside urban areas. The concept is to tag these networks onto "A" networks so they can serve as the link between two large conurbations. Participants are TFK, DeTeMobil and large local radio/mobile dealers. The first few TFK Chekker networks already exist. DeTeMobil and the private PMR operators are competing for those GSM customers whose activities are mainly confined within a region. Roaming possibilities between individual PMR networks are intended to help in this process. The mobile data market in Germany is not quite so advanced. DeTeMobil's Modacom network has been running since the beginning of June -- but terminals have only been available in reasonable quantities since October. And a private mobile data licence has yet to be granted. Applications have been submitted since mid-October but the process continues until February 15. The Federal Ministry for Post and Telecommunications will not decide on this licence until 31 May 1994. DeTeMobil is expecting half a million mobile data subscribers in Germany by the year 2000 in both future networks. Other observers estimate a market potential of about two million subscribers. Four companies are expected to apply for a mobile data licence; D2 operator Mannesmann Mobilfunk and its subsidiary Eurocom, the electricity utilities Rheinisch-Westfalischen Elektrizitatswerken (RWE) and Preussen Elektra, and BellSouth in association with RAM Mobile Data. D2 chief Peter Mihatsch already announced his interest in such a licence last spring. He wants high usage of his infrastructure -- mobile data seems ideal. For BellSouth, the situation is quite similar. The United States company holds 21 percent in E-Plus (Table 1). If this consortium is granted the licence there would be obvious synergy effects with E1. Klaus Kirchhoefer, responsible for new business developments and expansion at RWE: "We are currently examining our participation in the application process." And VEBA-subsidiary Preussen Elektra is considering participation "with interest", as they say.
