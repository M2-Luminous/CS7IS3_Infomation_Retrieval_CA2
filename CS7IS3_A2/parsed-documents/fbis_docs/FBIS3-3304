The meeting was held amid the budding of some Hong Kong underground groups in the Mainland where they commit various kinds of crime posing hazards to social order both in the Mainland and in the territory. A representative from the Hong Kong police gave details on the illegal groups operating in the territory as well as on measures adopted by the Hong Kong police to counter the groups. The Mainland police officers elaborated on the infiltration of illegal organizations into the Mainland for various kinds of crime and they gave an account of the measures being taken against such groups. Participants at the meeting believed that the strengthening of cooperation between the police in the Mainland and in Hong Kong was a necessity for the prevention of crime in the two places. Director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security Mr. Zhuo Feng stressed that underground forces from outside the country's borders were in no way given shelter in the Mainland. All members of illegal groups were harshly punished in accordance with the law once they were found guilty of committing crimes inside the Mainland. A Hong Kong police officer said that he hoped police in the two places would further boost their cooperation in fighting against organized crime related to the Mainland and Hong Kong in order to put a halt to the mushrooming of underground forces with the aim of safeguarding prosperity and stability in the two places.
