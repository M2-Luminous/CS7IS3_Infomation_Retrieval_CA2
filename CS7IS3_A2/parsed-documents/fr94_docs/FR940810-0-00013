FR940810-0-00013 FR940810-0-00004 To prevent fatigue failure of the trunnion as a result of takeoffs and external load lifts (high-power events), that could result in loss of the main rotor and subsequent loss of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Within the next 25 hours' time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), accomplish the following: (1) Create a component history card or an equivalent record for the affected trunnion. (2) Determine the actual TIS of the trunnion from maintenance records, if possible. If the actual TIS cannot be determined, use a TIS of 900 hours per year. Prorate the hours for a partial year. (3) For Model 214B and 214B-1 helicopters, determine and record the accumulated high-power events on the trunnion as follows: (i) If the number of high-power events is unknown, assign 12 high-power events for each hour TIS obtained in accordance with paragraph (a)(2). (ii) If the number of high-power events is known, divide that number by 2 and record the resulting number as the total accumulated high-power events. (4) For Model 214ST helicopters, determine and record the accumulated high-power events on the trunnion as follows: (i) If the number of high-power events is unknown, assign 11 high-power events for each hour TIS obtained in accordance with paragraph (a)(2). (ii) If the number of high-power events is known, record that number as the total accumulated high-power events. (b) After the effective date of this AD, continue to record high-power events. For Model 214B and 214B-1 helicopters, divide the number of high-power events as they occur by 2 and add the resulting number to the previously recorded sum. For Model 214ST helicopters, add the high-power events as they occur to the previously recorded sum. (c) Remove the trunnion and replace it with an airworthy trunnion in accordance with the following: (1) For each trunnion with 59,400 or more high-power events, replace with an airworthy trunnion on or before the accumulation of an additional 600 high-power events. (2) For each trunnion with less than 59,400 high-power events, replace the trunnion with an airworthy trunnion on or before attaining 60,000 high-power events. (d) This AD revises the helicopter Airworthiness Limitations Section of the maintenance manual by establishing a new retirement life for the trunnion of 60,000 high-power events. However, trunnions with 59,400 or more high-power events need not be retired until on or before the accumulation of an additional 600 high-power events. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Rotorcraft Certification Office. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (g) This amendment becomes effective on September 14, 1994. Issued in Fort Worth, Texas, on July 20, 1994. James D. Erickson, Manager, Rotorcraft Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
