These are the words, said half in jest, of Rep. Kang Sam-chae, who moved from the position of Policy Coordination Office II Director to Director of Planning Coordination with the reorganization of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] which followed the cabinet reshuffle in December of last year. The person he called "Senior Paek" is Rep. Paek Nam-chi, who switched places with Rep. Kang to be appointed director of Policy Coordination Office II. This is the position with overall control of DLP-government deliberations on noneconomic sectors. Rep. Kang and Rep. Paek have worked closely together in the Democratic-Party faction, which could also be called the chinjong [the home of a married woman's parents. This refers to the remnants within the DLP of the Democratic Party of which Kim Yong-sam was head until his "marriage" with the Democratic Justice Party and Republican Party to form the DLP] of President Kim Yong-sam. Rep. Choe Hyong-u, appointed home affairs minister in the cabinet reshuffle (former secretary general), is their senior in the Democratic-Party faction. Was Kang showing that he thought that if Minister Choe were "under control," there would be no problems in their relationships with other ministers? Was he encouraging Paek not to be daunted just because added to the stern Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang there was now an influential home affairs minister? Or was it a joke coming from his composure, the result of a stabilized relationship between the party and the administration? Maybe it was all three. Actually, not that long ago, soon after President Kim took office, the relationship between the DLP and the administration was more than a little shaky. There were many occasions when senior government officials would go to the DLP headquarters on Youido for party-government deliberations only to leave embarrassed at the resentful scolding given them by the party side. This was particularly severe for officials of the health and education ministries, which experienced many scandals such as the herbalist-pharmacist dispute and college-entrance examination irregularities. With the passage of time, however, the once up-in-the-air relationship between the DLP and the administration is experiencing a soft landing. Government ministries and offices are faithfully going through the process of party-government deliberations and some "powerless departments" have actually come to use party-government cooperation to depend on the party for policy momentum. President Kim's intentional care played a big part in bring about this change. Before approving important cabinet policies, President Kim would ask, "Has this gone through party-government deliberations?" The administration's posture changed markedly as this became more frequent, according to a DLP source. President Kim may have his own reasons for thus setting out to ensure "party-government cooperation." This is said to be because Kim is from a minority faction of the ruling party. Thus, the situation cannot be the same as one in which a majority-faction president would inherit power from a past administration. As the influence of the DLP grew owing to the care of President Kim, the relationship between the party and the government grew stable. Only last year, measures supplementing the financial real-name system were taken under the leadership of the DLP, to include a revision of the Enforcement Ordinance, built around a relaxation of excess-profit taxes on real estate, and the issue of long-term, low-interest, unregistered bonds. The early party-government relationship was much dependent on the "comradely solidarity" of Democratic-Party-faction members in the party and the cabinet. Although it was not carried through, First Minister of State for Political Affairs Kim Tok-ryong, Director of Planning Coordination Paek Nam-chi, and Policy Coordination Office II Director Kang Sam-chae's putting their weight behind the progressive labor-management policy of Labor Minister Yi In-che is one example of this. This year too, Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u and Political Affairs First Minister So Chong-won are leading party-government cooperation together with Directors Kang and Paek. Recently, however, even some not belonging to the Democratic-Party faction have started to participate in party-government cooperation. Party President [PP] Kim Chong-pil, in a formal meeting with the Yi Hoe-chang Cabinet after the party and government reorganization late last year, called the attention of the government side to the DLP's position, stressing, "After President Kim's five-year term is over, it will be the ruling party, the DLP, which is judged for the results of his management of the government. Once every week, PP Kim meets with President Kim to report on operations and to see to President Kim's requests. The mood of this weekly meeting is completely different from that of the weekly meetings between PP Kim Yong-sam and President No Tae-u during the Sixth Republic. There was tension in the meetings between President No and PP Kim, but the present President Kim-PP Kim meetings have changed, showing a completely vertical relationship. In the relationship between the Blue House and the DLP, at first, the Blue House had control of everything. Now, for most important policies, the Blue House determines direction, the DLP supports this, and the administration follows behind. Political-reform bills, such as the Integrated Election Law, the Political Party Law, and the Political Funding Law, presently undergoing negotiations between government and opposition parties, were created based on President Kim's ideas on an "election that does not take money." Late last year when the regular session of the National Assembly was adrift due to the budget and the autumn-harvest-grain problem, the DLP laid out a compromise bill on the Agency for National Security Planning Law, bringing the National Assembly back to normal. It is said that this was done following the ideas and at the request of the Blue House. Contrarily, there were many cases in which the DLP intended to do something, but had the brakes put on by the Blue House. The DLP Special Committee for Social Reform and party officials presented proposals, such as the abolition of the up-myon-tong system, a prohibition of government-service employees from using private vehicles to commute to work, a reform of the reserve armed forces system, and a proposal to make use of the Yongsan War Memorial, only to be reprimanded by the Blue House for "not even giving thought to the plausibility of realizing" them. In this process, voices began to be heard pointing to the runaway leadership of the Blue House and to the powerlessness of the DLP. "In the past, there were many bureaucrats in the Blue House, and members of the administration-transition team were in the minority. Therefore, its leadership of the party was weak. Now, however, a considerable number of the administration-transition team and many from the DLP are in the Blue House. Thus the inner mind of the president is silently conveyed to the DLP," explained one Blue House source concerning this. As examples of this, the source brought up the fact that since President Kim took office, the number of events to which party officials are called has grown considerably and that a large number of Blue House figures participated in this year's DLP New Year's celebration. DLP channels within the Blue House are Chief Secretary Pak Kwan-yong, Chief of Political Affairs Yi Won-chong, and Party-Government Affairs Secretary Yun Won-chung, all from the DLP. Chief Secretary Pak and Secretary Yi deal with the three main leaders, Secretary General Mun Chong-su, Policy Committee Chairman Yi Se-ki, and Assembly Floor Leader Yi Han-tong. Secretary Yun generally deals with mid-level party officials.
