Now Russia will continue to cooperate with Vietnam as the former Soviet Union did in the past, because old friends are always better than new ones. During his visit, the deputy prime minister of Russia also attended the inauguration of the eighth generator unit of the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Plant. The Voice of Vietnam asked for his comments and whether Russia plans to cooperate with Vietnam to build other projects on such big scale. He said: [Begin Yarov recording, in Russian fading into English translation] The Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Project is a combination of the joint effort of Vietnamese workers and Russian experts. I would like to congratulate Vietnam for building this project through its own effort. It proves that Vietnam is able to do other bigger projects. The Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Project is the symbol of the close relations between Vietnam and Russia. It makes relations between Vietnam and Russia as well as other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States become closer and closer. In future, Russia may install two other generator units at the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Plant, and two other generator units at the Pha Lai Thermal Electric Power Plant. When Russia is [word indistinct] from its crisis, and it is certainly getting out of the crisis, we will have more joint ventures and investment in Vietnam. [end recording] Mr. Yarov then gave his impression about Vietnam and its people. He said: The Vietnamese people are hardworking and hospitable. During my working visit to Vietnam, the Vietnamese Government has created favorable conditions for us, especially during my visit and in our presence at the inauguration of the eighth generator unit of the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Plant. The weather in Vietnam is very beautiful.
