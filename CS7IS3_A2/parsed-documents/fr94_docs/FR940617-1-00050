FR940617-1-00050 FR940617-1-00012 After considering the manufacturer's comments and evaluating the data available at the time, the agency concluded that the information was not adequate to characterize the level of absorption, the distribution, the metabolism, and the excretion of chloroxylenol following topical administration. In a 1988 letter to the manufacturer (Ref. 40), the agency stated: (1) That data from the human bathing studies reviewed are highly variable (absorption 0.5 to 15.7 percent), (2) the analytical methodology used in the studies had not been validated and (3) that the small number of subjects included in the studies made it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the reported results. The agency commented further that submitted accumulation predictions were not adequate to define the toxicity that might occur with repeated exposure to the ingredient because no data have been submitted to support or validate the model's assumptions in characterizing exposure and stated that additional data are needed to justify, support, and verify the assumptions and data used in the predictions. Pointing out that accumulation is not the sole issue of long-term toxicity, the agency asserted that long-term toxicity may be related to repeated daily exposure to low levels of the ingredient over a lifetime. In that same letter, the agency stated that it had reexamined the necessity for a long-term animal study based on the manufacturer's assertion that use of the ingredient as an antiseptic handwash and surgical scrub should be regarded as repeated use to a limited area of the body, and had concluded that data from additional short-term studies conducted under actual use conditions (i.e., where abrasion is followed by occlusion, with the level of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the ingredient being shown under these conditions) could provide adequate information to determine whether or not a long-term animal study is necessary. Protocols for a pharmacokinetic surgical scrub study to develop such data were submitted to the agency (Refs. 41 and 42); however, to date the agency has not received any data from such a study. The agency's detailed comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Refs. 43 and 44). More recently, the agency received additional data pertaining to the safety of chloroxylenol from another manufacturer (Ref. 30). The data included an assessment of the ingredient's mutagenic potential by a series of in vitro and in vivo assays (Ames test, unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes, chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay). The data also included a dose range-finding study for a teratology study of the ingredient in rats and the subsequent teratology study. Two of the four mutagenicity assays included in the submission yielded suspect or equivocal results. The in vitro administration of 19, 38, 75, and 150 micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL) doses of chloroxylenol to Chinese hamster ovary cells produced a statistically significant increase relative to the solvent control in the mean number of chromosome aberrations per cell at the 75 and 150 μg/mL dose level both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Statistically significant increases in the percent of aberrant cells were also seen at the 75 μg/mL dose in the absence of metabolic activation and at the 75 and 150 μg/mL doses in the presence of metabolic activation. No dose response was apparent in either the activated or nonactivated systems. The investigator concluded that the results were equivocal in the nonactivated test system and suspect in the activated test system. The results of the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay demonstrated a statistically significant increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in female mice 24 and 72 hours after oral dosing with 250 and 833 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) doses of chloroxylenol. However, no dose response was apparent. The investigator considered the results to be a statistical anomaly based on unusually low mean micronucleus values in the negative control group and the lack of a dose response. However, the agency believes that because the observed increases were significantly elevated over those of the negative controls (p 0.01) and were reproducible at two dose levels, these results should be considered equivocal. The manufacturer has provided additional information (Ref. 45) in response to the agency's interpretation of the results of the mouse micronucleus assay. However, the agency continues to believe that reliance on data from historical controls is inappropriate and has not changed its position on the data. The agency's detailed comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Refs. 46 and 47). In light of the new data (Ref. 30) and the issues that they raise, the agency has again reexamined the data requirements necessary to support the safe chronic use of this ingredient. The agency finds it necessary to broaden the additional testing requirements in order to clearly assess potential risks associated with chronic use of chloroxylenol. Therefore, data obtained from the following are necessary: (1) Human studies conducted under maximal use conditions, i.e., repeated use as a surgical scrub use where abrasion is followed by occlusion, characterizing the level of absorption, the distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the ingredient, (2) a lifetime dermal carcinogenicity study (up to 2 years) in mice, and (3) an appropriate human epidemiological study performed to determine the effects on health-care professionals in countries, such as England, where the ingredient has been used extensively for a long period of time are necessary. Further, in order to relate the data derived from the chronic animal study to humans, the lifetime dermal carcinogenicity study should also include concomitant absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies. A protocol for an 18-month dermal carcinogenicity study has been submitted to the agency (Ref. 48). The agency's detailed comments and evaluation of the data and protocol are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 47).
