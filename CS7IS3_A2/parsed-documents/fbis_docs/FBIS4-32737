With Jovanovic, Martino immediately went to meet the president of the Serb Republic, Slobodan Milosevic. On the calendar were talks with the Serb Bosnian leadership and in particular with Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha. Martino arrived here from Zagreb, the second stop of his peace mission to the former Yugoslavia which kicked off in Sarajevo Monday [27 June]. In the Bosnian capital, the Italian diplomatic chief met with Premier Haris Silajdzic, while in the Croatian capital he conferred with President of the Republic, Franjo Tudjman. The Serbian press was playing up the Martino mission and the influential BORBA newspaper spoke of "Decisive Hours for Peace", while the broad circulation POLITIKA today said on its front page that it would be the upcoming G-7 summit to give new impetus to peace and the paper underscored the optimism exuded by the Italian foreign minister. Martino is touring the Bosnian crisis area in preparation for the G-7 summit in Naples on July 8-10 at which Russia, seen as a major player in attempts to solve the crisis, will be included in the political part of the discussions. Furthermore, reliable diplomatic sources in Belgrade said today that Vitaliy Churkin, the special representative of Russian President Boris Yeltsin for the handling of affairs in the former Yugoslavia, would be arriving here on Wednesday [28 June]. [passage omitted] In addition to Churkin, there were rumors that a special envoy from United States President Bill Clinton would also be arriving here Wednesday. Charles Redman, handling matters pertaining to the former Yugoslavia for the Clinton administration, and Churkin, might well present to the Serbian and Bosnian Serbian leadership the conclusions to be reached today in Paris by the Contact Group, experts from the United States, Russia and the European Union, represented by France, Germany and Britain. These conclusions will have to do with the partition of Bosnia and with steps to be taken against any side which eventually does not accept this plan. It is taken for granted that Redman at least, and possibly Churkin too, will continue the present mission by also going to Sarajevo and Zagreb.
