Belgium is well aware of the destruction caused by the dispute in Daghlyk Karabakh and laments that state of affairs. In parallel with our president's tasks as the chairman of the European Union [EU] Committee, my country is making a diplomatic effort within the CSCE Minsk Group's framework to contribute toward the finding of a just solution to that dispute. Any decision for the solution of the problem must be in accordance with CSCE principles and provide for the maintenance of international borders and the protection of the rights of ethnic minorities. Disturbed by the fate of hundreds of thousands of refugees, who are in serious condition, Belgium and its EU partners have recently decided to increase their humanitarian aid to that region. Meanwhile, I am convinced that mutual cooperation between Belgium and Azerbaijan can be successfully improved. The Belgian Government is prepared to cooperate with you on that matter. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to convey my respects to you once again.
