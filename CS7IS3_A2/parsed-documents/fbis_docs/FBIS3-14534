Can you shed some light on the results of this meeting? ['Afif] First of all, I would like to thank you, especially His Majesty King Husayn and the people and Government of fraternal Jordan for following the situation in Yemen. In fact, the Council of Ministers met on Wednesday [23 March] and today it is still in session. It made many decisions to implement the accord document, which was signed in fraternal Amman. The government is continuing its efforts in order to implement this document. The implementation is the government's responsibility. [Dhiyab] How do you assess the work of the Jordanian-Omani military committee? ['Afif] This committee, particularly the Jordanian team, carried out excellent work and is highly appreciated by all the sons of Yemen. I say this, because I feel that Major General 'Id [head of the Jordanian team] and his team did good work with the joint military committee at many locations. Confrontations among the Armed Forces were prevented at many locations. In fact, the joint military committee exerted intensive efforts. A few days ago, I heard His Majesty King Husayn say upon his return to Amman from the Gulf that he still has much hope and optimism. Of course, his majesty is holding the people of Yemen responsible in this regard. However, Jordan, especially His Majesty King Husayn, continues to follow this issue because Amman is the Yemenis' final resort. We hope that all the people of Yemen will implement this accord signed in Amman, and I frankly reiterate that all the people of Yemen admire and are proud of King Husayn and the Government and people of fraternal Jordan for their continued efforts and they will continue this work because the accord was signed in fraternal and great Amman.
