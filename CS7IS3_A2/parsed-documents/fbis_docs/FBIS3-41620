The Polish ships were followed by nine large South Korean trawlers and almost the entire Chinese fishing fleet. Somewhat later fishing ships from Japan, Panama, Bulgaria and Ukraine appeared. A wild revelry began in that part of the Sea of Okhotsk. Reluctant to observe the elementary international fishing regulations, foreign fishermen set to clearing out the wealth of the northern sea. At first the Far Eastern fishermen, before whose eyes all this illegal activity occurred, accepted it as some absurd incident, without the slightest doubt that the Russian government and the President would put an end to the pilfering and the plunderers would be made to clear out shortly. In keeping with the moratorium on fishing in the central part of the Sea of Okhotsk, announced by the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, local fishermen have stopped fishing and returned to their native port. However, our Supreme Soviet is not regarded as an authority by foreigners. The poaching, unprecedented in world practice, has been going on for two years. Dozens of seiners (there were some months when they numbered 90) barbarously catch pollack in the area and everything that gets into the nets--herring, salmon, saury, flatfish, halibut, crabs and mollusks. Disregarding appeals and warnings from the Russian side (from fish-protection bodies and scientists) foreigners catch pollack in places which have always been regarded as forbidden areas, i.e., at the wintering congestions of this species and spawning grounds, undermining the existence of the pollack population. In fact, they take only the back of pollack used for ``Suremi'' stuffing and roe which makes 35 percent of the total catch. The rest is considered as waste and is thrown into the sea, which is now polluted beyond measure. According to experts, the foreign fleet catches 1.5 million tons of pollack a year in the area. This is considerably more than permitted rates. The Sea of Okhotsk is doomed to ecological disaster, Far Eastern fishing companies will be ruined and fishermen will lose their jobs. The neutral zone mentioned here covers only three percent of the total area and for numerous large-tonnage trawlers does not suffice. It is no wonder that now and again they find themselves in our economic zone, especially since boundaries cannot be drawn at sea. However, most of them pass into the prohibited zone intentionally. Well aware that Russia's economic zone is poorly guarded nowadays, and that our frontier-guard and fishing protection bodies face difficulties with fuel (patrol ships are laid up), they also raid Russian territorial waters. The poachers are rarely detained. But even those detained get off with a trifling fine, which fails to compensate the losses incurred by our country as a result of foreign poachers. According to the most optimistic calculations, Russia annually loses about $700 million because of raids by foreign fleets. Russia's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly given explanations on this score from which it follows that there is no solution to the crisis in the Sea of Okhotsk, that the sea is unprotected and we have no rights to oppose the foreign plunderers. But there are other seas in the world where, as in the Sea of Okhotsk, the zone allocated to international fishing is an insignificant part of the total area and is surrounded by the 200-mile economic zone of the coastal state. Controls imposed by the coastal states are very strict and serve to regulate foreign fishing in neutral waters. For law-breakers there are sanctions that can ruin even the most prosperous fishing companies. Violations of the law are rare there. The situation on the Sea of Okhotsk has become strained to the utlmost. Insulted by the government's inaction and the impunity of robbers, Russia's fishermen are arming themselves. The frontier guards, too, suggest to change legislation and to give permission to open fire on poacher ships caught fishing in our waters. At its recent session the Council of the Far Eastern Association of Economic Cooperation offered to declare the area where foreign ships are deployed, a zone for launching ballistic missiles. It was also suggested that foreigners be turned out of the ``pentagon'' with the help of the Pacific Fleet warships, and only after that to find a juridical substantiation for these actions. Scientists recalled that in the past century there were similar problems with seal furs. The seal was on the brink of extinction. To prevent this Russia and the USA sent warships to the area to protect the environment from poachers. P.S. The latest news: foreign warships began to enter the free zone to protect their ``fishermen.'' It looks as if the dramatic situation in the Sea of Okhotsk has reached its peak. The outcome is yet to be seen.
