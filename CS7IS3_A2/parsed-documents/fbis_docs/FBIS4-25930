The declaration was made by Chan Youran, the head of a DKP delegation to a round table meeting of a peace working committee which opened at the royal palace Phnom Penh this morning under the chairmanship of Nhiek Tioulong, the representative of the king. Chan Youran said: "Our nation and people are definitely tired of war. Continuing it would only make the situation in Cambodia worse." However, the DKP delegation did not agree the deadline of June 30 for the cease fire which was proposed by the government and national assembly at today's meeting. Chan said mutual concessions and compromises should be made through discussions as suggested by the king. "On that common basis, we will discuss what the DKP should hand over to the royal government and what the government should in turn give to the DKP." he said.
