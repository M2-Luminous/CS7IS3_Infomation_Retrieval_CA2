The first and second places in these sad statistics are held by diseases of the circulatory system and cancer, respectively. Doctors are also concerned by the fact that there are many more suicides than homicides. Very many children and teenagers die needlessly (in this age group, accidents are the most common cause of death), as do men (three times more than women), and rural dwellers (1.85 times more than urban dwellers). Medical statistics prove that deaths caused by trauma are increasing every year: In 1988, there were 2665, while in 1992, there were 3344. Medical professionals think that the number of needless deaths is increasing due to the free trade in alcohol, which is often of inferior quality. This assertion is supported by statistical data: The number of accidents and suicides began to increase in 1988. Yesterday members of the medical community, having called a press conference, announced to reporters that they plan to deal with the problems of the prevention of trauma and suicide at the governmental level by creating an interagency trauma control council. It would consist of representatives of the ministries of Health, Social Security, Interior, Transportation, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, and Construction and Urban Planning. Also planned is a program of public education and training, the reorganization of the delivery of medical services and the work of the traumatology-orthopaedics departments, equipping them with diagnostic and treatment tools, the creation of an effective system for the medical and social rehabilitation of trauma victims as well as a system of suicide prevention. Without a doubt, the new council will come out in favor of a state monopoly on alcohol. We can be sure that the government will take an interest in the creation of the council, for trauma in the workplace causes an annual loss of 250 million litas.
