An Asian diplomat here has told his Iranian counterpart that there is a high likelihood that the British intelligence has carried out similar activities regarding the other embassies. "We intend to carry out a thorough search in our embassy for sure," he said. He noted that embassies of the Islamic countries are more exposed to the British eavesdropping due to the London's concern over the increasing growth of Islamism in Britain. "Even the ambassadors of the European countries who are concerned over the issue, sarcastically ask the British politicians in their meetings as in what part of their embassies the British Government installed its eavsedropping devices," said the diplomat.
