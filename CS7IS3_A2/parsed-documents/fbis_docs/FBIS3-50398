He should be arriving in Belgrade this evening. [Ilic] Currently the most controversial person on the international political scene, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, arrived this afternoon in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at the invitation of the Serbian Democratic Party of all Serbian Lands and the Serbian-Russian Friendship Society. He was welcomed at the Hungarian-Yugoslav border crossing by Radomir Smiljanic. Expressing thanks for the welcome, Zhirinovskiy said that he was happy that he had stepped onto Serbian soil, onto the beginning of the Slav world, and that he was among the people who are today fervently fighting for all the Slavs. After a brief traditional Orthodox ceremony, Zhirinovskiy went to Subotica, where he was greeted by many citizens. Addressing them, he said: I am coming to your country for the first time, but I am coming here as a representative of the victorious party at the Russian elections, as a representative of Russia, which has chosen a new course. This course is the obligation of Russia to help the brotherly Serbian people. Our enemies are our common enemies and you ought to know that they will be punished for all the evils committed against the Slav people. A new era is beginning, Zhirinovskiy said. His words were accompanied with chanting: Russia, Serbia. He stressed that the enemies of the Slav people are now trembling in Paris, Bonn, London, and Washington. Commenting on the war the Serbian people are waging on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, Zhirinovskiy said that all the barbarians that have settled on the sacred Serbian soil must accept the fact that this land belongs to the Serbian people, or leave it. After a brief stop in a big restaurant in Subotica, Agros Centar, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy continued his journey to Belgrade, where he will hold a news conference. According to the plan, Zhirinovskiy will visit Bijeljina as a guest of the republic of Srpska, and then meet Milan Martic, newly elected president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, in Vukovar.
