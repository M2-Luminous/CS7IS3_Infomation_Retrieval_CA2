Commenting on the Israeli acts of suppression against Arab citizens in the occupied Arab territories, TISHRIN says: The Israeli Cabinet has extended indefinitely the military siege imposed on the occupied Arab territories, amid circumstances asserting that the situation in the occupied territories is unbearable and that our people there are experiencing hell because of Israel's iron-fist policy and the scheme of collective punishment. Some Israeli officials have acknowledged that the increase in the Israeli military and economic pressure on the occupied territories will definitely generate more violence and resistance. This will also starve the sons of our people in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. The policy of complete closure betrays total Israeli inability to face a growing, stepped-up Palestinian resistance. TISHRIN adds: There is no doubt that the failure of the occupation to provide security to its settlers and forces is yet further evidence that Israel is incapable, whatever its methods and brutal, suppressive practices, of undermining the steadfastness of our people in the face of the Israeli war, aggression, and terrorism machine. Israel has repeatedly resorted to such methods. This is not the first time the occupation authorities seal off the West Bank and Gaza and tighten the siege on them. What is strange, however, while observing the serious, explosive developments in the occupied territories, is the silence toward this situation and the indifference of some international capitals and political circles toward what is happening, despite its severity and seriousness. This is as if the fate of the Palestinian people does not deserve a word of justice against the Israeli occupier and as if threatening the very existence of this people no longer requires assuming urgent missions to save the life of the defenseless sons of Palestine, after the occupation has turned their life into unbearable hell because of the Israeli suppressive practices. TISHRIN asserts that Israel takes lightly all human values and international laws and charters. The paper urges people with a living conscience who care about the stability and security of the West Bank and Gaza to come to the rescue of justice and humanity, lift the injustice and oppression against the Palestinian people, and protect its sons who are experiencing real massacres and a serious war of starvation. AL-BA'TH comments on Israel's crimes in the occupied Arab territories that threaten peace opportunities. Israel has turned both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip into closed detention camps. It has imposed collective punishment on the people of Palestine, thus violating all international norms and charters and the Geneva Convention on the protection of human rights. The paper asserts that the measures adopted by the occupation against our people in the occupied territories are not new. The record of the occupation is rife with the ugliest kinds of crimes. The enemy generals have acknowledged that they are fighting a true war in the West Bank and Gaza. AL-BA'TH notes that Israel sheds tears over peace and tries to appear before the world as an advocate of peace. This approach toward world public opinion is no longer useful to the Rabin government, having unmasked its bloody face through a series of crimes carried out in the occupied territories in broad daylight and under the very gaze of the whole world. Concluding, the paper calls on those who are making serious efforts for a just and comprehensive peace to put an end, once and for all, to Israel's crimes because spilling Arab blood does not serve the peace process, nor make it possible to achieve any step forward.
