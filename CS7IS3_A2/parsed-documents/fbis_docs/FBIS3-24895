In a policy statement on the Constituent Assembly 1994 broadcast on Radio Uganda and Uganda television tonight by member of the Presidential Commission, the Rev. Dr. (Kefa Sempanje), the party asked the people of Uganda to commit themselves to long-term objectives which transcend narrow interests and can stand the test of time. The UPC said the people of Uganda should commit themselves to: 1. Protect and preserve the territorial integrity of our beloved country and never permit it to be enslaved, dismembered, and enfeebled by militaristic systems; 2. Guarantee fundamental human rights and basic freedoms of the individual, particularly the enjoyment of the right of association. It said political parties should be entrenched in the Constitution in the promotion of democratic institutions; 3. Create an enabling environment for individuals to develop their full potential; and, 4. Build a strong and sound economy. On governance, the party said the new constitution must guard against the emergence of leadership which comes to power through the gun or other criminal means. The Constitution, the UPC argued, should state clearly the tenure of office, the process of acquiring that tenure, its renewal and limitations. In other words, it added, the issue of regular elections should be entrenched in the Constitution with due dates and frequency specified. It said this should not be left to the whims of the executive. The UPC also recommended that the role of the three arms of government, namely the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary should be defined. For good governance, the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law, it said, must be recognized and accepted. The will of the people as the ultimate sovereignty must be respected through regular elections based on universal adult suffrage. The National Assembly must be the depositary of the people's will and sovereignty. Its authority should not be undermined by any other body such as the National Council of State. The party described the (?adoptive) draft Constitution as a tragic betrayal of the underlined principles in constitution making and the noble aspirations of the people of Uganda. It charged that the draft Constitution attempts to legitimize and entrench the NRM in power. It declared that the country must be committed to: 1. A constitution which is the supreme law of the land with no individual or organ above it. 2. Ensuring that the people's sovereignty is upheld at all times. 3. To establish constitutional modalities removing from office a president who fails to perform in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. 4. Maintaining the rule of law as opposed to arbitrary rule and 5. Safeguarding the independence of the judiciary. On local government, [the] UPC added its voice to those of other parties who have already presented their views on the draft constitution in recognition of the need for unity in diversity and also it said that for effective provision of services to the people there is need for devolution of powers to local authorities, bearing in mind the need for equitable distribution of resources. But it stressed that the central government under the UPC will play a supportive, advisory, and supervisory role. However, the central government under the UPC will continue to play the exclusive role in the field of international relations, finance, defense, and security and management of the natural resources.
