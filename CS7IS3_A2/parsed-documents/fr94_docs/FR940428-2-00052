FR940428-2-00052 FR940428-2-00031 [Docket No. CP93&hyph;258&hyph;003] Mojave Pipeline Co.; Amendment to Application April 21, 1994. Take notice that on April 18, 1994, Mojave Pipeline Company (``Mojave'') filed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;258&hyph;003, pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (``Act'') and Rule 215 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``Commission''), an amendment to its initial application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, filed March 17, 1993 and amended on November 8, 1993 in Docket CP93&hyph;258&hyph;000, all as more fully set forth in the amendment to the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. On March 17, 1993, Mojave filed an application for an optional certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct, install, and operate certain pipeline, compression and related facilities for the purpose of extending its pipeline into central and northern California (the ``Northward Expansion''). An Amendment to that application was filed on November 8, 1993. To facilitate the transportation of gas to these new markets, Mojave's application also proposed to expand Mojave's existing mainline through the addition of looping and compression. Mojave requested the Commission to issue a certificate prior to April, 1, 1994, in order to meet a projected in-service date of April 1, 1995. In its initial application, Mojave submitted for Commission review two alternative designs for the Northward Expansion facilities. Under the first alternative, ``Case 1'', Mojave proposed to construct a 475 Mmcf/d expansion on a stand-alone basis, requiring the construction of new mainline and related facilities and additional looping on Mojave's existing facilities, as well as a number of additional meter stations. Under the second alternative, ``Case 2'', Mojave's proposed 475 Mmcf/d expansion would be built in conjunction with a proposed 475 Mmcf/d expansion would be built in conjunction with a proposed expansion by Kern River Gas Transmission Company (``Kern River'') of 452 Mmcf/d. Kern River's proposal is currently pending at Docket No. CP92&hyph;198&hyph;000. Mojave states that the Amendment has two purposes. One is to identify 29 minor route modifications to the previously-proposed Cases 1 and 2 that more specifically address environmental, cultural resource, engineering and/or right-of-way matters. Mojave also states that 24 of these alternates constitute route revisions of approximately 1000 feet or less and affect, in total, approximately 47.3 miles of its proposed pipeline route and do not result in changes to the previously-filed cost estimate. Mojave states that the second purpose is to present to the Commission for review, two alternative project designs (Case 3 and Case 4) that incorporate recent developments in the Northern and Central California markets to be served by the Northern Expansion. Mojave indicates that Case 3 consists 635.1 miles of pipeline of various diameters, related facilities and 103,228 horsepower of compression at an estimated cost of $488,084,000 dollars while Case 4 consists of 679 miles of pipeline of various diameters, related facilities and 92,728 horsepower of compression at and estimated cost of $494,907,000 dollars. Cases 3 and 4 do not supersede the previously-filed alternation project designs. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should, on or before May 5, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a protest or motion to intervene in accordance with the requirements of Rule 211 or 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 or 385.214) and the Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a petition to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10101 Filed 4&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
