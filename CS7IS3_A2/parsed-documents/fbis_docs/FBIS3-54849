What is your view? [Brazauskas] I do not see such danger as others do. There are also many people panicking in Lithuania. I suppose this is unnecessary. Too much talk about a person called Zhirinovskiy would do him too much credit. Out of 443 seats in the parliament, his party has won only 80. Certainly, there will also be communists and their partners, the "agrarians," in the Russian Federal Assembly. I am not sure, however, that the party membership of most of the elected deputies fully reflects their views, because some parties and electoral blocs emerged right before the elections. [Staselis] Do you intend to correct Lithuania's policy toward Russia somehow? [Brazauskas] I think that our policy toward Russia will not change. At least, there is no definite reason for doing this now. [Staselis]In your opinion, are the current bilateral relations optimal? [Brazauskas] I suppose that we have accomplished particularly much this year in normalizing Lithuanian-Russian relations. In this respect, we have been more successful than our neighbors for different reasons. We will also pursue such a balanced policy in the future. [Staselis] Mister President, having been disappointed with Sajudis, Lithuanian citizens voted for the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] a year ago. In your opinion, for whom will they vote during the next elections if they become disillusioned with the LDDP, particularly if the economic crisis is too protracted? [Brazauskas] No, Lithuania will not have such extremist activists like in Russia (if you had in mind such an implication) who could expect a victory in the elections. [Staselis] Why? [Brazauskas] Because the community in Lithuania is more stable, and the multiparty system is more distinct. Thus, there are no conditions for extremist policies. [Staselis] However, can you claim that there is no political extremism in Lithuania? [Brazauskas] Well, it is abundant. There are many politicians who may not be like Zhirinovskiy, but who are trying to accumulate political capital by criticizing the government's moves concerning our relations with Russia, by saying: "There is no political strategy," "We must apply tough policies toward them [Russians]," "Kaliningrad Oblast belongs to Lithuania," "We will correct the border between Lithuania and Poland," and so on. [Staselis] Your decision to disband the state delegation for negotiations with Russia has caused a certain indignation. Did you dissolve this structure for the aforementioned reasons? [Brazauskas] Some people are making much noise about this issue. The delegation for negotiations is a separate issue. First of all, I have not heard of any other country possessing such a structure approved by the law: An institution comprised of randomly selected persons who are not responsible for anything. This delegation claimed that it had great authority, but with no responsibility for its actions. [Staselis]What is your reaction to the criticism of the former members of this institution directed against you concerning the "policy ordered from Moscow," "jellyfish," and so on? [Brazauskas] My assessment of this criticism is the same as over the past five years. I have been called different names all that time, and I have gotten used to it. State interests are more important to me than the opinions of some individuals about me. [Staselis]However, Lithuanian foreign policy has not been ideal. Sometimes it is difficult to understand why there is no coordination of action; why one minister does not know what his colleague is signing in Moscow; why the foreign minister has no documents signed by the prime minister; or why the president's office is unaware of the moves of the negotiating delegation, to say nothing of certain strange situations. What do you think of this? [Brazauskas] Life is life. We will seek strict coordination of action among government institutions abroad in the future, particularly among those which influence foreign policy. It is difficult to achieve this immediately. Certainly, there are some people who are used to squeezing their personal opinions or principles into some official framework. [Staselis] Can the new seven-member working group for negotiations with the CIS, which has replaced the state delegation for negotiations with Russia, be interpreted as your foreign policy "team"? [Brazauskas] Yes, this is a team that used to meet unofficially, and now it has been legalized. [Staselis] Are you not afraid of the accusations that you have eliminated all sorts of the opposition from the "formation" of foreign policy? [Brazauskas] I have not eliminated anyone. The newly created council consists of persons who are responsible for the successes and failures in foreign policy. Meanwhile, the opposition should engage in creative work in the Seimas [parliament] and express its opinion, and we will take it into consideration. It is we rather than the opposition who are responsible for our state policy today. Therefore, I do not think that the opposition should participate in outlining our foreign policy. Finishing the issue of the opposition's right to state policy, I would add that I also was in the opposition once. I remember quite well how much our opinion was necessary in drafting state policies or how much it was considered.... [Staselis] Currently, you are under active pressure demanding your tough stand on Lithuania's faster accession to NATO. What do you think about this? [Brazauskas] I suppose that this issue (knowing its difficult resolution even in West European countries) is not a matter of the non-ruling party alone. I believe that its position on this problem considerably exceeds the authority of the government and the Seimas. Therefore, a referendum on this issue is quite an attractive idea. [Staselis]Mister President, recently Lithuania has learned that the world Jewish community is continuing to seek that Lithuania be equalled to Germany concerning the Jews' genocide during World War II. What is your attitude toward this problem? [Brazauskas] I suppose that there has not been such a statement, thus, I have no definite reply. I think, however, that each similar statement requires evidence. I have repeatedly said that some Lithuanian citizens really participated in the Jews' genocide -- this is a stigma of our nation. I will never agree, however, that the entire nation or the state be accused of this. I proposed cooperation in definite issues involving concrete names to the Israeli delegation during its visit here. However, we will not agree to the transfer of all criminal cases to another state. We trust Israeli and U.S. justice, and we expect the same from them.
