Russia Handles Sarajevo Crisis in Seven Days"] [Text] The West was unable to resolve the Sarajevo crisis in two years. Moscow has handled the task in seven days. However two weeks ago the U.S. leadership and NATO circles did not even think of Russia being able to make a decisive contribution to resolving the Bosnian crisis. This was manifest particularly clearly when the ultimatum was being delivered to the Bosnian Serbs. Admittedly, the West suddenly had a thought and authorized the British prime minister during his visit to Moscow to slightly ease the awkwardness. Paris LE FIGARO wrote the following on this score: "The task facing the head of the British Government is no easy one: He has to find a compromise that will enable Moscow to save face and once again enter into dialogue with the West regarding a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina after the double insult for Russia of the NATO ultimatum and Bill Clinton's statement to the effect that the Kremlin's position does not pose a 'major problem.'" You can see from Western press articles how formal Major's mission was in this respect. The same LE FIGARO wrote in an article headlined "Yeltsin's Dilemma: Between the West and Serbia": "For Moscow it is a question of the need to find the elusive solution [prizrachnoye resheniye] that would enable it not to alienate the West and not betray the 'Slav brotherhood' linking Russia with the Serbs. That is why, after the announcement of the NATO ultimatum, Russian leaders have made -- so far with relative success -- a series of attempts to avoid inflicting air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs' positions." Moscow's involvement did not, however, prove at all "elusive." As soon as the ultimatum was adopted the Russian Foreign Ministry gave notification that it regards it as "illegitimate and not in line with UN decisions," and during a conversation with John Major Boris Yeltsin spoke in even more forthright terms: "Some people are trying to resolve the Bosnian issue without Russia's involvement. We will not permit that." Bill Clinton was forced to promise Boris Yeltsin 11 February during a telephone conversation that finally took place after several abortive attempts that he would persuade the Muslim government of Bosnia not to quit the negotiating process in Geneva in exchange for the Russian president trying to persuade the Serbs to withdraw their heavy artillery and tanks from Sarajevo. There is every indication that the U.S. President made this promise lightly since he had little faith that Yeltsin would indeed have any success in this endeavor. However, Moscow's involvement proved more than vigorous, it proved crucial. Thursday morning Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special representative, gave Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic a personal message from Boris Yeltsin. The text of the message indicated that Moscow had pondered everything down to the psychological nuances. Treating Serbian leaders with respect, the Russian president made no demands on them. He asked them to withdraw their heavy artillery and tanks from Sarajevo and in exchange proposed that 400 airborne troops from the Russian battalion of the UN peacekeeping forces stationed in Eastern Croatia would take up the positions they would vacate in the village of Lukavica near the Bosnian capital. (Incidentally, the Russian word "prosba" [request] sounds very mild in Serbian, where it is "molba"). The Serbs realized straightaway that the Russians had proposed to offer their lives as a guarantee of peace in Sarajevo. After all, if NATO forces inflict air strikes, the bombs could land on Russian airborne troops and that would immediately bring a fundamental change in the situation throughout Bosnia. President Clinton could not contain his amazement, primarily at Yeltsin's decision to send his peacekeeping contingent from Croatia to Sarajevo (his administration's spokesman Myers announced this). Nor was it coincidence that Moscow did not say a single word about the NATO ultimatum. What is more, when the Russian Air Force Press Service announced Saturday 19 February that Russian airborne troops would not be redeployed until NATO lifted its ultimatum, the Russian Defense Ministry immediately issued a rebuttal, saying that the Russian Air Force Press Service had overstepped its authority. At 1500 hours Thursday the Serbs gave their consent to Yeltsin's proposal. Friday 18 February they began withdrawing heavy arms from Sarajevo, and at midday on Saturday Russian airborne troops began moving from Croatia to Bosnia. They arrived on the spot Sunday evening after a day's march through the mountains in heavy snow. As it is customary to say in such cases, there are no winners or losers in Sarajevo, peace is the victor. However, this popular expression is hardly appropriate here. Things are not like that in politics. The Serbs have clearly won by withdrawing their heavy arms from Sarajevo: Now in the event of renewed explosions in Sarajevo no one wil be able to blame Serb artillerymen or tank personnel for this. Having obtained peace in their capital, the Muslim leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina has lost an opportunity to lift up its hands to the West asking it to inflict air strikes as punishment on the "infidels" who are allegedly annihilating civilians. The West has obviously won; it does not now have to get embroiled in the adventure of outright military confrontation with a staunch and bellicose people, with the threat of creating a second Vietnam for itself (whether this applies to France or the United States). Henceforth efforts can be focused solely on finding a truly peaceful means of settling the conflict. Moscow has unexpectedly found itself ahead; for a week it demonstrated to the international community the exceptional diplomatic potential of a great power. So, many people have gained, although not everyone. But it is nonetheless hard to get away from the impression that this turn of events is not to everyone's liking. At first Moscow's initiative was greeted by the West with obvious (and seemingly sincere) relief: It would not have to become embroiled in an adventure involving air strikes Monday and put its head on the block. The point is that, according to Western intelligence services, the Serbs' armed formations in Bosnia have a large number of long- range fixed-site antiaircraft missiles with a range of up to 40 km and an even larger number of shoulder-launched infantry missiles for use against aircraft. What is more, the Americans well remember that in Vietnam the U.S. Air Force incurred its greatest losses not from missiles but from massive antiaircraft fire from the ground, against which the electronics that they used successfully in Iraq are powerless. In order to avoid losses from that kind of fire fighter bombers would be forced to fly at a higher altitude, but the accuracy of the aggressor's fire is dramatically reduced as a result of that kind of maneuver. However, when the first shock of Moscow's resounding diplomatic success had passed in the West, the United States seemed to switch to ways of blocking the new Russian peace initiative. In particular, when on Friday Andrey Kozyrev, building on the success achieved Thursday, forthwith suggested convening an international peace conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina next week in order to find a full solution to the Bosnian problem. The West attempted to "scupper" this new Moscow peace initiative: U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that long and careful preparations are needed for such a conference, which will take a great deal of time. Following this Washington, the BBC reported, has made great efforts to persuade the Croats and Muslims to remain in a single Bosnian state. A very well thought-out move. If it was successful, the Serbs in Bosnia would be left totally isolated. In that case the territories they are holding could be declared occupied and the Serbs could thus continue to be kept outside the world community. They could thus be pressured with a view to forcing them to leave the territories they control. There is every indication that Washington is trying to put its own plan into practice. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic and Bosnian Prime Minister Big Haris Silajdzic had a separate meeting in Germany Saturday to discuss a possible solution to the Bosnian problem. The meeting bore no fruit. That is not surprising. A month earlier Bosnian and Croatian Presidents Alija Izetbegovic and Franjo Tudjman met in Germany for the same purpose and were also unable to reach any agreement. It is not only that the interests of these two forces in Bosnia are diametricaly opposed. It is hard to imagine these two political forces being able to exist within a single state after two years of mutual enmity and after mercenaries from other Muslim countries being involved in the Bosnian Muslims' combat operations against the Croats. The question does of course arise: What is the origin of this treachery? Clinton did after all promise to put pressure on the Muslims, propelling them toward peace, but U.S. diplomacy has begun to take the exact opposite course. Why? The answer must be sought in public opinion. It now has a very strong influence on both Yeltsin and Clinton. The BBC reports that, according to the results of a Russia-wide public opinion poll, over 66 percent of Russian citizens would regard NATO strikes on the Bosnian Serbs as an attack on Russia. And over 77 percent of respondents opposed NATO's threat to bomb Serbian heavy guns in positions around Sarajevo. What realistic politician could have ignored such an explicitly expressed opinion from his own people? It is the same in the United States. Clinton's promise to put pressure on the Muslims had not had time to be made known to the U.S. public at large before U.S. newspapers bristled with headlines describing what the U.S. President said as "ominous" and his position "an utter disgrace." Nonetheless there is every indication that it will be very hard to stop the Bosnian peace settlement process after Russia's initiative. Friday Radovan Karadzic said: "We think that the war in Sarajevo is finally over." And Sunday 20 February Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special spokesman in the former Yugoslavia, voiced an even more optimistic opinion of the situation, saying that the Bosnian crisis as a whole may come to a peaceful close over the next few weeks.
