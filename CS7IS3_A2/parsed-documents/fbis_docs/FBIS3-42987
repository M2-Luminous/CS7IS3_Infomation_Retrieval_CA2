Requirements are set forth for the sensitivity of ordinary and professional radiometric instruments for radiation monitoring of food products based on supporting the concept of residence of the populace in regions contaminated by radionuclides from the Chernobyl disaster. Information is presented on setting up independent local centers for radiation monitoring of food products and the environment in centers of population of the Republic of Belarus. Medical and biological consequences for the populace following the Chernobyl disaster are examined. The report sets forth the scales of damage to forestry and agriculture as a result of the disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant and gives recommendations on management of agricultural production and use of forests on territories contaminated by radionuclides. Keywords: radiation conditions in Republic of Belarus, radiation monitors and radiometers, systems of radiation monitoring of food products, medical and biological consequences of Chernobyl disaster for the populace, management of forestry and agriculture on radionuclide-contaminated territories. Introduction Systems of radiation and ecological monitoring of the environment in Belarus, as in other regions of the nation, are narrowly departmental as a rule. In most centers of population, Belgidromet regularly determines the radiation conditions with respect to isotopes cesium-137, strontium- 90 and plutonium-239. Maps have been published of the radiation contamination of the territory of the republic with cesium-137, as well as strontium-90 and plutonium-239. At the same time, the representativeness and confidence of these maps are inadequate. At present only one measurement per 50 ha is taken on agricultural lands, and in centers of population with extent of 1.5-2 kilometers, only 15-20 measurements. For example, within the confines of the village of Veprin in Cherikovskiy Rayon of Mogilevskaya Oblast, according to data of the former State Hydrometeorological Committee of the USSR the density of contamination with isotope cesium-137 is 1184 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. However, according to data of a mobile radiometric laboratory equipped with a "CANBERRA" gamma spectrometer, a detailed study done on 24 March 1991 revealed an extensive zone on one street with contamination of the order of 1850-2035 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. A significant contribution to protective measures has been made by household studies of radiation conditions and compilation of radiation certificates of centers of population of the republic. Radiation certification of centers of population has basically been completed on contaminated territories, although certification of housing and garden plots continues. Certification of woodlands and agricultural fields is being done by the Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Agricultural Products of the republic respectively. In 1986-1988 when determining protective measures, good reasons were found for leaning toward the use of density of contamination of lands with radionuclides as an information index. Since completing resettlement of residents away from centers of population with density of contamination by cesium-137 of more than 1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and strontium-90 of 111 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], and also families with children away from the zone with contamination density of more than 555 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], the overall dose of external radiation for most regions does not exceed 10-40 percent, and the principal dose of irradiation of residents in affected regions is obtained from internal irradiation due to using local food products contaminated by radionuclides. Up until August 1990 in Belarus, as in other republics affected by the disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant, standards VDU-88 [for temporary admissible levels] were in effect that allowed exposure to internal irradiation due to radionuclide-contaminated food products of 0.7-0.8 rem per year. Laws of the republic on social protection of citizens affected by the disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plantset an effective equivalent dose of the population resident on contaminated territories of not more than 0.1 rem per year (7 rem for life). This has required the acceptance of new admissible levels of radionuclide contamination of food products. The introduction in Belarus on 1 August 1990 of new and more stringent control levels of admissible radionuclide contamination of food products was not supported by appropriate means of measurement, as most radiometric instruments were of type KRVP-4AB with inadequate sensitivity. In November 1990, the international Commission on Radiation Protection set stricter upper limits of the dose of irradiation of professionals to 20 mSv per year (previously 50 mSv per year), and for the populace to 1 mSv per year (previously 5 mSv per year). The same ICRP recommendations (No 60, 1990) introduce a minimum limit of annual dose of 0.1 mSv for taking protective steps (all values stated over the dose burdens from the natural background). In 1992, Belgidromet came out with a map of radioactive contamination of the territory of the republic with iodine-131 and the dose rate due to this radionuclide in various regions. In 1991, the Institute of Radiation Medicine of the Ministry of Public Health of the Rebpulic of Belarus compiled a catalog of doses of irradiation of residents for centers of population of the republic, where the density of contamination with radionuclide cesium-137 was more than 185 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. Dose loads were calculated by the approved procedure of the Ministry of Public Health for external irradiation with respect to dose rate and internal irradiation with respect to content of cesium-137, strontium-90 and plutonium-239 in milk and potatoes. The catalog covers 1111 centers of population of Gomelskaya, Mogilevskaya and Brestskaya Oblasts. In 1991, the dose of irradiation of residents exceeded 1 mSv per year in 610 centers of population. According to data of Belgidromet, there are more than 3668 centers of population, including 53 cities, on territories with cesium-137 contamination of more than 37 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. This number of centers of population should be increased due to villages and settlements in the Polesye district where the cesium-137 contamination density is 18.5-25.9 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and milk meeting standards RKU- 90 cannot be obtained. Thus, in 1992 we will need to measure the content of radionuclides in food products at more than 2500 centers of population of the republic. Following completion of work on compiling the catalog of doses of irradiation of residents in centers of population of the republic, there will have to be a more precise definition of the previously assumed decisions on assuring safety of habitation on radionuclide-contaminated territories. The report analyzes the main reasons for the unsatisfactory state of radiation-ecological conditions in the Belarus region and gives recommendations on necessary measures aimed at radical improvement of the situation that has evolved. The book offers an analysis of the state of health of the populace of the Republic of Belarus since the Chernobyl disaster. Creation of a network of local centers for radiation monitoring of food products for the populace along with the state radiation monitoring system will provide the population with means of protection from radionuclide-contaminated food products. This report has been prepared by a panel of experts from Belarus; the base for doing the research was defined by the Belorussian Institute of Radiation Safety, which was set up by the State Committee of the Republic of Belarus on Problems of Consequences of the Disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant and the International Chernobyl- Pomoshch non-governmental organization. The basic goals and areas of activity of the Institute: development of protective measures and regulations of safe production activity and habitation of the populace on radionuclide-contaminated territories; comprehensive radiological examination of centers of population and territories subjected to radioactive contamination; creation of local centers and preparation of dosimeters for monitoring food products for the populace, developing and producing radiometric instruments for radiation monitoring of food products and the environment. Conclusions and Proposals 1. The Republic of Belarus was hardest hit by the Chernobyl disaster. To assess the scales of the disaster for the republic, the following data should be presented: more than two thirds of the radionuclides discharged from the fourth unit at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant fell on Belarus, and one fifth of the territory of the republic was contaminated with radionuclides; the population residing on territory with density of contamination by cesium-137 of more than 137 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] in the republic numbers 2,105,400 (including more than 400,000 children) in 3668 centers of population, including 53 cities; more than 100,000 people have been resettled from contaminated regions of the republic: in 1992, residents were resettled from all centers of population in regions with contamination density of more than 1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]; more than 30,000 children reside on territory with density of contamination by cesium-137 of more than 555 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]; the damage inflicted by the Chernobyl disaster on the Republic of Belarus, which does not have a single nuclear electric power plant, is expressed by sixteen annual budgets of the republic; in the post-accident period, incidence of thyroid cancer among children increased by a factor of seven over the republic, and by a factor of 22 in Gomelskaya Oblast; in zones of radioactive contamination of 17 regions of Mogilevskaya and Gomelskaya Oblasts, for three years after the accident the frequency of congenital defects of development in close follow-up nearly doubled in comparison with the period preceding the accident; cytogenetic studies have shown that pregnant women (and fetuses) from the southern regions of Gomelskaya and Mogilevskaya Oblasts received doses of radiation that increase the overall level of spontaneous mutations of chromosomes by a factor of 1.5-2, and the number of dicentric and ring chromosomes in some mother-fetus pairs increased by a factor of 4-10; an absorbed dose of 400 cGy or more is considered a considerable risk factor of laboratory hypothyroidism and autoimmune disorders of the thyroid gland among children; significant prevalence of dyspancreatism syndrome has been established among children with level of incorporation of cesium-137 of more than 0.3 �Ci/organism; children residing on contaminated territories show greater frequency (compared with the control) of persistent asthenic states (by a factor of 2), hypochondriac syndrome (by a factor of 4.6), phobic syndrome (by a factor of 2.3) and so on; among children and adolescents residing on contaminated territories, especially under conditions of elevated incorporation of cesium-137, there is an increase in disorders of the digestive system. For example, the occurrence of chronic gastritides and gastroduodenitises among children and adolescents in 1990 in these regions reached 171-297% (in the control--125-153%); the level of recorded primary incidence of circulatory system disorders (CSD) in 1990 increased by comparison with 1985 by a factor of 3.5 over Gomelskaya Oblast, and by a factor of 2.5 over Mogilevskaya Oblast. 2. The republic program for alleviating consequences of the Chernobyl disaster for 1993-1995 and ahead to the year 2000 must take as a priority direction the production of clean food products, implementation of the concept of safe habitation of people on radionuclide-contaminated territories. 3. Contamination in the Republic of Belarus covers 45,600 km[.sup]2[/] or 23 percent of the territory of the republic, more than 1,866,000 ha of arable land, of which 106,000 ha was removed from agricultural use in the first year following the disaster; in 1986-1989, a total of 256,700 of arable land was taken out of circulation. In 1990 alone, lands wiht Cesium-137 contamination density of more than 1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] were eliminated from agricultural use, and finally, volumes of deliveries of meat and milk from these regions were reduced. 4. Research has shown that in the zone of contamination by radiocesium of up to 185 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and by strontium-90 of up to 11.1 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], all kinds of agricultural operations can be carried out by conventional technologies on arable lands. Forage with contamination density from 37 to 555 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] is resown to grass. Radioactive contamination of territory by cesium-137 with density of more than 555 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] makes stock raising unfeasible for practical purposes in this zone. 5. Standards have been set for the content of radioactive substances in agricultural raw material for producing goods corresponding to RKU-90 standards. Fodders should contain 5 x 10[.sup]-8[/] - 1 x 10[.sup]- 8[/] Ci/kg. 6. In 1991-1992, the radiological services of the Ministries of Agriculture, Forestry, and Public Health significantly renovated their inventories of radiometric instruments for cesium-137 monitoring; the instruments have high sensitivity that allows monitoring to be done in accordance with standards RKU-90. Complete retooling in these enterprises requires delivery of more than 2000 new gamma-radiometers of Vityaz, Belrad, Aliot and RUP 01P6 type. 7. The level of admissible content of radionuclides according to RKU-90 in food products, and the specificity of the diet of food products for those living in Belarus are such that the possible annual dose burden may amount to 0.17-0.18 rem/yr. And milk, baked goods, potatoes and meat comprise more than 70 percent of the accumulation of radionuclides in the organism. There is an acute need for 2-3 times more stringent radionuclide control levels with respect to grain, potatoes and milk. 8. Food products can be checked for strontium-90 and plutonium-239 content only by a radiochemical method (10-14 days for one measurement). Experimental models of beta-radiometers have been developed for instrumental determination of strontium-90 within a few hours (strontium-90 in soil of 20 Bq/kg within 3-4 hours). Experimental models of alpha radiometers are being developed for instrumental determination of plutonium-239. 9. The law of the Republic of Belarus "On the Status of Territories Subjected to Radioactive Contamination as a Result of the Chernobyl Disaster" (Article 40) acknowledges the advisability of setting up local centers (LC) for radiation monitoring (RM) of food products for the populace. According to a resolution and with the financial support of the State Committee of the Republic of Belarus on Problems of the Aftermath of the Chernobyl Disaster, 167 local centers for RM have been set up for rural Soviets in Gomelskaya (65), Mogilevskaya (42), Brestskaya (26) and Minskaya (14) Oblasts, and in the city of Minsk (20). 10. The Belorussian Institute of Radiation Safety, which is the head institute for LCs, is organizing LCs in the republic, and training capable local rural residents in radiation monitoring. Plans call for instituting more than 600 LCs in centers of population (generally the central homestead of farms) where the dose burden of the population exceeds 0.1 rem/yr. 11. Certification of the homesteads of villages and farms, use of adaptive technologies for agricultural production, compilation of maps of isotopic contamination of food products and development of regulations for safe production activity and habitation will enable protection of the health of the populace in regions hit by the Chernobyl disaster. 12. The operation of local centers in Brestskaya and Gomelskaya Oblasts has revealed considerable contamination of food products in centers of population of Belorussian Polesye, especially milk, cranberries and wild fruit at contamination density of less than 37 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. Clean milk cannot be produced even at a contamination density by cesium- 137 of 18.5-25.9 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. Haste must be made in cultivating and improving natural grasslands, and respecialization of agricultural enterprises. 13. Laws of the Belarus Republic "On Social Protection of Citizens Affected by the Chernobyl Disaster" and "On the Legal Status of Territories Subjected to Radioactive Contamination as a Result of the Chernobyl Disaster," the first legislative acts, are running up against considerable financial difficulties in their implementation; assistance of republics of the former USSR has practically stopped, especially in convalescence of more than 580,000 children. Considering the limited capabilities of Belarus in sanatorium and health resort facilities for convalescence of children (70,000 a year), an immediate task is to set up a sanitorium-convalescence base in the republic for 300,000-500,000 children. Priority and long-term plans should include setting up children's year-round sanitorium-convalescence centers in clean regions of Belarus with incorporation of foreign investments, offering tax privileges for such centers and their founders. 14. In connection with the scarcity of reliable data in world science about the effect of low doses of radiation andthe no-threshold effect of radiation on man, and passage of new recommendations by the International Commission on Radiation Protection in November 1990 with appreciably lower limits of radiation doses for professionals of less than 20 mSv per year (formerly 50 mSv per year) and for the populace of less than 1 mSv per year (formerly 5 mSv per year), particular attention in the republic must be given to minimizing the collective dose of irradiation, more precisely determining the effect of low doses of irradiation on healthy populations, especially for radiosensitive critical groups (a list of 34 illnesses is given in NRB-76/87), and working out effective measures for the population on territories with contamination density of not only 555-1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and 185- 555 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], but also with contamination density of 37-185 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], where the effective equivalent dose exceeds 1 mSv per year.
