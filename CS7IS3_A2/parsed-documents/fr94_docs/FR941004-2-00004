FR941004-2-00004 FR941004-2-00003 [A&hyph;557&hyph;808] Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From Malaysia agency: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. effective date: October 4, 1994. for further information contact: Thomas McGinty or Peter Wilkniss, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;5055 and (202) 482&hyph;0588, respectively. preliminary determination: We preliminarily determine that imports of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings (``pipe fittings'') from Malaysia are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on March 21, 1994, (59 FR 14148, March 25, 1994), the following events have occurred. On April 14, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination (see, ITC Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;691). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b) (1994), on April 29, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) issued its antidumping duty questionnaire to Malaysia Mining Corporation Pipe & Fitting Sdn Bhd (MMCPNF), the Malaysian company identified by both petitioner and the U.S. Embassy in Malaysia (by cable to the Department) as the primary exporter of the subject merchandise to the U.S. during the POI. On May 27, 1994, the Department received a letter from the Government of Malaysia stating that MMCPNF was placed in receivership in October 1993, ceased production at that time, and is currently in the process of selling its assets. Therefore, MMCPNF would not be responding to the Department's antidumping duty questionnaire. On June 3, 1994, the Department received a letter from petitioner in which the petitioner named another Malaysian producer of pipe fittings, Taiyo Steel Corporation (Taiyo). In order to ensure that all potential respondents were identified, we then cabled the U.S. Embassy in Malaysia a second time requesting information on Taiyo and any other Malaysian producers of pipe fittings. The U.S. Embassy responded that no company by that name could be found and identified no other Malaysian producers of pipe fittings.
