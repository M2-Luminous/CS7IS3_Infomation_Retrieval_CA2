According to our information from Washington, the U.S. ambassador strongly suggested that the State Department push the UN Secretariat to amend the initial text of the secretary general's report to not blame the Turkish side for the failure of the talks. According to the same information, a close supporter of this effort by Mr. Boucher was Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special coordinator on Cyprus; however, the actions and initiative were the U.S. ambassador's. The same information also notes that one of the reasons that led Mr. Boucher to this initiative, besides, of course, the fact that this effort is part of the greater U.S. policy toward Cyprus and the Turks, is the fact that he has been a diplomat in Cyprus for such a short time that he has not developed a greater perspective for progress on the Cyprus issue.
