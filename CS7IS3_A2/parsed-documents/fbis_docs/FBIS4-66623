Like bread rolls when they cost 1 Algerian dinar, the daily national newspapers are much in demand by residents of Batna, who want to know more about the prisoner escape at the Tazoult prison. For the time being, they make do with the little information that has been published, with the grapevine, and comments made by young people and the unemployeed who spend their time watching the military roadblock set up on the road to Khenchela, about 4 km from the main gate at the Lambese prison. They are credulous and hope they will witness the arrest of escapees. Any one of the latter who would venture to return to the scene of the crime, the most spectacular that Batna has had to experience in ages, would be very naive. Often their eyes as well as those of the majority of citizens are glued to the skies watching the National People's Army's MI-8 helicopters searching for the escaped prisoners. For some, the bird has flown the coop while for others it is certain that the escaped prisoners--particularly the last ones who got out of Lambese who fled across the fields on foot--are still hiding in town. Neither is entirely wrong. Why? First, because it has been confirmed by the escaped and ultimately arrested prisoners that trucks and light vehicles awaited the most important among the escapees (those sentenced to death by the special courts) so as to provide them with quick transportation. The other prisoners (common criminals and special courts) skedaddled with the help of their legs. The revelations of those arrested, which we will publish in our next issue, do show that according to "rank," i.e., the sentence, each escapee was accorded special treatment by the attackers. Next, because the search operations carried out by the combined police forces on the outskirts of Batna made it possible to state that the attackers and the escapees--at least some of them--are not far, but they are reported to have dispersed: on Monday, at their 500 residential unit building in downtown Batna, security forces received information on the presence of one--"very dangerous"--of the escapees; the following day (that is, yesterday), the famous "Echanfara," sentenced to 77 years in prison in connection with several cases, returned to his cell. We should add that there exists a second "Echanfara" who was sentenced to death and is--still--incarcerated in...Berrouaghia. On the subject of cells, let us point out that those in bloc 12 in the Lambese prison were completely torn up (bedding, etc.) by both prisoners and those who escaped. Everywhere there are signs of bullets. On the walls, on the ground, on the gates, the attackers were sufficiently armed, especially with munitions. The majority were young men--aged 20 to 22--supervised by even better armed "individuals." One of them had an RPJ. We will come back to this. Whether it be at the staff management or the prison guard level, everyone is deeply affected by this "catastrophe" that has befallen the Lambese prison, which had the reputation of being a citadel. Everyone says that accomplices inside the prison had a fatal influence. Some guards were not expecting such "treason" on the part of colleagues whom they had rubbed shoulders with for years, whereas others believe that "hardship is good for something," inasmuch as today all the authorities are being careful. The commission of inquiry that has been set up spent yesterday at the site of the breakout, where it listened to evidence and statements by prison staff. We shall return to this.
