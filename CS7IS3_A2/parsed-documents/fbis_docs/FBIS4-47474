The principle of this method is based on the dependence of the hydrooptical properties, reflectivity and absorptivity, on the film thickness. These relations were studied experimentally with an XeCl-laser exciting the films with 308 nm radiation. Both absorption and emission spectra of various petroleum products, lubricants and fuels in cyclohexane solution, were measured in a spectrophotometer. The fluorescence intensity of such films on water was measured with a laboratory apparatus which included this XeCl laser and an aligning it He-Ne laser, two photomultipliers, a pyroelectric radiation receiver, an MDR-4 monochromator with a spectrally 2 nm wide slit, and four objectives consisting each of a mating biconvex and concavo-plane lens pair. A rotating wedge diverted a part of the excitation beam through either the first objective into the first photomultiplier or through the second objective into the pyroelectric radiation receiver. A right-angle prism reflected the remaining part of the excitation radiation through the third objective into the test cell with a specimen. A rotating plane mirror reflected the radiation from the fluorescing specimen through the fourth objective and then the monochromator into the second photomultiplier. Tests were performed on successively 3-9-15-30 �m thick films, with an XeCl-laser emitting radiation in pulses of 30 mJ energy and 30 ns duration at an either 0.1 Hz or 0.25 Hz repetition rate. Fluorescence was recorded within the 320-410 nm band, the maximum fluorescence signal shifting farter into the long-wave region as a light petroleum product was being replaced with successively heavier ones. With increasing film thickness, the fluorescence signal normalized to the Raman scattering signal was found to increase up to the fluorescence saturation level. Therefore, use of an excimer laser is recommended only for thin (d < 15 �m) films of petroleum products on water. Figures 3; references 9.
