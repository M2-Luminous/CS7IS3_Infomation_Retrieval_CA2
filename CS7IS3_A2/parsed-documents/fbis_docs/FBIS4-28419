The commentary says: The June 10 independence movement which was the biggest anti-Japanese patriotic struggle in Korea in the middle of the 1920s dealt a heavy blow to the brutal colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists and powerfully demonstrated the indomitable will and stamina of the people not to tolerate the Japanese imperialists' aggression and occupation policy in Korea. Much water has flown under the bridge since then. But national sovereignty has not yet been fully achieved nationwide. The U.S. imperialists keeping South Korea under their military occupation have carried to an unprecedented extent their anti-DPRK campaign to stifle it, under the false pretext of "nuclear suspicion against the North," and the Japanese reactionaries are going to repeat the past history of crimes, openly crying for "legislative arrangements" to cope with "an event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula. The Kim Yong-sam group, in a bid to stay on in power, is making no bones of converting South Korea into a test ground of the U.S. "new military strategy," a military intelligence base against the North and a market of surplus agricultural and livestock products and old and new weapons. The United States must renounce its anachronistic policy of occupation, withdraw its troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea and come out with a sincere attitude to the DPRK-U.S. talks for a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula. The Japanese reactionaries must give up the hostile policy toward the DPRK and the scheme to stage a comeback to Korea and the Kim Yong-sam group must discard the foolish dream of getting profits through gambling over the issue related to the destiny of the nation. Peace and reunification are the unanimous demand and will of the whole nation. Nobody can break this will of our people.
