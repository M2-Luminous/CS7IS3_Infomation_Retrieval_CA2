FR941227-0-00039 FR941227-0-00009 The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;26&hyph;02 de Havilland, Inc.: Amendment 39&hyph;9098. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;46&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes, serial numbers 003 through 369, inclusive; equipped with passenger service units (PSU) have part numbers 10&hyph;1418&hyph;1 or &hyph;2, or 10&hyph;1081&hyph;1 through &hyph;8; certificated in any category. Note 1: This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (c) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent overheating of the passenger service unit (PSU) printed circuit board and power supply connectors, which could lead to a fire in the PSU, accomplish the following: (a) Within 300 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, or within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, or within 12 months after any previous inspection conducted prior to the effective date in accordance with this paragraph, whichever occurs later: Conduct a visual inspection of all PSU printed circuit boards and power supply connectors to detect corrosion and evidence of overheating, in accordance with paragraph III. of de Havilland Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A8&hyph;33&hyph;30, Revision `A', dated December 18, 1992. Note 2: The overheat condition referred to in this paragraph is the discoloration of the printed circuit board around the connector interfaces, and not the light conformal coating discoloration resulting from the normal operation of high current devices mounted on the printed circuit board. (1) If no corrosion or evidence of overheating is detected, repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 12 months. (2) If any corrosion or evidence of overheating of the PSU printed circuit board is detected as a result of any inspection, prior to further flight, either repair or replace the PSU printed circuit board in accordance with the service bulletin. Thereafter, repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 12 months. (3) If any corrosion or evidence of overheating of the power supply connectors is detected as a result of any inspection, prior to further flight, replace the affected power supply connector in accordance with the service bulletin. Thereafter, repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 12 months. (b) Within 24 months after the effective date of this AD, install Modification 8/1950 in accordance with de Havilland Service Bulletin S.B. 8&hyph;33&hyph;34, dated August 10, 1993. Installation of this modification constitutes terminating action for the inspections required by paragraph (a) of this AD. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, New York ACO. Note 3: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the New York ACO. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (e) The inspections shall be done in accordance with de Havilland Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A8&hyph;33&hyph;30, Revision `A', dated December 18, 1992. The modification shall be done in accordance with de Havilland Service Bulletin S.B. 8&hyph;33&hyph;34, dated August 10, 1993. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from de Havilland, Inc., Garratt Boulevard, Downsview, Ontario M3K 1Y5, Canada. Copies may be inspected at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, New York Aircraft Certification Office, 181 South Franklin Avenue, Room 202, Valley Stream, New York; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. (f) This amendment becomes effective on January 26, 1995. Issued in Renton, Washington, on December 12, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30940 Filed 12&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;U
