This will be the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries after the embassy had been closed for more than two decades because of endless civil war. However, sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Kingdom of Cambodia have not specified the date the embassy will officially be opened. Eng Roland -- an official of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and former minister of tourism in the provisional national government of Cambodia, and who has been appointed ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Thailand -- has expressed his determination to improve the relations between the two neighboring countries, and in particular to avoid mutual misunderstanding. Roland also optimistically hopes that relations between the two countries will improve once the Cambodian Embassy is opened. This first Cambodian diplomat did not elaborate on what he called mutual misunderstanding. However, his statement was thought to have referred to the war of words between the Cambodian and Thai Governments at the end of April and early May because of the Khmer Rouge issue. It may be remembered that the Khmer Rouge problem caused a fairly strong verbal exchange between government leaders and foreign ministers of Cambodia and Thailand. The Cambodian Government believed and had proof to show that Thailand did indeed support the Khmer Rouge in attacks against government troops in western Cambodia. As for Thailand, it affirmed that it had never provided assistance as accused by the Cambodian Government. Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, used strong words, even saying that the matter will be taken up with the UN Security Council. Howver, the troubled atmosphere between Cambodia and Thailand became relaxed through a diplomatic settlement. Eng Roland did not discuss how he will start his work with Thailand. However, it is understood that diplomacy with Thailand is very important to put pressure on the Khmer Rouge at a time when the government wants to have something clear from Thailand. It is worth noting that the Cambodian Embassy in Thailand has suffered only slightly and repairs have already been made. The embassy is located on Ratdamri Road in Bangkok.
