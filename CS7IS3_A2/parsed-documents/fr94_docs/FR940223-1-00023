The pounds of nonfat milk solids shall be computed by multiplying the producer skim milk pounds so assigned by the percentage of nonfat milk solids in the handler's receipts of producer skim milk during the month for each report filed separately; (f) With respect to skim milk and butterfat overages assigned pursuant to §1124.44(a)(15), (b), and paragraph (f)(6) of this section: (1) Multiply the total pounds of butterfat by the butterfat price; (2) Multiply the skim milk pounds assigned to Class I by the skim milk price; (3) Multiply the pounds of nonfat milk solids associated with the skim milk pounds assigned to Class II and III by the nonfat milk solids price; (4) Multiply the combined skim milk and butterfat pounds assigned to Class I by the difference between the Class I price, adjusted for location, and the Class III price; (5) Multiply the combined skim milk and butterfat pounds assigned to Class II by the difference between the Class II price and the Class III price; and (6) Overage at a nonpool plant that is located on the same premises as a pool plant shall be prorated between the quantity of skim and butterfat received by transfer from the pool plant and other source milk received at the nonpool plant. The pool plant operator's obligation to the pool with respect to such overage will be computed by adding the prorated pounds of skim milk and butterfat to the amounts assigned pursuant to §1124.44(a)(15) and (b); (g) With respect to skim milk and butterfat assigned to shrinkage pursuant to §1124.44(a)(10) and (b): (1) Multiply the total pounds of butterfat by the butterfat price; (2) Multiply the skim milk pounds assigned to Class I by the skim milk price; (3) Multiply the pounds of nonfat milk solids associated with the skim milk pounds assigned to Class II and III by the nonfat milk solids price; (4) Multiply the combined skim milk and butterfat pounds assigned to Class I by the difference between the Class I price, adjusted for location, and the Class III price; (5) Multiply the combined skim milk and butterfat pounds assigned to Class II by the difference between the Class II price and the Class III price; and
