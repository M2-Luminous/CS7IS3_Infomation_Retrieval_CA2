The deal, whose terms in line with the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR, were made public at the end of last year, has been officially endorsed by the Russian cabinet, a Vice-Chairman of Glavkosmos, Russia's major space research establishment, has said in an interview with Interfax. In line with new terms, Russia is to deliver at least four cryogenic boosters to India for its SLV-3 rockets. This is twice more than envisaged by the contract signed by Glavkosmos in 1991. Lifted up by a Russian booster, SLV-3 will be able to put loads in orbit about 36,000 kilometers above the earth. As the General Director of Russia's Space Agency Yuriy Koptev has told Interfax, supplies of ready-made cryogenic blocks are within MTCR, which Russia wished to join by signing a memorandum of intent in Washington on September 2, 1993. In Koptev's words, two additional blocks will be shipped to India to compensate for Russia's failure to meet the initial commitments, concerning the supply of technologies in bypass of MTCR. Koptev declared that Russia had kept virtually intact the volume of financing, totalling $300 million, envisaged by the contract. India is to get the first booster next year.
