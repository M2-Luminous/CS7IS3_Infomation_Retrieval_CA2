He emphasized the great importance of the national propaganda and ideological work conference and urged: Leaders at all levels in the municipality should conscientiously relay, study, and implement the guidelines of the conference and, in particular, study well the important speeches of Comrade Jiang Zemin and other leading comrades. We should implement the basic principles for this year's work as defined by the central authorities and take the initiative in subordinating to and serving the endeavor of "seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain stability," which meets the basic interests of the work of the entire party. Propaganda and ideological work should advocate concerted efforts. We should implement the guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work conference, especially the speech of Comrade Jiang Zemin. Chen Xitong pointed out: Beijing's propaganda and ideological work has produced great achievements in publicizing Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, raising ideological and theoretical levels, and adhering to the correct press guidance over the past few years. It has also made important contributions to ensuring the stability of the capital, promoting economic construction, reform, and opening up, and strengthening the socialist spiritual civilization. As has been proven in practice, Beijing's contingents of propaganda, ideological, and theoretical workers can withstand tests. Chen Xitong emphasized: In the new situation where the establishment of the socialist market economy system is accelerated, it is very important to achieve success in propaganda and ideological work. The main melody of propaganda and ideological work is publicizing socialism with Chinese characteristics. A good command of this main melody will bring about success in carrying out propaganda work correctly and effectively. We should arm the people with scientific theories, guide them with correct public opinion, mold them with noble spirit, and encourage them with outstanding works. It is hoped that party organizations at all levels will strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological work and that all trades and professions will support propaganda and ideological work. Chen Xitong put forward clear requirements on improvement of the contingents of propaganda and ideological workers. He said: To make propaganda and ideological work successful, the contingents of propaganda cadres should first intensify the study of the basic theory and basic knowledge of Marxism and Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. They should learn to resolve issues with Marxist stand, viewpoints, and methods. We should step up efforts to improve the leading bodies of propaganda and ideological fronts, pay attention to promoting young cadres, and maintain the stability of the contingents of propaganda and ideological cadres.
