FR941013-1-00023 FR941013-1-00005 Reregistration Fees Following the completion of the initial registration process, DEA will dedicate ongoing resources to insuring the controls of the DCDCA are being maintained, protecting the integrity of the system, and providing assistance, guidance, and interpretation of the chemical control requirements to the registrants. These costs, along with application processing costs will establish the basis for the annual reregistration fee. Since many of these costs will be averaged across the registrant population, it is only possible to establish a reregistration fee at this time based upon estimated populations. After the full second year of the regulations implementing the DCDCA, the fee schedule will be reviewed, as required by Circular A&hyph;25, and a new fee structure proposed for public comment, based upon the actual registrant population. As stated above, DEA will complete the registration process for all non-retail applicants in the first year. Investigative resources devoted to these pre-registration investigations (approximately 12 workyears) will be directed towards completion of the pre-registration process of retail distributor applicants in the second year. At the non-retail level, DEA will dedicate eight workyears of investigator time to conduct follow-up investigations of approximately 75 non-retail firms. Each investigation will require a comprehensive review of each registrant's records, reporting systems and security provisions to ensure that the registrant is complying with the chemical control requirements, and chemicals are not being distributed to persons seeking to divert them. Investigators will conduct a comprehensive on-site review of the registrant's records; verification of transactions and purchasers, including record checks of and visits to purchasers; travel; and report preparation. This cost, plus the reregistration processing fee and the above listed indirect costs averaged over the estimated 1500 non-retail registrants will constitute the non-retail reregistration fee. At the retail level, due to the large volume of firms and the general lack of experience in the required record-keeping and reporting requirements, DEA will conduct a greater number of follow-up investigations. However, in light of the anticipated smaller volumes of regulated transactions of such firms, each follow-up is scheduled for a smaller amount of on-site time. DEA anticipates that two Diversion Investigator workyears will be required to conduct follow-up investigations at the retail level. This cost, plus the reregistration processing fee and above listed indirect costs averaged over the estimated 2000 retail distributors registered in the first year will constitute the reregistration fee. As DEA completes the second year of the chemical registration program, the bulk of the retail distributor new applications will have been processed, thus freeing the resources assigned to conduct the registration investigations. In the following years, there will be a greater number of registrants submitting applications for reregistration. DEA will dedicate proportionally greater resources to these registrants. As noted earlier, following the initial two years of the registration program, DEA will conduct a review of the fee structure and, as needed, publish a notice in the Federal Register regarding amendment of the fee schedule. Registration Costs. The costs associated with the registration process are as follows. DEA estimates that 1,500 non-retail applications and approximately 10,000 retail applications will be received. As previously stated, the personnel costs listed below include all direct and indirect costs, including salaries, fringe benefits (such as life and health insurance and retirement) and travel; physical overhead, including material and supply costs such as forms, postage, equipment, rent and utilities:
