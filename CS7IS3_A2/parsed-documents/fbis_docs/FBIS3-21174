Metals with differing specific gravities were the raw materials for producing, in the weightless environment of space, a superconducting alloy with uniform composition, and wire was drawn from this material after it had been recovered on earth. Hopes had been placed on this alloy of aluminum, lead and bismuth for use in superconduction and vibration prevention. However, since the specific gravities of aluminum and lead are too disparate on the earth, attempts to produce a high-quality alloy have failed because the aluminum and lead separated into two layers. NRIM faced this challenge with the primary materials experiments conducted on the space shuttle Endeavor by astronaut Mori, and the alloy was produced in a weightless environment.
