The consequences of this aggression are over 200,000 killed and some 1,250,000 refugees and displaced persons. Unfortunately, the Serbian occupying forces are continuing the process of ethnic cleansing with relentless intensity, particularly in the areas of Banja Luka, Prijedor, Stipovo, Jajce, and other parts of the Bosnian Krajina. The international public is acquainted with the dramatic news of murders and other forms of pressure against the non-Serbian population and with preparations for the evacuation of the remaining non-Serbian population. The government uses this occasion to lodge an energetic protest because of the fact that the international community is not showing a readiness to stop the aggressor in this fascist endeavor. We call on the United Nations, the European Union, and the United States to do everything in their power to prevent the conclusion of the process of ethnic cleansing and that all citizens are granted the elementary conditions for safety of property and personal safety, and are guaranteed all other human liberties and rights established by international treaties and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Constitution. We call on all states, signatories of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide from 1949 to carry out immediately all the obligations pursuant to this convention. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government believes that the international community has failed to react to the Serbo-Montenegrin aggressor's attacks at Gorazde and Bihac. Since these attacks are attacks on protected areas as stipulated by UN Resolution 824, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government has taken measures with the goal of activating the mechanisms of the UN Security Council in order to stop these attacks and protect the civilian population. The government maintains the position that the aggressor is calling into question the continuation of peace negotiations and that the international community is obliged to take all measures to stop the attacks and create conditions for the continuation of the peace process.
