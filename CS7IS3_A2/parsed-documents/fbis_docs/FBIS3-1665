Reportedly, in the draft of the government work report for soliciting opinions, the passage on the Hong Kong issue is placed in the sixth part, entitled "Actively Advancing the Motherland's Peaceful Reunification." The Hong Kong issue is mentioned there, together with the issues of Taiwan and Macao. The gist of the passage is: With time elapsing, the date for China to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao is drawing near. The British side must bear complete responsibility for the termination of the Sino-British talks on arrangements for the 1994-95 elections in Hong Kong. We hope the British Hong Kong authorities will not move farther and farther ahead along the wrong course. No matter what twists and turns there are, the Chinese Government and people have the determination and ability to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on time, and are full of confidence in guaranteeing Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. By contrast, the gist of the passage on the Macao issue is: Since the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, cooperation between China and Portugal on the Macao issue has made smooth progress, and we are satisfied with this. It was generally held that the passage of the government work report (draft for soliciting opinions) concerning Hong Kong was mildly worded and still left some leeway. It was not quite different from what Li Peng said at the Spring Festival gala, and did not express anything new. As the draft was written before the recent political events in Hong Kong, it was expected that the passage concerning Hong Kong would be amended before the official delivery of the report. Last year, at the First Session of the Eighth NPC, Li Peng made a major impromptu amendment when reading the relevant passage in his government work report. At that time, the Hong Kong governor had just gazetted part of his constitutional reform package. Li Peng added the following passage: "Now, the British side again has placed artificial obstacles to cooperation, and the British Government must bear whole responsibility for all serious consequences caused by this action." The sources in Beijing said: Because Sino-British relations this year have become worse, added to the recent events, Li Peng's amended government work report will express the Chinese side's stronger attacks against the British side, and such words as "it is hoped that the British Hong Kong authorities will..." are to be deleted and replaced with a call for Hong Kong people to unite and make contributions to maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. It is still unknown whether the work report will reiterate the point that the three-tiered council structure built by the British Hong Kong authorities will be completely brought to an end on 1 July 1997. In short, at the coming NPC session, the passage on Hong Kong issues in Li Peng's government work report may again include something "impromptu" like that of last year.
