Stating this here Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Malaysian companies would now have to renegotiate with new contracting partners if they wanted to bid for such projects in future. The government's move would not, however, affect existing two-way trade and investments between both countries, he told a press conference after chairing the National Finance Council meeting here. The decision follows the government's concern over adverse reports in certain British newspapers which suggested that some Malaysian leaders were corrupt.
