FR940323-2-00144 FR940323-2-00113 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard [CGD 94&hyph;006] Announcement of Global Positioning System (GPS) Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and Its Impact on Vessel Carriage Requirement Regulations agency: Coast Guard, DOT. action: Notice. Summary: The Department of Defense has notified the Department of Transportation that the Global Positioning System (GPS) has reached its Initial Operational Capability (IOC). A GPS receiver now meets the carriage requirements for electronic position fixing devices under 33 CFR 164.41 (a)(2). dates: Effective December 8, 1993, the Coast Guard will accept a GPS receiver as an electronic position fixing device satisfying the requirements of 33 CFR 164.41. addresses: If so indicated, documents referenced in this preamble are available for inspection or copying at the office of the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001 between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (202) 267&hyph;1477. for further information contact: LCDR Jean Butler, Chief, Radio Aids Applications and Developments Branch, Radionavigation Division, Office of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services, USCG Headquarters, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001, telephone 202&hyph;267&hyph;0298. A copy of this notice may be obtained by calling the Coast Guard's toll-free Boating Safety Hotline, 1&hyph;800&hyph;368&hyph;5647. In Washington, DC, call 267&hyph;0780. Background The Federal Radionavigation Plan (FRP), jointly prepared by the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Transportation (DOT) on a biennial basis, contains further information concerning navigation, radionavigation system descriptions, and plans for government operated radionavigation systems. It is available to the public through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). GPS is a DOD-developed, worldwide, satellite-based radionavigation system that will be the primary radionavigation system well into the next century. When fully operational, the GPS will be composed of 24 satellites in six orbital planes. The spacing of the satellites in orbit will be arranged so that a minimum of five satellites will be in view to users worldwide. Full Operational Capability will be achieved when 24 operational, production model satellites (Block II or newer) are operating in their assigned orbits and when the constellation has successfully completed testing for operational military functionality. This is not expected to occur until 1995. GPS Initial Operational Capability (IOC) has been met and means that 24 GPS satellites (any model) are operating in their assigned orbits, are available for navigation, and provide the SPS levels of service as defined in the FRP. Any planned disruption of the GPS in peacetime will be subject to a minimum 48-hour advance notice provided by the DOD to the Coast Guard GPS Information Center (GPSIC). A disruption is defined as periods in which the GPS is not capable of providing Standard Positioning Service as defined in the FRP. Unplanned system outages resulting from system malfunctions or unscheduled maintenance will be announced by the GPSIC as they become known.
