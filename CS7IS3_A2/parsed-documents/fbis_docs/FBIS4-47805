Speaking to a Rwandan Government delegation which is in the country for peace talks, Honorable Malecela said last night that all sides in the conflict must agree on three issues which are vital to ending the hatred between them. The prime minister said the issues include the need to immediately stop the war between the government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] forces, an end to the killing of innocent civilians, and the implementation of the peace agreement signed in Arusha in August last year. The Rwandan Government delegation led by Communications and Transport Minister Andre Ntagerura and that of the RPF led by RPF Chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe are in Arusha for a meeting aimed at bringing peace to Rwanda. Because of the RPF's stand that it cannot sit at the same table as the government delegation, the prime minister is compelled to meet the delegations in different sessions at the Arusha State Lodge. This morning Honorable Malecela has held talks with the RPF delegation.
