It meets IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) recommended standards for testing a large number of ratios and parameters: optical power vs current, voltage vs current, differential quantum efficiency, threshold current, optical spectrum half-width, peak wavelength, side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR), far-field pattern (FFP), temperature characteristics, etc. For interested manufacturers, investment for a 50-100-square-meter production line is about 1-1.5 million yuan, and annual sales revenue and annual profit are estimated to be about 1.5-2 million yuan and 500,000-600,000 yuan, respectively.
