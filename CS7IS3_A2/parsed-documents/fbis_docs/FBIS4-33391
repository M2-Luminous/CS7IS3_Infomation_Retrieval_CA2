In a document evaluating the current administration's actions in government, the Herreraist faction characterizes this administration "as the first elected without restrictions" since the military regime. The document points out the main achievements of the administration headed by Luis Alberto Lacalle, emphasizing the "transformations and changes in concepts, the economic and social achievements, and the most incomparable and far-reaching social work of the past few decades." The document also states that "we want neither an all-encompassing nor an absentee government." The report, distributed among Herreraist constituents, describes the government as having "concluded the transition period that began with the 1984 elections, which were carried out with exclusions (...) The Herreraist government was the first to be elected without restrictions following the de facto regimes." The document mentions the attitude of current administration employees, especially their "firm, prudent, and clear conduct in attaining national goals, without demagoguery or a desire for political gain; their respect for the law and the Constitution; and their search for a consensus in resolving state problems in the most important areas of national life." The document mentions the basic actions of government. It mentions the following economic achievements: "balanced public finances; clear and reliable exchange and monetary policies; inflation is being fought against; public and private financial institutions are operating within the rules and controls that generate trust in the financial system; tax evasion and organized smuggling are being decidedly engaged; and the encouragement of productive retooling, which is being promoted by private initiative." In the area of labor relations, the document points out that "management and workers negotiate collective agreements without the state's participation. Nevertheless, the state has greatly supported collective bargaining. The concept of productivity has been incorporated into labor relations, giving rise to new forms of relationships between companies and their employees. Private and government-owned enterprises work out far-reaching collective agreements that ensure peaceful labor relations. The official banking sector programmed and enforced the equalization of salaries with the private sector." With regard to agriculture, the report underlines the reduction of tariffs on the importation of capital goods, the elimination of the tax on the National Silo Fund, (and) the reduction of the Imesi [specific domestic tax] levied on the sale of diesel oil, which has led to a drop in the price of this type of fuel." The document moreover counts "the eradication of foot-and-mouth disease" and "the strengthening of agricultural research" as achievements. It also underscores the attainments in the area of tourism, noting that "the objectives that were established have been greatly surpassed, as our 1995 goal of 2 million visitors was met in 1993. It is estimated that Uruguay will meet the target of 3 million tourists per year by the year 2000." The tract enumerates the laws proposed by the government which it labels "revolutionary laws." It mentions the process of the so-called "law on government-owned enterprises," including its "partial" abolishment following the plebiscite held on 13 December 1992. The document contends that pursuant to the provisions of this law that remain in effect, the executive branch "liquidated ILPE [State Seal and Fishing Industry], and implemented the necessary mechanisms to allow private capital to buy a share in Pluna [Uruguayan National Airlines]." It then mentions such achievements as the reform of the port administration system, the end of the insurance monopoly, and the elimination of red tape through the National Debureaucratization Program (Pronade)." The document highlights the work done in the area of housing. The Uruguayan Mortgage Bank constructed 10,057 homes between 1990 and 1993, and granted 7,280 personal loans.
