Although there is still no official information from the Mexican Government, Insulza told Radio Cooperativa that yesterday shortly after noon he received reports from Mexico City announcing the partial lifting of the embargo on the shipment. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What news is there about the embargo on the Chilean fruit shipment? [Insunza] Look, the situation is still rather confusing. According to the information we have, the embargo on the cargo from the first ship that was unloaded has been lifted, with the exception of a few boxes where a dead larva was found, which seems to have caused some problems and prompted the measure. I reiterate that there is no reason for this measure because Mexico has this type of larva, and therefore it poses no threat. The second ship is allegedly being subjected to a new inspection. [end recording] Insulza explained that the Mexican embargo was ordered on 18 March, and apparently there was some misunderstanding because Chilean authorities were not informed appropriately about the measures. The acting foreign minister explained that on 3 March, the Mexicans decided to ban the entry of Chilean fruit that could be infested with the fruit fly. The decision was made after the Chilean Government, in compliance with the agreements in force, informed the Mexican Government about the existence of the fruit fly in Santiago. Mexico immediately stepped up restrictions, thus establishing new obstacles for the entry of Chilean fruit. On 7 March, Mexico decided to circumscribe restrictions for the entry of Chilean fruit, and increased to 8 km the radius around the site where the presence of the fruit fly was detected. In view of this, Jose Miguel Insulza reiterated that the situation is regarded as serious by the Chilean Government, and admitted that despite the good will of Mexican authorities the measure causes material and intangible damages to Chilean producers.
