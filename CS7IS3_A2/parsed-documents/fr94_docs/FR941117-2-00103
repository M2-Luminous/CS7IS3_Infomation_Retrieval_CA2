The committee shall consist of five regular members of NCUA's senior staff: the Executive Director, the Director of the Office of Examination and Insurance, the General Counsel, one Regional Director, and one additional senior staff or Board staff member. An alternate Regional Director shall be appointed to consider matters arising in the member Regional Director's region. The term of committee service for the Regional Director, alternate Regional Director and additional member is two years. These members may be appointed for additional terms. All other members will serve permanently. The Executive Director shall serve as the chairperson of the committee and shall only vote in the case of a tie. All other members shall have one vote. At least three members will be present at each committee meeting. A majority vote is required for action on an appeal. Regular committee meetings shall be held four times a year. Meetings via teleconference are acceptable. Regular meetings may be canceled and special meetings may called by the Executive Director. Appeals may be made by all federally insured credit unions. The committee shall hear appeals of material supervisory determinations made by the NCUA. Such determinations are limited to: (1) composite CAMEL rating of a 4 or 5; (2) adequacy of loan loss reserve provisions; and (3) loan classifications on loans that are significant to a credit union. A determination is appealable only after a decision has been made by an official of the appropriate NCUA Regional Office. Appeals shall be submitted in writing to the Chairman of the committee, within 30 days of the regional office's decision. Appeals shall be mailed or delivered to Chairman, Supervisory Review Committee, NCUA, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314&hyph;3428.

The information must be submitted to the committee within 15 days of receipt of the committee request. The committee shall make a determination on the appeal within 90 days from the date of the receipt of an appeal by the committee or of its receipt of any requested additional information. The time requirements set forth above are subject to adjustment by the committee, either on its own or upon request of the appellant or the region involved. The committee's determination shall be submitted in writing to the NCUA Board. Within seven working days, each Board member will sign indicating whether they agree with the committee's determination. If a majority of the Board members agree, the determination shall be final and the parties so notified. If a majority of the Board members do not agree, the parties will be notified, and the Board will proceed with the final appeal. Appellants can seek redress from alleged retaliation through NCUA's Office of Inspector General. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28366 Filed 11&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7535&hyph;01&hyph;P&hyph;M
