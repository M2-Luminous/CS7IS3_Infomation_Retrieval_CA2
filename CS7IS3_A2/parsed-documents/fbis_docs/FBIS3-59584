Despite its name, this equipment, which should shed new light on the mechanisms of the reactions produced by the collision of heavy ions, was officially inaugurated at the Nuclear Physics Institute (IPN) of the Catholic University of Louvain-la-Neuve on 28 October. The ceremony was attended by several dozen physicists and engineers, among them Claude Detraz, director of the Institute of Nuclear Physics and Particle Physics (IN2P3) of France's CNRS [National Scientific Research Center], and individuals responsible for designing and developing the detector: Mr. Youssef, Mr. Masri, and Francis Hanappe, who are researchers at Belgium's National Scientific Research Fund (FNRS); and Guy Bizard and Bernard Heusch of the CNRS. Designed to be easily disassembled and moved, Demon (Modular Neutron Detector) was financed equally by the IN2P3/CNRS and the FNRS (20 million Belgian francs each) and built at four laboratories: the nuclear physics laboratories at the Free University of Brussels and the University of Louvain-la-Neuve, the Corpuscular Physics Laboratory (LPC) in Caen, and the Nuclear Research Center (CRN) in Strasbourg. The result is that following a preliminary series of measurements scheduled for December with Cyclone (the IPN's cyclotron), Demon will be transferred to GANIL (Large National Heavy Ion Accelerator) in Caen in 1994 and then to Vivitron in Strasbourg in 1995. Demon's designers emphasize that it constitutes "technological progress" chiefly because of the amount of electronics and informatics it contains. In other words, it could not have been built a few years ago. Demon also benefited from work in the same field that was done by Charles Ring on the Eurogam detector (used by Vivitron). What are the limits to the existence of nuclei--that is, what is the maximum number of nucleons possible in a nucleus, what are the respective proportions of neutrons and protons beyond which or below which a nucleus is no longer stable, and to what extent can one perturb a nucleus (by causing it to absorb energy) before it explodes (the phenomenon of multifragmentation)? Demon should help provide answers to some of those questions, which still constitute an unsolved problem in nuclear physics. Bernard Tamain of the LPC in Caen explains that in Louvain (where Cyclone delivers beams of 10 MeV per nucleon of energy) and in Strasbourg, the new apparatus, with its 96 detectors (including liquid scintillator plus photomultiplier) mounted on a spherical frame measuring four meters in diameter,<sup> 1</sup> will be "a chronometer making it possible to measure the fast fission of nuclei, the lifetime of a very hot nucleus, and those `reflex' times of nuclear matter that govern the fusion mechanisms." Its capabilities: times on the order of 100th of a billionth of a billionth of a second. In Caen, where the energy supplied to GANIL can reach 100 MeV per nucleon, the new equipment will be able to track the hottest nuclei up to temperatures of 100 billion degrees. But Demon will also be used as a microscope for studying the most "exotic" light nuclei (those presenting a large excess of neutrons compared to the corresponding ordinary nuclei) that it is possible to produce today, examples being lithium-11 and carbon-19. Lastly, the new installation will make it possible to measure neutron sizes down to one-billionth of a micrometer. It will therefore be possible to begin neutron detection--a difficult task compared to the detection of charged particles--within a few weeks using the equipment in question, which is unique in Europe. Hot Nuclei and Exotic Nuclei When perturbed by another nucleus, a target nucleus distributes the energy imparted to it among its components, the nucleons. If the excitation energy reaches a certain threshold and threatens its existence, the nucleus--which is then called "hot"--"cools" itself by the emission of protons and neutrons (the phenomenon of evaporation) or by fission into two or more fragments (known as multifragmentation). Studying the emission of neutrons enables one to learn about the excitation energy achieved by the nuclei, their de-excitation processes, and their lifetime (the time it takes them to return to stability). The hotter the nucleus, the stronger and faster the emissions. Heavy ion accelerators can also produce light nuclei which, unlike stable "ordinary" nuclei (in which the number of neutrons is close to that of protons), have too many neutrons. Examples are <sup> 11</sup> Li (three protons, eight neutrons) and <sup> 19</sup> C (six protons, 13 neutrons). In an "exotic" nucleus of that kind, neutrons will be randomly distributed in a "halo," making the nucleus very unstable. The nucleus will return to stability by emitting its least firmly bound neutrons. Detecting two neutrons simultaneously and measuring their speed (their "time of flight") and their angle of emission provides information on the limits to the existence of nuclear matter.

Twenty-four of those detectors, perfected by the CRN in Strasbourg in cooperation with Philips-France (in Brive-la-Gaillarde), are equipped with a Charged Particle Rejection System (Syrep) that also includes a scintillator combined with a photomultiplier.
