Yakovlev and V.V. Lazutkin, Heads of the Russian Federal Television and Radio Broadcasting Service" from Aleksey Simonov, former cochairman of the former Licensing Commission] [Text] Dear Aleksandr Nikolayevich and Valentin Valentinovich! This concerns the licensing of television and radio broadcasting, which has been charged to the federal service which you head under the president's Edict No. 2255 of 22 December. The Edict speaks about the preparation of a Statute where all the questions about licensing are to be explained and published. Permit me to ask: Where is this Statute? Why has it not been made public? Evidently by force of habit, because these matters have always been resolved by the bureaucratic method here. And with all my respect and sympathy for you, I have trouble believing that it will be your lot to break this "perpetual course of heavenly bodies." But the fact that the Statute should deal with licensing infringes upon the interests of hundreds of nonstate broadcasters (and how it affects them!), and the "bureaucratic nature" of decisions in this area may lead all these broadcasters who have come into being, those who are growing, and those who are becoming independent to the brink of ruin. But after all, it is precisely their existence, and only it, which actually makes it possible to form an opinion about the presence or absence of freedom of information in the country; by no means is this a procedure for appointing chiefs or a method of editing news reports on state channels. So forgive my persistence, but this concerns implementation of the most important article in the Constitution--and nothing less. For this reason, I ask that you consider this letter as a modest contribution to its protection. For nearly two years I was the cochairman of the Licensing Commission (formally, the Interim Broadcasting Commission), and my considerations are based on experience which is quite unique, for prior to this commission no one was concerned with the licensing of radio frequencies in our country. And the only available document which you could be guided by in your postulates was Council of Ministers Decree No. 500 of 26 September 1991, in accordance with which the commission was formed. So I would like to protect your Statute from this first mistake: do not repeat the decree's principal miscalculation and reject what is unprecedented in world licensing practice: the issuance of two licenses for one frequency--a broadcasting license (naturally, the one who broadcasts controls the frequency) and a technical license--which ties this frequency to a specific transmitter and its owner, which turns out to be an enterprise of the Ministry of Communications in 95 out of 100 cases. Well, what can we compare this with? Imagine that a deputy and the technician who provides him with a microphone have the same right to address the audience. Meanwhile, it is this very provision which has enabled the Ministry of Communications to retain its monopoly over the means of communication, which in the final analysis led to the shutdown of transmitters in dozens of regions in Russia. Secondly, in defining state policy in the field of licensing (and this is precisely the purpose of the Statute, obviously), you will have to overcome a natural bias toward concern for state television and radio to the detriment of nonstate, independent, and spontaneous broadcasting. After all, there are only two state channels, but there are already hundreds of independent broadcasters and, as never before, they need a fair law which protects them. Incidentally, from the viewpoint of licensing, broadcasting by "Ostankino" and RTV, as paradoxical as it may seem, is illegal at present: it has not been legalized by a license, unlike many nonstate companies. Thirdly. In its two years of existence, the Licensing Commission issued over 250 licenses. In most cases, for five years. Will your future Statute confirm them? Or will the new broom begin sweeping all over again, increasing the line of 500 or 600 broadcasters waiting their turn by another 250 because of the awkwardness of Decree No. 500 and because of the numerous spokes thrust into the wheels of the Licensing Commission by the Ministry of Communications? And after all, these 500 are broadcasting, but timidly, fearing an administrative outcry or arbitrariness, and not only because they are "making knucklebones" by any means. Among these "unbridled merchants" there are quite a few persons who consider broadcasting their duty to the people, to their audience which they have won and who have become accustomed to them. And who do not want to learn about their city, oblast, republic, and regional news from the infrequent mentions in the central channels' reporting. Now, when administrative arbitrariness in the regions has intensified to such an extent that a license is insufficient protection against it, the support of independent radio and television is so essential that universal preoccupation exclusively with the fate of the two state channels seems to me to be arrogant and--excuse me--shortsighted. The unified information space which everyone is so concerned about, by the way, does not mean that all programs everywhere are tied to the two state octopuses, accompanied by state protectionism with respect to the 89 small regional octopuses. The unity of this space lies in the diversity of choices accessible to the viewer in any part of Russia, a diversity supported by a wise law that applies to everyone, and a license is the guarantee of adherence to it. The commission in which I worked ordered back in July that they remain for a long time. I hope that all the licenses issued since 1 August, and quite a few have been issued since then, especially by the Ministry of Communications, will be nullified by your Statute, for someone should put an end to the squandering of state resources. During this time the last available ultrahigh frequency [detsimetrovyy] television channel in Moscow was pocketed, as well as frequencies for which competitions were conducted and there was a waiting line, and numerous channels in the regions where the Moscow "merchants," waving their new licenses, come looking for broadcasters on frequencies they have already obtained by circumventing the law. I realize that not everything is within your power, and you are unlikely to persuade the president that it is not good to give up a state channel with one's own hand, even to such a strong team as NTV, without competition and practically without serious discussion of the concept of broadcasting. But will the Statute contain articles which will help it refrain from such actions later on? The Statute, however you write it, is doomed to be temporary, for like any limited natural resource, radio frequencies need a unified law for their protection. And as I recall, there have been no less than five drafts of a law on television and radio broadcasting. The last one was prepared in those days when the next wave, the Bragin washout, once again mixed everything up in the turbulent sea of radio and television. Perhaps it should be adopted finally, and the Statute on state radio and television should be made one of the chapters in this Law, unified for everyone? And finally: will your Statute be able to prevent new attempts at blackmail by the Ministry of Communications? When the state monopoly sets conditions for the state, is only the economy behind this? Incidentally, the wages of ministry's employees come not only from payment of the state order to transmit the Ostankino or Russian signal. After all, they are flaying three independents, or commercial broadcasters, as it is more convenient for public consolation to call them, at the same time that state authorization is given. The prices are a little better than American prices in absolute figures, without any references to the exchange rate of hard currency. And there are no ministry employees who would not have these extra earnings "on the side." It is no coincidence that our commission was "dissolved" precisely at the point where it was butted by the horns of the ministry's desire not to give the opportunity to broadcasters to have their own transmitters and retransmitters. Only a strict antimonopoly policy with respect to communications enterprises can bring democracy to the situation in radio and television broadcasting. Otherwise, everything stays the same: a common state knife switch, which the unbridled fanatics at Ostankino repeatedly struggle to seize. It has now been two months that I have been trying to express these and other considerations to you, but in the meantime, for old times' sake, people who urgently need the legal right to conduct their broadcasting have been arriving from all over Russia. And they are telephoning. And they are asking: What shall we do? Where do we go? And while previously I was able and obliged to respond to this, it is your turn now. And I am addressing their questions to you with this letter.
