I decided to accept the invitation of the Metropolitan of Banat and of the Mayor of Timisoara to come to our Romanian land and pray together for our homeland. In spite of their promises, those who are ruling today do not allow me to be together with you where I had been invited, that is in Timisoara. They have not succeeded in overcoming the fear of those direct ties that exist between you and me, ties whose signs became evident two years ago when hundreds of you welcomed me with enthusiasm. The authorities are wrong. For all of you and for them, too, my presence among you represents the guarantee of civil and moral peace, as well as the spiritual peace that the Homeland needs in order to emerge from self-doubt, discouragement, and fear. Having confidence in what was said at the first talks that started two weeks ago on practical aspects of my journey, I hoped that the authorities finally understood that my only preoccupation is to make a contribution, with all my power, to the reconciliation of all Romanians, because only together can we revive Romania. Although I was ready to take into consideration all solutions in the name of the major interest of all Romanians and national unity, in spite of the wish showed by some people who are involved in administering the Homeland's affairs, I have to notice with sorrow that the highest level of the state leadership still upholds the unjust decision regarding my exclusion, a decision taken by the leaders of the communist state coup over 40 years ago. Romanians, because of you and for you, I do not want to lose hope. The Lord's resurrection is the triumph of hope over suspicion and we share the same belief in the triumph of life over death. Christ has arisen! This is the time when our patience has to yield results. Christ has arisen! The time has come for those who suffered injustice to rise and move on. We say the same prayer for our Homeland, for your families, and for your future. Christ has arisen! Romanians, my destiny is in your hands. My return depends on each of you, by respecting the freedom and dignity of each person. I know that many of you have publicly shown the wish to see me among you and I was greatly moved listening to the appeals of the representatives of the nation, of young people, of intellectuals, of trade unions, and of numerous associations. To all this one can add the thousands of letters that I receive from faithful fellow nationals. The time has come for us, after sacrifices and suffering, to be together at the revival of our homeland. On behalf of my family, I wish you happy holidays. So help us God! Mihai
