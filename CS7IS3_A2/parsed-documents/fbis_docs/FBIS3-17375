H. Nistad told ELTA. He confirmed information of ELTA released earlier that the assistance to Ignalina plant was suspended unless there is an agreement with Belarus preventing claims of the country to Swedish companies if a nuclear incident takes place in Ignalina. "The position of Belarus is very undetermined", Nistad said. Last November, Swedish Prime Minister appealed in written form to his Belarusian counterpart asking to explain the reasons why Belarus is not signing Vienna Convention on the civil responsibility for nuclear damages and not approving a law on nuclear energy. There is no answer so far, Nistad said. Director of Belarusian Institute of Energy problems Aleksandr Mikhalevich said there were no principal obstacles to sign the Vienna Convention or a bilateral agreement with Sweden. But "there are no people specialized in nuclear energy neither in Belarusian Government nor in Foreign Ministry", he said.
