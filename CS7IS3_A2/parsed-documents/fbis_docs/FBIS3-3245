In recent years, with the constant deepening of reform and opening up, various localities have made bold experiments and positive explorations in light of their own conditions. In the last two years, in particular, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks during his southern China tour and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, reform of the property rights system has markedly gathered pace and made positive progress. According to a briefing by a comrade from the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, reform of the property rights system in China has made impressive progress in the following aspects: --Fundamental changes have taken place in the traditional ownership pattern and an ownership structure with the public economy as the main body and the common development of many economic sectors has gradually taken shape. The proportion of the output value of state-owned industrial enterprises in the total industrial output value dropped from 77.6 percent in 1978 to 48.3 percent at the end of 1992, while that of collective industrial enterprises rose from 22.4 percent to 38.2 percent, and that of foreign-invested, self- employed, and private industrial enterprises grew from zero to 13.5 percent. --Experiments in transforming enterprises into joint-stock companies have developed healthily. By the end of 1993, there were more than 4,000 enterprises across the country, with a total stock market value of around 400 billion yuan, experimenting with the joint-stock system; over 200 joint-stock companies were listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen; and six large enterprises including the Shanghai Petrochemical Co. Ltd. and Qingdao Brewery issued stocks in Hong Kong. Rural enterprises under the cooperative shares system have shown momentum of rapid development. --Introduction of foreign capital into the country and capital export have further expanded. There are now 117 countries and regions investing in China. Last year, China signed agreements worth $110.852 billion in foreign capital, with the actual foreign capital input at $25.759 billion. --A large number of small state-owned enterprises are operated by civilians. Such enterprises account for a considerable proportion in various provinces, prefectures, and counties in northeast, northwest, east, and central south China. The proportion is 60 percent in Henan, 43 percent in Hebei, 35 percent in Nanjing, 60 percent in Chongqing, and 60 percent in Beijing's commerce department and its affiliated organizations. --Property rights exchanges have been gradually set up, and an important step has been taken in experimenting on the public sale of state-owned enterprises and their "grafting" with foreign capital. Property rights exchanges have so far been set up in over 20 cities and areas in over 10 provinces, and their business has become brisker with each passing day. Hunan Province put 220 enterprises on sale last year and sold 16 of them at a total value of 63.7 million yuan. Quanzhou City "grafted" all its state-owned enterprises (41 in all) and Wuxi City over half (170) of its large and medium-sized enterprises. --Like a new force suddenly coming to the fore, rural enterprises under the cooperative shares system have become another invention of the peasant masses. Such enterprises grew so rapidly last year that they accounted for 10 percent of the total number of township and town enterprises across the country.
