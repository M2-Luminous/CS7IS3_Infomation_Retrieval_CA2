They said the revision is required since substantive debates on the full budget by the House of Representatives Budget Committee are unlikely to start until mid-May. The stopgap budget for the year that started April 1, compiled to deal with the nation's political confusion, is valid only until May 20. The officials said the full budget is unlikely to be approved by the Diet before that date. The new stopgap budget will be valid until sometime in the 40-day period through June 29, when the current Diet session ends, and will involve additional appropriations of 3 trillion yen to 4 trillion yen, the officials said. The fiscal 1994 budget was submitted to the Diet on March 4, but there have been no Diet debates on it because of the political confusion.
