He graduated from the Moscow Petroleum Institute and is a candidate of technical sciences. He worked for many years on Sakhalin and in [the Republic of] Komi as a worker, shop foreman, chief engineer, general director of major production associations, and a first deputy of the USSR minister of the oil industry. Member of the board of the RAO [all-Russia joint-stock society] Gazprom. [Andriyanov] Boris Aleksandrovich, a year ago there was a wave of articles about Rosshelf in all the newspapers. Grandiose plans were outlined. And then--it was as if all the information were put under lock and key.... [Nikitin] The Rosshelf joint-stock society was registered in May 1992. In 1993 we were granted licenses to develop two major deposits--Shtokman and Prirazlomnyy. We have accomplished a lot of preparation work, and only now can we tell about it. This interview to RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA is my first. [Andriyanov] Thank you. So what has been done? [Nikitin] Let us first look at the map, so that our readers will have a better understanding what we are talking about. The Shtokman deposit is located in the Barents Sea. The depth is considerable--more than 300 meters. Very difficult climatic conditions. We cannot apply the experience of development in the North Sea over here. The size of the gas deposit is enormous. It will have an impact on both the domestic and the foreign gas market. We are currently putting together a technical and economic justification for the development of the Shtokman deposit. This will require completely new technology--for instance, platforms capable of working at a sea depth of more than 300 meters. [Andriyanov] Can domestic industry handle it? [Nikitin] Of course; that is the point--to make use of enterprises undergoing conversion. I think that the actual implementation of this project will begin in 1994. [Andriyanov] Such large projects also require large investment.... [Nikitin] Unfortunately, in 1993 we have been able to invest half the planned means. The gas industry, however, just like the oil and coal industries, cannot live without long-term planning. Old territories and deposits get depleted, mines die out. We need to work on new ones ahead of time. This is for the sake of the future of the country, the prospects for our children and grandchildren. [Andriyanov] The mining and oil industries are currently losing more capacities than they put on line. [Nikitin] Fortunately, this has not happened to the gas industry. The policy of the RAP Gazprom and its chairman, R. Vyakhirev, is oriented toward development of new major deposits. This is the precondition for normal work of the sector, and the entire industry. One could do even more, but the current economic situation literally binds everyone, hand and foot. Still, Gazprom as a powerful, major firm is conducting a policy aimed at the future, and it takes into consideration what will happen in five, eight, 10 years.... [Andriyanov] Had we not had such a firm, had we not had a Unified Gas Supply System.... [Nikitin] It would be very difficult, or perhaps even impossible, to finance the volume of development we are now doing on the Barents Sea shelf and at Yamal, which is mostly being worked by Nadymgazprom enterprises. We hope to increase investment next year. [Andriyanov] Boris Aleksandrovich, speaking about the gas industry overall. This is probably the only sector that has avoided--let us knock on wood--the general decline. What is the secret? [Nikitin] There is no secret. Fortuitous organizational changes were made when it was still the USSR Ministry of the Gas Industry. The sector has gradually adjusted to the real conditions emerging in Russia. In RAP Gazprom each stockholder has a stake in the final result of common activities. In short, what has emerged is a company capable of realistically competing not only in the Russian market, but in foreign markets as well. Gazprom found its niche in a market economy. [Andriyanov] Why do you think this has not happened to the oil industry? [Nikitin] By concentrating its means, Gazprom is able to support major projects. You tell me--what company could afford the development of Yamal or the shelf? The crisis deals a blow first and foremost to projects requiring investment. To save them, major investment is needed. The oil industry currently does not have anyone to bring it under one roof. Formally, a concern apparently includes the entire chain--from extraction to the production of the final product; but in real terms, it has remained compartmentalized. And on top of that, constant delays in payments.... [Andriyanov] We have seen the results of this in Nadyma.... [Nikitin] Nevertheless, in such an explosive situation Gazprom has been able to maneuver resources in a timely manner and to take the necessary measures. [Andriyanov] It appears that the social explosion in Nadyma was the result of the current economic policy. [Nikitin] Policy is consistency. You see? A smart man will find a way out of a situation. A wise one will make it so that such a situation does not develop. [Andriyanov] You mentioned the Prirazlomnyy deposit at the beginning of our conversation. Is this also at sea? [Nikitin] Yes, it is located in the Pechora Sea, or, to be precise, in Pechora Bay. It was discovered two years ago. The first well produced oil; the second was not unsuccessful. This year the Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka, on a contract from Rosshelf, drilled Well No. 3. It produced a very good output--about 700 tonnes of oil a day. It is a rich deposit, and next year we plan to increase considerably the volume of operations there. In addition, we are studying the shelf adjacent to Yamal; it is a very promising territory. The deposits there are estimated to contain 7-10 trillion cubic meters of gas. Production decline as deposits get depleted is an objective occurrence. This disbalance cannot be corrected by resolutions. What is needed is new technologies, resource-saving, and most importantly, new deposits. [Andriyanov] Thank you, Boris Aleksandrovich. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA is prepared to introduce a permanent rubric on the topic of development of Yamal, the Shtokman and Prirazlomnyy deposits. [Nikitin] This will help us all. And the people who work in these extreme conditions will be grateful to the newspaper for its attention to their efforts.
