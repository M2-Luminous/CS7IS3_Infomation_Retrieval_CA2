In the statement, which has not been authenticated, the GIA said it had carried out the executions of members of the Islamic Armed Movement (MIA) without giving a precise date. The statement was sent by fax, headed the "State of the Islamic Caliphate in Algeria" and dated February 5, 1994. It said the killings had been carried out according to Koranic law, adding that the "masters of the political decision are the mujahedin." The GIA has accused the MIA of trying to suppress its group and has described MIA leader Said Mekhloufi as a "traitor, and agent of the government services." In a previous statement the GIA said it was "against all truce, all dialogue and all reconciliation with the powers" in place and threatened anyone taking part in talks with "the worst of deaths." Meanwhile security forces announced Sunday that 13 armed Moslem militants were killed between Tuesday and Thursday in several regions of Algeria. Six militants were killed Thursday in Oued Fregha on the northern border between Algeria and Tunisia, and two died in Mechta El Magahi 450 kilometres (279 miles) southeast of Algiers. Three fundamentalists were killed in Oran in western Algeria on Wednesday, and two died Tuesday evening in a suburb of Algiers. Earlier Sunday the Hilton hotel in Algiers closed its doors, the latest in a growing wave of foreign companies to suspend operations here because of continuing fundamentalist violence. The hotel, which opened last August, decided to close for an unspecified period six days after the killing in the Casbah district of French cameraman Olivier Quemener, whose body was repatriated Sunday. It also came three weeks after the assassination of a employee of the French consulate, Monique Afri. Both killings were blamed officially on Muslim fundamentalist groups.
