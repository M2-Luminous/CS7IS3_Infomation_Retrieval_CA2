During the segment, Zhirinovskiy reacts to German media reports about him, including a report on his alleged contacts with a prostitute in Vienna published by the German daily Hamburg BILD. Laux opens the report by saying that he showed Zhirinovskiy recent copies of German newspapers and "confronted him with our fear of a return to the Cold War." When he was shown a copy of DER SPIEGEL depicting his face in the foreground and Hitler's in the background, Zhirinovskiy's said: "It is very nice to see my picture on the front cover of DER SPIEGEL. However, if I am depicted once more along with Hitler, and if you compare me with Hitler again, then the future for DER SPIEGEL will be tough, and then I could see the end of DER SPIEGEL before long. Our party has never had a relationship with your underexposed [referring to the cover photo] fuehrer. You must never forget that your mad Hitler shot and annihilated more than 26 million Russian citizens. You and your fuehrer, who was nothing but an uneducated painter. He was a mad fanatic who was later condemned by the entire world. Pass that immediately on to our lawyers. We will sue DER SPIEGEL for 100 million marks." The journalist stresses that Zhirinovskiy's strong language appeals to people and that he always knows how to place himself at the center of attention. Laux notes that although Zhirinovskiy's popularity is increasing, he is "far from supported by all Russians." One unidentified man in the street states that Zhirinovskiy is "a dangerous man, who might start World War III." A woman who is asked about Zhirinovskiy only says that "he is mad." Laux then describes Zhirinovskiy's rhetorical talent: "He terrifies his audience with spraying spittle, he evokes the huge disappearing empire, reaching his climax by showering abuse on the corrupt reformers, communist liars, and obtrusive foreigners." Rainer Laux then notes that these slogans are "particularly appealing to the young Nazis in Russia," who are still meeting "secretly," while "their great idol" appeared at a Congress of the German People's Union [DVU] in Passau last October. Laux adds that the DVU has "booked" Zhirinovskiy again for its "right-wing radical spectacle" this coming September. However, Laux argues that Zhirinovskiy "is flexible, and cultivates profitable contacts with the left, too. The millions of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] are welcome." Quoting from a German newspaper, Zhirinovskiy says: "My dear deputies. Here I can read that the communists in eastern Germany -- the SED, although they call themselves differently now -- say that they paid us DM8 million. Please tell them that we would be happy if only they had given us DM8. All the money for us, immediately." Laux emphasizes that the military, in particular, feel attracted by "the dangerous dreams of a megalomaniac demagogue." Zhirinovskiy: "Germany is not an independent country, because it is occupied. More than 300,000 Russian soldiers remain stationed in Germany. As the security power, Russia can determine your country's fate. We have the right to say whether the soldiers remain there or are withdrawn. Instead of withdrawing them we might as well send another 700,000 soldiers there. Then 1 million Russian soldiers would stand on German soil." Zhirinovskiy then goes on to say: "BILD claims I had sex with a girl. Am I not allowed to do that? What do the Germans think? Don't the Germans have contact with women, or do they do it with animals? What do the Germans do? What is the problem? That one here? I have to put on my glasses. This girl is a snake. I do not want one like her. Let me meet 10 other girls. Sasha, look, they say that I did it with that girl in Austria. It would have been a pleasure for me to have had something with 20 Austrians, but not with that one. You can dump that one off on Schmidt and Kohl, but not on me." Laux says that apart from his threats to occupy Germany, Zhirinovskiy also "hypocritically expressed his sarcastic concern about our country." Zhirinovskiy: "One day Germany will cease to exist, because more and more people are getting divorced there, people do not have children any more, everybody is gay. This is why Germany will soon be populated only by foreigners! Do you understand that?" Laux ends the report with a quote from Zhirinovskiy's address to the DVU Congress in Passau last October. Zhirinovskiy: "Long live the great Germany, long live the great Russia. Russian and Germans -- friends forever."
