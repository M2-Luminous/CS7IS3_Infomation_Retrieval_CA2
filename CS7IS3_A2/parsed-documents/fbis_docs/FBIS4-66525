This controversial question is currently being asked in Western intelligence and political circles. Defacto inquiries are being made of al-Nahdah's exiled leadership in Paris and London concerning this subject. Informed Tunisian sources confirm that Tunisian parties purchased arms from merchants in several European capitals, particularly in Brussels and Paris, and that these parties presented themselves as or intimated their affiliation with the outlawed "al-Nahdah Islamic movement" in Tunisia. The arms were bought in small quantities and were directed to a third party. However, al-Nahdah's leadershiip firmly denies that they purchased arms for the purpose of smuggling them into Tunisia and asserted that their movement is political and would never resort to violence under any circumstances. One al-Nahdah member who asked that his name be withheld said that the Sudan expelled a group of Tunisians who adopted the policy of "al-jihad," and said that the expulsion took place at the request of al-Nahdah, which does not want to bear the responsibility for such a trend. The same source indicates that the operation to smuggle arms from Tunisia to the Kabylie region of Algeria is for the purpose of arming the groups supporting the extremist Berber leader Said Saadi, leader of the Rally for Culture and Democracy. Two weeks ago in the French newspaper LE FIGARO, Saadi called for arming the opposition to the Islamists and forming militias to confront the supporters of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front]. These statements caused an uproar in Algeria; commenting from abroad, Rabih Kebir, president of the FIS executive council, characterized Saadi's remarks as "an open invitation to civil war." The al-Nahdah leadership confirmed that the source of these weapons was not the Tunisian army's arsenal, rather that they were purchased abroad with the knowledge of the security agencies in Tunisia in order to achieve two goals: "Firstly, to preoccupy Algeria with a civil war when the FIS takes power and [secondly,] to implicate al-Nahdah with the charge of purchasing the arms." However, Tunisian official sources are insisting that al-Nahdah is purchasing arms to use them in terrorist operations inside Tunisia.
