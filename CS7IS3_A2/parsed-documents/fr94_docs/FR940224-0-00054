FR940224-0-00054 FR940224-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Parts 10, 12, 24, 123, 134, 162, 174, 177, 178, 181 and 191 [T.D. 94&hyph;1] RIN 1515&hyph;AB33 North American Free Trade Agreement; Corrections AGENCY: Customs Service, Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Interim regulations; corrections. SUMMARY: This document makes corrections to the document published in the Federal Register which set forth interim amendments to the Customs Regulations to implement the preferential tariff treatment and other Customs-related provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: These corrections are effective January 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Myles Harmon, Office of Regulations and Rulings (202&hyph;482&hyph;7000). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 30, 1993, Customs published in the Federal Register (58 FR 69460) T.D. 94&hyph;1 to set forth interim amendments to the Customs Regulations to implement the preferential tariff treatment and other Customs-related provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which was adopted by the United States through the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (``the Act''), Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057. Those interim regulatory amendments took effect on January 1, 1994, to coincide with the effective date of the NAFTA. This document corrects some errors published in T.D. 94&hyph;1. Two errors involved amended §24.22: (1) Paragraph (g)(1), as revised in the document, failed to fully reflect the change in wording of section 13031(a)(5) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 58c(a)(5)) effected by section 521 of the Act for fiscal years 1994 through 1997; and (2) the document failed to amend paragraph (g)(2)(iv) to avoid a conflict between that paragraph and the amended statutory and paragraph (g)(1) language. In new §181.45, a printing error involving the text of paragraph (a) before the example is corrected by rearranging the text without any change in substance. In addition, in order to ensure coverage of all appropriate litigation contexts involving Customs and its officers or agents, at the end of new §§181.98(b) and 181.116(f) the word ``defendant'' is corrected to read ``party to the action''. Finally, this document corrects a number of drafting or typesetting errors of an editorial nature. Corrections of Publication Accordingly, the document published in the Federal Register as T.D. 94&hyph;1 on December 30, 1993 (58 FR 69460) is corrected as set forth below. Correction to the Background Section 1. On page 69461, in the second column under the heading Part 24, the first paragraph is corrected to read: Section 24.22, which was published as a final rule in T.D. 93&hyph;85 on October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54271), is amended to reflect changes to the commercial passenger arrival fee provisions of section 13031 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 58c) effected by section 521 of the Act. The changes involve, for fiscal years 1994 through 1997 (in effect, from January 1, 1994 through September 30, 1997), (1) replacement of the words ``from a place outside the United States'' by the words ``from outside the customs territory of the United States'', (2) an increase in the fee from $5 to $6.50, and (3) suspension of the fee exemption for persons whose journey involves certain specified locations outside the United States. Corrections to the Interim Regulations 2. On page 69470, in the third column, the amendatory language and text pertaining to §24.22 are corrected to read: Section 24.22 is amended by revising paragraph (g)(1), the introductory text of paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A), and paragraph (g)(2)(iv) to read as follows: §24.22 Fees for certain services. * * * * * (g) Fee for arrival of passengers aboard commercial vessels and commercial aircraft.
