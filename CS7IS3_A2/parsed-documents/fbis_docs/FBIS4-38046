Whereas the U.S. attitude towards India is manifested by a variety of pressures and proposed sanctions that are consistent, her attitude towards Pakistan is fickle and often full of contradictions. The latest U.S. enticement of Pakistan, whose nuclear weapons program was chiefly nurtured by the feigned indifference and inactivity of the U.S., is its move to suppress and cover its despair in NPT matters by pressuring her protege. During the cold-war, the U.S. indifference to Pakistan's nuclear arms program was only a mask. This enabled arms to be supplied continually to Afghan rebels in their uprising against the USSR- supported government of Najibollah. This was also the reason why despite the controversial information received through CIA sources, the U.S. President continued to issue "clean-chits" on Pakistan's nuclear program. But the end of the cold-war signified a decline in the importance of Pakistan for the U.S. The result being that the White House at the end of October 1990, expressed its inability to issue such chits. Consequently, all the military aid given to Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment provisions were stopped. But contrary to even U.S. expectations, Pakistan managed to meet all its defense needs in the last four years. It appears that Pakistan is not likely to be trapped by this U.S. enticement as she has her own problems. Even if Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto wants to, she cannot accept the U.S. proposal as Pakistan's nuclear program is in the hands of the military, with opposition leader Nawaz Sharif giving it a political color. Prime Minister Bhutto perhaps would not like to shatter the dreams of her father Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto who launched the nuclear program under any external pressure by suspending it. According to a report published in Washington, the U.S. would like to entice India together with Pakistan, to nab the former in her policy trap. If India agrees to sign the nuclear NPT and accepts the measures for international security proposed by the U.S., the latter might extend her the following benefits. (1) First, the U.S. could take the initiative by resuming to supply fuel for the Tarapur Power Plant. It may be recalled that after India's peaceful nuclear testing in Pokharan in 1974, the U.S stopped supplying fuel for the plant in 1980-81 under its policy of coercion and regulation of nuclear nonproliferation. But, due to the (?determined) policy of Indira Gandhi and her followers, and France as its alternative supplier of Uranium U-235, India not only successfully ran the plant, it also did not compromise on its nuclear policy. (2) Also, an assurance could be given to soft peddle Super 301 measures. The U.S. has all along been threatening India together with Japan and Brazil with imposing economic and trade sanctions for their prohibitive business behavior under Super 301 rules. Any U.S. decision in this regard would prove extremely important for India in her current weakened economy because one-fifth of its total exports are consumed in the U.S. (3) With the liberalization of U.S. rules on computer imports, it may become possible for India to start exporting her latest computers. After a recent liberalization, the U.S. Department of Commerce allowed India to export computers of the level of 500 MTOPAS. If the U.S. wants, it can raise this level to 1000 MTOPAS, the limit it prescribes for other countries. India's present quota is only 125 MTOPAS. (4) Another concession is providing complete help to Hindustan Aeronautics in manufacturing light bombers. The cessation of aid from the U.S. firm, Marin Marietta, to Indian scientists in design-development for advanced flight-control systems could prove to be a great headache. But any ban on General Electric engines by the U.S. could ground the whole program till the Kaveri engine, which is still being produced by the Gas Turbine Research Organization, is ready. How far would these U.S. enticements to India like the F-16 bombers to Pakistan, serve U.S. economic interests? The basic idea of resuming the supply of uranium and helping in the manufacture of light bombers is to make India dependent on the U.S. On the other hand, the supplies of the most modern computers is also guided by demand. Computer technology is a monopoly of the U.S. and Japan. The aim of the relaxation of the U.S.-Japan computer monopoly is to remove hurdles in its competition with Japan, which as a result the U.S. electronics industry has so far suffered losses of $30 billion. India's increased use of computers and the huge size of its market could help compensate the U.S. favorably for this loss. Like India and Pakistan, another victim of the economic-interest-spurred by U.S. NPT policy is North Korea. By blowing out of proportion North Korea's nuclear capability, the U.S., on one hand, has been able to make its active role in nuclear nonproliferation felt. On the other hand, by creating a atmosphere of fear in South Korea, it has activated a market for its weapons new and old. The recent supply of Patriot missiles bear testimony to this assertion. Unhappy with the U.S. decision to resume supplying F-16 bombers to Pakistan, the Republican Senator from South Dakota and the author of the Pressler Law, Gary Pressler, has perhaps rightly commented: "Instead of adopting a responsible policy on NPT in South Asia, the Clinton Administration appears to be conducting only the sale of the military arms and junk brought out from the Pentagon garage." Whether it is to restore the F-16 jets to Pakistan at the cost of Pakistan's nuclear program or frightening the South Koreans by magnifying the nuclear capability of North Korea and thus ensuring the sale of her missiles to South Korea, the only aim of U.S. policy is to use the NPT to enhance regional imbalances, and as a cover to fan the demand for traditional arms that has been dying after the end of the cold war. To the U.S. this appears to be the only way to save its arms industry, which has now fallen on bad times. To achieve this, the U.S. can go to the extent of using the nuclear nonproliferation as a weapon and it into cold storage in case it fails. The Clinton Administration has not made a final decision on Pakistan's F-16 jets. However, the views of the Assistant State Secretary Robin Raphel in the context of the ineffectiveness of the Pressler Amendment for achieving the NPT aims indicate that the U.S. might restore its supply without any conditions, and this should cause no surprise. If the U.S. is really worried about the increasing number of countries with nuclear capability, why does it not forgo its business ruses and attempt to set a treaty that is acceptable to all? Such a treaty should not only provide guarantees for nonnuclear countries by prohibiting the use of force by nuclear states, it should also provide for an early and systematic destruction of their nuclear arsenals.
