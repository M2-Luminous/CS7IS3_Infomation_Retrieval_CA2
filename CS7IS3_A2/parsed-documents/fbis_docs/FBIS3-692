Elias] [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- Right-wingers have been acting against media covering their arrival in Mmabatho to back the Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] in a bid to prop up the government of President Lucas Mangope. They moved into Bophuthatswana under cover of darkness on Friday morning, with the apparent knowledge of the BDF. An SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] aerial camera crew were surrounded by heavily-armed khaki-clad men when they landed at an airfield near the capital to refuel. A camera crew from the British-based ITN news network had their four bulletproof vests taken from them, as well as all video cassettes. ITN crew member Nick Mhlahlehle said a large crowd of Mangope loyalists surrounded their car outside the University of Bophuthatswana at 9.30 AM and pulled them out. STAR photographer Ken Oosterbroek was assaulted and his film confiscated, as was Cape Town freelance photographer Fanie Jacobs. An AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE [AFP] news team went to an air base near Mmabatho where the right-wingers have set up headquarters, but their car was surrounded by a group of men and they were told to leave the area. "There were about 100 of them and as soon as they said that we got out of there," said AFP photographer Walter Dhladhla. An informal meeting of journalists was held in the lobby of the Mmabatho Sun Hotel to devise a way of getting photographic coverage of the sealing off of the town by the BDF and the 5,000 loyalists now patrolling both the capital and the nearby historical town of Mafikeng. During the meeting, a representative of the International Red Cross arrived at the hotel to co-ordinate activities with members of the Red Cross already in Mmabatho.
