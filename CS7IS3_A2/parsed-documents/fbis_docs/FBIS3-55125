The German parliamentarian calls on the German Bundestag and Western countries to throw their weight in support of the Baltic states, amid the threats voiced by the Russian ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and worries sparked in the Baltic states by the hints which have cropped up in the New Year's address of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to his fellow citizens. "It has to be made clear to the Kremlin leadership that, whatever the government of the Russian Federation is, independence of the three Baltic states has to be inviolable," says the statement. "Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia should not be betrayed and sold out once again, as it has already happened in 1940, 1941 and 1945. Russia ought to be told that the remaining troops be withdrawn from Latvia and Estonia in 1994." Dr. Von Stetten maintained that he had not witnessed any evidence of Russians being discriminated repressed in any of the three Baltic countries, they had been only deprived of their self-assumed rights to act as occupants and masters of the three people, which they had enjoyed until recently. He pointed out that legislation on minorities rights in Estonia and Lithuania met the most strict European standards, the only controversy being the laws on citizenship. Von Stetten said, however, that the citizenship laws in Lithuania and Latvia are much more liberal than respective legislations in the countries of Western Europe, including Germany. The German parliamentarian underlined that both the allegations by Zhirinovskiy and implications by President Yeltsin were groundless. Von Stetten also stated that the former occupants could not be granted any privileges they are claiming so vehemently. The chairman of the German parliamentary group suggested it was necessary to consider seriously and to discuss an option to grant the Baltic states the NATO membership, or to offer Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia guarantees of their security, in order to ease their worries of a new eventual annexation on the part of Russia.
