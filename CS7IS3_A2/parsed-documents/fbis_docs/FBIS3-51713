This control committee will have 30 days to conclude its work, and will be made up of seven congressmen. It will be coordinated by the Chamber of Deputies vice president, Deputy Fernando Lira, and the rapporteur will be Deputy Vital do Rego, comptroller of the lower house. Meanwhile, the final Budget CPI report must be corrected before it is delivered to the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. [passage omitted] Budget CPI President Senator Jarbas Passarinho spent the morning in his house organizing the documents that arrived at the last moment at the CPI, and which must be added to the final report. One of the documents which arrived during the weekend is a report from Sergipe Governor Joao Alves demonstrating that his assets are compatible with his income. The document was processed by rapporteur Deputy Roberto Magalhaes. Senator Passarinho must hand in the final CPI report to the Chamber of Deputies president this afternoon. But this will only take place if the Senate data processing service manages to print the report with the corrections made by the CPI members and the improvised commentaries made by the rapporteur as he read the final report. Furthermore, Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio de Oliveira said that the Constitution and Justice Committee, which must judge the congressmen mentioned in the CPI report, must have its composition reorganized before the end of the week. Some of the current members of this committee are mentioned in the final CPI report, so they must be replaced. [Begin Oliveira recording] The decisions of the Constitution and Justice Committee, which is made up of 54 members, are made through a vote. I believe that the congressmen mentioned in the CPI report must be removed from their posts by their party leaders. [end recording] The government will also intensify the investigations on the involvement of Executive Branch officials in the budget scandal. A special investigative committee presided over by Federal Administration Secretary Romildo Canhim will be installed in the first week of February.
