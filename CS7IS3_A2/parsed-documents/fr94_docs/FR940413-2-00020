FR940413-2-00020 FR940413-2-00013 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;316&hyph;000, et al.] Northwest Pipeline Corp., et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings April 5, 1994. Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. Northwest Pipeline Corp. [Docket No. CP94&hyph;316&hyph;000] Take notice that on March 30, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84158, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;316&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205, 157.211 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211, and 157.216) for authorization to replace certain metering facilities at its Wenatchee Meter Station (Wenatchee Station) in Chelan County, Washington to maintain the ability to accommodate its existing firm maximum daily delivery obligations (MDDO) to Cascade Natural Gas Corporation (Cascade), under Northwest's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;433&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Northwest states that its Wenatchee Station has a maximum design delivery capacity of approximately 19,334 Dt/d (at 225 psig) from Northwest's Wenatchee Lateral into Cascade's distribution system. Northwest further states that it is presently contractually obligated to deliver up to 12,214 Dt per day to Cascade at the Wenatchee delivery point, (8,740 Dt/d of transportation which is provided under a Rate Schedule TF&hyph;1 agreement pursuant to Subpart G of Part 284, and 3,474 Dt/d of storage which is provided under a Rate Schedule SGS&hyph;1). Northwest is specifically proposing to replace four obsolete regulators (two 4 inch regulators and two 2 inch regulators), with two new 2 inch regulators. Northwest avers that replacing the four obsolete regulators with the two new 2 inch regulators will decrease the maximum design capacity of the Wenatchee Station from 19,334 Dt/d to approximately 12,367 Dt/d at a pressure of 225 psig. It is stated that the smaller design capacity still will be adequate to deliver the current MDDO of 12,214 Dt/d at the Wenatchee point. It is further stated that during the past four years, the actual peak day deliveries have not exceeded the proposed design capacity of this delivery point. Northwest states that the total cost of replacing the described facilities at the Wenatchee Station is estimated to be approximately $13,325, including the cost of removing the old facilities. It is stated that since the proposed facility upgrade is necessary to replace obsolete equipment, Northwest will not require any cost reimbursement from Cascade. Comment date : May 20, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 2. Trunkline LNG Co. [Docket No. CP87&hyph;418&hyph;003] Take notice that on March 29, 1994, Trunkline LNG Company (TLC), P.O. Box 1642, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1642, filed in Docket No. CP87&hyph;418&hyph;003 an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's regulations thereunder for a certificate amendment and clarification of the applicable tariff provisions to the existing authorization wherein TLC provides liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal service to Pan National Gas Sales, Inc. (Pan National). TLC is not requesting a change in the shipping cost currently included in the Cost of service calculation specifically designed for shipment of Algerian LNG to TLC. TLC is requesting authorization to utilize a shipping cost of $27,937 per day plus actual port costs for affiliated shipping of non-Algerian LNG or the actual shipping cost, when using non-affiliated shipping. TLC also requests clarification that TLC is authorized to provide terminal service to Pan National, regardless of the origin of the LNG, or in the alternative, the necessary amendment to allow such transactions. Comment date: April 26, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 3. Southern Natural Gas Co.
