Major General Andrej Sabol was appointed Defense Ministry state secretary and Colonel Rudolf Zidek was appointed head of the Defense Ministry Office. In his speech, the prime minister emphasized that the Slovak Republic requires high-quality and advanced Army and patriotic soldiers, who will fulfill their tasks regardless of which political grouping is in power. In expressing his appreciation, Minister Kanis said, among other things, that, in the coming weeks, it will be necessary to prepare a thorough analysis of the Slovak Army's first year. It is essential to improve the style and method of managerial work at the Defense Ministry and the Slovak Army Command "because the current system in many ways still resembles the old bipolar system," emphasized Kanis.
