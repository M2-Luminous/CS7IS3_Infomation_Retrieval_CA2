And For a Long time"] [Text] Frankly speaking, I had planned at first to interview Nikolay Petrovich Shmelev. But after listening to the first "chords" of his impassioned and emotional speech and seeing how he painstakingly wiped the drops of perspiration from his forehead with a handkerchief, I changed my mind. Let the corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences express his views on the painful problems of our society. But I have assumed responsibility for systematizing the opinions of the noted Russian economist and presenting them for your attention. Now then! No Illusions. As strange as it seems, I now hold a cautiously optimistic view of the situation in Russia. I think we reached the bottom of our national political crisis last fall. The threat of a total catastrophe now is less real than it was before, it seems to me. Nevertheless, our leaders and society as a whole have to become used to the idea that the current crisis in Russia will continue not for years or even decades, but for two or three generations. That is, we are doomed to live under conditions of permanent crisis for the present. What is most tragic is that we are beginning to realize the uselessness and inviability of a substantial part of the vast economic potential which we accumulated over the past seven decades. According to various assessments, from one-third to two-thirds of this potential should be either dismantled or drastically modernized. This will require a lot of time, a tremendous amount of patience, and a pile of money, but it cannot be helped. As regrettable as it seems, for example, Vorkuta, which has 85 percent of its expenses covered by the budget, should be shut down. This same fate awaits the Moscow Coal Basin and the lion's share of our ferrous metallurgy and defense industry. The most favorable predictions indicate that in agriculture, a minimum of 75 percent of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes are doomed to a slow death. For this reason, I support those allegedly conservative circles of economists who are repeatedly mentioning the vital necessity of a well-thought-out industrial policy. Simply stated, someone in our country should decide whom to support for a year, whom to support for 5 years, and someone must be helped to die tomorrow. Between the Hammer and the Anvil. No government today, no matter whether it is headed by Chernomyrdin, Zyuganov, Zhirinovskiy, or Gaydar, will be able to provide for the classic, normal choice between inflation and unemployment. After all, no one knows where this acceptable level of inflation is. It is clear that the less inflation the better, but we cannot get along without it now; otherwise, it is impossible to maintain the vast unprofitable sector of our economy. Unless we begin the process of bankruptcy, of shutting down entire sectors of industry and even cities, there can be no discussion about any normalization of the Russian economy. But such measures will lead to an avalanche of unemployment. A paradox! I have only sympathy for Chernomyrdin. He stated that this dilemma should be resolved. However, this is tantamount to walking on a razor blade. A step to the left means hyperinflation, and a step to the right means a social explosion because of unacceptable unemployment. It is at the level of 5 to 6 percent at present, but it should climb at least to 12 percent. How will the public react to this increase? For this reason, in my view, the question is as follows: what level of unemployment can the Russian society withstand, and what level of inflation can it forgive the government for? "Veneer." Our monetary system must be normalized without delay. No economy can function normally with a sick currency. Gaydar managed to cure the financial system somewhat at the price of "eating up" all the public's savings, but this was obviously inadequate. First of all, we have to restore incentives to save our Russian rubles so that they are competitive and constantly in circulation. I was in a group of economists which at one time suggested that we repeat the successful experiment of the 1920's and issue hard convertible currency at the same time. Over a period of 1.5 to 2 years, it would completely force the compromised "veneer" out of the market. Then we would be able to normalize the monetary system naturally. And one more problem associated with this--the universal dollarization of the Russian economy. Such a thing can only be imagined in an insane asylum, when a foreign currency is used in practically all trade and economic operations. Dollars make up more than half of what is now in circulation. They make up over 50 percent of all the cash in the country. Crazy! Where Are the Property Owners? I am very skeptical about the current privatization strategy. Vouchers have played their role, that is, they brought down the social tension, but only that. They simply palmed off some illusion on the people in the form of the notorious voucher. A more difficult problem is linked with our industrial monsters. As an example, in order to privatize 10 large companies, M. Thatcher needed 10 years. But what is to be done with our industrial facilities, which are probably a little tougher than the English ones? Will 10 decades be needed? But many of my colleagues and I are worried about something else. In the sphere of classic business and private initiative, nothing has actually changed. Where are the private industrial enterprises in the cities, and where are the large farms in rural areas? Opening a small candle works today is just as hard as it was 60 years ago. The government of democrats, with their loud declarations about liberalism, the market, and free enterprise, have done nothing to alleviate the situation. They have simply driven private initiative to trade on the corners and in Luzhniki. So they are pushing private capital out of industry and they are not giving it any space or any protection from the criminal and state rackets. Plus the taxation in the stratosphere. Well, think of it: a law-abiding private entrepreneur must give the state up to 90 percent of all his income. With such an apportionment in the world, no one will ever work. One Blanket for a Pair. I have not believed in Tatar separatism or Sverdlovsk or Yakutsk separatism for a single day. The passions surrounding the division are nothing but political games based on a simple question: how do we divide the money (taxes) between the center and subjects of the federation? Moscow has traditionally taken 85 to 90 percent of the taxes, leaving crumbs for the localities. For this reason, we are also doomed to resolve this problem in a civilized manner, as in other normal countries, roughly in this manner: 40 percent to Moscow and the rest to the regions. But this has not been constituted yet and it paves the way for various local conflicts, from which separatism springs up. I assure you that when the question of taxes is settled sensibly, we will forget all our fears about the Far Eastern, Urals, and Yakutsk republics. Back in the USSR. Economic reintegration and restoration of the former Soviet Union in the sense of an economic alliance is a matter of time, and very little time, I fear. Experience has shown that without the subsidies which the former Soviet republics received regularly for decades from Russia, they simply would not be able to survive. These subsidies were roughly equivalent to an average $50 billion annually . Kazakhstan received 11 billion of the "green," Ukraine 7 billion, and Lithuania $3.5 billion. And there is no kind uncle who will pay the deficit in their balance of payments to Russia. Even the Armenians are having no success in this direction, although they have the largest and most sympathetic diaspora in the world. For this reason, the CIS countries are doomed to establish a common economic space similar to the Common Market in Europe. But does Russia need this? Are Russians in a position to bear the return of this burden of subsidies? Even our radical leaders are not prepared now for restoration of the previous integrated system. Protectionism Or Competition. We have proclaimed the opening of the Russian economy. But this gesture showed that we are not standing up to world competition in the market. At the same time, only foreign competition will be able to force the wheels of our economy to turn. We can understand those who demand protection from it and those who categorically speak out on its behalf. For example, our electronics industry has already been stifled by Japanese products, and there are innumerable cases such as this. In this connection, it is very important to find the golden mean which applies to the Russian economy. In our time, no one dares to shut down our economic system completely, and a degree of protectionism is part of the political boldness of our leaders and political groups for this reason. [Mironov] This was the "cheerful" conversation with Nikolay Shmelev. Our life was depicted in such pessimistic shades that I could not help but ask: "Nikolay Petrovich, there is still hope for us to overcome this crisis faster, all the same. Perhaps some strong personality is in a position to do this? After all, don't we have obvious examples in Chile, Turkey, and South Korea?" [Shmelev] Well, some general with his sword drawn will come along on his white horse. They will begin chopping off heads and military tribunals and all kinds of punitive actions will begin. Well, what good will he be able to do for the country? Except to crush organized crime, and that is possible. But he will not be able to solve those problems which we have been talking about. No, we do not need this...
