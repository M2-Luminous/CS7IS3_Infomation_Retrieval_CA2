At a press conference Tuesday [19 April], Januska said the Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces Staff are expected to present their final suggestions in the near future, and the document will then be submitted to NATO for consideration. In his words, NATO experts are satisfied with Lithuania's document as a basis for developing cooperation with the alliance, including participation in peacekeeping missions. "The document for participation in Partnership for Peace is our preparation for expanding NATO toward the East," Januska said. He noted that NATO experts suggested not to hasten the preparation of the presentation document, in order to make it as constructive as possible. The deputy minister said the State Defense Council's decision to hand over border control to the Interior Ministry is reflected in the presentation document. Januska was unable to estimate the approximate cost of Lithuania's participation in the program, but he expressed hope that NATO members will help to implement the program. According to the partnership Framework Document, which was signed by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas in Brussels January 27, each country will fund its own participation in partnership activities, although assistance through bilateral agreements with NATO members is also possible. Januska noted that Denmark and Great Britain have greatly contributed to the creation of a Baltic peacekeeping battalion.
