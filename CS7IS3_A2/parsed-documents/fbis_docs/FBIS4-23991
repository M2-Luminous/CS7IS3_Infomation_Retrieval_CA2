It is a followup to the process started by his number two, Gen. Diya. They have been trying to woo supporters away from the pro-democracy movement, the National Democratic Coalition [Nadeco]. Nadeco is calling for a sovereign national conference and for the installation of Chief Abiola, presumed winner of last June's elections as president. [passage omitted] And it is not only the traditional rulers in Nigeria who are divided over the country's political future. There's talk of opposition to the government political program from within the military as well. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari is a former Nigerian head of state. On the line from Kaduna, Mustafa Ibrahim asked Gen. Buhari if he thought Chief Abiola's action in declaring himself president would split the Nigerian Army? [Begin recording] [Buhari] No, I wouldn't. The Nigeria Army knows that it will be the first institution to lose its job if the federation breaks up. So, for their own personal security they wouldn't allow Abiola's interest to jeopardize their career and their country which they fought for. [Ibrahim] It appears that the politicians are uniting. We have heard recently that the National Assembly met in secret and endorsed the presidency of Abiola, and asked the Army to quit. It is looking increasingly likely that the Army is going to be disgraced out of office if the politicians can mobilize civilians on the streets. Is this not what is going to happen now? [Buhari] No, it is not going to happen, because we have to look at the credibility of the politicians and that of the soldiers in view of what happened during the last 10 years. I don't think the politicians have got anything to show as far as credibility and patriotism are concerned, relative to the soldiers, of course. [Ibrahim] But the record of the military -- of the eight years of Babangida -- and the present regime is so poor and dismal that people are tired. [Buhari] Well, it would appear -- that is the personal opinion of some Nigerians which I would not quarrel about -- but if we were to make a relative comparison of corruption and incompetence, the civilians have got nothing to show against the soldiers. [Ibrahim] Would you say the national conference, which is going to take place later this month is the way out of the political crisis in Nigeria? [Buhari] I agree with that. [Ibrahim] Why do you support the national conference? [Buhari] Well, I supported it, because it is the most sensible way out now. There seems to be an impasse, and the best way is for Nigerians to go to the conference and then go through the agenda as objectively as possible with the view of keeping the Nigerians together and making a political progress. That is why I support it. [Ibrahim] But it appears this conference is going to be teleguided by the government. It is not a free discussion. [Buhari] No, I disagree. It cannot be teleguided. Look at the type of people that are there, and in any case they have been elected, and there would be some government representatives there. I think the conference should be given a chance by all those who want peace and political progress in Nigeria. [end recording]
