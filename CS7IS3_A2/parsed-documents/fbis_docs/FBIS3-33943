He did not give in to the pressure of those who advocate an active, global U.S. leadership in the belief that in the absence of clear-cut evidence of its determination, the Washington administration will be ridiculed by both friend and foe. As an opponent of the Vietnam War and one who moved into the center of the political arena in the quarter century since then but is still afraid of the unforeseeable cost of involvement, Clinton is willing to take the criticism and pay the price of doing nothing, on the assumption that the price of doing something is much higher. This has been his attitude so far in the case of Bosnia and of Haiti, but his ability to tread the same path with North Korea is gradually decreasing. Clinton's behavior vis-a-vis the radical, conservative regime in Pyongyang last year resembled the way the governor of Arkansas would treat Republican legislators in Little Rock: pompous declarations and threats wrapped in incentives, culminating in a compromise depicted as a success. This system has barely worked with Congress in Washington, where Clinton carried fateful votes with a minuscule albeit decisive majority, but it is not effective when the adversary is a foreign leader who has been ruling his country since toddler Bill Blythe -- he changed his name to "Clinton" years later, in honor of his stepfather -- was in kindergarten. Kim Il-song has long strived to attain the nuclear capability that would enable him to threaten South Korea, punch a hole in the U.S. nuclear umbrella protecting it, and promote his goal of military or political reunification of both parts of the Korean peninsula. Thousands of U.S. troops stationed south of the 34th parallel would presumably become hostages in the event of an invasion from the north. Although Washington could respond with a nuclear strike on the north if the south were facing defeat, the north's nuclear weapons directly aimed at thousands of Americans and millions of Seoul residents might force the leaders of the south to make concessions without engaging in combat. Clinton had hoped to force North Korea to stop striving to attain nuclear capability by subjecting its facilities to international supervision, but he failed. After precious months of evasions by North Korea and the U.S. agreement to put off joint maneuvers with the South Korean Army, North Korea consented to partial -- hence useless -- supervision. Clinton hesitated for a month before he approved the stationing of Patriot missile batteries in South Korea to protect it from North Korea's surface-to-surface missiles which, as far as is known, are not outfitted with nuclear warheads but might be equipped with chemical ones. In his capacity as troubleshooter, Clinton's concern about causing an escalation through his response made some sense. This logic, however, is two-sided logic (Washington versus Pyongyang), whereas Clinton's problem is much broader: regional (how will the PRC and Japan proceed) and global (how will the message of U.S. feebleness be interpreted). Hesitancy will not help Clinton. He will ultimately be compelled to use force or lose what is left of his credibility in Tokyo, Beijing, and other capitals at a time when his global nuclear arms control initiative is supposed to be the crowning glory of his foreign and defense policy efforts in 1994 and 1995. The clock in the nuclear time bomb is ticking. If it goes off, it will mean that Clinton was tragically late.
