A lawyer with a length of service of almost 40 years. He has risen to his present very high position from the lowest rung, having missed none. He tells a good joke. He does not respond to criticism in the press but does not shun meetings with correspondents. [Skvirenko] Let us begin the discussion with a most general question: What impression of the present would you note as being characteristic of today's crime situation? [Barbalat] I have tried several contrasting criminal cases in succession recently. In Yedinets a son killed his father. In Stefan Vode a father killed his child. I recently took part in a trial in Kahula in which there should have been in the dock instead of the young man accused of having killed two persons his mother, perhaps.... You know what frightens me? The severance of the ties between the generations. The ties that hold together the moral health of both the family and society. [Skvirenko] You spent two days in Kahula, I believe? [Barbalat] Four. It was a very serious business. [Skvirenko] Describe it in more detail, if you can. [Barbalat] It is essentially a graphic example of the tragic consequences of the disintegration of the family. Husband and wife did not get on. The man had been free with his fists, for which he had done time, and once at liberty, he left is wife and two sons and went away. In her search for consolation the woman took to liquor. And she turned her home into a den of iniquity, collecting drinking companions aged 17 to 70. [Skvirenko] And what about the sons? [Barbalat] The elder went into the army and is serving as a warrant officer. The younger one--he is 31--also earned a living. But things were harder for him. He would hear continually from people: There's your mother cavorting around drunk--come and get her. Or he would be called to come and restore order in the house--the drinking companions would be letting themselves go once again.... So it was on this occasion also. He went to his mother's, there were two others there. One was about 60, the other, 40. The 40-year-old, bare to the waist, had struggled into his mother's winter coat, with a fur collar. The young man suggested that they cut it out, they set about him. With language and threats. And he then threw them out onto the street and then beat them up such that one died on the spot, the other, in hospital. [Skvirenko] A karate expert, perhaps? [Barbalat] Not to look at. He is puny in appearance. Those two were far bigger and healthier. But he gave them such a thrashing--something fearful. And here he is in the dock. I asked the mother: Have you any understanding that it is primarily you who are to blame for the fact that those two were killed, for the fact that your son is on trial, for what threatens him?..." "Yes, I am to blame, please do not pass judgment on him...." But a life has already been maimed, and the people cannot be brought back. And all because people have lost their human qualities. [Skvirenko] There is more freedom, but we are not seeing that it has been to everyone's benefit. [Barbalat] No, we proclaim freedom of the personality. But note: freedom of the personality, not freedom of the animal. The personality is a product of culture, it means respect for other personalities. Oversimplification is very dangerous here. But that which is simpler is very much in vogue with us. People say: Let us restore the economy. Once people are living better, they will become kinder of their own accord. [Skvirenko] We have already been through this, it would seem.... [Barbalat] Or even to boast that adolescents are washing cars and selling cigarettes--just like in the West, where the children of millionaires deliver newspapers. But it is clean forgotten here that socioeconomic conditions with us have as yet undergone merely superficial changes and that our tenor of life is changing as yet merely in the sense that it is being destroyed. And destruction is always a very painful process. [Skvirenko] With unclear prospects, what is more. [Barbalat] And the result is that from whatever side the problem is viewed, it is a problem of people's relationships. How to resolve it? By education? Compulsion? For several years our educationists pushed the idea of the establishment of the responsibility of the parents for their children's incorrect behavior. [Skvirenko] There is something in this, it would seem.... [Barbalat] Exactly as much as there was in another idea, when in the years of the punitive measures children paid for their convicted parents. [Skvirenko] But there was another proposition also: "I am responsible for everything!" [Barbalat] A handsome declaration. But it is in fact necessary for everyone to be responsible primarily for his conduct. Before both his conscience and the law. Only on this basis are normal human relationships possible. [Skvirenko] But there should, after all, be some principle of the creation of this basis? [Barbalat] There is just one principle: People need to be made accustomed to order not by talk, not by declarations, but by order. By the precision of demands and rules. By the clarity of the structures and the logic of their functioning. It is from such an approach, incidentally, that the principle of the separation of the branches of power ensues. [Skvirenko] I was looking for an opportunity to ask about this--about what the feelings of the third, judicial, estate are. Journalist colleagues of mine call themselves the fourth estate, incidentally, but this sounds nothing more than a joke. Is this not the way it is with you? [Barbalat] I would call our situation satisfactory. [Skvirenko] You feel no pressure? [Barbalat] There has been no intrusion upon our competence on the part of the official legislative and executive authorities. But on the part of certain persons, among the deputies particularly, there have been such attempts. Futile, of course. We have official forms of interaction, after all: an appeal or inquiry, in respect to which we examine a fact or problem and give the proper answer. [Skvirenko] Quite so. But there is a need for the development and improvement of the mechanism of the third estate itself. Do you sense this need? [Barbalat] I will go further. We have sent parliament, I'm afraid to name this figure even, a whole package of bills on questions of our activity, on judicial and legal reform. And I would like to emphasize the profound meaning of these proposals, which is directly connected with the subject of our conversation: They are all ultimately dictated by an aspiration to the fuller observance of human rights. Let us take, for example, the structural question. We still have a two-tier judicial system: the people's court and the Supreme Court. And that's it. The result is that the Supreme Court is continually acting the part of court of original jurisdiction handling the more complex cases. Whereas its function is summary, analytical, generalizing. But we have no courts of appeal, nor is there a Supreme Court itself essentially. It is hard to avoid violations of human rights in such a situation. [Skvirenko] And the actuality of the court's independence becomes an important facet of this problem.... [Barbalat] Of course. Although in this respect also there is a simplistic approach, when the problem of independence is reduced merely to the court being subordinate neither to parliament nor the government. [Skvirenko] But there was the instance of parliament wanting to hear you render account of your work! [Barbalat] Yes, and several parliamentary commissions presented such an initiative simultaneously, incidentally. I had to respond: If you insist, I will present a report. But I will feel ashamed in front of my foreign colleagues. Not for myself but for parliament, which has displayed before the world community such a lack of respect for the fundamental principle of democratic arrangement. In sum, I persuaded them to drop this idea. But, I repeat, the problem of the true independence of the court is not exhausted by such satirical-article collisions. The main questions are rooted within the judicial system itself. For example, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Code of Civil Procedure with us record: Directives of the superior authority are binding on the lower authority. But where is the independence here, pray? At the present time there is none. I do not want to say that the current model is necessarily fraught with malfeasance. But... there are instances of even the judges beginning to strike a balance. He has rendered a judgment, and this judgment has been countermanded. Aha, the judge gets the point, since the decision to satisfy the suit was countermanded, we now need to deny the suit. But the Supreme Court reversed the ruling not because the judge was wrong. But because there were insufficient grounds for the ruling. But the judge reacts in accordance with the rule: Since it came from the superior authority, it is, consequently, an order. And this is wrong. [Skvirenko] You speak so self-critically about this. We do not hear this that often. [Barbalat] We recently received expert findings from our colleague on the U.S. Court of Appeals. He literally tore to shreds our celebrated Article 54 of the Code of Civil Procedure. [Skvirenko] And what article is this? [Barbalat] It requires the court to assist the plaintiff and the defendant in obtaining additional and, from the court's viewpoint, necessary evidence. The American writes: What kind of court is this if it may, as it chooses, assist one party in obtaining additional evidence? There should be one rule in court: Whatever a person has brought to court he uses as evidence. And nothing doing, as they say, no trial either. [Skvirenko] Strict, but fair. A deforming influence on the judicial process is also being exerted, incidentally, by the inequality in the position of prosecutor and attorney, which is traditional here. [Barbalat] There was a time when the prosecutor, generally, exercised supervision of the activity of the court--this is now called supervision of the legality of the adopted judicial decisions. Such supervision is alien to normal civilized countries. If a judicial error has been made, it is rectified with the aid of the judicial mechanism. So the nonequivalence of the position of prosecutor and attorney is a continuation of that same outdated trend. Yes, all participants in the legal process should, of course, be placed under equal conditions. And, of course, the real independence of the court should be assured also--then it could be said that our judiciary was reaching the level of the world standard. [Skvirenko] And now the most topical question. What effect is the election campaign, which is just getting under way, having on your activity? [Barbalat] It is known that we have delegated to the Central Electoral Commission seven justices, who constitute its legal nucleus, as it were. The Election Act made provision for five justices, incidentally, but parliament decided to enlarge the size of the "brigade of justices." To Lucinschi's question concerning our attitude toward this quota, I honestly replied: with misgivings. For it seemed to us that an opportunity to involve us in some political games would emerge. But since this is the decision that has been adopted, we will do everything in our power for the strictest compliance with the requirements of the law. [Skvirenko] And are your misgivings being justified? [Barbalat] As yet, no. We are not taking part in any political or social actions even. We recently had an awkward discussion on this subject with a television official--he demanded in a tone of voice implying an order almost that our representative take part in a session of a roundtable on election matters. I categorically prohibited this. But, on the other hand, the judges are prepared, in accordance with the law, to examine most promptly locally all citizens' complaints on questions of this violation or the other in the course of the preparation and holding of the elections. And in accordance with the law, of course, the Supreme Court has to make a final ruling on the legality of the parliamentary elections of 27 February 1994. Generally, such a ruling should be made by a constitutional court, but inasmuch as we do not have such, parliament has entrusted this mission to us--in the person of a plenum of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Moldova. [Skvirenko] With what would you yourself like to end our interview? [Barbalat] I would like to return to the beginning to stress that the court is not an organ of struggle against crime, as certain journalists and public figures are attempting to maintain. The idea of the court is the idea of justice ensuring the health of the social and state organism by means of unswerving respect for human rights. As far as the fight against crime proper is concerned, I remember well, you know, the programs that were drawn up in party bodies and oriented us toward the phased eradication of crime--in terms of timeframe and percentages, by nature and category.... Such programs do not work! As long as civilization exists, most likely, it will be dealing with this problem. Nonetheless, its scale and seriousness will undoubtedly depend on all of us. And will result primarily from our attitude toward the problems of the youth, adolescents, and children. Let Minister for Youth Affairs Sandulachi not be offended with me, but it seems to me that these problems have moved somewhere toward the periphery of our attention. For instance, adolescents left fully to their own devices are busy with self-education in far from the best forms and traditions.... And what do the schoolchildren do during vacations? The camps and holiday hotels are empty, and even passes to children's playgrounds are beyond the reach of the majority of parents.... Where are we leading our children, our youth? [Skvirenko] Where are we pushing them, it would be more correct to say. [Barbalat] The answer to this question, unfortunately, has to be drawn from judicial practice. And we need, like the air we breathe, a different practice--one of normal, valuable, healthy relations between people. Without this nothing good with us will result. Neither in the economy nor in policy. Neither in the family nor in the country. For we will always get what we deserve. No less. But no more either.
