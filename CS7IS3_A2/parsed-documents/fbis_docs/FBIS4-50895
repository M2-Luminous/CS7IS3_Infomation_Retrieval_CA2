The report alleged that there were nearly 500 newly reported detainees from the 1989 protests in Beijing No. 2 Prison and the Qinghe Reform-Through-Labor Farm in Tianjin. It claimed that the prisoners remain under harsh conditions and often have been tortured and poorly treated in jail. "This is a sheer fabrication," the spokesman said in response to a request for comment. The "Human Rights Watch-Asia" and "Human Rights in China" have a deep hostility toward China, the spokesman said, adding that in the past they fabricated similar rumors on the issue of human rights. "It is out of ulterior motives that they spread such rumors now," the spokesman said.
