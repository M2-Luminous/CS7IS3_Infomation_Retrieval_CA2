He has just returned to Luanda from South Africa where he had talks with President Mandela. After consultations with President dos Santos he is heading back to Lusaka. In spite of the snail pace negotiations and the fierceness of the fighting, Mr. Beye is apparently not a man to despair. From Luanda, Chris Simpson reports. Alioune Blondin Beye reiterated once again that he was still optimistic about the prospects of peace in Angola and that the Lusaka talks are still moving toward a settlement. He acknowledged that Angolans in cities like Kuito and Malanje were in a terrible predicament and that the current phase of fighting was the worst for months, but he refused to succumb to pessimism. Mr. Beye is meeting President Jose Eduardo dos Santos this evening and confirmed he will be returning to Lusaka tomorrow, which may rule out another meeting with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in Huambo. Mr. Beye stressed that it was a top priority to get UN aid flights back on track, but so far, it has not been possible, with UNITA yet to give its approval. The head of the UN World Food Program in Angola, Philippe Borel, warned today that cities like Malanje cut off for more than a month were likely to slide back to the state they were in several months ago, with hundreds of people dying. It is a tragedy, he said. There is no hint of any let-up in the fighting inside Angola, with Angolan National Radio again reporting fierce clashes in Kuito, with 30 deaths today.
