Pyongyang Does Not Intend to Yield"] [Text] The unresolved state of the crisis connected with the verification of the DPRK's nuclear potential is making the situation in the East Asian region more complex by the hour, reviving gloomy recollections of the bloody Korean war into which the United States, China, and the USSR were also drawn. Discussions concerning the checking of nuclear installations in North Korea are giving way to open threats about the use of force, including military force. The situation is dangerous because in the event of an armed conflict, apart from the North and South Korean Armies, the 40,000-strong U.S. corps stationed in the south of the peninsula will also be drawn into it. North Korea has completed preparations for war on the Korean peninsula, but as yet there are no particular signs in its steps of readiness for armed provocations against Seoul. ROK Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae stated as much on Thursday, reading a report in the military commission of the South Korean parliament. From what he said, toward the end of July 1993 a special staff was created in the DPRK to prepare for war, and weapons and other military industry output were accumulated in underground stores. Long-range self-propelled guns and rocket launchers, presenting danger to the South Korean capital, were placed in the foremost position near the DMZ dividing the peninsula. According to information from North Korean sources in Moscow, if there is an armed conflict, all eight nuclear electric power stations on the territory of South Korea could be targets for bombing strikes. After that, so specialists believe, Chernobyl will look like a light-hearted prelude to a real tragedy. The Japanese SANKEI SHIMBUN, citing the manual circulated among servicemen of the American contingent in South Korea, has published figures about the correlation of forces on the Korean peninsula. Becuase its forces are inferior to the U.S. and South Korean forces opposing them in terms of technical equipment, intelligence and tracking systems, and targeting and guidance systems, the DPRK is trying to compensate for this with enhanced maneuverability, training for action at night and in poor visibility, and concentrating troops in the main salients, and also by numerical superiority. In the event of an attack, the DPRK will outnumber the combined American and South Korean forces in manpower by six to one, in tanks and armored vehicles by five to one, and in artillery by eight to one. A possible attack, the newspaper believes, could be organized in three directions: Along the west and east coasts of the peninsula, and also down the central valley. The most important role, U.S. intelligence believes, will be played in this by the 60,000-strong DPRK special-purpose crack troops, whose mission is to disrupt enemy rear services. "If Japan heads or joins any sanctions against the DPRK we will consider this a declaration of war, and Japan will not escape proper retribution," a North Korean Foreign Ministry statement transmitted by the KCNA agency says. The worsening crisis is highlighting completely new problems concerning North Korea's nuclear potential. As THE NEW YORK TIMES believes, "North Korea could complete the process of enriching the nuclear fuel recently removed from its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and obtain enough plutonium to make four or five bombs by the end of this year." At the same time THE WASHINGTON TIMES, citing well-informed sources, writes that the operation to remove fuel from the nuclear reactor in Yongbyon has caused "renewed" alarm in U.S. intelligence departments. In this connection, concern is being expressed that Pyongyang "could" pass on a nuclear device, fissile materials, or technology to certain states in the Near East. The potential buyers are being named as Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. The powers with a profound interest in resolving the crisis on the Korean Peninsula have not yet arrived at a unanimous opinion on what action to take in the immediate future. The United States has drawn up a draft UN Security Council resolution providing for the imposition of an economic embargo against Pyongyang but has not yet familiarized other countries with its text. This was reported to THE NEW YORK TIMES by "U.S. officials" at the UN headquarters. According to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, "the most urgent task at present is for the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution on the introduction of sanctions against North Korea." Moscow, despite increasing appeals to the DPRK over the suspicions that it is developing its own nuclear weapons, still believes that this problem should be resolved within the framework of the international conference proposed by Russia in accordance with the "six plus two" formula. This was confirmed in an interview with ITAR-TASS by Russian Federation Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov. "Our position remains as before: We advocate a conference at which this question must be resolved," the high-ranking Russian diplomat said. "Since the dialogue failed at the bilateral level, it must be resolved on a multilateral level." This initiative has not yet met with support. China is opposed to the use of sanctions against the DPRK, a spokesman for the PRC Foreign Ministry declared Thursday, reporting on the working talks between PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula. The speediest resumption of talks is the best way to resolve the DPRK nuclear problem. The use of sanctions can only exacerbate the problem and increase confrontation between the sides involved, the PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out. The likelihood of separate U.S., Japanese, and South Korean sanctions against the DPRK is "extremely low" at present -- so said a Japanese Foreign Ministry leadership spokesman at a Tokyo meeting Wednesday with foreign policy experts from the Liberal Democratic Party, the leading opposition party. Tokyo does not believe, however, that there is any point in the present situation in giving serious study to Russia's proposals for holding an international conference on the Korean Peninsula with the participation of the two Korean states, China, Russia, the United States, Japan, the United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The ITAR-TASS Agency was told this by a senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official. He pointed out that Tokyo now intends to try to resolve the problem of Pyongyang's nuclear program mainly on the basis of close consultations with the United States and South Korea.
