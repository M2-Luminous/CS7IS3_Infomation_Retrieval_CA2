Two earlier attempts at ending the fighting between the Mandingos and the Krahns, had ended in failure. Several hundred people have been killed in clashes that have mostly centred on the Bomi region to the north and west of Monrovia. ULIMO president Alhaji Koromah of the Mandingo clan and the movement's military leader, General Roosevelt Johnson of the Krahns, met at the headquarters of the West African peacekeeping force ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. ULIMO secretary-general Isaac Quawah said afterwards that there had been no breakthrough but added, "We are determined to reach an agreement." The feud centres on the distribution of posts of responsibility within ULIMO, with the Krahns accusing Kromah of favouring the Mandingos, although membership of the movement is equally divided between the two. ECOMOG has been trying for two months to disarm Liberia's warring factions, but has only succeeded in disarming some 3,000 out of a total of some 60,000 combatants as the fighting goes on unchecked in ULIMO-controlled areas. Hostilities have also continued in central and eastern regions under the control of ULIMO's rival National Patriotic Front of Liberia, which has since last September been fending off attacks by armed militiamen in the Liberian Peace Council. NPFL head Charles Taylor accepted a proposition Friday by the LPC to start peace talks in Monrovia this week to negotiate an end to the fighting under United Nations and ECOMOG mediation. If the ULIMO clans can along with the LPC and the NPFL strike a lasting settlement, that would provide the impetus for the UN and ECOMOG to bring all the belligerent groups to the negotiating table in order to end the conflict which has wracked the country since December 1989.
