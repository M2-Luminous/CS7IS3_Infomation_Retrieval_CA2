The Rs. 235-crore contract signed by the Indian Space Research Organisation with Glavkosmos of Russia in January 1991 had been for the supply of two cryogenic stages and transfer of technology. The United States objected to the deal, insisting that it violated the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), and in May 1992 imposed a two-year embargo on the ISRO and Glavkosmos. Under the U.S. pressure, Russia invoked the force majeure clause and informed the Government of India in July last year that Glavkosmos would not transfer cryogenic technology or production equipment. In a press interview at the time, the ISRO Chairman, Prof U.R. Rao, had asserted that India was not interested in mere engines. The sale of engines without the accompanying transfer of technology was meaningless, he said. When a Glavkosmos team, led by its head, Mr. Alexander Dunayev, was in Bangalore last month to renegotiate the deal, there were reports doing the rounds in ISRO circles that India would get additional cryogenic engines, but not the technology. Official ISRO sources had refused to confirm or deny these reports. But a recent agency report from Moscow, quoting Mr. Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency, said cryogenic technology would not be transferred and India could get two additional cryogenic stages instead. This report has since been confirmed by highly reliable ISRO sources. Russian interests: If these new terms are agreed to -- the renegotiated deal is reportedly yet to be finalised -- Russia would have effectively safeguarded its interests. Russia has completed a considerable part of the development of the cryogenic engine and stage, and is said to have received Rs. 102 crores from India. Had India decided to cancel the deal, this development effort would have been wasted and Russia might have had to pay compensation as well. The new deal would allow Russia to salvage the contract in return for two additional stages. The ISRO's acceptance of additional cryogenic stages, in lieu of technology appears motivated by a desire to avoid delays in developing cryogenic technology indigenously. The initial GSLVs would be launched with Russian cryogenic stages and indigenous development pursued alongside. The indigenous cryogenic stage could be ready in five years if there were no hitches, said one senior ISRO expert. But he also agreed that such hitches were common in cryogenic engine development and that other countries had taken twice as long. There is also said to be a provision for India to buy more cryogenic stages from Russia if indigenous development was not completed in time. Cost factor: An important issue that will have to be considered is the cost. Under the earlier contract, the Rs.235 crores would have got India two stages as well as the technology to make the cryogenic engines and stages. The same money would now get India four stages. That works out to nearly Rs. 60 crores for each stage, the cost of an entire Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). If more stages have to be bought, as they very well might be, that would push up the bill still further. There is no information available as yet on how much these cryogenic stages would cost. In addition, the ISRO will have to find the money to fund its own indigenous effort, which could cost Rs. 500 crores or more. A crucial assumption appears to be that the GSLV can be launched, as earlier planned, in 1995-96. But with last year's failure of the PSLV as well as delays in the GSLV development programme, it is more likely that the GSLV will fly only by 1998, according to ISRO experts themselves. If the indigenous cryogenic engine can be developed in five years as the ISRO claims, it should be possible to wait one more year and launch an entirely indigenous GSLV. The Russian cryogenic stages would then not be needed at all.
