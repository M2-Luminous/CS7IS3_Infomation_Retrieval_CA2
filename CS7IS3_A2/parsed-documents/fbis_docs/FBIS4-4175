This was stated by Tian Jiyun, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress when addressing the New Zealand-China Trade Association here this afternoon. He listed the major achievements made by the two countries in their economic cooperation in recent years and expressed the hope that more NZ business people and government officials will visit China to deepen mutual understanding. After briefing the New Zealand businessmen on the reforms in China, Tian pledged that "China will open wider to the world." He said that "to maintain and expand the influx of foreign investment, we should further improve the environment for such investment and the laws and regulations applying to it." "We should protect the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises with exclusively foreign investment and use the government's industrial policies to channel such investment into basic industries and infrastructure," he concluded.
