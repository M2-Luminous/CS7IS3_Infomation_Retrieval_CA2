Vavilov'';UDC 621.397.3:681.3] [Abstract] Recognition of three-dimensional objects on a perspective image of a real locale is examined, the process involving detection and subsequent identification of an a'priori known object on a real image possibly much larger than that object. The basic procedure is to construct a reference image of the sought object and then find the latter on a large image. Inasmuch as it is not otherwise feasible to store reference images covering the entire gamut of conditions (aspect, position of light source, focal length of lens, resolution), automatic recognition by means of three-dimensional computer graphics is being resorted to so that both the locale and the shape of an object can be described mathematically in a form readily yielding quasi-photographic likenesses under practically any conditions. Successful computer-aided simulation of reference images requires storing in the computer memory not the numerous reference images of the sought object but only its shape and optical characteristics, a single reference image then being generated by a synthesizer under predetermined conditions. The procedure is demonstrated on automatic object detection and recognition with the aid of video sensors on an aircraft in flight. For reconstruction of a whole scene, each individual three-dimensional object or group of objects is fictitiously enveloped with a convex polyhedral shell. As an example is considered a hexahedral shell with the base on the ground, the parallel to it roof in the air, and the lateral four other faces of equal height h in vertical position. The calculations are programmed so that the width of the shell will, depending on the sun's position, automatically increase so as to optimally envelop not only the three-dimensional object but also its two-dimensional shadow. For this purpose the computer solves a system of four equations in space coordinates X[.sub]i[/],Y[.sub]i[/] of the four base vertices i= 1(1)4 and space coordinates X[.sub]sun[/], Y[.sub]sun[/],Z[.sub]sun[/] of the sun, with the height h of the shell given. The algorithm of image synthesis yields first an image of the entire locale without objects in it and then adds zone-by-zone the images of objects, including their shadows and other graphically describable items, each within its fictitious enveloping shell. The algorithm includes also calculation of the image brightness based on information about the brightness of pixels, unless Nyquist's rule is observed and the space frequency of readout from the discretized locale image is accordingly at least twice as high than the spatial discretization frequency of that image.
