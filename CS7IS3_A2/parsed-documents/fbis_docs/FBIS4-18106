The terror group's announcement was welcomed -- but only as a potentially interim step. Prime Minister Albert Reynolds stressed that what was really needed was a permanent end to the Northern Ireland-linked violence. That was the only way, he said, that the political process could be moved forward. The hope was that the development could be built on to create a long-term cessation of terrorism, officials in the Irish capital added. That prospect was envisaged earlier this month by deputy Irish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Dick Spring. He controversially looked ahead to a temporary IRA ceasefire providing a foundation for moves towards a political settlement of the Ulster conflict. In subsequent comments, though, Mr Spring made it clear that only a permanent rejection of violence by the hard-line Irish Republicans would permit them to enter the constitutional political arena. The Dublin sources made no attempt to cloak their disappointment that the IRA had not gone the whole way in tonight's statement. And, speaking ahead of the anticipated development, Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said he would study the contents of any announcement that was made. But he added: "While any reduction in violence would be welcome, a short term one, or one of short duration would be disappointing. I would be disappointed because what the situation demands at this stage is -- in order to move the peace process forward -- a cessation of violence." [passage omitted]
