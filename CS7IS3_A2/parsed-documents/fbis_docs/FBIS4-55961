[Ganic] We will defend ourselves, but, because of the arms embargo, we have only a limited number of armor-piercing weapons. Serbia will continue fighting. The Serbian offensive will continue, because they have received contradictory signals from the international community. In Gorazde, the Serbs got round the NATO ultimatum. NATO should have put the Serbs heavy weapons out of action, but Mr. Akashi failed to give a green light. He preferred to have 100 dead and 1,000 injured Bosnians to the destruction of 30 Serbian tanks. [Rahimpour] Do you believe that UN emissary Akashi has been making deals with the Serbs? [Ganic] Instead of respecting UN resolutions, Akashi has been working closely with the Serbs. The high point came when he allowed them to take their tanks from Sarajevo and position them in places from where they can attack our positions. He is responsible for the deaths of people in Gorazde. He could have prevented the massacre. [Rahimpour] How do you envisage the establishment of peace? [Ganic] The Serbs should return land to the Croats and Moslems. That means a withdrawal from those areas where Croats and Moslems constitute a majority. [Rahimpour] Are you satisfied with 51 percent of Bosnia's territory? [Ganic] The Serbs are talking about 51 percent, we want more. We will begin by implementing the federation on the territory that we control. We will continue with our efforts using political means, but if necessary, we will also resort to other means. [Rahimpour] Military means? [Ganic] The international community should tell us how we are to recover our territory. [Rahimpour] What do your territorial claims mean in quantitative terms? [Ganic] We are demanding about 66 percent of the Bosnian territory that was held by Croats or Moslems before the war. For the sake of peace, it could also be somewhat less than that, but then that would have to be settled beforehand with those private property owners who have been expelled. The best thing would be a federation in which everyone could return to where they come from. We are only calling for the restoration of the situation that existed before the war. [Rahimpour] What else do you want? [Ganic] We want the war criminals to be identified and sentenced. Only then can we live together once again. People who left their sons or daughters in the genocide will be able to direct their hatred away from those who carried out orders and project it onto the responsible war criminals. [Rahimpour] What are the limits to your readiness to reach a compromise? [Ganic] The Serbs will not, of course, receive any territory from us that does not belong to them, unless the European Union and the United States give them land. [Rahimpour] Can the enclaves in eastern Bosnia survive? [Ganic] Yes, people only need to be given back what belongs to them, and the United Nations should protect the enclaves. [Rahimpour] But who can guarantee that the corridors linking the greater part of the country and the enclaves in eastern Bosnia will not be severed by the Serbs at some point? [Ganic] Any agreement must guarantee the security of the enclaves. Not only our army, but the United Nations too should protect them. In the end, the United Nations created the enclaves. They should also defend them now. [Rahimpour] But the United Nations cannot even defend itself. [Ganic] It can. After all, they have 300 NATO jets at their disposal. [Rahimpour] Would you be prepared to exchange the enclaves in eastern Bosnia for more land in central Bosnia? [Ganic] No! There can be no Bosnia without eastern Bosnia. Land west of the Drina River has never belonged to the Serbs. [Rahimpour] Does the Moslem-Croatian alliance have a future? [Ganic] Yes, of course. It constitutes a renaissance of part of Bosnia, a renaissance that should extend to the entire country. [Rahimpour] Have the peace negotiations in Geneva become irrelevant? [Ganic] Yes, unless the military balance between us and the Serbs can be restored. That is the only way in which one can make them give us more land.
