Speaking at a House of Lords debate on Hong Kong, Lord Cromer, a leading British businessman in Hong Kong, said, "It is my view, and a view I would add that is shared by much of the community in Hong Kong, that her Majesty's government has embarked on a policy in Hong Kong that is seriously flawed." "It is a policy that is aiming to bring to Hong Kong a political system which...[ellipses as received] May not ultimately be compatible with Hong Kong's aspirations," he said. "It is also a policy which flies in the face of an immensely painstaking and ultimately highly successful series of negotiations...[ellipses as received] Which led to the signing of the joint declaration in 1984," he added. Refuting Chris Patten's claim that there was a "clear wish" in Hong Kong for further movement towards democracy, Lord Cromer said that no one has yet been able to provide any evidence that there was any such clear wish among the great majority of the people in Hong Kong. "What Hong Kong people want is prosperity, not democracy," he told the House. He pointed out that by insisting on constitutional changes in Hong Kong against Chinese objections, "the British side has chosen a path that has led to confrontation" with China. "Why have we put at risk a relationship with the world's most populous nation in order to offer something to the people of Hong Kong that is not within our power to deliver?" he asked. In his speech at the debate, former Hong Kong Governor Lord MacLehose said that he was "critical of manner in which the attempted reforms have been approached at this time." Chris Patten's constitutional initiative had proved to be a "serious mistake" and was "unlikely to do the people of Hong Kong any good," he commented. He warned that "there may be a mood of disillusionment with Britain and with the British Government when it becomes apparent that all these activities on the constitutional front have so little practical content for the people of Hong Kong." Another former Hong Kong governor, Lord Wilson, reminded his fellow Lords that the Chinese Government had made it clear that if there is no agreement between the two countries, any new arrangements in Hong Kong will not survive 1997. "That statement, I believe, needs to be taken seriously," he said. He pointed out that to ensure smooth transition and to maintain stability and prosperity in Hong Kong before and after 1997, the "guiding star" for the British policy "must surely be not the short term, but the medium and long term." "We must do as much as we possibly can, wherever possible in co-operation with China, to achieve what is right and beneficial for the people of Hong Kong and for the success of the Hong Kong special administrative region after 1997," he said.
