Despite Kiev's Objections, the CIS Receives Observer Status in the United Nations"] [Text] Debates at the 48th session of the UN General Assembly, which has resumed in New York, were marked by yet another clash between Moscow and Kiev. In the last two years the world has managed to get used to the fact that the two largest Slav states appear in the role of antagonists in international forums with enviable constancy. The discussion of the question of conferring UN observer status on the CIS was no exception. Vladimir Khandogiy, the Ukrainian representative, issued a hard-hitting statement that took the Russian delegation by surprise. He resolutely objected to the recognition of the Commonwealth as a subject of international law and as a regional organization which could carry out peacekeeping operations. This position radically contradicts Russia's approach. Moscow is insistently seeking international recognition of the CIS, and it was mainly thanks to its efforts that the issue of granting the Commonwealth UN observer status was included on the agenda of the 48th session. Replying to Khandogiy's speech, Russia's permanent representative to the United Nations Yuriy Vorontsov stated that Ukraine's objections are "due to its being insufficiently informed on the character of the Commonwealth and the agreements between its members." In his words, the treaty which is the legal basis of the CIS' peacekeeping activity was signed between Commonwealth members -- including Ukraine -- 20 March 1992 in Kiev. Despite Ukraine's peculiar position, the CIS nevertheless received observer status, which as of today is possessed by three regional organizations -- the European Union, the Arab League, and the Organization of African Unity. The resolution to this effect was adopted by the General Assembly without a vote. Commenting on Kiev's position, a high-ranking Russian diplomat did not rule out that Ukraine's new hardline approach is connected with the forthcoming elections to the republic parliament. By going against Moscow and once more stating their skeptical attitude to the CIS, it is possible that the Kiev authorities are counting on attracting the votes of supporters of Ukrainian independence -- mainly in the republic's western oblasts. However, Ukrainian diplomacy's New York demarche could produce an undesirable effect for Kiev in regions with a Russian-speaking population, first and foremost in the Crimea. Inhabitants of the peninsula have received fresh confirmation that the Ukrainian leadership is not seeking rapprochement with Russia. This could fuel anti-Ukrainian sentiments and affect the results of the poll on the status of the Crimea scheduled for 27 March.
