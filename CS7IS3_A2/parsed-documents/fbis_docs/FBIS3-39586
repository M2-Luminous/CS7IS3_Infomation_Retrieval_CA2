At a rally of his Forza Italia (Go Italy) movement in this Adriatic port city, the entrepreneur who parlayed real estate into a publishing and television empire looked first to the contest at the polls. "The men of the left were convinced they had won, that they were the assigned rulers," he said with the gains of the progressives in two-tier municipal elections around the nation in November and December last year. "But when you scratch under the paint, you find the state-ism and manager-ism of always." A victory of the left next month, Berlusconi insisted, would spell "disaster for economic freedom" because of an ideology "rejected by history," though these progressives now "mumble liberalism. We cannot resign ourselves to the fact of a minority taking the government of the country in hand and taking it on the dangerous path of recession," he declared to an assembly of some 1,000 Forza Italian supporters here. He went on to promise a crusade waged "with new men... without personal attacks on the adversaries" and one pursued to "relaunch the economy...and maintain jobs and create new ones." On the maneuvers afoot for the formation of alliances and coalitions ahead of the elections, the new face on the political scene said, "For whole nights I looked at the ceiling with my chest swollen with anxiety" before deciding not to go it alone. The day after formalizing an alliance with the insurgent Northern League, plus two center-right splinter groups orphaned by the collapse of the Christian Democratic Party and others, Berlusconi said that despite the "coarseness" of the League, this movement "has provided a great contribution. "They too have understood that the time of succession has passed and now is the time for construction and government responsibilities. With our moderation and balance, we will be able to start up positive cooperation," declared the Forza Italia leader. After noting that the new majority electoral law works in favor of alliances and coalitions, Berlusconi discussed his "technical" agreement with the recently-formed National Alliance on the far-right. He noted that the National Alliance mainstay, the neofascist MSI [Italian Social Movement], captured nearly 50 percent of the mayoral vote in Rome and Naples at the end of last year. The MSI, "a party always left in the ghetto, outside the democratic span," has "taken many steps forward and I am now convinced of their liberal and democratic ideas," he insisted with reference to the party which traces its lineage directly to dictator Benito Mussolini's rump Republic of Salo. He went on to sweep in the other groupings "extending cooperation," the Democratic Christian Center and the Centrist Union plus areas of Mario Segni's Pact for Italy. Shared by Forza Italia and the Democratic Christian Center, he said, are "the inspiring principles of the Catholic tradition and culture, the irrevocable values of family, life, solidarity and justice. It is right to use their valid support." On his platform, Berlusconi emphasized the need to put the public sector "on a diet," overhaul the fiscal administration and apply a ceiling on fiscal pressure and reorganize public services "of low quality" which now penalize the weakest sectors of the population. On law and order, he declared, "There is a high percentage of murders and thefts which go unpunished. The first and fundamental duty of the state is to assure safety and security for its citizens," he added. At the end of last month, Berlusconi handed to his deputy the chair of his Fininvest financial holding company, Italy's second largest private enterprise after the Fiat group, to begin campaigning full time at the head of his Forza Italia movement.
