The three-judge panel acted on an appeal from Nakamura who had asked for bail so he can take part in a Diet vote to pick a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation last Friday. But no date has been set for the Diet vote yet. Nakamura, 45, an independent member of the House of Representatives, has been detained at the Tokyo detention house since mid-March after prosecutors arrested him on suspicion of taking a 10 million yen bribe from leading general contractor Kajima Corp. Prosecutors indicted Nakamura on April 1 on charges of taking the bribe on January 13, 1992, from Shinji Kiyoyama, then vice president of Kajima. The Tokyo District Court did not state its reasons for the latest rejection. Nakamura's first bail application was dismissed last Tuesday on the grounds he might destroy evidence. Nakamura's latest appeal was a "junkoku" appeal which can be filed with a three-judge panel at a district court. It is a legal recourse available under the Code of Criminal Procedure when the defense claims it is dissatisfied with a decision by a single judge. Nakamura is the sole Diet member implicated in connection with an influence-peddling scandal surrounding the country's leading construction contractors. He quit the Liberal Democratic Party just before his arrest and is currently an independent member of the lower house. If found guilty, Nakamura could face up to five years in prison, according to the penal code.
