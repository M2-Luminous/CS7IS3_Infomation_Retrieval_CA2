They claim that smugglers befriend visiting tourists and businessmen and hide drugs in their cars before they cross the Channel. Ron Williams, aged 55, of Newport, Gwent, is a transport manager and HGV driver who had no criminal record. In January 1993, he travelled to Spain to meet potential clients. In Fuengirola, he met an English couple in a bar who said they were touring Spain. Mr Williams told them he had a problem with his car, and they said they knew a mechanic who could fix it. The mechanic returned the car saying he had repaired an electrical fault. He also said that a relative might be interested in a business deal and asked for Mr William's address. Mr Williams gave him his business card. Mr Williams set off home, taking the sleeper from Malaga and putting his car on a separate train. At the French border at Hendaye he was searched by Customs officers and he told them of his car. Two and a half hours later Mr Williams was woken at Bordeaux by customs officers and told that 16 kilos of cannabis had been found in the rear inner panels of his car at the border. He was arrested. His trial took place in Bayonne. The judge had been told that a Ronald Williams had previous convictions for robbery in Britain and armed robbery in Germany. Mr Williams protested that the records shown were of another Ronald Williams, that it was a common name in Britain and his full name was Ronald Watkins Williams. "The judge was not interested and the trial was over in 25 minutes," Mr Williams said last week. "There was a school party in the court being shown how the court worked and while the judge was out, the children were told in front of me that this was how foreign drug smugglers were dealt with." He was jailed for two years. "I was told that the penalty was heavier because there were the schoolchildren there." After serving a year he was told that if he agreed to pay Â£5,000 he would be released early. He returned in February. "I have never been involved with the police before but now I have lost my business, I have bills from when I was locked up to pay. If I had really been smuggling drugs surely I would have got off the train as soon as it was obvious they were going to search my car." Mr Williams has contacted Stephen Jakobi, a lawyer and the chairman of Fair Trials Abroad, who specialises in cases involving British subjects in foreign jails. Mr Jakobi said it was one of a number of cases he is handling where people are "befriended" in France or Spain and drugs are later found in their car. In one case, Doug Belcher, an electrical engineer, is due to stand trial in Bayonne on May 5, accused of importing 44 kilos of cannabis. He met English people in a Malaga restaurant and told them his travel plans. He has said he believes drugs could have been hidden in door panels during the meal. In another case, Raymond Bickley, aged 49, from Brighton, who is in the travel business, was arrested in St Malo in December 1992 in the car of a man he had met a few days earlier. His family were not told of his arrest for two weeks. "I have never taken, bought, sold, imported or exported drugs," he said. "The only time I have been offered drugs was during my incarceration in Rennes." The use of travellers by drug smugglers is an old ruse; Customs officers would say it is also an old excuse used by people when arrested. But Mr Jakobi said the pattern of complaint to him indicated that innocent people are being arrested. "Either it's people using unwitting travellers or else setting people up as decoys," he said yesterday. "What is of concern is that the latest figures show that there are 270 British people in prison in France, of whom a quarter are in Bayonne. The judges do not have the time or the patience to listen to and investigate their cases, and as a result innocent people are being imprisoned."
