The source predicts that the 1994 price index will remain generally the same or be slightly lower than in 1993. An approximately 13 percent rise is predicted. This means that it will not be less than two digits, and will not very likely exceed 15 percent. If the economic growth rate is nine percent, this will not have too strong an impact on economic life. So long as no great ups and downs occur in the operation of the economy, the degree of increase in prices will be tolerable. Persons concerned feel that there are more favorable factors in the price situation in 1994 than in 1993. The situation may be looked at from the following several angles: First, the intensity of price reform has diminished. The degree and range of decontrol of prices for both means of livelihood and means of production is already substantial in China's pricing system. Although some price reform measures may continue to be inaugurated during 1994, the effect will be less than in 1993. Second the degree of opening of China's markets to the outside world will continue to expand in 1994. This is particularly true of means of production markets. To a certain extent, this will help international market resources keep in check the overly high degree of rise in means of production prices, thereby stabilizing China's markets. Third, the situation in means of livelihood markets suggests continuation of a pattern of supply being greater than demand. This will help hold down price rises attributable to panic buying, and it will also help restrain cost-driven currency inflation. Conversely, unfavorable factors may also appear in the following several regards: First, a fairly large amount of currency was issued in 1993, and forecasts call for no marked weakening of this trend during 1994. This may exert a certain amount of demand pull on market prices. Second, prices of transportation, energy, and raw and processed materials have risen greatly during the past two years, spurring a rise in costs, thereby increasing market pressures in 1994. Third, the merging of the two different exchange rates in 1994 may give rise to price rise factors to a certain extent. Fourth, main agricultural products are in relatively short supply today. Prices of staple and non-staple foods may exhibit a rising trend in 1994. Overall, the overall price level in 1994 will be limited by overall social supply and demand and the market environment. If the double digit economic growth rate of 1993 is to be maintained, the government will have no choice but to increase credit. Reportedly, a finance and banking conference decided that all banks in the nation must rigorously control total credit in 1994 at below 4.5 trillion yuan. This total may not be exceeded. The state has made control of currency inflation and maintenance of sustained, steady, rapid, and healthy economic development its economic development plan for 1994. It was on this basis that a few days ago the State Council stated the present need to intensify macroeconomic regulation and control, increase control over prices, and not permit prices to rise at will. Otherwise, not only will the standard of the living of both city and countryside residents be hurt, but this could trigger overall instability. Given the not insignificant current "inflation rate," there is ample reason for having confidence that the nation's existing macroeconomic regulation and control measures will be effective. This is because the forecasts of an authoritative source suggests that the income of Chinese residents used to pay living expenses will still be higher than the degree of rise caused by currency inflation. However, it is hoped that this result can be realized.
