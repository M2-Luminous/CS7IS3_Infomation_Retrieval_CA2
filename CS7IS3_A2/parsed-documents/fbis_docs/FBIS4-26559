Beijing's political think-tank on Hong Kong affairs, the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), has recommended that the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government withdraw key political freedoms granted in the territory in recent years. The PWC will recommend the SAR government restore restrictions on political organisations which were removed from the 1949 Societies Ordinance in 1992 to conform with the Bill of Rights. Political societies in Hong Kong would be prohibited from forming ties with foreign organisations. Formation of new political organisations would not be allowed without permission from the government. The PWC warned the SAR government would also overturn amendments--if they were adopted--currently before the Legislative Council curbing police powers to stop and search people, and easing restrictions on public demonstrations. PWC members said the changes contravened the Basic Law--Hong Kong's mini-constitution after 1997- and breached the spirit of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. The PWC said the changes reduced the government's control over political organisations and activists and threatened the territory's stability. PWC legal group co-convenor Shao Tianren, a Chinese official who advises the Foreign Ministry, said the spirit of the Joint Declaration--stipulating the conditions under which Hong Kong would revert to Chinese rule--made it clear that the law in force in the territory since 1984 should remain basically unchanged. He said "any major change in the transitional period should be negotiated with the Chinese side". He said the SAR government would not adopt major legal changes introduced unilalerally by the British-Hong Kong government. The government hopes to amend the Public Order Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance to make them conform with the Bill of Rights. But China claimed this violate the Basic Law. "Any amendments or new legislation made between 1984 (the year the Joint Declaration was signed) and 1997 should not be regarded as original law of the territory (and should be negotiated first with China)," co-convenor Simon Li said. The former local Appeal Court judge said he suspected the Hong Kong government had attempted to circumvent the Basic Law by making the changes. He also accused the government of granting too much political freedom since 1990, resulting in almost daily public demonstrations. The recommendations caused a furore among Hong Kong's political activists and legislators. Prominent activist and United Democrats legislator Lau Chin-shek said the decision was indicative of Beijing's intention to clamp down on activists after 1997. Independent legislator Anna Wu said: "The move reflects that Beijing is cautious about political groups and would like to hinder basic freedoms in Hong Kong (after 1997)." Independent legislator Emily Lau warned the move could create "legal chaos".
