Ministers Han and Perry shared the view that what is most important at this stage is for North Korea to accept additional inspection of their nuclear facilities, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. Chang said the two ministers agreed that only after North Korea underwent additional inspection can third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level talks be held to discuss comprehensively the nuclear question and the issue of improving Washington-Pyongyang relations. During the meeting, Perry stressed the importance of resolving the nuclear issue through diplomatic efforts as far as possible, the spokesman said. The two ministers also observed that if North Korea fails to accept additional inspections within a given period, it would be unavoidable to promote a sanction against Pyongyang by the U.N. Security Council. In this connection, the spokesman said, Han and Perry decided to build up the joint defense ability of South Korea and the United States to prepare against any contingency. The two ministers, however, ruled that the Korean peninsula is not in a critical state at the moment because there is no unusual military movement on the part of North Korea. They further reaffirmed the principle that the inter-Korean dialogue and U.S.-North Korea talks should be promoted in a complementary way, spokesman Chang said.
