However, we should not end up turning Shanghai into a business center following the establishment of such links. Now is not the time to foster wide-ranging transportation links. Huang Kun-hui said: Direct cross-strait transportation can indeed reduce the cost and time of shipping containers. However, since our country and Communist China are in a state of hostility, the unconditional establishment of such links will amount to an acknowledgement that any direct routes thus established are domestic routes in Communist China. This will make it difficult to clarify to other nations that our country is not a province of China. Also, direct transportation services will affect our country's alert status.
