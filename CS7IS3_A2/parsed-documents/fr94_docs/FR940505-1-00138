FR940505-1-00138 FR940505-1-00012 ( c ) Control Period. EPA proposes to establish a fee-based program focused on controlling commercial aviation emissions only during the ozone season in each FIP area. Further, EPA proposes to assess fees on the basis of the season-long average of emissions per passenger and freight carried. There would be no enforceable expectation for emissions in a single day or month. This extended averaging period differs from the stationary source cap program in which year-round control and monthly control periods are proposed. Because of the complex nature of operational scheduling, commercial aircraft operations appear to have much less potential to vary significantly over the course of the ozone season in comparison to stationary sources. This reduces the need to be concerned about particular days with significantly more emissions than average that could adversely affect attainment. In addition, if the program is fee-based rather than based on a specific emissions limitation, enforcement does not require a short control period to be practicable as it does for the stationary source cap program. The proposed program for commercial aviation is both novel in concept and stringent, and EPA does not wish to burden the industry with controls outside the ozone season if they are not essential to the air quality goals of the FIP. Furthermore, operational changes outside the ozone season may provide some opportunity to ease the compliance burden during the season. The annual ozone seasons for each of the three FIP areas are: South Coast_March through October Ventura_April through October Sacramento_May through October Alternatively, EPA could establish a year-round fee program and apply fees separately in each month in order to even better ensure that emissions are controlled each day. Beyond its contribution to ozone attainment, year-round control of NO X emissions from commercial aviation may aid efforts to comply with the particulate air quality standard, particularly in the South Coast control area. (Ensuring particulate air quality is not a requirement for this FIP.) Since state and local regulation over commercial aviation emissions is preempted by the federal government, such control would have to come at the federal level. The Agency, therefore, requests comment on potential alternative compliance strategies. ( 2 ) Key Regulatory Elements. ( a ) Summary. A detailed control strategy is described here for the South Coast FIP area, but will apply for all three control areas. Any differences in detail or emission reduction requirements for Ventura and Sacramento will be identified separately. The control strategy for commercial aircraft proposed today relies on a fee system to achieve a series of annual emissions reductions from a baseline commercial aircraft emissions inventory. Airlines subject to the requirements of this program will report activity and emissions during the ozone season on an annual basis beginning in 1999. An airline's compliance with the program requirements will be determined for a given year by comparing an environmental performance factor, expressed as pounds of pollutant emitted per passenger-equivalent unit (PEU) as calculated in the annual report, against EPA's published pounds-per-PEU target for that year's ozone season. Airlines that exceed a particular year's pounds-per-PEU target will be required to pay a fee in proportion to the excess emissions. EPA is proposing pounds-per-PEU targets that will achieve the requisite annual emission reductions based on projected growth in passenger and freight activity. (A more complete description of the proposed PEU factor and emission targets is presented in section III.D.4.e.(2)(b)( 2 )( b ).) In order to obtain airline compliance with these pounds-per-PEU targets, the Agency will observe the airlines' responses to the initial fee level in 2001, and will adjust the fee level to a higher or lower level if needed. The final FIP regulations will contain commitments to this effect, and will specify the specific level to which the fees will be adjusted or a formula for determining such level. Comments on this adjustment process are requested. EPA expects that the final fee program for this source will be consistent with the Agency's Economic Incentive Program rules as discussed in section III.D.5 of this NPRM. This commercial aircraft emission reduction program will apply to all commercial aircraft operators in the FIP areas, including domestic airlines, foreign airlines, and new entrant airlines. EPA recognizes the economic and social importance of accommodating new entrants and the expansion of existing airlines in any commercial aircraft emission reduction program. This control strategy attempts to accommodate these important concerns by not directly requiring EPA to allocate emissions or operational rights to individual airlines.
