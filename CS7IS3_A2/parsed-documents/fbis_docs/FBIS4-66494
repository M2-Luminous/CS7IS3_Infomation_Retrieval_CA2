The functional performance checks of the ADEOS satellite with various sensors and electrical systems carried on board have already been confirmed using the engineering model (test model No. 1). The purpose of the thermal structural model is to check whether the satellite can withstand harsh changes in the space environment by testing the model in a simulated environment. Various tests are scheduled to be completed by the end of FY93, and the manufacture of the actual satellite (to be launched) will start in the autumn of next year if the test results are good, to be ready for the first launch scheduled in February 1996. ADEOS is intended for obtaining global-scale observation data on environmental changes such as global warming, destruction of the ozone layer, receding of tropical rain forests, occurrence of abnormal weather, etc., in order to contribute to and help the international earth environment observation. It also employs innovations such as data relays between satellites, which will be an essential factor in the earth observation system of the next generation, in order to improve space advancement technology itself. This research and development of this satellite started in the early '90s, and the total investment is expected to reach ¥80 billion. Eight different kinds of sensors are carried on ADEOS in order to observe the land and sea areas, as well as the atmosphere. The sensors have been developed by manufacturers involved in space activities such as Mitsubishi, Toshiba, and NEC. The tests using the thermal structure model will be conducted at NASDA's Tsukuba Space Center. They are to verify whether the satellite itself can function as specified in a space environment whose temperatures range from 200�C to -200�C and whether the command system can withstand the vacuum that is simulated by the test facility.
