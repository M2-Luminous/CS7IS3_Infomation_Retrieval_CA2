The message says the dear leader, who was born as the lodestar followed by all the people in the battle site in the period of the anti-Japanese armed struggle with the soul of Mt. Paektu, has performed undying feats for the country and the nation, for the history and era with brilliant ideological and theoretical activities and outstanding leadership. "Guided by you Marshal Kim Chong-il, genius of the revolution and construction, our country has demonstrated its might as an invincible socialist country and a model of best socialism centred on the popular masses," it says, and continues: "Marshal Kim Chong-il with unexcelled grit and iron will defended the dignity and security of the socialist homeland of chuche and won one great victory after another in political and military confrontation with the enemy by declaring a semi-war state and taking a decisive step of withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to cope with the moves of the imperialists and the reactionaries for isolating and stifling our republic." The message notes that the glory and happiness of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan are unthinkable apart from the wise guidance and paternal affection of the sagacious leader Marshal Kim Chong-il, who is leading them to victory by successfully embodying the great leader President Kim Il-song's chuche-based idea of the movement of Koreans overseas. It expresses the resolution to vigorously promote the modelling of Chongnyon on the chuche idea, strengthen it organizationally and ideologically and register greater achievements in the efforts for national reunification and all other patriotic work, thus making this a year of a new victory in the history of the movement of Koreans in Japan. The message wishes Marshal Kim Chong-il good health and long life.
