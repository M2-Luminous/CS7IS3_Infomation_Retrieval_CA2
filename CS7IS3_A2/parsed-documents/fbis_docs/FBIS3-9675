"The Muslim spring offensive has begun and their offensive is taking place along all lines, and particularly on the Trebava battlefield near Doboj and toward Kupres. This offensive must stop. If the Muslims fail to atop their offensive, we would then have to launch a counteroffensive, and then we are no longer going to talk about territories. The Muslims can get territories for their state through negotiations, but if they nevertheless decide in favor of fighting, then the factual state will be decisive, as we cannot give back the territories for which young Serbian men are losing their lives. Therefore, it should be clear to the Muslim side and the international community that it is either war or peace here. If there is war by the will of the Muslims, then the Muslims must pay the price of that war," Karadzic said and added the following: "As regards the sending of the Turkish troops into Bosnia-Herzegovina, there is is another dangerous precedent involved here and I am afraid that this is the eclipse of the United Nations. I am afraid that the United Nations are quickly going in the direction of self-abolition, self-discredit, just as the case was with the League of the Nations before the World War II. If the arrival of Turkish troops leads to the escalation of the war, the UN secretary general and the Security Council will directly bear responsibility. We demand, and will do so officially, for FRY forces to be included in the Blue-Helmet forces. For, Russia is not a counterpart to Turkey, that is, Turkey is not a Russian counterpart. Russia is a counterpart to the United States, and Turkey is an interested Balkan country, so, apart from Greek soldiers, Yugoslav ones should join the forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
