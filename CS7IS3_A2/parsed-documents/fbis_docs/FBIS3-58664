Arsenis' comment came in response to Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's statement about Greek threats not enabling Turkey to demilitarize its western shores. The minister described Turkish verbal aggression as an awkward effort to attract international attention. He added there has been no increase in the number of airspace violations, which remain at the same level. He said Turkish planes are immediately intercepted. On Saturday [22 January] the defense minister will meet Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis in Thessaloniki to discuss the joint Greek-Cypriot defense area.
