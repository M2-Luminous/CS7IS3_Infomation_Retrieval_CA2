Minister Joao Miranda said that UNITA's behavior -- which hinges solely on its greed for ministerial portfolios -- shows that it wants to continue war because it is not ready for democratic coexistence. [Begin Miranda recording] The talks are at a crucial point, at this stage, because they face the risk of collapsing. That is because UNITA is neither collaborating nor interested in an immediate end to the war. Decidedly, what it is in fact interested in are the ministerial portfolios that it has been demanding. UNITA presents those demands merely as a (?hobby), but it seeks greater goals, namely to create a space for itself because it is not ready to live in a democracy. [end recording] Deputy Foreign Minister Joao Miranda said this when he met Pak Myong-ku, his DPRK counterpart, whom he briefed on the postelectoral crisis in Angola. The visiting DPRK is scheduled to be in this country for a few days, during which he will meet Angolan officials to get acquainted with the situation in the country. He will be obtaining that information from officials such as Johnny Pinnock Eduardo, secretary of state for cooperation; Media Minister Hendrick Vaal Neto; and Lopo do Nascimento, secretary general of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola.
