Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-16Mar94-RUSSIA Flood of Candidates, Impractical Rules Mar Coming Election SUMMARY As Ukraine enters the final weeks before the 27 March Supreme Soviet election, a very large number of candidates are competing for most of the 450 parliamentary seats, guaranteeing many runoffs and even raising the possibility that not enough deputies may be elected to form a parliament. Activity by parties varies widely--strong in Lviv and Donetsk but weak in many other places. With nationalist and democratic parties likely to run well in the west, leftist and liberal parties in the east, but non-party candidates likely to win the most seats nationwide, prospects are for a badly splintered Supreme Soviet with weak parties and little ability to resolve the country's tough problems. END SUMMARY Easy filing requirements and lax filing deadlines contributed to the flood of candidates. According to the election law, candidates had to file only 10 signatures by 60 days before the election (late January) to become a "candidate for candidate" and then 300 signatures by 45 days before the election (i.e., 10 February) to become a registered candidate (Vidomosti Verkhovnoi Rady Ukrainy, 30 November 1993). Although plenty of candidates had already qualified, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) allowed registration to continue after 10 February (Nezavisimost, 11 February), apparently until individual local electoral commissions decided to close it. Robitnycha Hazeta reported on 18 February that registration had ended in 211 of the 450 districts, and Holos Ukrainy reported on 23 February that all registration had finally ended on 17 February. In late February the CEC reported that 5,833 (86 percent) of the 6,750 "candidates for candidate" had been registered as final candidates (Holos Ukrainy, 2 March). The lists of candidates began appearing in local papers in mid-February, and candidates began appearing on local television in groups--for example, the 16 candidates for Kiev city district no. 14 were slated to make the first joint appearance on 14 February (Vecherniy Kiev, 12 February). Parties' Role Limited Parties played a limited role in putting forward candidates, formally nominating only a small percentage of the candidates in most districts. Groups of voters nominated 3,633 (62 percent), work collectives 1,557 (27 percent), while parties nominated only 643 (11 percent), according to the 2 March Holos Ukrainy. However, some areas, such as Lviv and Donetsk, had a much higher proportion of party nominees than the republic-wide 11 percent (See Box 1). In reality, however, there are far more party-affiliated candidates on the ballot than party nominations would indicate because some who were identified with a party in local papers were nominated by groups of electors or collectives. In Kiev Oblast, only 12 candidates were nominated by parties, but 46 candidates actually belong to parties (Kiyvska Pravda, 28 January). And in Donetsk, lists of candidates for the first 10 districts in Vecherniy Donetsk identified one third to one half of the candidates in most districts as affiliated with parties, far more than the number nominated by parties. At the same time, not all candidates affiliated with a party are endorsed as candidates by the party. A DemPU (Democratic Party of Ukraine) candidate is running against former Defense Minister Kostyantyn Morozov in Kiev district No. 1 but DemPU itself is backing Morozov (Samostiyna Ukraina, 23-28 February). So far, no parties have published republic-wide lists of their candidates, and though several publicly set a goal of running candidates in all districts, it appears none came close. Few parties have even provided numbers of their candidates. The paper Rada (published by Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil) on 3 March carried an article reporting that Rukh members were running in 260 of the 450 districts and that there also were dozens of independent candidates "who support Rukh and promise to join Rukh's faction if elected." The URP's paper Samostiyna Ukraina (23-28 February) reported that the URP had registered 132 candidates (including 17 in Lviv, 17 in Kiev, 10 in Ternopil, and 8 in Ivano-Frankivsk), while the DemPU was running fewer (including only 6 in Kiev city). The Post-Postup News Agency reported that a 24 January UNA (Ukrainian National Assembly) press conference announced 60 candidates (15 in Kiev, 15 in Poltava and Cherkassy, 12 in Donbass, 4 in Rivne, 3 in Kiev Oblast, 2 in Odesa, Ternopil, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Vinnytsa). The Central Electoral Commission announced that the CPU was running the most candidates--6.7 percent of all, followed by Rukh (4.1 percent), SPU (3.11 percent), URP (2.42 percent), Liberal Party (1.43 percent), and DemPU (1.28 percent), but that there were also many "hidden" party candidates (Holos Ukrainy, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 4 March; Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 March). Joint Candidacies Another of the reasons for the limited number of party-nominated candidates may be agreement among parties to back each others' candidates to avoid fratricidal contests between like-minded parties. In the initial months after announcement of the election, success at uniting parties behind candidates was very limited. More recently, Levko Lukyanenko, head of the "Ukraine" Democratic Union (the latest name for the coordinating organ set up by democratic parties in December), has claimed that democratic parties have made great progress in agreeing on candidates. He said at a February press conference that democratic parties had "agreed on a single candidate" in over 320 of the 450 districts (Kiyvska Pravda, 22 February). In another version of his remarks--given in the 22 February Silski Visti and 23 February Khreshchatyk--he reportedly said there were "agreed" candidates in 342 districts. He named candidates in 6 Kiev Oblast districts that the "Ukraine" union would back with both organizational and financial support (Kiyvska Pravda, 22 February). Rukh Chairman and longtime Lukyanenko foe Vyacheslav Chornovil took a more pessimistic view than Lukyanenko of democratic parties' success in uniting behind agreed candidates. In a 15 February Sribna Zemlya interview, Chornovil said that the "Ukraine" union was mainly just Rukh, the URP, and DemPU. The PDVU, New Ukraine, social democrats, liberal democrats, christian democrats, and the "left center" had not joined, he said. He also complained that in Lviv the URP had fielded too many candidates. Moreover, even Lukyanenko admitted that democrats had been unable to agree on candidates in 38 districts--mainly in Lviv, Ivano- Frankivsk, and Ternopil (Silski Visti, 22 February). In these areas, where democrats are virtually sure to win, they apparently felt less need to unite and more opportunity to win on their own. When the Lviv democratic coordinating council finally announced its list of candidates, it was able to endorse an agreed candidate in only 2 of the 23 districts; in the rest it endorsed more than one candidate or noted that some member-parties were backing candidates other than the council's (Vysokyy Zamok, 5 March). Lukyanenko also acknowledged that democrats had been unable to field any candidates in 18 districts, mainly in the east--5 in Odesa, 4 in Donetsk, 4 in Luhansk, 2 in Zaporizhzhya, 2 in Krym, and 1 in Poltava (Khreshchatyk, 23 February). Prospects Vary in Regions Lists of candidates and reports on party activity in local Kiev, Lviv, and Donetsk papers provide a sample of the varied and complex picture in Ukraine's regions. Kiev Party strength among candidates for Kiev city's 23 seats is hard to measure because in listing candidates local papers often failed to indicate if candidates were associated with a party. Among the few candidates identified with parties in the papers, 8 were from the CPU, 6 from the SPU, 5 from Rukh, 5 from the PDVU, 3 from the UNA, 3 from the tJKRP (Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party), and only 1 from the URP and the Liberal Party, and none from DemPU or New Ukraine. Fifty-eight were specifically identified as nonpartisan. Most of the rest of the almost 500 candidates listed in the paper Khreshchatyk were not identified with any party or even identified as nonpartisan. Although few Kiev candidates bear the Rukh label, Rukh should win some seats because it has some big names--Chairman of the Supreme Soviet's democratic faction, Narodna Rada, Ivan Zayets, outspoken Rukh leader Serhiy Holovatyy, and Minister of Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko. Democrats in general should do well since some of their prominent candidates look like easy winners- -former Defense Minister Kostyantyn Morozov, city soviet chairman Vasyl Nesterenko, popular maverick Kiev leader Ivan Saliy (who was fired by Kravchuk as presidential representative for the city), outspoken Vecherniy Kiev editor Vitaliy Karpenko, and economic reformer and former Deputy Premier and Minister of Economy Volodymyr Lanovyy. Morozov, Karpenko, Zayets, Holovatyy, and Kostenko were endorsed by several nationalist democratic organizations (Vecherniy Kiev, 6 January). Democratic parties could not reach agreement on single candidates in many districts, however. When the "Ukraine" Democratic Union issued its list of approved candidates, it endorsed candidates for only 14 of the city's 23 districts (Vecherniy Kiev, 10 March). In general, though, Kiev city appears likely to produce fewer prominent deputies than in the past. Many big names on the incumbent Kiev Supreme Soviet delegation are running for reelection in other regions where they apparently rate their chances for election better. VNRU (National Rukh of Ukraine--the anti-Chornovil Rukh) leader Larysa Skoryk and Rukh leader Les Tanyuk are running in Lviv, democrat Pavlo Movchan in Ivano- Frankivsk, former Premier Vi told Fokin in Cherkassy, and URP leader Oles Shevchenko in Kiev 'Oblast. Lukyanenko complained that too many Kiev democrats were running in the west, where it is easier to win (Kiyvska Pravda, Khreshchatyk, 22 February)- -although Kiev city has also been relatively receptive to democrats in the past, since 17 of the 22 deputies elected from Kiev city in 1990 joined the democrats' Narodna Rada shortly after the election. Lviv Lviv will remain the main stronghold for democrats and nationalists. Its present delegation has many prominent democrats and nationalists--Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn, UKRP chairman Stepan Khmara, former Deputy Premier for economic reform Viktor Pynzenyk, former First Deputy Premier Ihor Yukhnovskyy, Rukh Chairman Chornovil, city Mayor Mykola Horyn, nationalist Iryna Kalinets, and PDVU leader Taras Stetskiv. Now, with others from outside--Skoryk, Tanyuk, prominent Rukh economist Volodymyr Chernyak, and Rukh Deputy Chairman Oleksandr Lavrynovych added, the field has become crowded. Despite Lukyanenko's complaint that Kievites are running in Lviv because it is easier to win there, Tanyuk reportedly dropped out of a Kiev race to clear the way for an URP candidate (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January), probably as part of efforts to coordinate candidacies. Rukh Chairman Chornovil actually went against the trend, deciding to run in Ternopil, not Lviv, this time. He explained that he was not running in Lviv district 266 in order to help clear the way for election of Rukh candidate Mykhaylo Boychyshyn (who was kidnapped a few weeks ago and is still missing) or in district 267 to make way for Tanyuk (Kievskiye Novosti, 18 February). Rukh, URP, and New Wave have coordinated some candidates, and democratic candidates are prominent enough to probably win on the first ballot in several Lviv districts. Probable first round winners include Yukhnovskyy (New Wave), Pynzenyk (New Wave), Tanyuk (Rukh), Chernyak (Rukh), Lavrynovych (Rukh), Ihor Hryniv (backed by New Wave, Rukh, and the PDVU--Vysokyy Zamok, 11, 20 January, 3 February; Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 12 January), Lviv tJRP Chairman Oleh Pavlyshyn, Lviv Rukh Chairman Yuriy Klyuchkovskyy, and Supreme Soviet member Mykhaylo Kosiv (backed by Rukh, New Wave, URP, and other organizations--Vysokyy Zamok, 5 February; Rada, 10 February). In contrast, the many extreme nationalist candidates (KUN, OUN, UNA, UKRP, and SNPU) will probably splinter the ultranationalist vote. These parties appeared to make little attempt to coordinate, with the SNPU (Social National Party of Ukraine) nominating 21 candidates for Lviv's 23 districts (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 5 March), KUN 14 (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January) and the UKRP 9 (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 5 January). District races in Lviv include some notable contests between prominent figures, sometimes pitting democrats against ultranationalists: URP Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn is facing controversial ultranationalist UKRP Chairman Stepan Khmara in district no. 261; PDVU leader Taras Stetskiv opposes KUN leader Iryna Kalynets in district no. 273; and oblast soviet Chairman Mykola Horyn (Rukh) is running against UNA leader and commander of UNA's paramilitary arm UNS0 (Ukrainian National Self-Defense) Oleh Vitovych in district no. 275. Donetsk Judging by identifications in the Donetsk press, leftist parties (CPU, SPU, and the Party of Labor) and the more centrist Liberal Party and Party of Justice have been the most active in nominating candidates, while Rukh has some candidates, but few PDVU, URP, DemPU, or ultranationalists are running. The 138 candidates for the 10 districts (listed in Vecherniy Donetsk on 19 February) include 11 Liberal Party affiliated candidates, 9 CPU, 8 SPU, 5 Party of Labor, and 5 Party of Justice, but only 3 Rukh, 2 KUN, 1 URP, 1 DemPU, and 1 PDVU. Holos Ukrainy on 8 February said the largest number of the party candidates in Donetsk are Communists and Liberals, followed by the Party of Labor, but most candidates were nominated by groups of electors. CPU leaders Petro Symonenko and Yevhen Marmazov are running here (Pravda Ukrainy, 18 January). Democrats, at least nationalist democrats, are clearly weak in Donetsk. Lukyanenko said that there are few democrats running in general and none at all in 4 Donetsk districts (Khreshchatyk, 23 February). Post-Postup reported a 15 January Rukh conference had managed to nominate 12 candidates for Donetsk's 47 districts. The lists of candidates, at least in the first 10 districts, not only showed few Rukh, URP, and DemPU candidates, but also few or no candidates from the non-nationalist democratic parties or blocs that should be strong in the east--New Ukraine, PDVU, the Labor Congress of Ukraine, and the Interregional Bloc for Reform set up by former Premier Leonid Kuchma and former Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Volodymyr Hrynyov, which appears active in Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk. A new local Donetsk bloc has also sprung up recently and nominated many candidates. The "People's Congress of Donetsk," which backs Ukrainian independence but opposes what it calls the present "speculative anarchy" and wants more state control and social protection for the public, registered candidates in most Donetsk districts, according to a 3 February Demokratychna Ukraina article. Dangers in Electoral Process The large number of candidates and limited ability of parties to organize support for candidates and provide some sort of order to the competition indicates there may be few winners on the first ballot, necessitating runoffs in many districts. To win, a candidate has to get over 50 percent of the votes cast and votes of at least 25 percent of registered voters (according to the election law in the Vidomosti, 30 November 1993). For the election itself to be valid, 50 percent of the registered voters have to vote, according to the Ukrainian law. These requirements apply to all rounds of balloting. If no candidate qualifies as a winner on the first round, the two highest vote-getters run in a runoff, which must be held within two weeks after the first round. In the 12 December Russian parliamentary election, only a plurality was needed, so almost all seats were filled on the first ballot. In addition to the difficulty of getting enough voters out to vote and of candidates garnering a majority of the votes cast, the voting procedures may produce many invalid votes, which also could prevent anyone winning. As in past elections, voters have to cross off all candidates except the one they wish to vote for. With 25 or 30 candidates in many districts, the voter has to cross off a large number of names, and if he inadvertently leaves more than one name not crossed off, the ballot will be invalid. If a voter crosses off all names, his vote is valid, however. In the 12 December Russian election, Russia changed over to positive voting, whereby voters put a mark only by the names of those they wished to vote for. The prospect of many runoffs has led to concern that voters will lose interest and too few will vote in the second round to meet the requirements for a valid election or that even in the runoff no one will win a majority (if a substantial number of voters cross out both candidates). In this case, the election rules provide for new elections within a month of the original election in which all candidates in the original election would be barred (Vidomosti, 30 November 1993). With the need to quickly come up with new candidates who had not participated earlier, it seems likely that the quality of the candidates would decline and voter interest may drop further, producing more invalid elections and leaving many seats unfilled--perhaps even enough to prevent the formation of a new Supreme Soviet. Outlook Although most news reporting on the Ukrainian elections has focused on the activity of parties and their candidates, most candidates are unaffiliated, and presumably they will win most seats, especially in rural areas where parties are weakest. Many of these unaffiliated may be conservative-leaning representatives of interest groups, lobbies, or behind-the-scenes power structures. While democrats are strong in west Ukraine, they appear to have little organization or support in much of the rest of the country, further adding to the prospect for returning a conservative legislature. There is also a danger that low voter turnout could void the balloting in enough districts to prevent formation of a new Supreme Soviet, raising the prospect of a paralysis of government. Box 1 Regional Variations in Party Activity In Lviv, parties were very active, judging by reports in local papers of meetings by Rukh, KUN (Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists), New Wave, UKRP (Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party), and the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party that nominated candidates for Lviv's 23 districts (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4, 12 January; Vysokyy Zamok, 4, 6, 18 January). Although lists of candidates in Lviv papers often did not report the organization nominating, a relatively large proportion of candidates were identified as affiliated with a party--in most districts about half the candidates. Many of these candidates, however, were nominated by groups rather than parties. In Donetsk, which encompasses 47 districts as the most populous oblast of Ukraine, a high proportion of candidates were identified with parties and parties nominated numerous candidates. The 19 February Vecherniy Donetsk report on the first 10 Donetsk districts* identified 51 of the 138 candidates with parties and listed 7 candidates nominated by the CPU (Communist Party of Ukraine), 6 by the SPU (Socialist Party of Ukraine), 6 by the Liberal Party, 4 by the Party of Labor, 3 by Rukh, 3 by the Party of Justice, 3 by the Peoples Congress of Donetsk, and 1 by the URP (Ukrainian Republican Party). In Zaporizhzhya (18 districts) 20 percent of the candidates were nominated by parties (18 by Rukh, 18 by the SPU, 12 by the CPU, 7 by the Liberal Party, and 4 by the Labor Party), according to the 8 February Holos Ukrainy. On the other hand, in Kiev Oblast (17 districts) only 12 of the 264 candidates were nominated by parties (Kiyvska Pravda, 22 February)--about 5 percent. Kiyvska Pravda on 20 January identified the 1JRP as the most active party in nominating candidates. In Dnipropetrovsk (34 seats) only 17 candidates were nominated by parties, versus 129 by groups of voters and 58 by collectives (Pravda Ukrainy, 27 January)--about 9 percent. In Krym (23 seats), parties--the URP, CPU, PDVU (Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine), and the Party for Economic Revival of Krym- -nominated only 26 of the 140 candidates (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 23 February). *The subsequent Donetsk papers listing the candidates in the other 37 districts have not yet come in. End Box 1 Box 2 Roster of Parties Mentioned Leftist: CPU (Communist Party of Ukraine), led by Petro Symonenko. Party of Labor, led by Mykola Azarov, anti-nationalist, pro- socialist. SPU (Socialist Party of Ukraine), led by 0leksandr Moroz, pro- communist. Non-nationalist democratic centrist: LPU (Liberal Party of Ukraine), led by Ihor Markulov, pro- business, pro-privatization, based predominately in east Ukraine.

People's Congress of Donetsk. (The stance of this new bloc is not clear, but it appears fairly centrist, reportedly favoring Ukrainian independence and also more state control and social protection of the public, according to a 3 February Demokratychna Ukraina article). TKU (Labor Congress of Ukraine), led by Anatoliy Matviyenko. Ukrainian Party of Justice, led by Mykhaylo Hrechka. (Classified as "liberal centrist," along with the Liberal Party and Labor Congress, by an 8 February Moloda Ukraina article). Nationalist democratic centrist: DemPU (Democratic Party of Ukraine), led by Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, pro-Kravchuk, anti-Chornovil. New Wave, created in Lviv by some PDVU, Rukh, URP and other democrats as an election bloc. (See The Trends of 2 February 1994, page 30.) Rukh, led by Vyacheslav Chornovil, anti-Kravchuk, pro-reform. USDP (Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party), led by Serhiy Plachynda, close to Rukh. URP (Ukrainian Republican Party), led by Mykhaylo Horyn, pro- Kravchuk, anti-Chornovil. VNRU (National Rukh of Ukraine), led by Larysa Skoryk, pro- Kravchuk, anti-Chornovil. Ultranationalist: KUN (Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists), led by Yaroslav Stetsko. OUN (Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists), led by Mykola Slyvka. SNPU (Social National Party of Ukraine), formerly called National Socialist Party of Ukraine, semi-fascist. UKRP (Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party), led by Stepan Khmara, anti-Kravchuk. UNA (Ukrainian National Assembly), led by Yuriy Shukhevych, militantly nationalist. End Box 2 Box 3 Nomination of Prominent Leaders Supreme Soviet: Chairman Ivan Plyushch, at present representing Kiev Oblast, is now registered as a candidate in Chernihiv (Kiyvska Pravda, 22 February), while Deputy Chairman Vasyl Durdinets is running in Kirovohrad (Holos Ukrainy, 22 January), where he was elected before--apparently safe districts. Most of the Supreme Soviet's incumbent deputies are not running, however. The Central Electoral Commission announced that only 145 current deputies are running, while 42 others had been candidates for candidate but had dropped out (Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 March). Presidential hopefuls: Former Premier Kuchma switched from his native Dnipropetrovsk to run in Chernihiv (Rada, 3 March; Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 March), former Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Hrynyov is again running in his home oblast of Kharkiv, and Rukh Chairman Chornovil switched from Lviv to Ternopil. Leaders of parties: SPU leader Oleksandr Moroz is apparently running again in Kiev 0blast, UKRP leader Khmara again in Lviv, TKU (Labor Congress of Ukraine) leader Anatoliy Matviyenko again in Vinnytsa, CPU leader Petro Symonenko in Donetsk, URP leader Mykhaylo Horyn again in Lviv, and DemPU leader Volodymyr Yavorivskyy again in Kirovohrad. Liberal Party Chairman Ihor Markulov announced he would not run for parliament (Pravda Ukrainy, 1 February). Members of the government: Many officials are registered as candidates even though they apparently cannot retain their jobs if elected, since the new Supreme Soviet is supposed to be a fulltime job--to avoid the present frequent absences by deputies with other jobs. The election law stipulates that candidates must file a statement promising to give up other jobs if elected. Despite this, acting Premier Yukhym Zvyahilskyy and Deputy Premier Valentyn Landyk were nominated in their native Donetsk, and in all, 4 deputy premiers and 37 ministers and deputy ministers are registered as candidates (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 4 March; Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 March). President Kravchuk was nominated in several districts but, pointing out that the law does not allow the president to run for the Supreme Soviet, declined the nominations (Ukraina Moloda, 15 February).
