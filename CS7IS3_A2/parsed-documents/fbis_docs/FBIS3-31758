Zvizdic: "Changes at the Head of the Embassy of Bosnia-Herzegovina?"] [Text] We have learned from a reliable source that Bisera Turkovic, the first ambassador of Bosnia-Herzegovina to Croatia, will probably not hold that office any longer. It is claimed at the Embassy of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Zagreb that Ambassador Turkovic "has left for a holiday abroad, which will last for several weeks," but it is not stated why she left. It seems that her successor is already known. It could be Mr. Neven Kulenovic, who is already the charge d'affairs at the Embassy of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Zagreb. According to the information that we have, it seems that Ambassador Turkovic has left for Australia after returning from Sarajevo several days ago. We have also learned that Mrs. Turkovic came to Zagreb directly from Australia on 25 March 1993 in order to present her credentials to the Croatian president. It can hardly be believed that this is not a feigned journey because there is no justification for the absence of the ambassador at a moment when important things are going on in Bosnia-Herzegovina and when negotiations between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia are starting. It is difficult to predict whether the dismissal of Ambassador Turkovic will influence Bosnia-Herzegovina policy toward Croatia. We have learned, however, that the Sarajevo leadership has on several occasions blamed the ambassador for her alleged inactivity in diplomatic communications and her lack of initiative. Bisera Turkovic was born in Sisak [Croatia], where she lived until the age of 18. Then she moved to Zagreb where she graduated from Law School. After that she practiced as a lawyer in Sarajevo. In the trial against the Sarajevo intellectuals in 1984 she was mentioned as one of the participants, and she left Yugoslavia that same year. She lived in Australia and completed her post-graduate studies of criminology there. She returned to Bosnia-Herzegovina in March 1992, two months before the war started, and stayed in Sarajevo until the autumn of 1992. She was an activist in the Party of Democratic Action. She has three children.
