Cai Shunming, a native of Taoyuan County in Taiwan, stopped production at the Fuzhou Daguang Paper Products Company Limited on March 31, saying he was giving workers a six-day leave for Ching Ming Festival, when Chinese commemorate the dead. Most workers left for home. But the remaining 60 female workers knew the next day their boss had fled town when they discovered the kitchen air blower had been stolen and everything in Cai's office removed, according to China Business Times. The company, which was founded last March in the city's Xindian Town, manufactured tin foil. It purchased raw materials in China and sold products overseas. The tin foil products were made by hand by some 300 women hired from places as far away as Shandong Jiangxi, Sichuan and Fujian provinces. When the Taiwan businessman skipped town, he was three months behind in payments to his workers and was in arrears for about 110,000 yuan ($12,650) in rent to the local industrial zone, the newspaper stated. Before skipping town, Cai subjected his workers to inhuman conditions according to newspaper reports. He locked the factory gate daily and forced workers to do more than 10 hours manual labour daily, some workers said. Four or five women had to share two single beds nightly by putting them together. They were forced to take cold-water baths. They only had porridge and vegetables for three meals daily. Cai refused to admit visitors, including local leaders, on the pretext of being a solely Taiwan-funded enterprise, the China Business Times quoted a local leader as saying. The Fuzhou city government is now handling the case and trying to make proper arrangements for the workers.
