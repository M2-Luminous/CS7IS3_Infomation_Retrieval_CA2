FR940419-2-00163 FR940419-2-00087 Contained in the Policy are provisions for developing appropriate, site-specific NPDES permit requirements for all combined sewer systems (CSS) that overflow as a result of wet weather events. For example, the Policy lays out two alternative approaches_the ``demonstration'' and the ``presumption'' approaches_that provide communities with targets for CSO controls that achieve compliance with the Act, particularly protection of water quality and designated uses. The Policy also includes enforcement initiatives to require the immediate elimination of overflows that occur during dry weather and to ensure that the remaining CWA requirements are complied with as soon as practicable. The permitting provisions of the Policy were developed as a result of extensive input received from key stakeholders during a negotiated policy dialogue. The CSO stakeholders included representatives from States, environmental groups, municipal organizations and others. The negotiated dialogue was conducted during the Summer of 1992 by the Office of Water and the Office of Water's Management Advisory Group. The enforcement initiatives, including one which is underway to address CSOs during dry weather, were developed by EPA's Office of Water and Office of Enforcement. EPA issued a Notice of Availability on the draft CSO Control Policy on January 19, 1993, (58 FR 4994) and requested comments on the draft Policy by March 22, 1993. Approximately forty-one sets of written comments were submitted by a variety of interest groups including cities and municipal groups, environmental groups, States, professional organizations and others. All comments were considered as EPA prepared the Final Policy. The public comments were largely supportive of the draft Policy. EPA received broad endorsement of and support for the key principles and provisions from most commenters. Thus, this final Policy does not include significant changes to the major provisions of the draft Policy, but rather, it includes clarification and better explanation of the elements of the Policy to address several of the questions that were raised in the comments. Persons wishing to obtain copies of the public comments or EPA's summary analysis of the comments may write or call the EPA contact person. The CSO Policy represents a comprehensive national strategy to ensure that municipalities, permitting authorities, water quality standards authorities and the public engage in a comprehensive and coordinated planning effort to achieve cost effective CSO controls that ultimately meet appropriate health and environmental objectives. The Policy recognizes the site-specific nature of CSOs and their impacts and provides the necessary flexibility to tailor controls to local situations. Major elements of the Policy ensure that CSO controls are cost effective and meet the objectives and requirements of the CWA. The major provisions of the Policy are as follows. CSO permittees should immediately undertake a process to accurately characterize their CSS and CSO discharges, demonstrate implementation of minimum technology-based controls identified in the Policy, and develop long-term CSO control plans which evaluate alternatives for attaining compliance with the CWA, including compliance with water quality standards and protection of designated uses. Once the long-term CSO control plans are completed, permittees will be responsible to implement the plans' recommendations as soon as practicable. State water quality standards authorities will be involved in the long-term CSO control planning effort as well. The water quality standards authorities will help ensure that development of the CSO permittees' long-term CSO control plans are coordinated with the review and possible revision of water quality standards on CSO-impacted waters. NPDES authorities will issue/reissue or modify permits, as appropriate, to require compliance with the technology-based and water quality-based requirements of the CWA. After completion of the long-term CSO control plan, NPDES permits will be reissued or modified to incorporate the additional requirements specified in the Policy, such as performance standards for the selected controls based on average design conditions, a post-construction water quality assessment program, monitoring for compliance with water quality standards, and a reopener clause authorizing the NPDES authority to reopen and modify the permit if it is determined that the CSO controls fail to meet water quality standards or protect designated uses. NPDES authorities should commence enforcement actions against permittees that have CWA violations due to CSO discharges during dry weather. In addition, NPDES authorities should ensure the implementation of the minimum technology-based controls and incorporate a schedule into an appropriate enforceable mechanism, with appropriate milestone dates, to implement the required long-term CSO control plan. Schedules for implementation of the long-term CSO control plan may be phased based on the relative importance of adverse impacts upon water quality standards and designated uses, and on a permittee's financial capability. EPA is developing extensive guidance to support the Policy and will announce the availability of the guidances and other outreach efforts through various means, as they become available. For example, EPA is preparing guidance on the nine minimum controls, characterization and monitoring of CSOs, development of long-term CSO control plans, and financial capability. Permittees will be expected to comply with any existing CSO-related requirements in NPDES permits, consent decrees or court orders unless revised to be consistent with this Policy. The policy is organized as follows: I. Introduction A. Purpose and Principles B. Application of Policy C. Effect on Current CSO Control Efforts D. Small System Considerations E. Implementation Responsibilities F. Policy Development
