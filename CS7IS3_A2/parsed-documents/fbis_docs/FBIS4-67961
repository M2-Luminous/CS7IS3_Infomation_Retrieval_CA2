The decision was made at a Unification and National Security Policy Coordination meeting presided over by new Deputy Premier and National Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku. ``Our government position is that if North Korea presses ahead with changing the fuel rods by themselves, it would be unavoidable to take additional steps against the North,'' Yi said. Emerging from the meeting, the deputy premier said North Korea has thus far maintained that it cannot allow the collection of samples from the reactor's spent fuel rods. The meeting also decided to step up the existing system of cooperation with the United States, the United Nations and the IAEA with respect to the nuclear question. As to when any additional action might come, Yi said not much time is left. ``The recent UN Security Council presidential statement has set mid-May as the deadline for North Korea's acceptance of additional IAEA inspections,'' he said. Noting that the North Koreans' attitude remained somewhat ambiguous, the deputy premier said their position would become clear either this weekend or early next week. Yi added, however, that if North Korea expressly promises to allow IAEA sampling of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor, it could be taken as a sign of progress. It is still unclear, he said, whether North Korea has begun to change the fuel rods on its own. North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, in a message to the IAEA, said Friday his country could allow additional inspections of its nuclear facilities, including taking samples from a glove box at the key radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon. But Kim said he could not promise permission to collect samples from the fuel rods at the 5-megawatt atomic reactor, a source said.
