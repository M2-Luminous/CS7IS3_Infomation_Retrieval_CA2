[sentence as published] Of the 11 cases, five have already died from the disease while the virus in the six other victims are in the full blown stage of AIDS. However, the report did not specify how the victims were infected. AIDS is usually transmitted through sexual intercourse, blood transfusion or via the mother's placenta where babies contract the virus in their mother's womb. DoH AIDS Unit Program Manager Dennis Maducdoc said more than half of those who were reported in the March AIDS registry are very young. "Most of their ages range from 15 to 29," he said. He also said that of the 11 cases, seven are assumed to have come from commercial sex workers in Angeles City where a U.S. organization conducted a study and found seven positive cases of AIDS out of the 1,767 blood samples it tested. The number of HIV-AIDS victims continues to increase as the total number of reported cases from 1984 to February this year reached 494. The number of full-blown AIDS cases has already reached 136.
