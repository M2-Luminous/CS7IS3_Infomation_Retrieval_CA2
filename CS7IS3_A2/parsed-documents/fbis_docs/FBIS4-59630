The sources say that Qaddumi's attack was particularly directed at 'Arafat's agreement to concede the right of representation for the national authority abroad. The sources said that a number of the Fatah Movement's Central Committee members are unwilling to leave for Jericho and assume their duties within the so-called national authority. The source said that Faruq Qaddumi, Hani al-Hasan, Khalid al-Hasan, Muhammad Jihad, and Muhammad Ghunaym have refused to go to Jericho, especially since there are differences on coordinating work between the Fatah commands at home and abroad.
