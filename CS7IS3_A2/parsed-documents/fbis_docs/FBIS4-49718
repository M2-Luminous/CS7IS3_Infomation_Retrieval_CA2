The amount of capital involved is over 100 percent up over last year, an historical record for the input of capital into the water supply system. Shenzhen and its adjacent city of Hong Kong suffer from a water shortage while China as a whole is a country short of water. Shenzhen has in recent years seen rapid economic development. A sharp rise in its population has resulted in an unbalance of supply and demand of water. According to the water supply programme for the municipality, the year-round general demand for water by the year 2000 will be 1.62 billion cubic metres. The water for the present annual demand is about one billion cubic metres while the supply of water is much less than the demand, making Shenzhen one of the seven cities suffering the most serious water shortage across the country. The municipality established a water bureau responsible for planning for the water supply. According to the plan, Shenzhen will carry out work on three networks for the water supply in a bid to develop a unified water supply system across the municipality. The entire project needs a total input of between RMB 4 billion and RMB 5 billion. Shenzhen has spent a sum of money on the building up of its water supply system in the past three years. The input of capital into water resources was put at RMB 100 million in 1992 and RMB 200 million in 1993. The water resources project this year will cost RMB 140 million while the water supply work and the water treatment plant will see a gross input of RMB 340 million. A number of water conservancy projects either newly set up or expanded have been carried out in the last three years. They include expansion ofthe Meilin Reservoir, a water diversion project and work on the Meilin water plant. Shenzhen has so far made the Shenzhen Reservoir as its main source of water supply supported by the Tiegang Reservoir and the Xiuli Reservoir. The Meilin Reservoir will play a role in balancing the water supply network across the municipality.
