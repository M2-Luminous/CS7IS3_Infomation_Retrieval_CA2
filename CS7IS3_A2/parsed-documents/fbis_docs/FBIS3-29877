Enticements for such opening could include active economic exchanges where Seoul offered various short- and long-term loans to North Korea and other forms of financial assistance, the Foreign Ministry's Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security (IFANS) said in a report on the North. "There is a chance that the United States and North Korea will solve the North Korean nuclear issue with a guarantee (to Pyongyang) on normalization of relations and respect for the existing system," said the IFANS report. "Seoul should acknowledge this possibility and seek North Korea's opening at another level," said the report. Improving relations with the United States is North Korea's top priority this year, and Pyongyang will also step up diplomatic exchanges with regional superpowers Japan, China and Russia, the report predicted. North Korea, simultaneously, is expected to expand what has so far been limited economic openness, it said. "The basic line of South Korea's North Korea policy should be strengthening the standing of reform-driven forces within North Korea so that they can attempt bold changes, as well as offering cooperation and assistance to effect North Korea's opening," IFANS said.
