FR940104-2-00030 FR940104-2-00021 Western Area Power Administration Floodplain Statement of Findings for the Fort Morgan North Tapline Project, Morgan County, CO AGENCY: Western Area Power Administration, DOE. ACTION: Floodplain statement of findings. SUMMARY: This is a floodplain statement of findings for the Fort Morgan North Tapline Project prepared in accordance with 10 CFR part 1022. Western Area Power Administration (Western) proposes to construct 3 miles of new 115-kilovolt (kV) tapline in Morgan County, Colorado. The tapline would connect Western's existing Beaver Creek-Weld 115-kV transmission line with Morgan County Rural Electric Association's (MCREA) new Fort Morgan North Substation. The Fort Morgan North Tapline would cross the floodplain of the South Platte River in Morgan County, Colorado. Western prepared a floodplain and wetlands assessment describing the effects, alternatives, and measures designed to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplain. This action is categorically excluded under the DOE's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Procedures (10 CFR part 1021). Western will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the statement of findings before implementing the proposed action. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Stephen A. Fausett, Area Manager, Western Area Power Administration, Loveland Area Office, P.O. Box 3900, Loveland, CO 80539&hyph;3003, (303) 490&hyph;7200 FAX (303) 490&hyph;7213. For further information on general DOE floodplain/wetlands environmental review requirements contact: Carol M. Borgstrom, Director, Office of NEPA Oversight, EH&hyph;25, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;4600 or (800) 472&hyph;2756. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a floodplain statement of findings for the Fort Morgan North 115-kV Tapline Project prepared in accordance with 10 CFR part 1022. A notice of floodplain and wetlands involvement was published in the Federal Register (FR) on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51623). Western is proposing to construct 3 miles of 115&hyph;kV tapline between Western's existing Beaver Creek-Weld 115-kV transmission line and MCREA's proposed new Fort Morgan North Substation. The tapline would be single circuit and would be constructed on single wood-pole structures. Approximately 13 wood-pole structures and two span structures (steel H-frame design) would be located within the floodplain of the South Platte River. Existing access is available along most of the proposed tapline right-of-way. New access trails may be required to access span structures located on either side of the river crossing. No construction would occur within the river. The tapline would span the active channel of the South Platte River. Approximately 600 square feet of riparian woodland would be removed on either side of the river for the construction of the two span structures. This would be a direct long-term impact. About 0.8 acre would be maintained as riparian shrubland as a result of project maintenance and would also be a direct long-term impact. Approximately 2 acres would be temporarily affected during construction for equipment and construction material staging and would be a minor short-term impact. No watercourses or drainage patterns would be altered by the project. Flood storage volume would not be affected. The action would conform with applicable State or local floodplain protection standards. This action is categorically excluded under the DOE's NEPA Implementing Procedures (10 CFR part 1021). Western will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the statement of findings prior to implementing the proposed action. Issued at Golden, Colorado, December 20, 1993.
