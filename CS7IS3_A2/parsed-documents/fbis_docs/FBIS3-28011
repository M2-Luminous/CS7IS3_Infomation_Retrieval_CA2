Mayor Choe pointed out: "Inchon meets various required conditions for being an outpost for internationalization. Inchon is a starting point of sea and air routes as it has an international trade port and Yongjongdo Airport, which is under construction. It also has the Kyonggi- Inchon Industrial Complex nearby." He said: "The positive [nungdongjok] internationalization is the only alternative to cut our way through the age of limitless competitions among countries, and this can firmly be established only when local cities are internationalized." To achieve this goal, Inchon is planning to accomplish the following by 2011: Development of its North Port into a port with an annual stevedoring capacity of 25 million tonnes; overall rearrangement of municipal functions for the convenience of domestic and foreign visitors, whose number is expected to be 100 million a year after Yongjongdo Airport is completed; and construction of a technopolice equipped with business, trade, financial, port control, information, and communication functions in a 5,350,000-pyong reclaimed land on Song Island. Inchon plans to invite a total investment of 602.4 billion won -- government investment of 207.5 billion won and civilian investment of 394.9 billion won -- to enlarge the port in two stages. For building the technopolice on Song Island, it also plans to invite a considerable amount of civilian investment out of the total expenses of 1.8 trillion won -- 600 billion won for reclamation and 1.2 trillion won for building the city. Mayor Choe said: "Not only businessmen in Inchon but also large enterprises, such as Daewoo, Hanjin, and Sunkyong express their intention to actively participate in the construction of the Inchon technopolice." Mayor Choe also presented the idea of "In Tide (in the tide of the limitless competition)" -- a symbol of the solidarity among Inchon, [China's] Tianjin, and Dalian and which is named after the first two characters in each of the three cities' names -- in an effort to link Inchon's technology with Tianjin's labor and Dalian's resources. Inchon established sisterhood relations with Tianjin in December 1993 and will establish sistership with Dalian in March. Mayor Choe will attend the opening ceremony of the standing Inchon goods exhibition center, the first official event since the presentation of the "In Tide" idea, to be held in Tianjin on 30 March along with about 100 businessmen in Inchon, who will participate in the exhibition with their products. Inchon has rapidly increased its trade with China since 1992 when ROK-PRC diplomatic ties were established. The number of Chinese visitors to the ROK through Inchon in 1990 was 9,411, and that in 1993 was around 116,100, increasing over 11 times. The amount of export and import cargo in 1990 was 409 TEU, and that in 1993 was 19,195 TEU, skyrocketing over 20 times. Like this, Inchon is becoming a key port in the Yellow Sea age.
