In the communique, Escobar claims to be the spokesman for the Escobar family and the arrested members of the Medellin Cartel in various Colombian prisons and asks Los Pepes [Persecuted by Pablo Escobar] for peace. The brother of the former chief of the Medellin Cartel asks his archenemies to seek a negotiated and public solution to the conflicts they maintain with his group. Roberto Escobar said his family has maintained a peaceful attitude despite the attacks they have sustained following the death of the Medellin Cartel capo. Roberto Escobar remains under medical surveillance at the military hospital after the Pepes attacked him at the Itagui Maximum Security Prison. It has been unofficially learned that there is little chance that the brother of late drug kingpin Pablo Escobar Gaviria will recover his vision following this attack.
