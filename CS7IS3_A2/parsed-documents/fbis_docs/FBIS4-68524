The federal budget deficit is increasing. State debts are not being repaid on time. Vital social programs have been frozen or are being only partially funded. Once again, the rate of growth of inflation is increasing. Under these conditions, as never before, our state needs a program of comprehensive economy of funds(...) In 1994 the relative share of expenditures for state administration within the federal budget was increased by 1.5 times as compared with the budget for 1993 (not taking into consideration the construction of new and reconstruction of old administration buildings). The expenditures for capital repair of the government residence and its relocation have not been reflected in the budget. Expenditures are growing in the central apparatus and in the local areas. The number of central organs of administration is increasing. The edicts of the president and the government calling for a 20 percent cutback in the apparatus of the president and the government are not being fulfilled. The apparata of the president and the government duplicate each other's efforts and the functions of the ministries. At the same time, new subdivisions are being created, which also duplicate each other's efforts. The local administrative apparatus has totally gone out of control. In many cities, the number of local administrations has increased threefold. Re-equipment of administrative buildings is going on everywhere. Large purchases of imported computers, furniture, telephones and automobiles are being made. In the federal budget alone, the expenditures for buying equipment for various state and judicial institutions are to be increased by 12.25 times, for their capital repair--by 30.3 times, and for the construction of new buildings--by 19.5 times. Aside from this, huge amounts of money are being spent through extra-budgetary funds and through utilization of credit resources for other than their intended purpose. In 1993, thousands of foreign automobiles costing $20,000 - $40,000 each were purchased at the rayon administration level. There were many cases of buying "Mercedes Benz" automobiles at a cost of up to $130,000. Individual ministries and departments, as well as state organizations, use buildings whose area is many times larger than that specified in the standards. The excess space is leased out, and the funds received are used for maintaining the organization. There are frequent cases of leasing at openly undervalued prices. As a result, it takes the income tax from 500 workers to support only one bureaucrat. We propose: a) to declare a moratorium on the creation of new administrative structures; b) to set limits on the number of state bureaucrats and limits on their wages at all levels of administration; c) to limit the purchase of new service automobiles; d) to urgently and comprehensively verify the utilization of administrative buildings; e) to prohibit the purchase of imported automobiles, furniture and equipment if there are cheaper domestic analogs; f) to spend only budget funds for the maintenance of the administrative apparatus; g) to eliminate administrative structures which duplicate each other's efforts. The struggle against excess expenditures must become one of the key directions of activity of the State Duma, along with that of the president, the government and the Federation Council. * * * One of the members of the RF [Russian Federation] government, having read this note, joked: "One gets the feeling that Gaydar wrote it based on his own recollections." The hint is a transparent one: When the current leader of "Russia's Choice" was a member of the cabinet of ministers, he too drove around in a Mercedes, and not on the trolley. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA has no other evidence at its disposal to show that the deputy's "announcement" made any impression on anyone. The fate of this note is ordinary, i.e., unenviable. Two weeks later they could not even remember in the State Duma what kind of paper the "Russia's Choice" representatives submitted for their attention. Naturally, it does not figure in the parliamentary budget discussions, and it even took a great deal of effort to find it. By some miracle, the only copy in the entire Duma had been saved in the technical section of the Duma apparatus. To politely send the authors of the note back to their own past ("People who live in glass houses...")--that is a rather widespread means of reacting to unpleasant questions. The radical democrats who had been in power really had time to show that they too were not ascetics. However, the results of their personal practice do not eliminate and do not belittle the problem itself. One can hide the deputy's note, not let it get through, but how can one hide the fact that the state apparatus is becoming ever larger and more wasteful? Having endured the short-term test of democracy, the Russian bureaucracy has been able to preserve its main privilege--freedom from control of society. This has allowed the bureaucracy to quickly restore its moral forces, its capacity to multiply, and its taste for the comfortable life. Since notions of comfort are rapidly changing, the needs of the bureaucracy are growing so dynamically that soon there may not be enought taxpayers to satisfy them. If the authorities believe that this threat is not serious--so much the worse for the authorities.
