The minister added, however, that the Economy Ministry will "help" speed up the process. Tax controls will be reinforced, exporters will receive incentives, and measures will be adopted to get banks more interested in the business of long term loans. The minister described the scenario during a conversation with CLARIN at Harvard University, a few minutes after talking with a group of Argentine students on Argentina's current economic situation. The minister answered questions on corruption reports, the removal of Martin Redrado, and the small budget allocated to education. "The savings rate increased by nearly 2 percent last year. It currently stands at 16 percent of the gross domestic product. The trend will consolidate after we implement the private pensions system. Savings will be encouraged by a nearly zero inflation rate and a more effective application of tax policies," Cavallo added. The minister said he had his eyes on wealth tax contributors. "We eliminated many tax exemptions, and will now redouble our efforts to make sure regulations are strictly fulfilled, just as we are doing with the item profits." The minister said at every chance that his recipe only contains more of the same medicine. He cited as an example the recent decree establishing guidelines on public spending. The minister said the decree made official an "unwritten" norm that the ministry enforced through regulations on budget programming. But the government decided to add legal weight to the instrument because of the need to establish stricter controls, and in order to reduce the administration's spending rate. Cavallo said the government will soon present a bill establishing a new fiscal mechanism to encourage the export of capital goods. Entrepreneurs will be able to postpone the payment of the value added tax [VAT] on their operations until they receive their tax return on the VAT applied on sales. "Another source of internal savings will be in the form of long term mortgage loans, which we still do not have enough in the market," Cavallo said. "Why do you think banks will stop preferring loans on consumption which are short term and have higher spreads?" CLARIN asked. "The demand will no longer be oriented toward those loans, and banks will have to compete and offer longer term lines and lower interest rates. It will also be advantageous for banks, because long term loans have minimum administrative costs which are applied just once, when the loans are granted. Will the government implement specific measures to speed up the process? "We are thinking of measures that will contribute to creating better conditions for banks to see more quickly where the business is. The law regulating the creation of mortgage securities [securitizacion de hipotecas] for trading in the capitals market points in that direction, the minister said, while walking through areas he remembered from his years as a Harvard student. The minister denied that current policies carry the risk of recession. He defended his position with an example: "The Austral Plan provoked an increase in internal demands in 1985. But it also provoked a 20 percent drop in the volume of exports, which lasted two years. With the convertibility plan we were able to maintain our export rate stable during the first two years. Exports started to pick up in the third year, and they continue to grow today." Cavallo's speech is strictly in accordance with what he has been saying since the Guadalajara meeting. In the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] meeting in that city three days ago, the minister minimized the possible influence of the U.S. interest rate hike on his decision to promote an increase in internal savings. "This year we might receive a little less capital investment. But that is not a determining factor. Everything will depend on us. Just as in the past we used external savings to finance investments, we must now take advantage of the fact that a reactivation in the United States might provoke greater demand for our products," the minister reiterated in Boston, the oldest city in the United States.
