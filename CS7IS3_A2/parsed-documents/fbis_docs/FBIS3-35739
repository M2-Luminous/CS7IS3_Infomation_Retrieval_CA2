Those who voted for President Akayev voted for the new economic reform, for the future calm in the republic, and for our prosperity. Medetbay Sherimkulov, chairman of the Supreme Council, voted to express confidence in Askar Akayev. Following is an interview Mr. Sherimkulov gave to our correspondent: [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Sherimkulov, this January is a very memorable time for our state. What would you like to say about the referendum? [Sherimkulov] This is the first referendum since Kyrgyzstan became an independent state. It is important because if the nation expresses confidece in Askar Akayev his term of office will last until 1996. It is not only showing confidence in Akayev, but also giving the leadership an opportunity for another two years to continue to implement the reform. If the reform is implemented, we can move forward. It means we will not reverse course or deviate from it. Frankly, we have spent many years aspiring to build socialism and communism, and in the final analysis what we have now is neither socialism nor capitalism. But our aim is to bring good to the country. This is a very important period for reforms. Frankly, we have many problems in the economy. We have to bring our laws in line with the process of reform. I want to repeat: Those who vote for Akayev will give him additional time to implement these reforms. Well, I know it is forbidden to campaign on referendum day [laughs] but this is just my personal opinion. Frankly, our new life and all aspirations are connected with the name of Askar Akayev. Thank you. [end recording]
