Some analysts nonetheless consider that the situation could change, with the cutting of subsidies to companies. What do you think of this? [Klaus] The foreign media always state that we have a low unemployment rate because companies continue to receive subsidies. A bankruptcy law, as the West understands it, has existed in our country for more than a year, and the government does not interfere in bankruptcy processes. The low unemployment rate is due to the effort made by companies to reorganize themselves and seek new markets and products. [O GLOBO] Why didn't the GDP of your country increase last year? [Klaus] The Czech Republic is completing its radical transformation to create a market economy. One of the inevitable phenomena is the elimination of several activities linked with central planning, which in a market economy cannot survive. [O GLOBO] What will be the benefits to joining the European Union? [Klaus] Given that our most important partners are or will be members of the EU, and given our links with a more integrated Europe, our association is essential.
