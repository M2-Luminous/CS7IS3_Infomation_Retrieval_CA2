While the [Azerbaijani] Defense Ministry announced that Armenians have been using various weapons to shell Azerbaijani positions for the past three days, high-ranking officials at the Presidential Office are indicating that there is only a verbal agreement on a cease-fire. It is being suggested that the protocol signed by the Azerbaijani and Armenian defense ministers in Moscow with the mediation of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is not being implemented, because it was not approved by President Geydar Aliyev. An official at the Presidential Office who did not want to be named noted that there is no formal cease-fire agreement with Armenia and that the existing agreement is only a verbal one. The same official added that there can be no cease-fire unless the Armenians withdraw from part of the occupied land. [passage omitted]
