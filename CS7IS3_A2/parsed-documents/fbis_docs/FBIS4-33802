This measure and Jonaissant's solemn rejection of yielding to foreign pressure comes 36 hours after President Bill Clinton's announcement that new sanctions will be applied against the Caribbean country to force the departure of the Haitian military chiefs. The provisional government on Sunday had yet to publish the "series of measures" announced by Jonaissant in his radio-television speech early this morning, but there is great calm in Port-au- Prince, where no special security measures are visible. According to the source, the establishment of the state of emergency does not have any connection with the murder of a soldier near the National Palace 15 days ago. A military official, who asked to remain unidentified, blamed the death on a guerrilla operation launched from Washington by exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his supporters. Referring to rumors according to which a group of armed men attacked the Army headquarters in this capital in the evening last week, the official indicated that it was "a minor incident" and that "the shots were apparently accidental." "The incident, which did not cause any casualties, was controlled in a few minutes by guards, and no bullet holes were found in the buildings," he added. Meanwhile, official sources denied rumors about the Haitian authorities' possible decision to close the Port-au-Prince international airport on 21 June, four days before the suspension of flights by the United States and Canada goes into effect.
