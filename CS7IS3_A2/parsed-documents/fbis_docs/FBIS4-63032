Yet Another Resignation of the PRES Leader"] [Text] Sergey Shakhray has tendered his resignation as deputy prime minister. The official reason is his dismissal as minister of nationalities and regional policy and the appointment of a successor "even without formal consideration for the opinion of the deputy prime minister in charge of these matters." Mr. Shakhray stated that his resignation "does not mean a move toward opposing the president or government, or any personal grudge." The statement expresses the hope that the dismissal is not connected with the deputy prime minister's order about a financial inspection of the former State Committee for Northern Territories [Goskomsever], pressure by any regional groups, or "intrigues from the president's inner circle." So far it is hard to judge how substantiated the first hope is (Goskomsever's involvement). Yet the next one has already been called into question by one regional group -- from Chechnya. The deputy prime minister believed negotiations with the republic would be possible only after new presidential and parliamentary elections there, while the president and parliament have no intention of quitting early, describing Mr. Shakhray as unobjective. The Chechen opposition, on the other hand, agrees with his self-assessment ("no one understands the question of nationality policy better than I") and believes that it was precisely at the moment when Russia has developed a clear-cut position on a settlement in Chechnya that the deputy prime minister has been removed by "power structures connected with Dzhokhar Dudayev and oil and arms." The hope about the absence of "intrigues" appears totally insincere. Tentatively, at least three can be pointed out. Mr. Shakhray was one of the initiators of the political amnesty while Mr. Rutskoy, released by him, came out with unveiled threats during the recent May Day festivities. The PRES was created mainly thanks to the structures of Mr. Shakhray's ministry and this, incidentally, also makes it doubtful that Mr. Shakhray's long-standing associate Aleksandr Kotenkov will keep the post of deputy minister and even that another PRES leader, Aleksadr Shokhin, will retain his vice premiership. Finally, Shakhray's removal means a certain weakening of the positions of Viktor Chernomyrdin who recently not only began a rapprochement with the State Duma but also wrested too much power from the presidential structures. Therefore to deprive the cabinet head of contact with the territories via Shakhray is the first step toward curbing the prime minister's powers. There are also stories about the role of Yeltsin's aide Ilyushin and presidential chief of staff Filatov, who endorsed the resignation, about a future deputy prime minister's job for Emergency Situations Minister Sergey Shoygu, and so forth. If the resignation is accepted, Mr. Shakhray will automatically cease to be a member of two councils: The Security Council and the Cadres Policy Council. But the main thing is that PRES, based mainly on a regional elite, is losing powerful support and its future is becoming murky.
