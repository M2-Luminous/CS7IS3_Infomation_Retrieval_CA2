(a)(1) To be listed by the Secretary as a nationally recognized accrediting agency, an accrediting agency must demonstrate to the Secretary that its accreditation or preaccreditation standards, or both, are sufficiently rigorous to ensure that the agency is a reliable authority as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs it accredits. (2) For a programmatic accrediting agency that does not serve as an institutional accrediting agency for any of the programs it accredits, the standards must address the areas contained in paragraph (b) of this section in terms of the type and level of the program rather than in terms of the institution. (3) If none of the institutions an agency accredits participates in any Title IV, HEA program, or if the agency only accredits programs within institutions accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary, the accrediting agency is not required to have the standards described in paragraphs (b)(7), (b)(8), (b)(10), (b)(12), and (b)(13) of this section.

(5) Student support services. (6) Recruiting and admissions practices, academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading, and advertising. The agency shall have standards that enable it to assess an institution's or program's recruiting and admissions practices, academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading, and advertising in terms of_ (i) Whether the institution's or program's academic calendar, catalogs, publications, and advertising are accurate, complete, and consistent with actual practice and agency standards, particularly with respect to costs, financial obligations, refunds, graduation rates, employment prospects, and other statements regarding educational effectiveness; and
