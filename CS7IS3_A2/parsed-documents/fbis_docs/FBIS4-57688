In his article, reporter and analyst Nicanor Leon Cotallo points out that Clinton's recent statements on Cuba are part of the strategy suggested by his advisers to obtain an electoral victory in the State of Florida. Leon goes on to say that Clinton's 20 May attacks on the Cuban Government demonstrate that obtaining a victory in that state during the 1996 elections has become an obsession for the president's team of advisers. In his article, Leon states that this goes hand in hand with the viewpoint of the most extreme right and the intolerant factions of the Cuban community in Florida. Leon goes on to say that even though Clinton is not part of the extreme right, as his successors Ronald Reagan and George Bush were, he must know very little about Cuba, the only explanation for his error, or lack of precision in talking about a long history of cooperation and mutual admiration between Cuba and the United States. Regarding Clinton's defense of the blockade against Cuba, the article in TRABAJADORES states that this contradicts the agreements of the UN General Assembly and the opinion of the principal U.S. newspapers.
