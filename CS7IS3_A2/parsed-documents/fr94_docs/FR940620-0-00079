FR940620-0-00079 FR940620-0-00027 47 CFR Part 90 [DA 94&hyph;544] Private Land Mobile Radio Services; Licensing of 800 MHz Channels in the U.S./Canada Border Area AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Deputy Chief, Private Radio Bureau released this Order to remove certain restrictions on land mobile radio operations along the U.S./Canada border that were designed to protect operation of certain Canadian UHF television stations. As a result of adopting this Order, licensing in certain previously restricted areas along the Canadian border in the relevant portions of the 806&hyph;890 MHz band may begin immediately. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 24, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Edward R. Jacobs, Private Radio Bureau, Land Mobile and Microwave Division, (202) 632&hyph;7597. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Order In the Matter of: Amendment of Subpart S of Part 90 of the Rules to Remove Certain Restrictions on the Licensing of Channels in the 806&hyph;821/851&hyph;866 MHz Band in the U.S./Canada Border Area. Adopted: May 24, 1994 Released: June 2, 1994 By the Deputy Chief, Private Radio Bureau. 1. On January 4, 1994, the United States and Canada exchanged Notes that modified the ``Arrangement Between the Department of Communications of Canada and the Federal Communications Commission of the United States Concerning the use of the Band 806&hyph;890 MHz along the Canada-United States Border.'' The effect of these modifications was to remove certain restrictions on land mobile radio operations along the U.S./Canada border that were designed to protect the operation of certain Canadian UHF television stations. This Order modifies Subpart S of Part 90, 47 CFR Part 90, to conform the rules to the modified agreement and to permit land mobile licensing on the relevant frequencies in the previously restricted areas along the Canadian border. These channels are immediately available for licensing. 2. These rule changes will facilitate the construction and operation of additional Private Land Mobile Radio stations in the Canadian border area. This should result in improved mobile communication service to the public without adversely affecting any party. As this Order does not impose new rules on licensees that would adversely affect their substantive rights, we find that notice and comment procedures are neither necessary nor appropriate. 1 To initiate a notice and comment procedure to make these additional channels available for licensing in the relevant Canadian border area would significantly delay the use of these channels without any countervailing public interest benefit. Further, because the rule changes relieve a restriction, we also conclude that these changes should become effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register . 2 1 See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). 2 See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1). 3. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i) and 303(r) and Section 0.331(a)(1) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 0.331(a)(1), that Part 90 of the Commission's Rules is amended as set forth below. 4. It is further ordered that, because these amendments eliminate a restriction on the use of spectrum in the Canadian border area, this Order is effective immediately upon adoption.
