Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] President L.K. Advani has said that India should develop nuclear weapons and should not come under pressure from the United States or world public opinion for the sake of the country's unity, security, and integrity. Addressing the three-day convention of the party's National Council, Advani said that the United States speaks about nuclear nonproliferation with the aim of having India subcontract its national security to it and getting unhindered access to Indian markets. About 3,000 delegates from throughout the country are attending the BJP National Council convention. Advani said that Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao has come under U.S. pressure. The national interests are being compromised to please the United States. Commenting on the government's statement in parliament on `Prithvi' and `Agni' missiles, he said our self-prestige has come down to the extent that we rush into apologizing at each hint of any U.S. displeasure. He asked: "Whether India should surrender its security interest to attract foreign investments?" He spoke about the threats posed to India by the increasing U.S. tilt toward Pakistan. He also cautioned the country against the compromising stand of the Narasimha Rao government, which is affecting national socioeconomic interests. He called for the Rao government to be toppled. He said that the Narasimha Rao government is ignoring the U.S. steps favoring Pakistan's nuclear efforts and according the Most Favored Nation status to China. It is a result of the government's wrong policies that Pakistan through the Inter-Services Intelligence's inspired terrorist violence and bomb explosions is waging a proxy war. He added that these Pakistan efforts are part of other wider designs, which can be much more dangerous, especially if the government's response remains weak. Advani said that foreign investment and world opinion have importance, but to base decisions alone on them is tantamount to abandoning the national interests. Nobody could imagine that this country of 900 million would go begging in front of others. He said India should act courageously and go nuclear. China and Pakistan are already nuclear powers. In view of this, India should not hesitate to acquire this capability. This will also change the outlook of other countries toward India and we will get our due place in the world. Referring to Rao's recent visit to the United States, Advani said he had abandoned national interests to please the United States. Even the `Prithvi' missile tests had been postponed and the prime minister had not felt even slightly embarrassed while announcing this decision. Advani said that the most important issue at this time is to acquire a respectable status for India in the comity of nations, but the Narasimha Rao government is so keen to weaken the country that any country is able to damn it. Advani said the present government has not only failed to deal with the international situation, it has also not resolved domestic issues. The Kashmir situation is progressively deteriorating. There is no let up in acts of terrorism and even Jammu has become their target. He said that, due to the lack of right policies and a unified command, the government has failed to deal with terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. In his speech, Advani mainly targeted the prime minister and his three-years of administration. He said he himself felt embarrassed, recalling that he had once compared Narasimha Rao to the late Lalbahadur Shastri. Advani described it as very unfortunate that, by raising a bogey of isolation, the government on the one hand is ruining the country's economy, and on the other its zeal for increasing foreign investment is even endangering national security. The indiscriminate entry of multinationals in the name of liberalization has threatened the very existence of the domestic industry. Violence, criminality, and corruption have touched extreme limits and scandal is synonymous with this government. Advani said the government is bringing forward the so-called electoral reforms bill to clip the wings of Chief Election Commissioner T.N. Seshan, who is trying to root out corruption, and to halt the growing strength of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The party will oppose it at every stage. He said attempts made to convert Rao's minority government into a majority one are not hidden from anyone. Rao first divided Janata Dal, Telugu Desam, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, and Shiv Sena and later admitted the dissident groups into the Congress-I by paying an `appropriate price'. Advani said Rao even unsuccessfully tried to divide the Congress-I ally Anna-Dravida Munnetra Kazagham. The BJP president said that, as well as encouraging defections, the present government also ranks first in corruption. This government, which created all sorts of obstacles for a probe into the Bofors gun deal, has also not taken action against those involved in the securities scam. He said he considers Narasimha Rao and the Congress-I responsible for the current round of ethnic war and anarchy in Uttar Pradesh following the assumption of power by the Bahujan Samaj Party-Samajwadi Party coalition in the state; because of the Congress-I support the state government has been formed there. Referring to the [Temple-Mosque] Ayodhya issue, the BJP president said the construction of a Ram temple at the birthplace of Lord Ram has become inevitable. This has been accepted even by those who earlier opposed it. No one now talks about reconstructing the Babri Mosque. Impressions have been created for the last few months that the temple will be constructed by a government trust and not by the Ramjanambhoomi trust, but the people will never allow this to happen.
