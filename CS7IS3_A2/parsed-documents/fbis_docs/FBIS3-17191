"Despite the fact that a fall in production was predicted during the transition to the market, today it does not have any clearly expressed signs of a structure whereby individual sectors develop rapidly, while others wind down because they are no longer needed," the doctor of economic sciences noted in an interview with your ITAR-TASS observer. Nevertheless, he believes, the government is in a position to work efficiently without introducing any kind of emergency measures in the economy. Responding to criticism from opponents, who see nothing new in the presidential message or the government program based on it, Aleksandr Livshits stressed: "I am convinced that it is not superprograms that are required of the government, but the implementation of commitments and its own decisions that have already been adopted." "Everyone who is now trying to propose a new program of action to the government is actually not wishing it well," the expert believes, "because what we need at the moment is not alternative ideas, but political will to perform the tasks facing us." As for the presidential message, then, from what Aleksandr Livshits said, the publication of this document has made it possible to offer society a considered strategy of action, whose absence has been sharply felt since the beginning of the transition to the market. According to the expert, this is the basic innovation of the course. Second, the "innovation of the message, as an initiative proceeding from the president, lies in the fact that it proposes to plan a policy to track the price of reforms. This means that the period of ramming methods of reform is over and the period of considered actions is beginning," the leader of the group of experts noted. Third, he went on, the economic section of the message has been met with "a moderately approbatory reaction by all political forces apart from those who want to privatize the entire economy within a month, or to reestablish the State Planning Committee and the State Committee for Material and Technical Supply in the same month." Thus, my interlocutor summed up, the president's message meets the expectations of the majority of society.
