Three weeks ago Carlos Lemos said the party was operating in a "maricona" [homosexual] manner. Two weeks ago, the glittery launch of Andres Pastrana's campaign was presented as the arrival of a new era in political marketing. A week ago, Carlos Lleras de la Fuente announced that he was so concerned about his party's fate that he had decided to submit his name as a presidential candidate. And two days later, Alvaro Gomez--the historic enemy of the Pastrana family--sealed the Conservative Party's unity with his endorsement of Andres. This string of misfortunes for Ernesto Samper led many people to think that, as things were going, the next tenant of the Casa de Narino [presidential residence] was going to have a moustache. Andres Pastrana, with his gorgeous wife and two precious children, conveys the image of the perfect candidate about to win the hearts of the Colombian people as the leader of this new country. In high-level social and business circles, the comment always seemed to be the same: "Even though I am a liberal, this time I am going to vote for Andres." In the Jockey Club of Bogota; in the Club Colombia of Cali, and in the Union in Medellin, all bets were on Pastrana. Ernesto Samper, who was traveling all over the country amidst considerable indifference, was perceived as a personality distorted by his managers; in addition, he was zigzagging ideologically between Fernando Botero's new right and the old left of Horacio Serpa Uribe. Many people were starting to announce his political demise. What may have brought about Ernesto Samper's resurrection was a poll by the CNC [National Survey Center] published in all the media at the end of last week. The poll was paid for by Bavaria, which for the past 16 months has been financing periodic opinion polls on the presidential campaign. In the world of politics and journalism this polling is considered the best barometer of this election contest. All the polls done by the Bavaria brewery had always given the victory to Andres Pastrana over Ernesto Samper. The margin of victory varied, but not the position of the candidates. But Bavaria is not the only organization doing polls. Other firms, like Opinion Publica [Public Opinion] and Napoleon Franco also conduct polls, and they all had something in common: Ernesto Samper never won. This was extremely difficult for Samper's campaign to explain. When he was ambassador to Madrid it could be argued that he was not in Colombia. After he returned, they could say he was not yet a candidate. But once he had actually begun his campaign swings from department to department, the advantage of Pastrana--who was not campaigning--was difficult to justify. And while that was when his rival was not saying a word, there was no guarantee that things would improve when Pastrana's campaign actually got started. For in addition to being very well financed, Pastrana's campaign has been designed and guided by the expert hand of Luis Alberto Moreno, who left the Ministry of Development to work on the Pastrana campaign. A Rigged Poll? Against this backdrop, last week's Bavaria-CNC poll caused a real surprise. In one month the situation had dramatically turned around and Samper, instead of losing, was shown winning both the first and second rounds. The results in the first round: Samper, 38 percent; and Pastrana, 33. In the second round: Samper, 50; and Pastrana, 43. The poll was done between 3 and 8 February, that is, the week immediately prior to the launch of Andres Pastrana. But although this factor was not taken into account, Samper's rebound was surprising. As the poll was financed by Bavaria, a member of the Santo Domingo Group, there were insinuations that it might have been rigged, as this conglomerate has been somewhat cool toward Pastrana. Still, that suggestion was not persuasive. If they had financed polls for 16 months in which Samper lost and had openly published them, why perpetrate a hoax now? Moreover, Augusto Lopez--Bavaria's CEO--is a reliable man, and falsifying information for electoral purposes would be an extremely grave matter for such a conglomerate. In addition, the new regulations on polls would make any such manipulation difficult, as it could be easily detected. And finally, Carlos Lemoine and the CNC are putting their prestige on the line in backing the veracity of their forecasts. Therefore, even though there may have been some debate about the methodology--particularly by the Pastranists--the poll's validity could not be seriously challenged. What conferred the most legitimacy to Samper's resurrection was not just the Bavaria poll. It was the fact that all the other polls done at that time and immediately after began to show the same results. Peter Hart's consulting firm, along with Napoleon Franco, both showed Samper the winner by an equal margin. And an EL TIEMPO poll published on Sunday also agreed. That unanimity demonstrated that, against all expectations, Ernesto Samper had managed to pull ahead of Andres Pastrana during the week preceding the official announcement of Pastrana's candidacy. Though it was very likely that the successful launch of the campaign of the New Democratic Force's candidate would give him a substantial boost, this does not necessarily mean the imminence of a Pastranist victory. What is clear is that Andres Pastrana would face a contender in the ring up to the final round. Ernesto Samper's strategists always expected Pastrana's best time to be the week following the start of his campaign; that is, right now. That was because of the publicity fanfare generated by a new campaign, the charisma of the candidate and his family, and Colombians' propensity to get enthusiastic about anything new. After that phase, though, Samper would have a lot going for him. First of all, his predictable victory in the Liberal Party primary would give him not only the image of a winner, but legitimacy as the sole candidate of liberalism. And this party, despite all its flaws, limitations, and frustrations, is still by far Colombia's majority party. This factor means that the Liberal Party's sole candidate always has great chances of being elected, even though he may not be the favorite of the multitudes. That is how Gaviria, Barco, and Turbay all reached the presidency without being considered--when nominated--to have great mass appeal. Since 1930 the Liberal Party has never lost an election when it was united. It lost when the party was split over Ospina Perez in 1946 and Betancur in 1982. Obviously, things have changed. Now party affiliation is not as strong as it used to be, and new factors like the second election round have created unknowns. But if Ernesto Samper, the sole liberal candidate, loses the election, it would be the first such case in this century. Liberal Party Primary For Which Candidate Do You Intend to Vote?

Financed by Bavaria, S.A. Sample size: 7,550 persons over 18 who expressed their intention to vote in some of the elections in 1994. Group studied: representative sample of the population in urban areas of Colombia. Collection method: personal interviews conducted at respondents' homes. Date of collection: 3 February to 8 February 1994. Maximum error margin for total sample: 1.1 percent. The CNC is registered with the National Election Board. Samper's Rebound The question, then, is: if things were going so badly for him just a month ago, why is he doing so well now? Especially running against Pastrana, a candidate with star quality, who so far has made no mistakes. There are two answers to this question. The first is purely and simply the party machinery. All the polls in which Samper lost were conducted when the congressional campaign in the departments had not yet caught fire. They barely got off the ground at the start of this year, and such is the force of the liberal machine that it is producing a snowballing effect for the candidate. The last Bavaria-CNC poll on the Senate's composition shows that, of a total of 100 senators, it should have about 64 liberals. All these liberal campaigns are putting in money and giving a strong boost that inevitably benefits Samper who, as people now know, will be the official candidate. Napoleon Franco attributes last month's surprising rebound to this factor. Pastrana may have more support in big cities and a considerable edge among the ruling class and young people. But in midsized and smaller towns, ordinary people continue to produce the votes. And in this area, the Liberal Party still outperforms its rivals. So when the polls are conducted in the four major cities, Pastrana wins; but when the polling universe is widened, then the Samperist forces appear. And now, with the elections drawing nearer, these forces are starting to make themselves felt. Party machinery is not the only explanation. There is also the fact that Samper has defined himself ideologically, and so the election is growing more polarized. Pastrana's candidacy has become a candidacy of the center right, and Samper's is becoming a center left candidacy. Both men deny these labels, trying to disguise them with other words. Pastrana rejects the neoliberal tag and calls himself a centrist; Samper defines himself as a supporter of democratic capitalism and places himself in what he calls the social center. But the truth is that Pastrana is the candidate the farthest to the right since Alvaro Gomez. With the difference, of course, that what was considered reactionary is now considered in. He has bravely announced that he supports the policies of President Gaviria who, economically, has also been on the right, though he does not like the "neoliberal" label either. Ernesto Samper at one time flirted a little with neoliberalism, trying to harmonize it with the Liberal Party's traditional positions. Then, finding that this strategy was leaving him high and dry, he decided to leave this space to Gaviria and Pastrana and return to the position that liberalism had historically occupied. He went to extremes, like allowing himself to be praised by people like Hernando Agudelo Villa, considered obsolete by contemporary economic thought, people who have upheld the same old economic line for 25 years. All these decisions entail risks for Samper, especially now that the right is in fashion and the left has become taboo. But not differentiating himself from Pastrana and simply tagging along and continuing Gaviria's new capitalism held even greater risks. As Samper himself has said dozens of times in private, he wants to be more like Clinton than Bush. The strategy was to touch this traditional liberal fiber which historically has been able to mobilize the masses. Left vs. Right The truth is that both Pastrana and Samper are moderates. Pastrana is shocked by the image of savage capitalism with which people are portraying him, but there are many Colombians who believe that market forces produce better results than state intervention. Particularly in the ruling class, where the Pastrana majority is well known. And Samper is neither a populist nor a leftist. But he knows that Colombian workers, students, and unions believe that neoliberalism has produced excesses that need to be corrected. These views are not heard much in the social clubs, but they may be in the majority. His speeches do not mention the word "apertura" [trade liberalization], considered compulsory in the Pastrana group. Samper's key word is "jobs" which, though sounding somewhat trite, is the Colombian people's biggest concern right now. Ernesto Samper is using this traditional strategy, and the results are showing up in the polls. After waffling from side to side for years he has decided to play the liberal card. Today this card is much more to the center than to the left. But in any case, it is different from Andres Pastrana's neoliberal right. Pastrana, though, is a formidable candidate. He has a great image and while by no means an intellectual, he is ideologically consistent. In handling the media he is infinitely superior to Samper; therefore, defeating him is not going to be easy. But the liberal candidate still has two aces up his sleeve: the party leadership and the vice presidency. When he is proclaimed the official candidate, the selection of these two posts will allow Ernesto Samper to give an image of renewal to the party. This "makeover" may manage to persuade many a skeptical liberal that it is better to be disciplined and loyal to the party. And as 50 percent of the voters are now liberals, compared with 25 percent who are conservatives, if Ernesto Samper can mobilize his party, his victory is highly probable. To mobilize liberals, they must be made enthusiastic. And the truth is that even though the machinery is running at full speed, there are still signs of lack of interest. The party image is a little out of fashion and modernizing it is essential. Former President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala, as the party's sole leader, has been conciliatory and effective. But his image--although venerable and respected--evokes other eras. The image of Samper himself is not the best. While he is barely over 40 and comes from the private sector, he has been perceived as an old-style politician. This image contrasts with that of Pastrana, the perfect product for a marketing director. But when Ernesto Samper emerges as the winner of the Liberal Party primary he is going to be running the show, and he may be able to bring about a change enabling him to turn this situation around. As the winning candidate, he can become the sole leader of his party--as the tradition has been in the past--or delegate this function to people who symbolize the new times. The selection of his vice president will also be a message of the changes the Liberal Party will have to make upon reaching the 21st century. Names like Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, Juan Manuel Santos, and Pedro Gomez have been mentioned in different contexts for the concluding phase of the campaign. Some strategic decisions of this nature may radically change the profile of liberalism and of its candidate in the final stretch. In a little while, Ernesto Samper will hold in his hands the ability to bring about this shakeup. If he does, he will be elected. The Truth of the Polls The years go by, and Colombians are still skeptical about polls. For the experts, the reality is very simple. Polls for the Senate and Chamber are not very reliable because of the number of candidates running. The polls for presidential candidates, when properly done, are reliable. It is almost impossible for them to be in error. This is because it is one thing to ask questions for three or four names, as in presidential elections, and something else for 300 or 400, as in parliamentary elections. Reservations about the methodology used in the poll released last week showing Ernesto Samper ahead are based on a single point: the inclusion or noninclusion of undecided voters. All pollsters in Colombia agree on two points. The first: of the people who intend to vote in the next election, Ernesto Samper is ahead of Andres Pastrana. The second; people who do not know if they are going to vote or not tend to prefer Pastrana. Therefore, a poll's final results depend on which percentage is attributed to these undecideds. The Bavaria-CNC poll lists 11 percent classified as independents. LA PRENSA criticized this as very low, arguing that independents in Colombia are at about 45 percent. However, Napoleon Franco, a polling rival of Carlos Lemoine, believes that the 11 percent of independents included as certain or probable voters in the Bavaria poll is a reasonable figure.
