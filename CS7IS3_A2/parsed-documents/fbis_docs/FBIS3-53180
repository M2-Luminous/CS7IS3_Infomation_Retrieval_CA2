FBIS3-53180 "drnes008_n_94006" FBIS-NES-94-008 Document Type:Daily Report 12 Jan 1994 LEBANON Suspected 1986 Berlin Bomber Imprisoned in Tyre NC1101190694 Beirut AL-DIYAR in Arabic 7 Jan 94 p 24 NC1101190694 Beirut AL-DIYAR Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Report by Mahmud al-Zayyat from Sidon] [Text] It has been learned that the Palestinian detainee Yasir al-Shuraydi, whose extradition is requested by the German authorities for alleged involvement in the bombing of a discotheque in Berlin in 1986 that killed three Americans is in a Tyre prison on charges of attempted murder and forgery and may face fresh charges in seven pending cases. It has been learned that several charges against al-Suraydi were dropped due to insufficient evidence. However, he is expected to face further charges in several other cases and will stand public trial later this month. You will recall that in 1983, when al-Shuraydi lived in Libya, Germany called on that country to extradite him. He was later implicated in the murder of a Libyan citizen called Mustafa al-'Ashiq. Al-Shuraydi, born in 1959 and a resident of 'Ayn al-Hulwah camp, hails from the al-Safsaf, a village in northern Palestine. South Public Prosecutor Justice Hatim Madi commented on the German request for al-Shuraydi's extradition, saying: "The issue of extradition depends on whether the legal conditions for extradition are met. It also depends on the strength of the case against the defendant. Following the interrogation of the person whose extradition is requested, the Higher Court's public prosecutor is to refer his file to the justice minister together with a report." Justice Madi added: "Extradition can be effected by a cabinet decree passed upon the recommendation of the justice minister. I do not think that there is an international extradition treaty between Lebanon and Germany. In this case, Articles 30 to 36 of the Lebanese penal code, governing the extradition of criminals between countries, would apply." Justice Madi said: "As long as an individual is facing trial in a Lebanese court he cannot be extradited, because Lebanese law should take precedence. If the extradition of a prisoner is requested for a certain crime, we will not try him for that crime, but it have to wait until he serves his prison sentence before we look into the crime for which his extradition is requested."
