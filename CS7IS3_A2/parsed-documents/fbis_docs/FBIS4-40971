Emphasizing the second document's importance in a conversation with journalists, the Russian Federation's foreign minister said that Russia is interested "not only, and maybe even not so much, in signing the 'Partnership for Peace' program, but in the Russia-NATO program." An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by the minister's adviser Galina Sidorova that the protocol on cooperation with the North Atlantic alliance is a "ramified document." She reminded him that the program for Russia's cooperation with NATO, which was elaborated by Russian experts, was presented by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to his NATO partners during his recent visit to the alliance headquarters. Afterwards, Russian diplomats and their NATO colleagues used it as a basis to prepare a document acceptable to both sides. Work is still being done on details, but Russia's most important wishes have been taken into account. "The protocol will incorporate virtually all provisions in the program suggested by us to NATO," G. Sidorova said.
