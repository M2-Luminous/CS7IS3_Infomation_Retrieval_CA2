ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would amend our regulations to require States to provide, as a condition of Medicaid eligibility, for mandatory enrollment of certain Medicaid eligibles in employer-based group health plans determined cost-effective by States under guidelines approved by HCFA, and require States to pay all premiums, and all deductibles, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations under these group health plans for items and services otherwise covered under the approved Medicaid State plans. In addition, the proposed rule would provide for Medicaid payment of premiums for certain individuals who are entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage (see Public Law 99&hyph;272 and section 601 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)) under a group health plan provided by an employer with 75 or more employees. This rule would conform our regulations to sections 4402 and 4713 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.

Background Medicaid is the Federally assisted State program authorized under title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act) to provide medical care to persons of limited means. Among these persons are those individuals who receive financial assistance under title IV&hyph;A (Aid to Families of Dependent Children (AFDC)), and title XVI (Supplemental Security Income (SSI)) and mandatory State supplements (SSP) and in the territories title XVI (Old-Age Assistance (OAA), Aid to the Blind (AB), Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled (APTD), Aid to the Aged, Blind or Disabled (AABD)). Each State determines the scope of its program, within limitations and guidelines established by the law and the implementing regulations at 42 CFR part 430 et seq. Each State submits a State plan that, when approved by HCFA, provides the basis for granting Federal funds to cover part of the expenditures incurred by the State for medical assistance and the administration of the program. Section 1902(a) of the Act specifies the eligibility requirements that individuals must meet in order to receive Medicaid. Other sections of the Act describe the eligibility groups in detail and specify limitations on what may be paid for as ``medical assistance.''
