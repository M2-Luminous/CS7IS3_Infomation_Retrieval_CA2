Responding to a reporter's question if the speech will be on March 7, Hosokawa said, "Yes. It will probably be so." Hosokawa also said his government is likely to submit the 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 to the Diet on Friday. The prime minister, foreign minister, finance minister and the economic planning agency director general usually give speeches in late January at the start of a 150-day ordinary Diet session. Hosokawa and the three ministers have yet to deliver the speeches to the Diet because of a delay in the compilation of the state budget for fiscal 1994 which starts April 1. The government usually compiles the budget at the year-end but this time carried compilation over to February because of prolonged deliberations on the political reform package, which was enacted in January.
