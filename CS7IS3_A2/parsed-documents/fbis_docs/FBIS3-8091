Four years after the beginning of the collapse of the former Communist Party, something new is trying to grow out of its ruins. Ivica Racan's Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), created from a reformist faction in the former regime party, has united with Antun Vujic's Social Democratic Party (SDH), which was established in 1989 in opposition to the former regime. The long-announced gathering of leftist social democrats is nevertheless starting to get under way, and some 10 days ago, leaders of both parties publicly confirmed that. They present themselves as two factions on the left of center Croatian political scene: social democrats from the former ruling party and social democrats from the opposition, and they advocate an independent and democratic Croatia. Without the Third Side However, with the appearance of a third movement on the left, which primarily includes Branko Horvat's Social Democratic Union (SDU), they will not and cannot unite. They think the third is continuing the work of conservative forces from the former regime, regarding the idea of a form of Yugoslav community, which see the creation of the Croatian state as a necessary evil. The Socialist Party of Croatia (SSH), headed by Silvije Degen, is a fourth leftist party, but Croatian social democrats have noticed that the Socialists wander between them and the SDU, and that they do not want to take sides. It is impossible to unite all the leftist parties because, even since 1990, the deepest polarization in Croatia is situated exactly to the left of the political center. Those who advocate Croatia are on one side of this front line and those who advocate Yugoslavia or invoke its spirits are on the other. Observers say that the attempt to unite everything that exists left of center would look like an attempt to glue together the former Croatian League of Communists: As though it were being attempted to shut a cat and a dog in the same cage and put the well- known curse on the left: May you have to deal with yourself! People say that that would continue to prevent the left from developing into a force that could mean something on the Croatian political scene. But many still insist on uniting the ununitable. Some members of the SDP claim that some do it naively wishing for the left to get stronger, but the road to hell is often paved with the best of intentions. Some think that uniting all the leftist parties is being encouraged by some circles in the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] and outside it -- those who want to weaken the left fearing it could get back to power in Croatia as well, as has already happened in many Eastern European countries. If the advocates of compromised ideas were to belong to one party, people say that the ruling party would find it easier to deal with the left, while the existing Racan's and especially Vujic's social democrats are a bit harder to control now. Identity Crisis Furthermore, people say that insisting on merging all the leftist parties is beneficial for some circles in the SDU and the SSH, as that part of the left is undergoing an identity crisis. A new identity can easily be found if they come closer to the social democrats, who acquire and want to continue to acquire an identity and legitimacy first of all with the Croatian nation. At former state and local elections, the SDP got the biggest share of the 9 percent of votes for the left. Ivica Racan is claiming these days that "the attempt to unite everything leftist in one party would marginalize the left and then also marginalize and eliminate the SDP. I will not agree to that, and I believe that I am supported by most people in the party." Some observers explain why it would be good for, for example "the far left" headed by Branko Horvat, which Stipe Suvar likes as well, to suppress the SDP, and especially to suppress Ivica Racan. In 1990, when he was a member of the SDP, Horvat criticized Racan for intending to give the SDP the name of social democrats but a couple of years later he changed his mind and started advocating social democratic concepts himself. "Far left" circles reproached Racan for having a poor strategy, with being "the grave-digger of the party," with "betraying the Serbs" after the first democratic elections, and the like. Indeed, after getting almost 30 percent of the votes at the elections in 1990, the SDP got only some 5 percent at the elections in 1992. It became evident that the party had reached an all time low, but it survived, recovered, and is now preparing to move slowly upward. These days one often hears the old anti- communists complimenting former communist Ivica Racin on his way of leading the party; they appreciate his political experience, and sometimes refer to the SDP as "polite civic party, which has contributed to democracy and inter-Croatian reconciliation." An observer has remarked that Racan's adversaries from the left could now be forced to admit that Racan was right in some things and that he "has not become history like some of his critics who were tied up by history." Racan or Tripalo The same observer continues that it is difficult to admit that owing to personal vanity, and some are quietly trying to push Racan away from the leading position in the SDP, including members of his own party. Lately, they have welcomed references to Mika Tripalo as a possible president of the united left, for that would make it easier to do away with Racan and the SDP. Still, our source claims that Racan and Tripalo are not in conflict, they recently had a long talk behind closed doors and cleared up matters, and they are also publicly praising each other. Indeed, in the last couple of months, Racan himself has considered withdrawing from the leading position into the party shadows. However, VJESNIK's source continues, "now Racan, too, is displaying a kind of vanity. He does not want to be written off but wants to prove that he can not only preserve the party but also stimulate its growth, and that has lately become evident. In that, he is supported by most members of the SDP; he is even being pushed by them." All in all, after the successful party reform, which Racan carried out by relying on the so-called youth line, the SDP is now trying to make a step forward on the Croatian political scene. With a refreshed and rejuvenated leadership, the SDP wants to be the center of the Croatian democratic left, which will spread toward the center. As a sign of that, members of the party claim, they decided to unite with the SDH, whose members did not hide their political inclinations toward the reformists in the SDP. Antun Vujic claims he finds it easier to talk to members of earlier factions of the SDP than with Racan himself. Circles close to the SDP and the SDH claim it is soon to be expected that many prominent men will publicly support the unification of social democrats in order to help them develop politically. Observers say that Racan is counting on young people in his party in particular to carry forward social democratic ideas, and that there are such people in the SDH as well, for the unburdened generation can suppress conflicts in the party that mostly originated in the past and that are directed toward the past instead of the present. A young member of the SDP, now in the party leadership, says it was most difficult for him in the election campaign of 1990. At that time, new Croatian parties were setting up their stalls on Jelacic Square and selling party materials and symbols. "I was standing behind the SDP stand, and the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] stands were to the left and to the right of me and people were fighting to get to them while no one came to me except for old ladies and stool pigeons. One of them shouted: `And where is your famous equipment -- the hammer and sickle?' I replied sadly they had been stolen by some people from the HDZ. When the war begin, I volunteered. Of course, it was difficult for me at the front lines as well, but easier than on Jelacic Square in 1990."
