FBIS3-48171 "dreas015_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-015 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 South Korea Agreement on Principle of Inspection SK2201022794 Seoul YONHAP in English 0217 GMT 22 Jan 94 SK2201022794 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Berlin, Jan. 22 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea have agreed on the basic principle of a one-time restricted inspection, and the IAEA is expecting an official answer on the sites Pyongyang will open for inspection next week, IAEA Spokesman David Kyd said Friday. One-time restricted inspection is neither a regular inspection nor a full-fledged inspection, Kyd told YONHAP by telephone. The IAEA totally understands the situation and so it is not demanding a full scope safeguard inspection. Both sides agree that the purpose of their working-level talks is to try to agree on a one-time inspection to see if there have been any abnormal changes in the status of North Korea's nuclear facilities, but there is a problem on the scope of the inspection, Kyd said. The IAEA insists that it should inspect all the facilities, and North Korea disagrees. Remarks by a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman berating the IAEA were just an attempt to shift the blame in case the contacts fail to reach an agreement, Kyd said. He said he believed that North Korea would give an official answer at a diplomatic level next week, and he is waiting for the answer. Making announcements to the outside world and trying to reach agreement through patient discussions are totally different activities, he said, adding that he did not think North Korea would break off contact with the IAEA. North Korea may want to say that the IAEA is trying to resume regular inspections, which had been carried out until last year's suspension of nuclear inspection, but that is not true, he said. The IAEA has an understanding that the resumption of regular inspections should be discussed more. There is no change in the IAEA's position that it will not send an inspection team until it has a clear agreement with Pyongyang on the scope of the inspection, he added. Also reached by telephone, Yi Si-yong, the South Korean ambassador to Vienna, said that there was no change in the IAEA's position that North Korea should open all seven declared nuclear sites for inspection according to nuclear safeguards regulations. Securing continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea and carrying out a full-fledged inspection are required by resolutions of the IAEA Board of Directors and general meeting, and the IAEA Secretariat is not in a position to make concessions freely, Yi said.
