FR941031-2-00134 FR941031-2-00093 The first formal governing document for the tribe was the 1974 Articles of Incorporation. It was followed in 1990, by a constitution which reflected how they governed themselves and defined their membership. Membership consists of Choctaws possessing 1/4 or more blood quantum who descend from the Choctaws who settled in LaSalle Parish and who were listed as Indian on the 1880, 1900, and 1910 censuses. The constitution also allows that at specified future dates, descendants with less than 1/4 Choctaw blood quantum will be allowed to enroll as members. The members are not members of any other recognized tribe, nor has Congress terminated or denied a government-to-government relationship with the tribe. There are 153 names on the 1993 membership roll. One hundred percent of the membership descends from at least one ancestor who was identified as a Choctaw Indian on the 1900 and 1910 Federal censuses or as Indian on the 1870, 1880, or 1920 Federal censuses. Over 88 percent of the membership also descends from someone who was identified as a full-blood Mississippi Choctaw on the 1903 preliminary roll of the Dawes Commission. Under the new regulations, the high degree (over 50 percent) of in-group marriages through 1959 is considered to be a high level of evidence for the existence of an Indian community to that date. The new regulations also provide that the petitioner is assumed to have exhibited tribal political authority over its members prior to 1959 because of the high level of evidence that it maintained a community during those years. Interaction between Jena Choctaws has been maintained since 1959 with informal ``visiting'' and since 1974 with activities sponsored by the tribal council. Based on this preliminary factual determination, we conclude that the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians meet all seven mandatory criteria and should be granted Federal acknowledgment under 25 CFR part 83. As provided by 25 CFR 83.10(h) of the new regulations, a report summarizing the evidence, reasoning, and analyses that are the basis for the proposed decision will be provided to the petitioner and other interested parties, and is available to other parties upon written request. After consideration of the written arguments and evidence rebutting the proposed finding and within 60 days after the expiration of the 180-day response period described above, the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs will publish the final determination of the petitioner's status in the Federal Register as provided in 25 CFR 83.10(l). Ada E. Deer, Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26835 Filed 10&hyph;28&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;02&hyph;M
