FR941103-0-00025 FR941103-0-00006 14 CFR Part 73 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ASW&hyph;12] Change Time of Designation for Restricted Areas R&hyph;5103A, B, C, and D; McGregor, NM AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends the time of designation for Restricted Areas R&hyph;5103A, B, C, and D, McGregor, NM. The U.S. Army has determined that the present published time of designation for the restricted areas does not accurately reflect their actual times of use. This action lessens the burden on the public by amending the published time of designation to reflect limited weekend activity in these areas by the military. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, February 2, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steve Riley, Military Operations Program Office (ATM&hyph;420), Office of Air Traffic System Management, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;7130. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Rule This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the time of designation for Restricted Areas R&hyph;5103A, B, C, and D, McGregor, NM, from ``0700&hyph;2000 local time; other times by NOTAM'' to ``0700&hyph;2000 local time Monday-Friday; other times by NOTAM.'' Following a review of its special use airspace the U.S. Army, Fort Bliss, TX, determined that it has a continuing requirement for the restricted areas; however, the current published time of designation does not accurately reflect the time the airspace is required for military use. This action amends the published time of the restricted areas but does not change the existing boundaries or the types of activities currently conducted within R&hyph;5103A, B, C, or D. Because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public is not particularly interested, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. ยง73.51 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Environmental Review This action reduces the time of designation of the restricted areas. Accordingly, this action is not subject to environmental assessments and procedures as set forth in FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts.''
