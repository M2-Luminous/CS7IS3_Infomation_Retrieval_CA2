Representatives of highly influential international organizations--the CSCE, which sent members of parliament from various countries, and also the International Election Systems Foundation--an organization tracking election systems worldwide--had come to the republic specially. Having expressed gratitude for the invitation to observe the elections, Jaan van Hauvelingen thereupon declared: "The elections far from conform to the international standards accepted in the CSCE. The purpose of elections in pluralist free societies, that of the people being afforded an opportunity to determine their future, was not achieved. Our delegation was made up of nine persons representing France, Sweden, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Germany, Turkey, Greece, and the Netherlands, and also the central machinery of the CSCE directly, and this is our unanimous opinion. In the course of the trip we have had an opportunity to meet both officials and leaders of public organizations, and to visit election precincts in Almaty, Kapchagay, Issyk, and several other places of the capital oblast. Six of our teams visited and had an opportunity to observe the election process at 50 polling stations." Mr. Hauvelingen went on to dwell in detail on the actual reasons that made for the unsuccessful elections. He cited as the first of them the candidates' and, most important, the electorate's insufficient time for truly aware voting. "The system of registration of the candidates is very complex, and the district commissions excluded from the slates candidates, and the Ministry of Justice, political parties and grassroots movements, arbitrarily, frequently pursuing ends incompatible with fair elections," the CSCE representative observed. "The official slate constitutes 20 percent of the corps of deputies. So high a percentage of appointees, not elected persons, is a most flagrant breach of the principles on the basis of which the CSCE functions." He also emphasized that this runs counter to Kazakhstan's commitments, which the country assumed when it acceded to the Paris Charter and the Helsinki Act. The observers' particular criticism was evoked by the fact that one person would sometimes vote for several, not even presenting his papers, what is more. At some stations at which the foreign members of parliament were present, the number of such "dead souls" amounted to 35 percent. The existence of two electoral rolls (one at the station, the other in the district election committee) also left open the possibility of manipulation. Even the foreigners' fleeting acquaintance with our elections enabled them to uncover two instances of the portable ballot boxes being taken to the voters' homes, where they were forced to vote. Nor was the campaign fair beyond reproach, in the words of the overseas experts. The dubious disqualification of many candidates was reflected in their assessments. The public was inadequately informed about the elections and the candidates and their programs. Election polls revealed the electorate's misunderstanding of the voting system. In the city of Kapchagay, which one team of observers visited, there were 13 open stations and three closed ones--at military facilities. Some 5,000 persons--20 percent of the electorate--voted at the closed ones, but there was not a single observer or representative of the candidate present there. The system of distribution of ballots elicited the experts' particular objections. In many instances, there were more than were necessary, and there was no proper count and destruction of the surplus ballots. The ballot boxes were not guarded at some stations. The portable boxes were located in an unmonitored room, and the observers were unable, try as they might, to establish strict control here. The leader of the CSCE delegation observed also: "In all likelihood, the press was unable to publish material or to criticize violations in the course of preparation of the elections. Intimidation of independent journalists by the local authorities occurred in some instances. This was manifested particularly obviously in Almaty and Karaganda." Summing up what he had said, Mr. Hauvelingen confirmed once again that all this prevents the elections in Kazakhstan being deemed sufficiently democratic. More than 10 points of the Election Charter were violated. He distinguished as positive aspects the very aspiration of Kazakhstan to free elections and also the openness of officials in the leadership of the country and the Central Electoral Commission, who are capable of dialogue and of making revisions to the election system. Representatives of the International Election Systems Foundation declared that they would not venture to defend the elections in court. The voice of the citizens of Kazakhstan simply was not, in their opinion, heard in full. Amat Radevegan and Linda Enborg subscribed fully to the assessments made by the CSCE parliamentary delegation. At the same time, they presented their own opinions also: They criticized the Election Code, which has obvious shortcomings, and also the practice of its application. All those whom the foundation's representatives met in the republic--political parties, observers, and officials--agreed with this, incidentally. The diktat of the local district commissions was observed in the course of the elections. The Central Electoral Commission was severely limited also in its opportunities for intervening in the process of registration of the candidates and monitoring the local commissions. Thus, 135 election standards, matching the number of electoral commissions, had taken shape in Kazakhstan. A necessary solution for the future, according to Madame Enborg, could be coordination vertically, with full responsibility being entrusted to the Central Electoral Commission. Many violations were connected, as representatives of the foundation observed, with the fact that commissions, attempting to ensure the necessary 50 percent turnout, permitted one family member to vote for all. But there were stations and commissions that performed their duty impeccably. The present elections were for all that, therefore, a step toward democracy. Such harsh evaluations by the international observers could not have failed to have given rise to journalists' questions. The first was as follows: "....Do you not think that the president should cancel these elections?" Responding, Mr. Hauvelingen said that he hoped that Kazakhstan, as a member of the CSCE, would heed the delegation's opinion and take account of its observations, making the appropriate changes for the next elections. Responding to a question as to who should be held responsible for the unfair elections, the leader of the delegation said that this was for the people of Kazakhstan and the new parliament, not the foreign observers' mission, to decide. The foreigners' evasiveness as regards specific conclusions which might follow as a result of what had been said is perfectly understandable. But it is clear even now that Kazakhstan will once again get a parliament which it will be hard to call one that is legitimate and that truly expresses the will of the citizens of the republic.
