It is said that industry enters a period of change from the new to the old in increments of 100 years, but how will new industries linked to the 21st century differ? Twelve trends are examined. Today, at the end of the 20th century, the root causes of the extended major business slump are the structural changes in both lifestyle and sense of value on the part the members and consumers living in our high-powered consumer society. Materialistic consumption in the subsistence areas of "clothing, food, and shelter," which was the 20th century lifestyle focus, has reached saturation and, therefore, a limit. Industry of the 20th century, which is based on this, is therefore directly confronted by growth limits and will be forced into retooling and long-term structural adjustments into the next century. Industry is in an "end-of-century structural slump," marking a period of fundamental shift from the old to the new. By contrast, 21st century lifestyles and industry are now budding. With the sure spread of a lifestyle that takes non-materialistic living seriously, where are the possibilities for new businesses to be found? Permit me to try and predict these new business trends into the 21st century, resulting from a multifaceted gathering of information and analysis. The Changing View of Clothing, Food, and Shelter First, in terms of the "clothing" aspect of the basic necessities of clothing, food, and shelter, we are led to consider "consumer fashions." Although up to now "designer fashions" done by eminent designers have occupied the fashion mainstream, the consumer herself will now be able to select from the growing flood of fashion selections to emphasize her own individuality, using her own fashion ability. Consumers will suddenly be made aware that they themselves can coordinate the flow of fashion products. It is not the designer controlling sensibility and fashion, but the consumer through her own lifestyle who will be able to manage her own fashion life. The fashion business will be transformed in the future. In 1992, Onward made a hit in commercializing consumer fashions with a product line called, "Suite." It is a commercial development made on the premise that the consumer herself will combine individual pieces. We can now see the same trend in such products as Renown's "AAR" and World's "OZOC." One is not led to conclude that the fashion industry has reached the saturation limit; rather, new business possibilities are arising through wrestling with consumer fashion principles. The second area is "food." We speak of a gluttonous society and we also see in children incidents of diabetes and even geriatric diseases. Thus, it is natural that healthy and natural foods should draw our attention. Chinese medicine is again being reviewed at the Toyo Medical School, and with health rules based afresh on natural principles, Chinese traditional nutrition and the art of meritorious chi are in the limelight. In contrast to the art of meritorious chi, which introduces universal natural energy into the mind and body, Chinese traditional nutrition involves eating just as they are those foods which contain the life force, energy, and nutrients of universal nature. Although it is said that nutrition has a more than 5,000 year history, attempts are now underway to study it scientifically. For example, it was announced at an academic conference that a component of catechin found in tannin in tea has efficacy in suppressing cancer. Foods containing green tea itself are under development and Chinese and Japanese teas have become highly popular. Beta carotene is another nutrient that has gained attention for its cancer suppressing ability. Furthermore, research continues on chitosan found in the shells of crabs and shrimp which is effective in lowering blood pressure and on the utility of food fibers and rice bran sugar which activate colon bacteria. We are led to consider trends toward converting these sorts of things into food. Furthermore, there is said to be a booming market of nearly 50 billion yen for natural water and it is now being added to tofu base, pickles, beer, diluted whiskey, and Japanese sake. There is potential for natural water and products using natural water to grow in the future. One can conceive of scientific development and production of ultra-pure water of perhaps the same quality as natural water. There is the artificially produced [sekomu] mineral water called "[Sekomu] Safe Water," which is close to "scientific water." Third is the issue of housing. A housing environment will be sought which I call "five and sixth sense housing," which can fully satisfy the five human senses as well as our sixth sense. Urban civilization and culture have been thought to run counter to nature, but now people want to incorporate nature into their living space. Currently a hit are plants, pets, and home aquariums which combine environmental technology with the use of water. These can be seen as fresh "amenity conditioners" that combine natural breezes and natural light with the beauty of shade which are hallmarks of Japanese residential culture. Devices which direct sunlight to underground rooms and rooms with a northern exposure are on the market. The point is how to present an agreeable environment close to nature using current technology. If we look back on history, the Phoenix Hall of the Uji Byodoin Temple and Taian Hermitage of Rikyu constitute a world of virtual reality of Buddhist paradise and perhaps now we can manifest the spiritual world of Zen nothingness. In Japanese residential culture, there is much know-how regarding this kind of interface and interaction with nature. It would seem necessary in modern housing to incorporate this kind of thing, of taking lessons from the past. The Potential for a "Spiritual" Industry Although the concept of "from the material to the spiritual" has been discussed for ages, Japan's consumer society truly has an excess of "things," such as household appliances, furniture, and automobiles, which have been the focus of the basic necessities of clothing, food and shelter. I have been calling the "spiritual" aspect of this "HEALCI" (healthy), which embodies this concern. "H" stands for health, "E" for education, "A" for amusement, "L" for leisure, "C" for culture, and "I" for intelligence or information. We are led to believe that people have an interest in this area and will make it an important part of consumption. Then, the fourth area is health, which comes first. In the area of health in the narrow sense will be growth in home medicine, family medicine, and family checkups. Health instruments one can use for self-examinations at home are already on the market, for example, instruments to check for diabetes by testing urine, wristwatches that check blood pressure, and pregnancy test kits. The trend toward self-management of health will be a new business area brought on by cooperation among the leading industrial nations. Fifth is leisure. There was at one time an explosive boom in resort development, but speaking of resorts, the conspicuous ease of tennis courts and golf courses with their problem of spontaneous deterioration caused them to reach a limit. An age of "leisure time farming" will come in the future. We may find resorts offering agriculture, fisheries, and animal husbandry businesses on a leisure time basis, allowing families and friends to do farming. The point is that they will be able to commune with nature and themselves. Autocamps were perhaps forerunners of this. In England, travel to see cattle-raising has become an industry. In New Zealand, one travel product in the agricultural industry is a "farm stay" where one visits with a farm family and shears sheep. Also, in Japan, urban agricultural parks in Setagaya and Narima-ku are filled to capacity. As the nobility was familiar with the agricultural and fisheries industries, for today's city dwellers, leisure agriculture resorts will in the future also be a major interest. Even so, facilities will not be lacking, such as showers in order to tide the visitor over comfortably. Sixth is the much talked about area of multimedia, which is developing into a major industry. Although the attention of the business world has been focused on games, a truly diverse industry involving culture, the arts, and education, and carried on multimedia, is a possibility. For example, in the area of the arts, we are led to consider ultra art reproduction. Art will lack canvas and frames; that is, it will be stored on CD-ROM's, and people will be able to call it up for display at any time. One will not need to leave the house nor will the art become subject to speculation, linking this to democratization of the arts. As for education, it will be important to generate curricula and texts which will invigorate the diverse potential of multimedia. Culture will be produced scientifically and it is a certainty that multimedia culture, which will incorporate "cultural science," which in turn will combine the sensitivities of the artist, will become a colossal business in the coming century. It is said it will be a 500 trillion yen business worldwide. The next, or seventh area, stemming from the information superhighway, is the concept of "electronic retailing." Although CATV [cable television] is now used exclusively, ultimately shopless marketing will be carried on the B-ISDN [broadband integrated services digital networks] network. Movies, video, music, and educational programs will simply be brought up on home terminal displays. The same will be true for games. Today, already, Sega Enterprises is delivering 100 to 150 different games on an experimental basis on the Tokyo CATV Network. The leading U.S. telecommunications company and Sumitomo Shoji will conduct experiments on Suginami CATV in a cooperative investment. When this begins, consumers will be able to order directly from their homes by referring to electronic media catalogs and detailed product information while simultaneously drawing on funds in their bank accounts in order to make payment. In the United States, the concept of an information superhighway, the B-ISBN, has been announced and will be in place by the year 2000. Although I have discussed leisure some already, eighth is the possibility of "cyber amusement," which will combine the human senses with mechanical apparatuses. For example, when we attempt to measure the brain waves of children absorbed in the family computer, we find Zen-like alpha waves. Children also achieve Zen-like satori while playing games. Although there is talk that the Formula I race car driver Ayrton Senna saw God in the middle of a race, it may be that he was experiencing the same sort of thing. Importantly, in studying the ultra "giddiness boundaries" and making free use of high tech, electronics, and mechatronics, we will develop a leisure of the brain and senses. Body sensation games come close to this. The Age of the "Brain Industry" As a ninth area, industry of the future will probably surpass the information industry and achieve importance as a "brain industry." People who are in the lead in the industrial world are not white collar but "platinum collar," that is, a "brain tribe" who do brain work, for whom it will be necessary to cultivate "brain tools," which will give rise to high-value-added "brain products." Called cyber devices, they are the product of advances in computer technology. Today computers continue shrinking in size such that we now have palm-sized "palmtops." Apple's "Newton" and Sharp's "GEOS" are on the market. With computers becoming endlessly smaller and with handwriting recognition, data communications, and telephonic capabilities, they become an extension of our brains. Every individual will have a cyber device as a surrogate for his brain. The way these high-powered information knowledge products achieve this may be as "brain tools." The 10th area is the era of a "brain industry," with offices becoming brain offices and cities where research centers are sited called "brain cities." Developing these brain cities may become a new business area. Large factories and office buildings will be unnecessary in the cities of the future. Because shops will also be unnecessary with the information superhighway, one is led to believe that large buildings will also become unnecessary in large cities. If this happens, it will be natural that these become the biggest casualties of urban culture. The 11th trend will be the appearance of the ecological city, which will incorporate nature. In the "Biosphere," which was built in the United States in the state of Arizona, a space colony-like situation was created in a capsule with seven to eight scientists now living in it experimentally. It is a city which exists as a living body by incorporating nature. Prototypes of nature incorporated in the city produced and managed with scientific technology have been the realization in Funabashi City in Chiba Prefecture of an indoor ski slope called SSAWS, the "Shiigaya" indoor seaside pool in Miyazaki Prefecture, and an artificial wave pool at "Wild Blue Yokohama" in Yokohama. With lighting technology imitating the sun in the Tokyo Dome, there is also the possibility of neighborhood industries involving the atmosphere of cities. The "brain city" and the "nature city" will be the mainstream cities in the future. Finally, I offer as the 12th area "electronic brain religion." Although earlier I introduced alpha waves of children using the family computer, research into brain functions connecting science to human emotion is progressing with the development of the computer. Integrating the results, it will probably be possible to reproduce something akin to a religious-like experience with electronic technology. For example, a company in northern Kyushu called Sunray, using virtual reality, expects to open a theme park in 1995 that will give visitors experience with facing death. As a pseudo-religious theme park, it is an original idea for a business. This type of electronic brain religion, in contrast to the life worth living, can create an "industry of death worth dying." It will be an industry to fulfill the desire to live life fully up to the moment of death, as with hospices today and decisions on the scattering of ashes. In the United States, the Tibetan Book of the Dead is being used in psychological treatment to prepare AIDS patients to meet death. Human "Mental Abilities," the Ultimate Resource The above introduces 12 future business possibilities, although new marketing approaches will be extremely important for 21s-century style new businesses. Companies first will find it necessary to build systems that foster integrated intellect, knowledge, and information, that is, a "corporate brain." Furthermore, with major change today saturating 20th century industry, the ability to anticipate and foresee the future will be indispensable. Moreover, we could say, without judging culture emotionally or intuitively, that an era has arrived which will develop scientifically. In order to foster the development of multimedia, "cultural science" must be tackled. Consumers, as urbanites, are human beings. If "human research" is neglected, one cannot achieve ultimate customer satisfaction. New business marketing in a high-powered era will be the knowledge industry, which will be the embodiment of post-capitalism. Automation and product quality management will be necessary with advances in brain work productivity. The "mental ability" of people is the ultimate resource. In terms of insight, genius, intuition, and inspiration, humans possess enormous latent "mental abilities" and in activating them through scientific analysis, "filiation science strategies" and "filiation science marketing" based on filiation science, which is the science of human thought, will be needed.
