FBIS3-50431 "drlat001_h_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-001 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Jan 1994 Honduras Deputy Decries U.S. Position PA3112164793 Tegucigalpa Voz de Honduras Network in Spanish 1145 GMT 30 Dec 93 PA3112164793 Tegucigalpa Voz de Honduras Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [From the "Morning Paper" newscast] [Text] Carlos Sosa Cuello, PINU [Innovation and Unity Party] deputy has charged that the U.S. position of supporting the clearing up of missing persons cases in Honduras is hypocritical because the people in Washington originally promoted and fostered this type of criminal action. Meanwhile, Sosa fears that actions may be taken against witnesses in these cases after the release of the preliminary report by Human Rights Ombudsman Leo Valladares. The report could revive the memories of the violent actions that led to more than 100 missing persons. This morning, Deputy Sosa levied serious allegations against the U.S. Government, saying it is greatly responsible for the more than 100 disappearances during the 1980's. Likewise, he insinuated that a controversy could arise between the relatives of the missing persons and those accused of being responsible for the disappearances. Here is what Deputy Sosa Cuello said: [Begin recording] [Sosa] I think the United States, specifically the Reagan administration, had a leading role in this matter. They trained our forces; they armed the Honduran forces; and they trained them in torture, interrogation techniques, and methods that led to the disappearance of people. Now, from Washington, they have the gall to cry out, as if horror-stricken, in favor of human rights. Only a decade ago, these very rights were violated under U.S. instructions, encouragement, and support. The United States almost demanded this. This is typically hypocritical of the empires that preach one set of morals and practice another. This is very characteristic of the Calvinist moral system: It upholds success as the only human goal, regardless of the means or mechanisms used in achieving this success. It has a philosophical antecedent in Machiavellianism; it is typically Calvinistic and Protestant; it is very characteristic of this empire's moral values. [Reporter] What they applauded before, they now reject, right? [Sosa] Concerning what they fostered and demanded before, they are now horror-sticken. On certain occasions it is the very same actors who participated. [Reporter] [words indistinct] in this case the U.S. empire. [Sosa] This is what they call political pragmatism. It is the securing of results as the primary goal of men of state. This is not true. The means should be in keeping with the ends to allow our actions to ethically respond to the goals for which we are fighting. One cannot champion democracy and liberty by murdering or, even worse, by fostering murder and then subsequently appearing horror-sticken by what one has fostered. To me, this is philosophically and ethically unacceptable. [Reporter] Who is more guilty, the United States or the Hondurans who were in power at that time? [Sosa] I think we Hondurans should place historical and not criminal responsibility on those who held high-ranking positions at that time in our nation. It would be wrong for us to judge the foreigners without first judging our own people. When I make this statement regarding the imperialists' hypocracy, I do this from an Honduran point of view, and I am doing this in an effort to prevent this from ever happening again in Honduras. [Reporter] Do you not fear that this report will create discord between the two sides? [Sosa] I would like this report, its final conclusions, and the actions that the attorney general -- still unknown to us as of this time -- could or not take to put an end to this chapter. I would like this report not to refresh memories of an era that we Hondurans should forget, precisely so that it is not repeated and not relived. [Reporter] What does this refreshing of memory mean? [Sosa] It means the possibility of leaving the door open -- a green light, so to speak -- for actions against possible witnesses, against possible depositions, or that this could be used by certain sectors against their adversaries. [Reporter] Currently, are there threats between the groups? [Sosa] I hope not. I hope that the investigations, the legal actions, and the meaning of the amnesty granted by Congress will put an end to the situation and create one in which the Honduran state has greater interest in compensating the relatives and descendants of these victims of violence than in seeking revenge. We should do more to educate the children of the missing persons to guarantee them a future instead of procuring vengeance, which is one of humanity's basest emotions.
