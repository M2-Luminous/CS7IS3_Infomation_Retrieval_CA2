FR940921-2-00005 FR940921-2-00004 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;570&hyph;001] Potassium Permanganate From the People's Republic of China; Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: On August 15, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) received a request from Carus Chemical Company (Carus), the petitioner, that it be permitted to withdraw its request for an administrative review, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5) (1994), of the antidumping duty order on potassium permanganate from the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the period January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993. Although the Department received the request to withdraw after the normal period allowed, the Department is terminating this administrative review in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5). EFFECTIVE DATE: September 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Stolz, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230, telephone number (202) 482&hyph;4474. Background On January 31, 1984, the Department published in the Federal Register (49 FR 3898) the antidumping duty order on potassium permanganate from the PRC. After receiving a timely request for review from Carus, the Department initiated, on February 17, 1994, an administrative review for the period January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993 (59 FR 7979). On August 15, 1994, Carus requested that it be permitted to withdraw its request for review for this period of review. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5), the Department may extend the normal 90-day time limit for withdrawal of a request for review if the Department determines it is reasonable to do so. We have determined that it is reasonable to extend the time limit for Carus' request because we have not yet issued questionnaires for this period and because there is no indication on the record that the substantive rights of any party would be impaired by such a decision. Respondent Zunyi Chemical Factory (Zunyi) and an importer, Novachem, Inc. (Novachem), have objected to the termination request on the grounds that (1) Zunyi intended to submit adequate information in the current review in order to avoid the application of best information available as was done in the 1990 review, the final results of which were published on May 23, 1994 (59 FR 26625), and (2) petitioner's request for termination of this review was untimely. Regardless of its stated intent to supply adequate information in the current review, Zunyi should have been aware that because the 1993 review was based solely on the petitioner's request, that request could be withdrawn pursuant to 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5). Because we have extended the 90-day time period for requesting withdrawal, we hereby grant Carus' request for withdrawal. This notice is published in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675) and 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5). Dated: September 9, 1994. Roland L. MacDonald, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23365 Filed 9&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
