Among the detainees is also an UNPROFOR member. The detainees were carrying a large amount of foreign currency, and it has been established that the suspects were charged with purchasing equipment for the army and the police of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and that they had set off for the airport with this intention, from where they were supposed to fly to Zagreb. As the incumbent offices have reported, six people have been arrested and detained in prison, among them (Angelo Andrea), an Italian citizen who was in charge of the liaison with correspondents in the UNPROFOR civilian sector. The search has established that Savcinovic, Cakovic, and Kujic all possessed UN press cards, while, as he claims, he had the card of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees from the Muslim government because he was in charge of control of humanitarian cargo in Frankfurt. [sentence as heard] A letter was also found on Halilovic, which claims that Operation Parachute will be stopped in a month. An investigation is under way.
