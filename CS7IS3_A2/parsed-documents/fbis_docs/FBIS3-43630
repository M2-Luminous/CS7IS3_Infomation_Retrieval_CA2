The plane was seized in Kent, England, over a controversial debt. The aircraft flew into the country in the early hours of Thursday [6 January] last week. The return of the high-revenue yielding aircraft followed successful negotiation by the Nigeria Airways management led by its managing director, Mr. Andrew Agom. This brings to three the number of seized Nigeria Airways aircraft that have been released by creditors. Mr. Agom said the authority is doing everything possible to carry out reorganizations as directed by the government. For this reason, letters have been sent to those who will replace returning overseas stations staff. He also said a new flight schedule will be out by the 17th of this month with the emphasis on the west coast routes.
