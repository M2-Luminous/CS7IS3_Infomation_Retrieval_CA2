FBIS3-50836 "drlat006_a_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-006 Document Type:Daily Report 10 January 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Puerto Rican Journalist on Cuban Defectors FL0801154894 FL0801154894 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 1255 GMT on 8 January features a 13-minute live telephone interview with Marilyn Perez Coto, journalist for the Puerto Rican newspaper CLARIDAD, regarding the current situation of the 35 Cuban athletes who deserted recently during the 17th Central American and Caribbean Games in Ponce. Radio Rebelde host Alfredo Forte explains to Perez that this call is in response to a 7 January GRANMA article that was based on the Milvia Arcilla piece published in CLARIDAD entitled, "The Defectors are Abandoned." Perez states: "Sadly enough, many of the athletes who defected believed the promises made to them. However a week after the games, they were housed in a civil defense shelter." Perez states that many of the promises made to them cannot be fulfilled because of certain Puerto Rican laws and regulations. She adds: "It is not easy for someone new to find work, particularly when there are so many unemployed Puerto Ricans with university degrees in sports." Perez stresses that athletes in Puerto Rico need to depend on regular jobs to make a living and that training facilities are not as readily available as in Cuba. Perez stresses that the athletes have basically been forbidden to speak to the press, particularly CLARIDAD, which presents a point of view different from the official view in other newspapers. Perez points out that only one athlete, basketball star Andre Gibert, has been provided an apartment. Perez states that they have been told Gibert is very depressed because he is not playing and that his future is uncertain, since it is unlikely that the Puerto Rican and Cuban Basketball Leagues will reach an agreement to let him play. Forte and Perez stress that Gibert had been told it was very easy to become a pro star. Perez explains that the Cuban exile community is pressuring sports leagues and local officials, behind closed doors, to change the rules and let Cuban athletes play. Perez notes that the possibilities for these athletes are minimal: "It is very sad, but these young men [muchachos] have thrown their futures overboard. Here they will end up working as store clerks." Throughout the conversation, Perez repeatedly refers to the athletes as "muchachos." Forte states that they have unfortunately allowed themselves to be carried away by a siren's song and are now dearly paying the consequences. Perez reports that there are approximately 10 athletes still in Puerto Rico -- the ones who ended up in the shelter. Others have reportedly moved to Miami or are staying with relatives. Perez stresses that in Miami the situation is no easier in terms of getting permission from sports leagues or overcoming international rules. Perez adds: "It is very, very sad. There are people here who left during the Mariel boat lift; we all know the conditions under which the Mariel people left. We see them in the streets, very depressed and regretful. They are trying to get help, and tell everyone that they regret having left and want to return to Cuba. However, we cannot help them at this point." Perez adds that there are immigrants from the seventies and eighties who are truly sad and have not found a niche in Puerto Rico. Perez says that the only hope these people have is to fight for the end of the blockade and therefore vindicate themselves. Yet, it is not easy to do this after having betrayed one's country. She states: "They mope around like penitent souls. It is truly sad." Perez describes the tragedy of these young men's actions, that this will be a trauma they will have to shoulder the rest of their lives, and adds: "In the end, they will regret what they did." Forte thanks Perez for the information. Perez explains that they feel like Cuba'a correspondents. Forte thanks Perez for the support CLARIDAD and the Puerto Rican people gave to Cuba during the games. Perez says that it is their duty to support Cuba 100 percent, everyday, and under any circumstances, because: "We believe in the Cuban Revolution."
