Speaking on arrival, Mr. Beye said there was no deadlock at the peace talks he has been chairing in Zambia for the past seven months. He declined to discuss the possibility that the UN might withdraw from Angola at the end of the month if no settlement was reached. The government and UNITA delegations at the talks have returned to consult with their leaders in Angola. A government minister, Albino Malungo, has appealed to UNITA to allow the resumption of aid flights, which were suspended last Monday [13 June], saying food stores could otherwise deteriorate.
