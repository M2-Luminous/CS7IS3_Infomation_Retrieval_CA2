Japan's crime in concealing a large quantity of plutonium must be counted. NODONG SINMUN says this in a commentary today. Noting that the Japanese reactionaries are resorting to despicable artifices to hush up the recently exposed concealment of 70 kilograms of plutonium at the Tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant, the analyst says: Japan is claiming that it was ignorant of a large quantity of plutonium sticking to the equipment of the fuel-making plant. But this far-fetched argument is unbecoming to Japan boasting itself of being advanced in nuclear technologies. No less ridiculous is the excuse of Japan that the case resulted from the negligence of cleaning of the equipment by the plant which was too much engrossed in the production of nuclear fuel through the operation of the fast breeder reactor. Plutonium possessed by Japan now reportedly amounts to 26 tons. It was several dozen years ago that Japan put its first nuclear facilities into operation. Now many reactors are operating in Japan. So, not much penetration is required to guess how much plutonium Japan is now concealing besides the exposed amount. The Japanese reactionaries' concealment of plutonium is aimed at manufacturing nuclear weapons. If not, why has it kept dangeorus nuclear materials in secrecy? The Japanese reactionaries, captive to the design of reinvasion, are making haste with the conversion of Japan into a nuclear power in a bid to realise their old dream of "the greater East Asia coprosperity sphere." Japan's nuclear armament has reached a very dangerous stage. The Japanese reactionaries' noisy row to do harm to the DPRK over its "nuclear development" is nothing but a petty trick to cover up their nuclear armament. They are now openly claiming that if "sanctions" were taken against the DPRK by the United Nations, Japan would blockade the seas and send troops of "the self-defence forces" to the Korean War. By going ahead with nuclear armament, the Japanese reactionaries are digging their own grave.
