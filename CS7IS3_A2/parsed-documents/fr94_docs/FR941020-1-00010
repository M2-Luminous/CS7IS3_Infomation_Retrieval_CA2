FR941020-1-00010 FR941020-1-00002 The regulations at 7 CFR 273.8(d) already exclude jointly-owned resources that can be shown to be inaccessible. An example is a bank account that is jointly-owned by food stamp applicant household and non-household members which, by State law, is determined to be inaccessible wholly or in part to the food stamp household. Also, certain types of property are excluded from consideration as a resource including property that the household is making a good faith effort to sell (7 CFR 273.8(e)(8)). The Department believes that the amendments to Section 5(g)(5) of the Act were not intended to supplant the existing regulations on inaccessible resources. Rather, these amendments were intended to provide an additional exclusion for resources such as heir property or other property which is unlikely to produce a significant return or significant funds for the support of the household. In Section 1719 of the Leland Act, Congress required that household resources unlikely to be sold for any significant return because the household's interest is relatively slight or because the cost of selling the household's interest would be relatively great be excluded from income for Food Stamp eligibility purposes. The legislative history of this provision did not provide any further guidance as to how this was to be implemented. The floor debate indicated that it would not be necessary for State agencies to determine the exact fair market value for a resource for such resource to be considered inaccessible. Cong. Rec. H11862, October 23, 1990, remarks of Congressman Hatcher. The 1991 Technical Amendments added to the Leland Act provision the requirement that a resource be excluded as inaccessible if its sale or other disposition is unlikely to produce any significant amount of funds for the support of the household. The legislative history of this provision also did not provide any definitive guidance as to what Congress intended by ``any significant return''. The floor debates indicated that the term was to include ``any significant amount of money to buy food for the household'' and that ``[N]o arbitrary sale price of percent-of-value test may be imposed.'' Cong. Rec. S18326, November 26, 1991, remarks of Senator Leahy. The Department is proposing to define ``any significant return'' as being one half the resource limit for the household. The Department believes that some value above which the resource must be sold must be established for uniform administration of the program. The Act requires that the standards of eligibility be uniform for all participants, 7 USC 2014(b), and provides that the Secretary shall issue such regulations, consistent with the terms of the Act, that the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate for the effective and efficient administration of the Food Stamp Program. 7 USC 2013(c). Given this, and the lack of clarity of the statute and legislative history, the Department believes that it is reasonable to establish ``significant return'' or ``significant funds'' to mean one half of the household resource limit.
