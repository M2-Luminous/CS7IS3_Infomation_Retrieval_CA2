Group member Fedor Shelov-Kovedyaev told journalists that, according to the statement, there are at least two wings in the government, one of which, according to the lawmaker, "rests on laurels and feels well at the expense of the other". The pragmatic wing parasitizes on reform-minded cabinet members, shifting onto them responsibility for all actions by the government, he continued. Shelov-Kovedyaev said that the group's statement will be soon made public and, according to the legislator, will give a helping hand to Gaydar. Shelov-Kovedyaev said that "according to the latest information, Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin is interested in continuing negotiations" on this issue. Replying to ITAR-TASS, another group member, Gennadiy Burbulis, former secretary of state, said: "I believe that everything will be clear within the next two days. Then, it will be possible to draw conclusions and make comments. It is too early now to say anything".
