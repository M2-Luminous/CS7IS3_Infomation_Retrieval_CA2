First, it should be recalled that the term `peaceful evolution' came into existence in 1949 when it was first used by the Americans. The strategy has come to be a trick of imperialism aimed at eradicating socialism. Shrouded with a complex history, it has gone through many stages and has resorted to various essential tricks such as creating counterrevolutionary public opinion and mass media in the ideological domain, making inroads into people's cultural thinking, containing our economic growth, and nurturing reactionary forces they call democratic forces. Peaceful evolution is nothing but a change in the format to conceal the reactionary nature of imperialism. This has been identified and summed up through the following: -- This strategy is conducted to gradually gain influence, defeat socialism, and stamp out the international revolutionary movement by peaceful means instead of violence. -- This war is being waged by soft means such as diplomatic, cultural, ideological, and political activities. Violence will only be used as a last resort. -- The war under the banner of peaceful evolution advocates using mainly direct forces, namely men and means of a rival country, to undermine the rival's internal ranks with outside support to cause a swift crumbing and disintegration. This format has caused the people to be mistaken about a change in the nature of imperialism. -- Basing itself mainly on social relations and on imperialist designs, the peaceful evolution strategy advocates using wise and sophisticated tricks to foment a tremendous self-destruction force from within a rival country in order to lead it to a comprehensive deterioration, internal anarchy, and finally a swift and quiet crumbing about which the imperialists will pretend to be innocent and uninvolved. -- The peaceful evolution strategy bears a global character. It does not have any time and space limits. The tempo and the process of this war develop very slowly. Although this war does not give any feeling of fierceness, the results it produces may be very great. -- The peaceful evolution strategy advocates building and using on-site political forces to set up its base and rally force from within the socialist regime for use as an inside force. In this strategy, the imperialists will play the role of external strike force. When the situation permits, they will resort to military force. Dear comrades and friends: For Vietnam, imperialism and other hostile forces are using the peaceful evolution strategy against our country. With their clear-cut objects and strategies, they attach importance to the ideological and theoretical struggle aimed at eradicating Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought. This is one of their key spearhead moves aimed at infiltrating deep into and effecting a change within the internal ranks and the superstructure of the party and the socialist state; driving our national economy to stray off the socialist orbit course and undergo privatization and liberization in accordance with the market economy format of capitalism; rallying reactionaries from various religions and ethnic minority groups, taking advantage of superstition and divinity to incite the people to demand freedom and human rights in opposition to us. In can be said that hostile forces have openly announced their design to carry out their peaceful evolution strategy against our country and our regime. Lately, the enemy has stepped up activities in various fields to achieve this. The intensity of this war is increasing while its scale has been expanded in various areas -- political, ideological, economic, cultural, artistic, press, religious, racial, scientific, theoretical, and in terms of organizing personnel. The enemy, with the use of many overt, semi-overt, and covert means, is trying to gradually legalize various activities and organizations while seeking ways to establish contact with our people and involve themselves further in sowing division among and undermining our internal ranks from within. Simultaneously, they are striving to rally local reactionary forces and linking these with outside reactionaries. They are resorting to political tricks while attempting to prepare armed rebellions for subversive purposes. It is reported that on the cultural and ideological front, in 1993 the enemy and the reactionaries intensified their sabotage on a larger scale. According to incomplete statistics, there existed 17 more overseas reactionary organizations from among the exiled Vietnamese and an additional three Vietnamese-language radio stations, including Radio Free Asia, and 15 newspapers or magazines. In 1993 alone, they cooperated in launching four major propaganda campaigns against Vietnam in addition to many rallies and demonstrations in a number of countries. They brought to our country thousands of reactionary documents, of which 37 are new. Their activities consist of spreading slanderous charges and incendiary propaganda about democratic liberties, human rights, ethnic, and religious issues. They have distorted incidents in Thua Thien Hue, Ba Ria-Vung Tau, and Son La to sow division among the people. They have increased their efforts to split overseas Vietnamese, establish contact with and draw our overseas cadres, students, and workers, and called for the overthrow of the party and the socialist regime. The enemy's mode of operations is open, brazen, sophisticated, and crafty. Its nature is increasingly dangerous. They are taking advantage of our party's renovation and open-door policy to carry out activities through cooperation, aid, investment. They have been carrying out clandestine activities under the guise of economic cooperation. They are upbeat in asking for the opening of cultural, scientific, and technological information centers and using various conferences and seminars to invite our cadres overseas to sign contracts and buy materials and technologies so as to propagate, influence, establish contact with, and bribe them. Certain enemy organizations also intend to restore old organizations to rally forces to be used as a springboard for sabotage activities launched from the outside. Thus, while the revolution's central tasks of national construction and development are being busily carried out, the tasks of safeguarding the country, regime, and party have also developed in a very urgent manner. A number of incidents involving Vietnam that took place before Tet provided new proof by which our entire party, people, and army can clearly realize their situation and tasks and heighten their vigilance in the struggle against the enemy's schemes and tricks. In 1994 and ensuing years, we must be more profoundly aware that the peaceful evolution strategy is an attempt by hostile forces to eradicate party rule and overthrow the socialist-oriented political regime in our country. This strategy is closely related to the dangers pointed out at the mid-term national party conference: The scourge of corruption and other social evils and being left further behind other countries in the region and the world economically; and the danger of straying from the socialist path if we fail to overcome irregularities in providing guidance on these issues. This is why we have to link the fight against peaceful evolution with efforts to overcome these dangers. It can be said that there is a rather fierce ideological battle taking place between us and hostile forces as a result of the peaceful evolution war. For the time being, we should build and firmly consolidate our socialist ideological battleground if we want all of our party members and the masses to stand firm on the socialist path, Marxisim-Leninism, and Ho Chi Minh Thought; thoroughly understand the party's various viewpoints and its renovation policy; firmly maintain political stability; revamp the people's security network; strengthen universal national defense; and build a steadfast people's army. It should be affirmed that it is the duty of every cadre and combatant and our people to smash peaceful evolution ideologically. To triumph in this tough and complex struggle, we must counter the enemy's attack with the results of our renovation process, with our theoretical research and development of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought, and with our efforts to build a fine lifestyle and ethical quality for ourselves as revolutionaries. We will strive to illuminate the legitimacy, clarity, and straightforwardness of the path toward socialism; our country's inevitable road as well as the law of evolution of history chosen for our nation with clear foresight by our party and Uncle Ho. To counter the enemy's peaceful evolution schemes ideologically, armed forces units must always stress and satisfactorily maintain internal political security, fight against all of the enemy's psychological warfare schemes and tricks, intensify efforts to build clean and steadfast party organizations, and build comprehensively steadfast units. Greater attention must be paid to political and ideological training in view of this new situation so as to improve the political acumen of cadres and soldiers. We must equip them with the correct methodology so they can clearly differentiate nature from phenomena and right from wrong. Cadres and combatants will then have a clear idea of our friends and foes and of the complex socio-political issues now emerging at home and abroad. Various units must formulate plans and measures to provide adequate, correct, and guided information on new developments in those fundamental issues related to the actual socio-political situation at home and abroad that are having an impact on their feelings and emotions, so they can cope with these things correctly. On this basis, they must struggle against the enemy's psychological warfare and efforts to sabotage us psychologically. Various units must also step up the movement to build a new cultural environment; they must struggle against unhealthy lifestyles, preserve our fine customs and traditions, and preserve and develop the character of Uncle Ho's troops in view of the new situation and tasks. Other aspects of the fight against peaceful evolution are not without difficulties. They require us to develop immediate and long-term measures. These consist of: Satisfactorily motivating various strata of the masses -- especially clergy, intellectuals, writers, artists, industrialists, and businessmen -- to keep the enemy from using our means of transportation, post offices, printing houses, and the like for trouble-making and sabotage; consolidating mass organizations; building backbone forces for the political struggle; and paying attention to the tasks of protecting the party, organizations, and party cadres and members. Meanwhile, efforts must be made to detect and eradicate reactionary organizations promptly to maintain political stability, public order, and safety. Dear comrades and friends, it is necessary to understand correctly the nature and fundamental features of the imperialists and the other hostile forces as well as their attempts to carry out their peaceful evolution strategy at the current complex juncture. If we heighten our vigilance and remain dynamic, sensitive, and able to counter the enemy unreservedly and promptly with our blows, the enemy will not be able to hold sway and attain the desired results. Meanwhile, we should not disregard the enemy's strategy. In 1994 and ensuring years, the fight against peaceful evolution is likely to become tougher and fiercer. This requires our entire party, people, and army to be more dynamic and determined to foil the enemy's malicious strategy and firmly preserve the ideal and the path we have chosen.
