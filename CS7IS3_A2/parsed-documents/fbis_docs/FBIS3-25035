That course is being attended by 50 men from both sides. However, what really arrested the attention of those present -- including guests such as UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello, among others -- were the remarks made by Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo, of the Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo, armed forces. After thanking Portugal for its role in the formation of the FADM forces, Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo proceeded to cause controvery when he said that all countries posed a threat to Mozambique. He was referring to the role that the FADM are supposed to play. That Renamo military officer also noted that certain Mozambicans are secretly training troops and hiding weapons, directly accusing General Eduardo Nihia, Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, Party first secretary for Nampula Province, of being involved in the training of 1,000 men. At this point, Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo affirmed that the United Nations has been informed and that a commission (?sent) to investigate the matter had been prevented from working on the ground. Indicating that the United Nations had not done that work, UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello shook his head while Ngonhamo made those remarks. [sentence as heard] Later, Aldo Ajello told journalists that he was unaware of that problem but he added that he will order an investigation if it is indeed true. Subsequently, we interviewed Lieutenant General Tobias Dai, of the Mozambique Armed Forces, who expressed great surprise about those serious accusations by Mateus Ngonhamo. Nonetheless, he said that, should they be true, the government will take note and will try to investigate the matter on the ground. [passage omitted]
