There seem to be no difference in the formation of al-Zulfiqar and its influence, the Punjabi-Pukhtoon Alliance, G. M. Syed and the Sindhi Nationalist Organization, and the formation of the MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement] and Iltaf Hussein's political style. All these organizations play a role in the same drama and are instruments in the hands of the same force. After Murtaza Bhutto's return to Pakistan, it seems that armed terrorism in this country has ended, and political terrorism has started. Dr. Qadir Magsi, leader of Jiye Sindh movement, is talking about establishing law and order in Sindh and getting rid of the robbers after his mysterious release from jail. Murtaza Bhutto, the head of al-Zulfiqar, talked before and after his arrest about ending al-Zulfiqar's activities and of his desire to play the role of a patriotic political leader. Meanwhile, Iltaf Hussein, leader of the MQM, is giving up communal politics and is talking about a united national political movement. It seems that some of these forces are moving the energy of armed terrorists toward political terrorism, in order to show the nation that they have taken away weapons from the terrorists and have included them in the national political mainstream. The one and only purpose for this plan is to continue using their followers in their future political activities, so that our nation is not self-reliant in the political and economic arenas. These forces wanted to maintain their control in the name of establishing law and order. When Benazir Bhutto took power in 1988, there was the possibility of Murtaza Bhutto's return; however, she tried to keep Murtaza Bhutto scared for her own vested interests, and gave the impression to her younger brother that if he put his foot on Pakistan's land, it would mean signing his own death sentence. This way, Benazir Bhutto put in Murtaza Bhutto's mind a fear of intelligence agencies and other top agencies in our country. Thus, he could not dare return home in the past. During this period, Jam-i Sadiq Ali and Mustafa Khan, who are both traitors and were involved in conspiracies against the army, managed to return home, and even to become Cabinet members. A special aspect of the cases against Murtaza Bhutto is the legal loopholes involved in these. According to legal experts, Murtaza Bhutto perhaps will not be punished in any of the cases against him; however, intelligence agencies have proof of Murtaza Bhutto's involvement in terrorism. If these are presented in court, then Murtaza Bhutto will be in serious trouble. However, these agencies may need Murtaza Bhutto's services for some reason, and it would be impossible to present proof of his involvement in terrorism. According to high-level police officials, there are 72 witnesses listed in connection with the case registered in Ferozabad, but 15 years have passed, and some of these witnesses have died. Others have retired, and some of them will not be willing to testify against the brother of the prime minister. It is feared that Murtaza Bhutto will win in the legal wars, because in Pakistan witnesses and proof are very important in criminal cases. The most important fact is that the judge of the special court where the case against Murtaza Bhutto is registered has been transferred. He was a former judge in the Sindh High Court. How and when was al-Zulfiqar established? PPP [Pakistan People's Party] supporters and opponents have different opinions about it. When the late Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto fell from power and was arrested on 16 September 1977 at Larkana, he, after a decision in the case against him for murdering Nawab Mohammed Ahmed Khan, understood the seriousness of the situation and sent both his sons--Mir Murtaza Bhutto and Shah Nawaz Bhutto--abroad. In the end Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was sentenced to be hanged. General Zia rejected even his last appeal for mercy. On that day, Murtaza Bhutto decided to establish al-Zulfiqar and declare General Ziaul Haq his target. Among the targets of al-Zulfiqar there are many VIPs, as well as prominent politicians, judges, and high-level civil and military officers. The first target of the al-Zulfiqar was the hijacking of the PIA [Pakistan International Airlines] Boeing PK 326 on 2 March 1981. This plane was going to Peshawar with 148 passengers in it, including three women. This plane was hijacked to Kabul. When the hijackers sent their demands to the government of Pakistan, it was learned that they were members of the al-Zulfiqar terrorist organization, whose leader was Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's son, Murtaza Bhutto. This plane was in the hijackers' control for 13 days, and 54 persons were released from jail, as per the demands of the hijackers, and sent to Damascus. There were only three hijackers. These included Salam Allah Tipu, Nasir Jamal, and Arshad Ali. In an interview with international media, Murtaza Bhutto admitted that Salam Allah Tipu was his man. Murtaza Bhutto was in continued contact with the hijackers, who were following his instructions. Hijacker Tipu, at Murtaza's instruction, shot Major Tariq Rahim in the neck at Murtaza Bhutto's command and threw his body out of the airplane onto the runway. He later sent a message to the control tower to pick up Tariq Rahim's body. An important member of the hijacked plane's crew said that he still trembles when thinking about this hijacking incident. He also said that it seemed that the Kabul government was supporting the hijackers fully. Otherwise, it would not have been possible to have control of the hijackers for such a long time. The PIA hijacking was registered as FIR 211-81 on 2 March 1981 under 120-B, 364,302,109 PPC at Crime Circle I. In this case, Malik Ayub, son of PPI Manager Malik Ghulam Sarwar; Saif Allah Khalid; Isa Baloch; and Nasir Baloch were arrested while Salam Allah Tipu, Nasir Jamal, Arshad Ali, Murtaza Bhutto, and Shah Nawaz Bhutto were declared absconding. The four persons listed above were given death sentences, which were later changed to 25 years of hard labor after their appeals. Later, Malik Ayub's father, Sarwar, and Saif Allah's father, Mohammed Ali Johar, managed to contact Ziaul Haq. They managed to get a pardon from him. However, Nasir Baloch refused to ask for any kind of pardon, and he was sentenced to be hanged. The notorious al-Zulfiqar terrorists, Salam Allah Tipu and Nasir Jamal, and Arshad Ali were accused of murdering a Jamia Karachi student and member of Islamic Jamiat-i tulba, Hafiz Mohammed Aslam, six days before they hijacked the plane. This report was registered under FIR 47-8, Explosion Act, case number 302-34 PPC 3-5, at Gulshan Iqbal Police Station. Tipu himself has admitted to murdering Aslam while talking from the control tower. The same day (26 February 1991), these three people were also involved in a robbery in the Bahadarabad region. This robbery was reported under FIR 35-81 as case number 17 (3) (EHO) at the Bahadarabad Police Station. The terrorists of al-Zulfiqar also robbed a showroom on University Road in New Town on 13 November 1980. Saif Allah Khalid, Hanif Patel, Mohammed Tariq Cheena, and Salam Allah Tipu were all involved. This was registered in the New Town Police Station as case number 17 (3) (EHO), under FIR 43-80. On 19 March 1981, the New Town police arrested Saif Allah Khalid at Crescent Motors on University Road and registered case number FIR 81-54 under 307-33-34 PPC. On 30 November 1980, Saif Allah Khalid, Hanif Patel, and Salam Allah Tipu were involved in a robbery and theft of a government rifle, and the case was registered under 17 (3) (EHO), case number FIR 534-80. They were arrested and were sentenced in a military court. Similarly, a sub-machine gun with 60 cartridges was recovered from another al-Zulfiqar terrorist, named Islamuddin, on 24 April 1982. This case was registered as FIR 222-82, under Article 13D, at the Liaqatabad Police Station. On 20 November 1981, the police received information about a flat in the federal capital area, stating that some al-Zulfiqar terrorists were hiding there. The police raided the flat the terrorists fired at the police resulting in the death of one police officer, Aslam Kiani, and one terrorist, Lala Asad. Rukhshar Qureshi was arrested. This case was registered as 568/81 under 302/224/225/218 Penal Codes at the Liaqatabad Police Station. Later, these terrorists were sentenced in the Military Court. On 14 November 1980, al-Zulfiqar terrorists Saif Allah Khalid, Salam Allah Tipu, Nasir Jamal, Arshad Ali, and Hanif Patel seized a government car, tag number GT 1877, from one Dr. Yusuf, and used it in a robbery incident. The case was registered as FIR 125/80 under 17 (3) (EHO) Penal Code at the Gulshan Iqbal Police Station. Accused Saif Allah Khalid and hijacker Arshad Ali joined Lala Asad and Lala Aslam in robbing a showroom at gunpoint on Sharah Qaideen on 14 February 1981. This case was registered as 59/81 under 17 (3) (EHO) Penal Code at the Ferozabad Police Station. Murtaza Bhutto has also admitted to murdering Zahurulhasan Bhopali. Ayaz Samon, Ilias Saddiqi, and Javed Malik were also involved in this murder. Ayaz Samon was later hanged, while Ilias Saddiqi was killed on site by his friend's bullets. This case was registered at the Ferozabad Police Station. The police personnel at Brigade arrested an important PPP leader, Masrur Ahsan, and recovered proof of anti-national activities from his person. Another al-Zulfiqar terrorist, Aftab Ahmed Meman, was arrested by the Gulbarg police, and weapons were recovered from him. He admitted before a magistrate that he was a member of al-Zulfiqar, and that he was given the responsibility of assassinating an important person. He said that he was arrested before he could do his job. This case was registered at the Gulbarg Police Station as FIR 330/81, under 13 D Penal Code. Another al-Zulfiqar terrorist, Ghulam Mustafa, was arrested by Quetta's Crime Branch Police at the border when he entered Pakistan from Afghanistan. He was presented before a magistrate first class, where he admitted that he was an active member of al-Zulfiqar and had returned after involvement in some subversive activities in Kabul. The story of al-Zulfiqar's terrorist activity is very long and scary. Now that the leader of this terrorist organization has returned to Pakistan, the government and other forces should make sure that these terrorists are punished, and that they do not find ways to avoid punishment. The details of the terrorist activities of al-Zulfiqar given above were gleaned from a report at the Ferozabad Police Station. Murtaza Bhutto has admitted to more than one terrorist act staged by his organization, al-Zulfiqar. It was learned after the arrests of most of the members of his organization that Murtaza Bhutto used to come to Delhi to attend the oath-taking ceremony of his members after they had finished training. Murtaza Bhutto, after the airplane accident in which General Ziaul Haq was killed, admitted in an interview with international news media that he had attacked Ziaul Haq six times, all without success.
