A complaint was lodged yesterday by the Cordoba FUNAM (Foundation for the Protection of the Environment) ecological group in conjunction with a fellow British group which said the woods, in the region of Moreno in the northeast of Santiago del Estero, would be in grave danger if no action was taken by the government to shelve the plans. The British company, currently assessing the cost of the project, hopes to market the quebracho with the brandname "AAA Hardwood." The work would be carried out in conjunction with the local Australian Argentine Agricultural (AAA) group. "The project will be promoted by an ecological lobby as if it had come from a forest which had been exploited rationally," FUNAM President Raul Montenegro said. "In other words they will try to fabricate a green image." The British company's plans, leaked to FUNAM last month, estimate that once work gets under way in Santiago del Estero, the company will be in a position to produce some 3.6 million metres of parquet, 13,901 tons of charcoal, and 30,000 tons of other fuel. A probe into the affair has also discovered that a leading bank in the Federal Capital has offered to put up capital in order to fund the project. Santiago del Estero forestry commission representatives have said they will fight the plans although they have not yet received precise details of the British company's intentions. Meanwhile the national government has made no comments on the case. The forests under threat are considered the most important of their type in Argentina.
