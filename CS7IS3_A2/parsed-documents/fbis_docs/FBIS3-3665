The authorities have also acknowledged a ban on the latest edition of the United States news magazine Newsweek. Witnesses said the demonstrators in the square scattered leaflets as a group of delegates to parliament passed by. The content of the leaflets was not known. Police grabbed the camera of an AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE photographer who had taken pictures of the protest and opened it to expose the film. The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that two Chinese women "were stopped by other citizens for disturbing public order this morning". The statement quoted by the XINHUA News Agency said: "It was improper for foreign journalists to cover news in China without going through necessary formalities." In a related incident, dissident Gao Hongmin, who had planned to distribute an open statement to the national legislature, was picked up by security officers at the Jianguomenwai foreigners' compound after visiting the offices of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. On the ban on the latest edition of NEWSWEEK, a spokesman for the government body that controls the import of periodicals would only say there was an unspecified "problem" with the issue. The cover of the current Asian edition is entitled "China's Angry Voices" and features prominent dissident Wei Jingsheng. The edition contains two highly critical stories. The more controversial one covers the crackdown on growing political dissent in China during last week's visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The other article questions the ability of the central government to control the economy and highlights corruption and social problems. Subscriber copies of NEWSWEEK continued to arrive through the mail.
