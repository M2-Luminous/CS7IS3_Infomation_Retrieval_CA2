The latest 600 billion peso cut in government spending proves the inflation issue has pushed Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes to a point of desperation. A few days ago, he made a most shocking announcement: loans will be restricted. Moreover, Hommes plans to ask the agriculture minister to halt food imports, and he insists that inflation this year will be 19 percent -- despite evidence to the contrary -- because it is currently nearly 10 percent and unemployment is up to 10.3 percent. Furthermore, the planning sector, which had estimated economic growth at 5 percent this year, now estimates that it will be no more than 3 percent. Meanwhile, despite the implementation of preventive measures, dollars continue to flow freely into the country.

They say the restrictions primarily hurt the construction sector and savings and housing corporations. National Association of Financial Institutions says many approved loans cannot be paid out because of the measure, adding that if it is maintained the financial institutions will be virtually paralyzed by June.

In the country's seven largest cities, unemployment increased from 9.6 percent in March 1993 to 10.3 percent in March 1994. During that same period, jobs increased by only 1.2 percent, down from 3.6 percent from the previous year.

The beneficiaries of this decision must make a 25 percent downpayment and will have 10 years and a three-year grace period to pay off their debt. The refinancing, which eases tension between the coffee growers and government, will be covered by 180 billion pesos set aside for this purpose.
