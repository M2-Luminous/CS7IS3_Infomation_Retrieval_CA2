Father Yvon Massac opposes the arrival of this tanker in Haiti, as it is tangible proof of the hypocrisy of the international community in the Haitian crisis. Father Massac deems the mobilization "iron cuts iron" launched by President Aristide necessary in order to prevent the deterioration of the country's situation. [Begin Massac recording, in Creole] The hypocritical moral standards of the international community want to paralyze Aristide by advocating the ideal of nonviolence, an ideal which is making him shirk his responsibilities as head of state. The country's constitution gives the president the duty of ensuring the good functioning of the state, of having all citizens enjoy justice, safety, and the rights conferred on them by the country's fundamental law. The president must create the necessary conditions so the institutions can function. The international community is making hypocritical statements. They are setting traps under the cover of humanitarian aid while people are dying. Can the president continue to stand aside while his people are being pulled down in Haiti? No! Self-defense must be organized. The president and the Haitians in the 10th department [abroad] must set up a force in the field so as to prevent the criminals from doing what they want with people. [end recording] This was Father Yvon Massac, Fermathe parish priest.
