During the legal time limit, the defendants did not appeal to the higher court, and the procuratorial organs did not disagree with the court's judgments. Accordingly, the verdicts became effective on 19 February. Criminal Ma Liesun was the vice chairman of the Ningxia Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee before he was arrested. Criminal Ma Fuli was an associate professor at the Ningxia Education College and criminal Ma Jie was a lecturer at the Northwest No 2 Nationalities Institute before their arrests. Criminal Ma Rucheng was a peasant in Xiazhai Township of Xiji County before he was arrested. Since May 1992, Ma Liesun, Ma Rucheng, Ma Fuli, Ma Jie, joined others in repeatedly organizing gang fights and revenge attacks in Xiji County of Ningxia despite repeated warnings from the party and government. They trampled upon state laws and ignored the safety of the people. As a result, 49 people died, two disappeared, and 30 were wounded. To prepare for the gang fights, they unlawfully manufactured and bought guns and ammunition. After the fights, a total of 5,442 guns (of which 2 were for military use), 7,362 bullets of various kinds (of which 310 were for military use), 21 privately made cannons, and 118 privately made shells and bombs were confiscated from the two sides involved in the dispute. The evidence mentioned above was sufficient and proven, and the defendants pleaded guilty. The acts of these criminals seriously violated Articles 137, 132, and 112 of the "Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China," and constituted the crimes of murder with intent and the illegal manufacture and purchase of guns and ammunition. To safeguard the authority of the law and to protect the safety of the people's lives and property, Ma Liesun was punished according to the law for murder with intent and the illegal manufacture and purchase of guns and ammunition in plotting armed gang fights, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, and was deprived of his political rights for four years. Ma Fuli was punished for murder with intent and the illegal manufacture and purchase of guns and ammunition in plotting, organizing, and commanding armed gang fights, was sentenced to life imprisonment, and was deprived of his political rights for life.
