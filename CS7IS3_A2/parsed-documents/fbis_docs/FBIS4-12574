The session was started with a reading from the Opening Chapter of the Koran to evoke God's mercy on the souls of those who are nobler than all of us, namely, Iraq's righteous martyrs, who sacrificed their lives in defense of the nation's honor and dignity. Then, Assembly Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih delivered a speech reviewing the current Arab and international state of affairs in light of the U.S.-Atlantic-Zionist conspiracy that is targeting the Iraqi territories, people, and civilization. He said: What the United States is doing against the Iraqi people (?does not) reflect an arbitrary policy. Rather, this anti-Iraq U.S. conduct is the manifestation of an ingrained and deep-seated malice dwelling within the psyches of Zionist occupiers. The National Assembly speaker urged Iraqis to double their efforts and make further sacrifices to thwart the imperialist conspiracy, which is targeting our homeland and nation. He added: We must be at the forefront of those advocating harmony, unity, solidarity, and affection so that we may bring about an awareness of the importance of unity, patriotism, and loyalty to the nation, whose values we must uphold. Afterward, the Assembly members listened to a detailed report read out by Deputy Assembly Speaker Ghanim 'Aziz. The report addressed the activities recently carried out by the permanent Assembly committees in the political, parliamentary, economic, social, legal, health, service, and trade spheres.
