FR940516-1-00128 FR940516-1-00008 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 20 [GN Docket No. 94&hyph;33, FCC 94&hyph;101] Further Forbearance From Title II Regulation for Certain Types of Commercial Mobile Radio Service Providers AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Notice of proposed rule making. SUMMARY: This notice of proposed rule making (Notice) solicits comment on whether, within particular services classified as Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS), there may be types of providers that merit forbearance from certain requirements found in Title II of the Communications Act. Specifically, the Commission asks whether we should forbear from enforcing those provisions of Title II that we determined did not merit general forbearance in our Second Report and Order in Gen. Docket No. 93&hyph;252. If the further forbearance is warranted, the Commission asks how we should determine which types of CMRS providers should be excused from remaining Title II requirements and how we should implement and enforce such forbearance provisions. DATES: Comments are due by June 27, 1994 and reply comments are due by July 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gina Harrison or Susan McNeil, Private Radio Bureau, Land Mobile and Microwave Division, (202) 632&hyph;7792 and 634&hyph;2443, respectively, or Peter Batacan, Common Carrier Bureau, Tariff Division (202) 632&hyph;6917.

The full text of Commission decisions are available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Docket Branch (room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC.

Synopsis of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making 1. In the Second Report and Order in General Docket No. 93&hyph;252, 59 FR 18493 (Apr. 19, 1994) the Commission elected, pursuant to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act), to forbear from applying Sections 203, 204, 205, 211, 212, and 214 of Title II of the Communications Act to any service classified as CMRS. The Commission determined that the remaining sections of Title II should be enforced with respect to CMRS providers in order to promote competition or to protect consumers, and that this decision would not place any undue burden on any CMRS provider or class of providers. Nevertheless, the Commission also announced that it would consider additional relief in a future rule making that would gather a more extensive record on the potential effect of the remaining sections of Title II on particular types of CMRS providers within each class of service. The purpose of this Notice is to initiate that rule making.
