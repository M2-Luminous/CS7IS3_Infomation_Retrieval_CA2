[A related item from the same "First News" section adds: "Ministerial quarters have expressed puzzlement over the insistence of U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley in his private discussions that Israel had nothing to do with the bombing in Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il, a position that conflicts with the evidence accumulated by the security organs and judiciary."]
