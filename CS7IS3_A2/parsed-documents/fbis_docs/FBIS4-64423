Kinkel will fly to Pretoria for the inauguration next Tuesday. Kinkel expressed his respect and appreciation for outgoing President Frederik de Klerk. It is not surprising that the elections did "not" take place "without some organizational problems." The important thing is the impression gained by the international observers that the elections were "generally free and fair." The new South Africa can count on German solidarity and "energetic support." The Social Democratic Party Executive Committee also expressed appreciation for De Klerk and congratulations to Mandela. In a statement published on Tuesday the Executive Committee stressed the trust placed in Mandela, who will take away fear and concern from the South Africans of different colors by implementing the announced policy of reconciliation. German industry, which worked also during the UN sanctions in South Africa, is now particularly called upon to help.
