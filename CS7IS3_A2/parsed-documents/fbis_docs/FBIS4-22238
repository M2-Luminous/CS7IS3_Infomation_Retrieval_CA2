Many issues of organizing state defense and the functioning of defense institutions are not regulated by present laws. The new law is intended to fill this vacuum. According to the new law service in the defense forces is compulsory for all male citizens of the Republic of Estonia (foreign citizens and non-citizens are not conscripted to the Estonian army). Active military service from eight to 12 months (the precise term is set by the government regarding the kind of troops and the tasks of a military subdivision) is required of young men from the ages of 19 to 27. Those who have finished active service are entered into reserve and in the future can be conscripted to military training. Volunteers can start their service at the age of 17. The law also provides for alternative service for those, who due to ideological or religious reasons, do not want to take weapons in their hands. This kind of service is organized by military units and lasts from nine to 15 months. Due to some family or other serious circumstances service can be interrupted for a period of up to six months. Persons who have finished the service can continue service on a contract. Women from the age of 19 to 40 can also serve in the army on a contract basis. During discussion of the draft law the maximum age for conscription was reduced from 30 to 28 years after the proposal of the Liberal faction. Secondly, the opposition factions achieved reduction of the maximum term of service from 18 to 12 months. However, the Royalist faction's proposal to free people with advanced degrees from military service did not receive the necessary support. During the Soviet period they were not conscripted to active service although they had to cover military education in special military departments in the universities. Defense Minister Indrek Kannik also has not served in the army because of this stipulation. Deputies of the ruling coalition had the opinion that the army should not consist just of "workers and farmers," university graduates are also supposed to serve. However, they have the right to choose training to become reserve officers instead of the usual service. The law also sets the order for conscription into the reserves and the order of financing expenses connected with supplies for general military service. Persons involved in the military service are forbidden to participate in the activities of political parties, political meetings, and demonstrations.
