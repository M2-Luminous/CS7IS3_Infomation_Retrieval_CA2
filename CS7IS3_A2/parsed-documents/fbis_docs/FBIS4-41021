The deputy minister described the agreement as the beginning of Ukraine's integration in the united Europe. He said, in particular, that for Ukraine the most important part of the document is the political part, which confirms the EU's interest in Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. Regarding purely economic issues, Oleksandr Makarenko said, the agreement envisages the withdrawal of any restrictions on trade between Ukraine and EU member states. He said, however, that although Europe, by this agreement, has opened its doors, the speed of our integration will depend on the speed of our reforms.
