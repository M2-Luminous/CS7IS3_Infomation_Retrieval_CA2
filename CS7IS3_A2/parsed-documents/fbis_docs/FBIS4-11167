Yesterday [18 April], opposition leader H. Eman said that he was prepared to look into the possibility of working together with the MEP [People's Electoral Movement] of Prime Minister N. Oduber. On Sunday evening [17 April], Oduber let it be known that his second cabinet has fallen and that he now intended to lose no time in exploring the possibility of forming a broad coalition with AVP [Aruban People's Party] leader Eman. Oduber said that he no longer had any confidence in his two small coalition partners, the PPA [Aruban Patriotic Party] and ADN [National Democratic Union], each of which had one seat in the parliament. The second Oduber cabinet, which only had the support of 11 out of 21 seats in parliament, lasted for approximately one year. Together, the MEP and AVP have 18 seats. In a telephone conversation with NRC HANDELSBLAD, Eman said he was demanding early elections as a precondition for any possible cooperation with Oduber. A broad coalition between the two major parties that rode out the entire parliamentary session until the elections in 1997 was, he considered, a "station we have already passed." [passage omitted] On Sunday, however, the cabinet crumbled. Differences of opinion regarding financial and economic policy and especially a severe round of cuts for the government were the cause. Political observers in Oranjestad believe that the reason for the cabinet crisis was a row about the dismissal of the director of a housing association, aggravated by the subsequent nomination to that position of a future son-in-law of ADN Parliamentarian Charo Kelly. If the social plan of his AVP is implemented for the main part, then after early elections opposition leader Eman could bear the responsibility of government together with the MEP. The main thrust of the social plan involves the more honest distribution of income in Aruba, "the richest country in the Caribbean region." According to the plan, the payments made to pensioners and the recipients of benefits had to be increased. [passage omitted] "If a provisional crisis cabinet is formed, then the AVP will prove flexible," said Eman, who is not demanding the premiership although his party is slightly larger in terms of the number of votes than that led by Oduber. "That will only become an issue when the Aruban electorate has once again voted and we know how the division of power looks," he said. On Sunday evening [17 April], Oduber regretted that his second cabinet had made such little progress with financial and administrative reorganization. "The present coalition has never known peace and stability; there has always been a lack of cooperation." Previously, he had criticized the "patronage policy" of the small parties, i.e., the appointment of friends to governmental or semi-governmental posts. "We have made mistakes and they must be rectified," he said in November, in an interview with NRC HANDELSBLAD. "Too many officials have been appointed and too much tax liability has been imposed in too short a time."
