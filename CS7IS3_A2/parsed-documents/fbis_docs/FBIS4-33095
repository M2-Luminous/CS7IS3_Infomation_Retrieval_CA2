During his speech, the under secretary explained that the trade agreement will encourage investment and generate better paying jobs for Mexicans. The agreement, he said, will be particularly attractive to small- and medium-sized businesses. When members of the Senate Trade Committee asked him about the current state of trade between Mexico and the United States, Herminio Blanco reported that Mexican exports to the United States totaled $4.2 billion and that Mexico's trade balance deficit is $83 million. Herminio Blanco described this as a fairly well-balanced bilateral trade relationship. The under secretary admitted that there are still a number of problems that need to be addressed. [Begin Blanco recording] Obviously, paperwork and bureaucracy are always a problem because they reduce competitiveness. We have fought against this throughout the Salinas administration, but there is still plenty of work to do. In terms of the trade issue along the border, I must say there has been progress. There has been progress, and I am sure we can advance even further to allow border retailers to successfully compete against the large commercial chains on the other side of the border. [end recording] He concluded by saying that Mexico cannot limit itself to trade with its North American partners. He announced that in addition to the free trade agreement signed with Costa Rica, other agreements will be signed in June with Colombia and Venezuela, and that Mexico is currently involved in negotiations with Bolivia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. This will give us access the entire Central American market with its 30 million inhabitants and $7.8 billion in total imports.
