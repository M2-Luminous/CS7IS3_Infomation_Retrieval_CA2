ACTION: Extension of comment period. SUMMARY: EPA is extending the comment period for a proposed rule under section 5 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), to screen microorganisms before they are introduced into commerce. The proposed rule is designed to prevent unreasonable risk to human health and the environment without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on the biotechnology industry. The proposed regulation describes notification procedures and microorganisms that would be exempt from notification. DATES: Written comments on the proposed rule should be submitted to EPA by December 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on issues concerning the proposed rule should bear the docket control number OPPTS&hyph;00049C, and should be submitted to: TSCA Public Docket Office (7407), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of September 1, 1994 (59 FR 45526), EPA issued a proposed rule under section 5 of TSCA, TSCA authorizes EPA to regulate any chemical substance, except for certain substances covered by other Federal agencies. The Act defines chemical substance broadly enough to cover microorganisms. TSCA section 5 establishes a 90-day process for EPA to screen certain chemical substances before they are produced. Section 5(a) allows EPA to require submission of a notification for microorganisms that are considered ``new'' chemical substances and those that will be made for a ``significant new use.'' Section 5(h) provides for certain exemptions from the 90-day screening process. In the proposed rule, a 60-day comment period was provided. In response to requests by interested parties, EPA is extending the comment period on its proposed rule by 60 days. Comments must now be received by December 31, 1994. As part of an interagency ``streamlining'' initiative, EPA is making this proposed rule and certain support documents available electronically. They may be accessed through the Internet at: gopher.epa.gov. EPA is very interested in learning whether persons have obtained these documents electronically and what their experiences were in doing so. Persons who comment on this proposed rule are encouraged to provide feedback on this electronic availability with their comments. To obtain further information or to provide feedback on the electronic availability of these documents, please contact Juanita Geer (Telephone: 202&hyph;260&hyph;1532; FAX: 202&hyph;260&hyph;1657; Internet: geer.juanita@epamail.epa.gov). Please be advised that Ms. Geer will accept only feedback on the electronic availability of these documents; all comments on the substance of the proposed rule must be submitted to the docket above.
