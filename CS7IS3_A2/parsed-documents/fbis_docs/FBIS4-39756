The conference opened in the State Palace of the Moscow Kremlin. President Yeltsin is attending its sittings. Soskovets said Yeltsin signed a decree on housing loans, a decree on construction certificates and a decree on the sale of, and commercial investment in, unfinished construction projects. According to Soskovets, the national budget revenue in the first five months of 1994 fell 5.2 trillion rubles short of its target. He felt economic recovery depended, in great measure, on investment in housing construction. He said the government must offer private entrepreneurs reliable, including state, guarantees for investment in that field. A second packet of legislation on more economic reform is in the making and legal moves are being made to reduce, as of 1996, basic, including profit and value added, taxes by 10 to 20 percent, Soskovets said. The government, he said, also intends to hold tenders among those wishing to sell products to the state and intends to sell part of unfinished construction projects to private entrepreneurs in a bid to lure more private investment into the industry.
