In recent days the group has circulated pamphlets denouncing the high commands and demanding greater attention to military requirements. He said that the organization, which is apparently made up mainly of midranking officers and noncoms, has been operating for some time, despite which the direct superiors have been unable to identify its members, who in many instances have been denouncing a series of alleged irregularities in the running of the military. "`Vivid Red' is an underground group in the Armed Forces. Unfortunately, we have not been able to discover anything about these pamphlets that are coming out periodically. There could be two or three people, but they cannot be identified, inasmuch as a single person could put out a series of anonymous pamphlets," the chief of staff of the high command asserted. He attributed its existence to the heterogeneous makeup of the Armed Forces and to the discontent among some of its members. "Ours is a large institution. Not everybody can be in agreement with the things that happen in any command or any unit," General Shriqui said, adding that "they have to be military personnel because they are very well informed about the things that are going on." Commander in Chief When asked about the same issue, the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, General Fernando Sanjines, indicated that because of the annoyance that the pamphlets circulating periodically are causing among servicemen, Department II of military intelligence is investigating the matter. "We are doing the appropriate follow-up," he said, noting that "they are anonymous, and we should not attach importance to an insignificant issue." Defense Minister Antonio Cespedes made a similar remark, asserting that "the only thing I am familiar with is the pamphlet that I read once, but I do not attach any importance to it and it should not be taken into account."
