All sorts of agreements have been reached, which are said to be provisional, still going to be checked with their principals. [passage omitted] It was said throughout the day that the two leaders were smiling and holding each other's hand as if promising South Africa something that they could be proud of -- smiling about. I'm being joined now in the studio by Mr. Jacob Zuma, Deputy Secretary General of the ANC, and the national chairman of the IFP, Dr. Mdlalose. Gentlemen, good evening and welcome. The progress -- what sort progress are we talking about here if you look at this statement, Dr. Mdlalose? [Mdlalose] Well, I think there's progress. First, I think the spirit in which the leaders discussed, the spirit in which the delegations intermingled and discussed was very, very promising; it was really good. And when we came to the actual substance of things that we went into, there was no skirting of issues. Issues were dealt with straight on, and people spoke honestly, and they spoke from their hearts but through their brains. They were not emotional; they were being realistic. And I think a lot of progress came out. [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, how would you describe the kind of progress we are talking about here, constructive or satisfactory? [Zuma] I think it was both, more constructive in a sense because both delegations approached the matters in a very serious manner with all the determination to find a solution. And I think that issues were discussed very frankly, and I think both delegations realized the responsibility that the two organizations have in connection with trying to solve the problems of the country, trying to deal with matters of violence, and I think what has been reflected in the statement as the kind of understanding in a joint statement actually reflects I think in a very exceptional manner a kind of....[pauses] The two delegations sat down and said we need to find a solution. A kind of a delegation that said we are not sitting here now to find a solution now, we said we are making a solid foundation so that this meeting is not going to be a one-off meeting, is actually the beginning of a process that is going to move now and, if needed, to go beyond the 27th of April. I thought that was quite a realistic approach that both delegations realized and indeed were determined to continue as much as possible -- in search for the solution. [Mashokwe] Gentlemen, let us now leave out the diplomatic issues and tell South Africans the real story. When you say you are out to promote conditions in which people of South Africa as a whole could exercise their democratic right and to make political choices in accordance with their beliefs and consciousness, what exactly do you mean? You're saying the ANC can put up boards and advertise in Ulundi, open an office there. Can the ANC also reciprocate in the same way? What exactly do you mean? [Mdlalose] But that's exactly what we mean, Lesley. We mean that people should be free to give their own philosophies to the public. People should be free to advocate for participation in elections if they want to and to promote their own philosophies. But equally, we think people must be free to be able to say why they may not be wanting to participate if they do not want to participate. That freedom should be there for everybody and they should be able to say it whether at Ulundi, or around Shell House, or wherever, without any fear. [Mashokwe] Are you saying to your followers out there that they must from tomorrow allow the ANC in your areas and in the same vein the ANC remove their no-go areas wherever they may be? [Mdlalose] Our party has been saying that all the time, and we want to redouble our efforts to let the people know that is what we stand for. [Mashokwe] No-go areas, Mr. Zuma, within the ANC? [Zuma] What we've been saying Lesley, is that in the period running up to where we are, we've had a situation where perceptions have been created that if political players are saying we are not participating in the elections, it means that those who are participating must be stopped from doing so, and those who are not participating must also not be given a chance to canvas their own views among the people on the reasons why they are not participating. What this meeting has said -- which I think is important -- it has underlined an important principle of democracy that people have a right to choose whether to participate or not to participate. But those who are participating don't have a right to prevent others to choose not to participate. And we are saying the question of no-go areas therefore must go. People must be able to reach any part of this country, in this province, and promote any of these two views, that we see as opposing views. And this is what we've said. We've said it doesn't necessarily mean that people must slaughter one another simply because they've got two political different views. And I think it is an important kind of an achievement that we made in this meeting. [Mashokwe] But what the leaders say and what happens at the ground are two different things. You've been professing freedom of political expression on both sides, yet on the ground IFP supporters will not allow ANC supporters to politic in their areas and vice versa. How do you get the message down to the ground. [Mdlalose] Well, as we've said earlier, we are going to redouble our efforts to get to the ground. We are preaching even as I'm talking to you now, preaching through the TV that people are watching. They have to be tolerant one to the other. Whether you belong to ANC, IFP, Azapo [Azanian People's Organization], PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], whatever, you must be able to listen to the other man and say he's entitled to explain his views to everybody around here. That is the message we're carrying on to the people wherever we are going to be. [Mashokwe] It is evident that there are still differences on constitutional matters between the two parties here. There was talk about possible intervention by the international constitutional experts. What exactly gives? How are you going to unbundle this mess? [Mdlalose] Thank you for asking that. First of all, we have discussed this and we've thought of an option that is before us -- to consult with international organizations and get them perhaps to help us to see through this impasse which we've reached. We have not reached unanimity on that point. The ANC people are going to discuss it among themselves. We'll also discuss it more fully among ourselves and be able next time we meet to come up with definite ideas about how we must approach this subject. [Mashokwe] On that question of calling in international experts, Mr. Zuma? [Zuma] We've certainly agreed that we need to take these two points to our principals: one, the issue that is being raised of the involvement of the international community at two levels. One level is at the level of violence -- in other words, to seek to reach the international community, an organization with the expertise of conflict resolution as well as the aspect of the deadlock on constitutional matters. And we've said we will take these matters to our principals to be considered and come back after that consideration to say how our principals look at those matters, and equally the IFP has felt, as a result of that kind of a discussion, there could be a provisional registration of the IFP in terms of the Electoral Act so that if agreement is reached, they are in a position to find it to participate. I think all of that indicates or gives you the chemistry of the discussions today that we were able to reach that point and have this kind of particular aspect to be referred to our principals. [Mashokwe] I want to come back to this issue of provisional registration later after the break, but for now, how binding would the views of the experts be? In mediation I would imagine that if you say yes, this is what the expert say then it is binding on both of you. Have you reached that stage when you will say what the experts say binds both of you? [Mdlalose] Actually we've reached that point. We've said there will be no point in approaching international experts if at the end of the day when they have given us their point of view we would say but I didn't accept that. We would be able to accept their point of view. [Zuma] Definitely. That is what we discussed, and that's what we came to understand. [Mashokwe] And Mr. Zuma, Mr. Mdlalose, I have to go back to an ad break, I'll be back just after this. Don't go away. [commercial break] Gentlemen, let's talk about this issue of provisional registration of the IFP. Time is against you, 4 March is the deadline again. Will it be possible for you to have registered by then, or do you depend on the outcome of mediation? [Mdlalose] Well, the issue of provisional registration is to be discussed by the IFP's central committee. If we decide we should make provisional registration, we will do so. That of course must clearly be understood not to mean commitment to taking part in the elections. It means commitment to saying, we put our name there, and if at the end of the road we decide we are going to go in for elections, we are clear that we go in for elections. But later on if we find that there is no way we can undertake to do elections, then we don't. [Mashokwe] It seems to water down this whole historic agreement, as it were. It will look like you are saying, we may come in, we may not. What would push you to come in? [Mdlalose] But we have been very clear about that. We have said it so many, many times, that there are a number of things that we have placed before the government and we have placed before the African National Congress, and when those things are undertaken we march on to elections. Before they are undertaken, we have got problems. [Mashokwe] Is this not a new ball game now from the one that.... [Mdlalose, interrupting] A new ball game? [Mashokwe] Yes, are we talking about new things in this one? [Mdlalose] Oh no, come, we placed our ideas and our suggestions before the government and before the ANC a long time ago, and we consolidated them on 19 December 1993. We put them in black and white in what we call the Yellow Paper. Everybody knows about that. A new ball game? That's surprising! [Mashokwe] I am trying to understand one little thing. What are your non-negotiables as the IFP? [Mdlalose] We have put those papers to the whole world. We are saying, so far as the constitution is concerned the provinces must have powers, and those powers must be unfettered, and they should be able to be exercised by those provinces even in the future, not to be removed so easily by the central government without the proper acceptance by the provinces themselves, and by all the structures of government. Secondly, we are saying in order that those functions may be exercised the provinces must have power to have money, to collect money, that is, the fiscal powers of the provinces must be enhanced. Thirdly, we are saying the provinces as such must be able to have their own constitution, and to have a constitution, of course, in line with the general constitution of the whole country, but they must be able to make up their own constitutions and put them before everybody. [Mashokwe] But have these things not been addressed by these concessions? [Mdlalose] No, no. No, no. They have not been sufficiently addressed. [Mashokwe] The ANC, why don't you give the IFP what they want so that we march on to elections come 27 April? Is it difficult? [Zuma] Leslie, I don't think it is a question of giving the IFP want they want, it's a question of negotiating. I think we have been involved in negotiations for quite a long time, including the very package that the ANC has announced in the recent past, which is again an indication of how flexible the ANC can be. And I think the very fact that we had a meeting today is an indication that all of us are keen to discuss and find one another in the process. I think what is critical in negotiations is a spirit of being ready to give as well as take, and I think this is what we are doing, and this is what we would like all parties to be able to do, and I think we have done that, and I think we are in the process of perhaps even looking at the responses that the IFP is making to our package that we have come up with. [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, Dr. Mdlalose says here and now that those concessions do not meet with their demands, therefore the two of you are not finding each other yet. What else do you have to do? Do you know what you have to do in order to meet their demands? Are you prepared to do that? [Zuma] I think what we are prepared to do is to debate the issues. I am not certain whether we have had enough time with the IFP to sit down and look even at what the IFP says, it doesn't mean anything, because if we debated the matters we might actually emerge with a position where we could be even much closer. I think it is a question of us looking at this package, and looking at the criticism that the IFP is leveling against the package, and arguing back, because we do not believe if one has heard some noises, that all the objections that the IFP is making are not debatable. We think they are still debatable, and I am sure they would feel the same. [Mashokwe] I see that you know in your h?ad, but could I just go back to Mr. Zuma? You've had a chance with the 19 December -- the Yellow Paper that is being stated here. Have you addressed their concerns? Are going to be addressing these concerns at all? [Zuma] We have, we have addressed the concerns, and this is what we are saying -- negotiations, ever since they began more than two years ago, the business has been to address the concerns of other parties, and I think it goes on. And I think even the fact that today we have come to discuss some possibility of the international kind of people participating, as well as even the IFP saying -- we could register after consulting with our principal on the provisional basis -- is an indication of the process. I think the process is on. [Mashokwe] Mr. Mdlalose? [Mdlalose] Well, I agree entirely with what Jacob is saying. The issue is this -- it's not just a matter of yes, no, to an issue. It's an issue of, what does this involve? How far can this be taken? Take for example the issue of powers, powers for the provinces. It isn't just one power. There are several powers that are mentioned, and then, when you consider those powers in a sense you say how much of that power to be taken by the province or by the state will do, as we would prefer to say? Now then, you've discussed that and somebody might say, all right, that power may be given but it should be in the context that the national government will have a say over what you have got. Then we have to negotiate that. [Mashokwe] Dr. Mdlalose, it's almost like somebody who is watching could say the IFP has an attitude of -- if you don't give us what we want, we don't take part in the elections. Is that true? [Mdlalose] Well, that would be a wrong interpretation. [Mashokwe] What is the right one? [Mdlalose] We are saying, for the sake of South Africa, and that must be importantly understood. For the sake of South Africa, the constitution is best when it has this, that, or the other feature. We have already, in fact, considered many things even though we would not have liked to have considered those issues, but we have considered them in a spirit of understanding and reaching some consensus. So we see these powers have got to come up and we have mentioned them, and then of course the other party will say -- no, yes, you can have that, but not that far, then they well know we can't. We must have it at least thus far. So that there is negotiation. Negotiation is not just a matter of saying A or B. [Mashokwe] OK, I hear that it sounds very reasonable, but in actual fact here we have.... [Mdlalose, interrupting] It is in fact, it is in fact reasonable... [Mashokwe, continuing] I say it sounds reasonable, but out there the reality is that -- the chief minister said he does not recognize the authority of the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]. Now, the text here says: The responsibility for peace and the end of violence rests with the government. Again shifting the goal posts, shifting the blame to the government. Are you not as leaders supposed to be taking this responsibility on your shoulders and saying to your supporters: Stop it? [Mdlalose] But I don't think you have read that statement correctly. We have said it clearly that there is a responsibility on our part to redouble our efforts, those are the words we have said. It means we go on to our constituencies, we go on to the people on the ground, we go on to the structures of our parties, we meet ever so often with our branches and let them know that they must tolerate one another. We take part in the peace committee structures. There is a regional Dispute Resolution Committee, there are also the local dispute resolution committees. For example here in Natal we have got six centers that are actually manned by various people. Since certain instances some of our members don't turn up, in certain instances some of the ANC members do not turn up. So we have got to get to our people and say: Look, turn up. And that is not government, it's our parties. We are going to press them to go and take part in these dispute resolution committees... [Mashokwe, interrupting] OK.... [Mdlalose, continuing] ...and then we say the government might as well do its part. We are not saying that's only the government. [Mashokwe] Let me hear it from the ANC. Are you also redoubling your efforts, redoubling the issue of no revenge killings? How do you interpret it? [Zuma] Definitely, that's what we are saying. There are efforts which have been undertaken by both organizations, because it doesn't necessarily mean nothing has happened between the two organizations in an attempt to stamp out violence. We are saying we are going to redouble that effort. in other words, as two organizations we want to ensure that the peace structures that we are party to, and every other thing, including new initiatives, we are going to do everything we can. But we are then saying, there is a voice that comes from the government if there is a kind of violence. They will say this is between the IFP and the ANC, let them sort it out. We are saying, while we have got the responsibility to deal with the matters that we have just spelt out, the government at the end has the responsibility to ensure that there is law and order in this country, not to pass the buck and say -- violence is there, we can't do anything about it, it is a matter between the IFP and the ANC. [Mashokwe] Okay, I have to ask again on this issue of provisional registration. Will this influence in any way your relationship with the other members of the Freedom Alliance? [Mdlalose] Well, it may. We are working as a party to make decisions on our own as a party, but naturally we communicate our ideas to our partners in the Freedom Alliance. [Mashokwe] Do you think they will be disappointed with your move? [Mdlalose] I won't talk on their behalf, they are big enough to make those decisions. [Mashokwe] Let us try and get to the root of this. You have moved from an alliance that said it will not take part before A, B, C, and Z, etc. You've taken a stand now -- provisional registration. Is that not in the same tone. It seems to me it's not in the same tone with your friends in the Freedom Alliance. [Mdlalose] The first thing to recognize is the we have not decided on having those provisional registrations done yet. We are going to refer them to our Central Committee -- we have said that before. There has not been a decision as yet, but we are an independent party. If we think that is the right thing to be done, that will be so, then we'll inform the other parties. We have power to make our decisions; they also have power to make their own decisions. [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, let me go back to you. The issue of the ANC and socio-economic reconstruction development. Are we in a situation now where we could say you are going to be able to pursue this, say within the Natal region? [Zuma] Certainly, that is our aim. That is what we would like to do. All that we are doing, basically we would like to have peace and stability. We don't think it is a good thing that our people should be killing one another, because if there's violence there is no peace and stability, then you cannot address the question of reconstruction and development. That has to take place within the context and environment that is conducive. If there is violence, there is destruction of property, burning of houses, etc.; then you cannot have that kind of situation. That is why the issue of stopping violence is a cardinal question that here, particularly Natal, we've got to work so closely all of us to ensure that we succeed. [Mashokwe] OK, let us look at the new task group. In the past when the leaders had met they have come up with meeting -- with task groups or committees. How effective is this one going to be which is charged with bringing back peace in this area [as heard]? How are you going to go about it practically on the ground? [Zuma] We believe that in order to follow up the decisions taken today and the discussions and other agreements reached before, we do need the task force that is going to ensure that the kind of double efforts that we are talking about are actually put in place. It has to meet and plan as to how do we in practice take these decisions and implement them and ensure that decisions, like the two leaders visiting various areas, are undertaken. I think we, by the task force, we are trying to ensure that our decisions don't suffer delay in implementation -- and also which implementation -- that they should be implemented quickly and effectively. [Mashokwe] Dr. Mdlalose? [Mdlalose] And that also there should be facilitation of the national peace structures at local levels. [Mashokwe] Gentlemen, I have to ask you this. It would appear you have avoided in this statement here the issue of the king and the monarchy. What is the agreement there, because they live close to the hearts of.... [Mdlalose, interrupting] We discussed the issue of the king and we have not included it in our statement. It's a lot of concern and there are a lot of sensitivities about that. But we went into that and we did not feel it was our duty really to make pronouncements on that issue. [Mashokwe] But it is an issue that South Africans would want to know about. Mr. Zuma, is it not important to tell us what you discussed at least? [Zuma] The issue was discussed as Dr. Mdlalose says we will not necessarily put it in a statement, but there was an indication from the ANC's position for an example that the ANC recognizes and respects the king, and I think you should be aware that in the ANC's position the respect of the traditional leadership has been pronounced. Even the interim constitution that is there does provide this, and we believe that in the provincial constitution which will deal with the peculiarities of Natal as Natal, that issue will certainly be accommodated. But we did not necessarily discuss it with an aim to conclude the issue, because we know the issue is under discussion. That's why we thought it was not necessary to put it in the statement here. [Mashokwe] Does provisional constitutions [as heard] make enough room for the kingdom of Zululand in your view, Dr. Mdlalose? [Mdlalose] Provincial constitutions? [Mashokwe] Yes, the ones that have been agreed upon. [Mdlalose] Well, from the point of view of IFP we have provision for the position of the king. [Mashokwe] Are you satisfied with those pronouncements that the ANC has come up with in that regard? [Mdlalose] There is a lot still to be discussed. I mean, the ANC have made their comments about it, but there is nothing that's finalized, as Mr. Zuma said. [Mashokwe] Gentlemen, I have to ask you this in conclusion. Which of you believe that there is a need for a Zulu volkstaat [homeland]? Do you believe there is a need, Mr. Zuma? [Mdlalose] A Zulu volkstaat? We have not spoken about a Zulu volkstaat [laughter from Zuma]. And that is not equivalent to a Zulu kingdom. [Mashokwe] OK, let me get this quickly, you're left with 10 seconds. [Zuma] No, but the Zulu kingdom is there. It has been there. It is not a question of debate about it. I think what is being debated is the role and the place of it constitutionally. I don't think there's anyone who debates or disputes the fact of the Zulu kingdom. [Mdlalose] The Zulu kingdom is there. It has been there for centuries. And no one is going to abolish that. [Mashokwe] Dr. Mdlalose, Mr. Zuma, thank you for talking to us. That was Newsline from Durban and thank you for watching, good night.
