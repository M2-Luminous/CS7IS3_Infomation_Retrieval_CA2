General Viljoen told the Pretoria Press Club that his party wanted to complete all the details for an Afrikaner volkstaat before the election and to define the self- determination aspect of the Afrikaner as soon as possible. However, he said that proof of support for a volkstaat was of cardinal importance and could only be done by voting in next month's election. According to General Viljoen, the establishment of a volkstaat cannot be stopped if there are more than a million votes in its favor. However, it would be up to the constitutional court to decide whether there was sufficient support.
