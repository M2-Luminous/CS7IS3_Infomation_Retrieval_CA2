What topics were discussed and what stands were expressed? ['Abd-Rabbuh] Today, a meeting was held with the French foreign and defense ministers. At this meeting, we explained the stand of the Palestinian command, emphasizing the need to provide all security guarantees for the Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories as a necessary step before the peace process is resumed. At the forefront of these demands is the issue of ending settlement activities, the armed presence of the settlers, and some settlement centers that are a real obstacle and a time bomb threatening any peace arrangements that could be reached. At the same time, we must not forget the importance of the presence of international forces in the occupied territories with full authorization from the UN Security Council to carry out their role of safeguarding security and monitoring Israeli respect for the security of the Palestinian people and their rights. I can say that the French and Palestinian stands on these points are in agreement, and that France is playing its role as the current UN Security Council president by issuing a UN Security Council resolution that will help us start implementing such arrangements and measures. [Reporter] Has France agreed to send international forces to the occupied territories? ['Abd-Rabbuh] France today said that it agrees to an effective international presence in the occupied territories authorized by the UN Security Council and the United Nations, and that this international presence should have a practical role in preventing any violations against the Palestinian people, particularly after the massacre that was committed in Hebron one week ago. [Reporter] What capitals will you visit after France? ['Abd-Rabbuh] Today, we will also meet with the EC leadership in Brussels, and with the Belgian foreign minister. We will explain the Palestinian stand within the framework of common action with Europe and all other forces eager to preserve the peace process and have it proceed without impediments and without any mines being laid on the road, such as the presence of the Israeli terrorists, the settlers, and the extremist forces that support them. [Reporter] The international envoys that have traveled to Tunis to meet with the Palestinians and to Israel, including the Russian envoy and the Greek envoy, whose country chairs the EC, have urged the Palestinian and Israeli sides to resume the negotiations. When do you expect the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will resume? ['Abd-Rabbuh] We seek to resume the negotiations as soon as possible. However, the resumption of the negotiations calls for real guarantees. The question is not one of sitting around a table only. The question is to reach, on the ground, a secure and sound state of affairs with respect to the Palestinian citizens, a situation that does not expose them to the Israeli terrorism at any moment. [Reporter] Are you satisfied with the development of the international stand in this respect? ['Abd-Rabbuh] We believe that most of those who represent the international stand are sympathetic and understand the realism of the Palestinian stand and Palestinian demands, as well as the Palestinian side's concern over the peace process and its continuation. The international stand now completely understands that the obstacles placed by the terrorist settlers and others should be completely removed so that the peace process may be resumed, and so that steps and measures can be taken on the road to implementing the peace agreement and not only to sit at the table of negotiations. [Reporter] Reports from Israel speak of a serious dialogue between the Rabin government and the extremist right-wing party Tzomet to have it join the coalition government. Tzomet's stands are known to be against the autonomy agreement and to support the presence of the settlements, not to mention the other extremist stands. What do the Palestinians think about this development? ['Abd-Rabbuh] Of course, this is a negative development. The strange thing is that Rabin's government, which claims it is against extremism, seeks to deal with extremism by resorting to more extremism. We are closely watching this issue, especially since the differences between Eytan, Kahane, and the other extremist gangs are minor. They all agree on the same platform -- on adopting a racist stand against the Palestinians.
