Several far right-wingers in camouflage AWB uniforms said earlier they had come to support the march, which was a display of solidarity of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's demands for a Zulu kingdom and the Freedom Alliance's constitutional demands. But the march was held up on Wednesday afternoon as organisers sorted out the potentially embarrassing situation. IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] Youth Brigade National Organiser Otto Kunene told SAPA he had confirmed with his leadership that there had been no agreement for the AWB to join their march. "Fortunately we have resolved this situation diplomatically," he said. The march, after a lengthy delay, began soon after 1.00 PM and comprised at least 1,000 stick- and shield-wielding Zulus, and several firearms were seen among the crowd. There was a strong police contingent to ensure there was no confrontation in the politically-charged south coast town.
