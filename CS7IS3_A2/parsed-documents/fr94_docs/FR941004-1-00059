FR941004-1-00059 FR941004-1-00016 The populations on the Presidio are threatened by competition with invasive alien vegetation, shading from native and introduced shrubs and trees, foot traffic, sand quarrying, bulldozing, and other anthropogenic activities (CDFG 1989; California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) 1992; Susan Smith, pers. comm., 1992; Paul Reeberg, pers. comm., 1993; Terri Thomas, pers. comm., 1993). The population located on San Bruno Mountain is threatened by urbanization, trampling, competition from invasive alien vegetation, and bulldozing (Thomas Reid Associates, in litt, 1991; Susan Smith, pers. comm., 1992; Paul Reeberg, pers comm., 1993). Both the Presidio and San Bruno Mountain populations are threatened by stochastic environmental events. Alice Eastwood (1931) originally described Arctostaphylos imbricata in 1931, based on material collected from the San Bruno Hills in 1915. Until 1967, various authors either synonymized A. imbricata with A. andersonii (Jepson 1939), or considered it to be a variety of A. andersonii (Adams in McMinn 1935). James Roof followed Eastwood's treatment and acknowledged A. imbricata as a distinct species (Roof 1967). Philip Wells (1988) subsumed A. montariensis as a subspecies of A. imbricata, necessitating the creation of an autonym as discussed above (i.e., A. imbricata ssp. imbricata ). He since has recognized A. imbricata as a distinct species in his 1993 treatment of California Arctostaphylos (Wells 1993). Arctostaphylos imbricata is a low spreading evergreen shrub of the heath family (Ericaceae) that lacks a basal burl. Attaining a height of 20 cm (8 in), this highly branched shrub forms mats that are up to about 6 meters (m) (6 yards (yd)) in diameter. The bright green oblong to ovate leaves are hairless, except on the midrib, and densely overlapping. Small white urn-shaped flowers appearing from February to May are densely clustered at the end of branchlets. After fire, A. imbricata regenerates from seed instead of resprouting from a basal burl. A. imbricata can be distinguished from its congeners by its prostrate habit and its shorter, densely arranged leaves and compact flower clusters (Roof 1967). Arctostaphylos imbricata is restricted to San Bruno Mountain in northern San Mateo County. On San Bruno Mountain, five small occurrences cover approximately 80 hectares (33 acres) (Paul Reeberg, in litt., 1993). The most abundant population has 400 to 500 plants; other populations have as few as 15 plants (Roman Gankin, San Mateo County Planning Department, pers. comm., 1993). The plant grows in rocky exposed areas such as open ridges within coastal scrub or manzanita scrub at an elevation range of 275 to 365 m (900 to 1,200 ft). Where it occurs, it is the dominant plant species, and may be associated with Baccharis pilularis (coyote brush), Vaccinium ovatum (huckleberry), Rhamnus californica (coffeeberry), and Arctostaphylos uva-ursi var. suborbiculata (bearberry). A. imbricata has never been known from more than the five populations that occur today. Four of the five populations occur on land owned by San Mateo County Parks and Recreation; the fifth population is privately owned (Thomas Reid Associates 1991). The proximity of this plant on San Bruno Mountain to human population centers and intensive development activities renders A. imbricata vulnerable to change in the frequency of fires (i.e., as a result of a fire suppression policy), which are needed for the plants to reproduce sexually. Its highly restricted distribution increases its susceptibility to catastrophic events such as disease or pest outbreak, severe drought, or other natural or human-caused disasters. Previous Federal Action Federal government actions on the two plants began on June 16, 1976, when the Service published a proposal in the Federal Register (41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700 vascular plant species to be endangered pursuant to section 4 of the Act. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975, Federal Register publication. Arctostaphylos imbricata was included in the June 16, 1976, Federal Register document. General comments received in relation to the 1976 proposal were summarized in an April 26, 1978, Federal Register publication (43 FR 17909). The Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1978 required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to those proposals already more than 2 years old. In the December 10, 1979, Federal Register (44 FR 70796), the Service published a notice of withdrawal of the June 16, 1976, proposal, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published an updated notice of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480). This notice included Arctostaphylos imbricata and Lessingia germanorum (as Lessingia germanorum var. germanorum ) as category 1 candidates for Federal listing. Category 1 taxa are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. On November 28, 1983, the Service published in the Federal Register a supplement to the Notice of Review (48 FR 53640). This supplement changed L. germanorum var. germanorum from a category 1 to a category 2 candidate. Category 2 taxa are those for which data in the Service's possession indicate listing is possibly appropriate, but for which substantial data on biological vulnerability and threats are not currently known or on file to support proposed rules.
