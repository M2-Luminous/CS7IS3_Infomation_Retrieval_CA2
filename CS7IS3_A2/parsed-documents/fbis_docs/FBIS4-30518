The bank is required by law to keep inflation within a zero to two percent range, and in a six-monthly statement governor Don Brash cited pressures in the economy that could push inflation towards the top of the target range over the next 18 months. "Given the forecast outlook, the bank is comfortable with the slightly firmer interest rates seen recently, and some additional modest firming in monetary conditions would reduce the risk of inflation going above two percent," Brash said. "More substantial firming is not yet required but would almost certainly be needed if signs of inflation pressures continued to accumulate," Brash said. The bank did not see inflation taking off, but did forecast pressures that would push inflation to around 1.7 percent to 1.8 percent in late 1995 and 1996. "Inflation at those levels would provide little room for error and, with the economy continuing to grow strongly, we are more likely to encounter greater, not less, inflation pressures," he said. A cautious tightening of monetary conditions at this stage would, by reducing the risk of a boom/bust economic cycle, help to extend New Zealand's current robust growth. "We are in the midst of another period of volatility in overseas financial markets," he said. "The bank tries to take a medium-term view of financial market conditions, rather than reacting to every period of domestic volatility induced by overseas developments. "But if such impacts were prolonged or sharp, we could need to react in order to maintain price stability." The bank said a distinct uptrend in underlying inflation was likely to emerge within a year. "Our forecasts indicate that, in the absence of monetary restraint, a distinctly upward trend in underlying inflation is likely to emerge within a year," the bank statement said. "The outlook for inflation presented in this statement underlines the importance of setting policy in a forward-looking manner. "Inflation is currently near the middle of the forecast range. Our forecasts indicate that, in the absence of monetary restraint, a distinctly upward trend in underlying inflation is likely to emerge within a year. "This suggests that somewhat firmer monetary conditions than prevailed in the March quarter are appropriate. Some firming, mainly through higher interest rates, has already occurred.
