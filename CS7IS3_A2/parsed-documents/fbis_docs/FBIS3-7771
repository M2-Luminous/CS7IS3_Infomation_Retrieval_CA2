Ratko Mladic, has said one should not worry over the Serb defence positions around Sarajevo after the withdrawal of heavy weapons, because the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was really making an effort to maintain ceasefire. If, however, the Moslems launch an offensive (in the Sarajevo area) the (Bosnian) Serbs will fiercely respond with all available means, Gen. Mladic warned in an interview to the Novi Sad daily DNEVNIK on Saturday. I would not recommend to Moslems to take up arms. It is better (for them) to try to achieve their goals peacefully -- through negotiations, in which they can achieve much, because they can lose everything by opting for war, he said. In connection with the insistence by some western countries, especially france to threaten the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes unless they allow the opening of the airfield in Tuzla, Gen. Mladic said he was confident that the airfield in that Moslem enclave would be least used for humanitarian aid supply. We have reliable information that weapons and ammunition, as well as Mujaheddin from Islamic countries would be brought in by planes, he said. Stressing that the Serb side will discuss with UNPROFOR the possibilities for the opening of the airfield, and that it is ready to negotiate this directly with the Moslems, Gen. Mladic warned that it should, nevertheless, be clear to everybody that Bosnian Serbs would not allow the case of the Sarajevo airport to be repeated. "We held the Sarajevo airport, and then turned it over to UNPROFOR, and the Moslems dug a tunnel under the airport and use it unhindered (for military purposes), despite our warnings to the peace-keeping command and U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali," said Gen. Mladic. In connection with the talks on forming a common Bosnian Moslem- Croat state, Gen. Mladic said it was possible that a Moslem-Croat coalition backed primarily by Croatia, as well as many other countries, again take up arms and come against the Serbs. As long as the international factors do not want peace in Bosnia- Herzegovina, there will be no peace, Gen. Mladic concluded.
