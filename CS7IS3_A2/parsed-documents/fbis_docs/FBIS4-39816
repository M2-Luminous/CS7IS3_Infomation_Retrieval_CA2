He called such information complete garbage. A well-informed source in the government told the ITAR-TASS correspondent today that this evening Chernomyrdin was returning from Germany. But the question of his participation in tomorrow's all-Russian builders' conference in the Kremlin with the participation of the Russian president currently remained open. In all probability, Soskovets would deliver a report there. Aleksandr Livshits, head of the Russian president's group of experts, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent the following concerning the fabrications about the possible resignation of Chernomyrdin: Such rumors are advantageous only to those who are trying to snatch power, and for this purpose to set at loggerheads the leaders of the government and the president's administration. We are working amid continuous malevolence, but our team of reformers will not let this put their nose out of joint. At the federation of goods producers, which is chaired by Yuriy Skokov, whom the authors of the article in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA have destined for the post of prime minister, the ITAR-TASS correspondent was told: This is mere fiction and nothing else, and it is a pity that it compromises our federation's leader.
