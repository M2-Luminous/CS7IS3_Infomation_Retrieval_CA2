North Korean Citizens Bring Eight Kilograms of Heroin Into Russia"] [Text] Your SEGODNYA correspondent has learned from competent sources that a successful operation was conducted in Maritime Kray a few days ago to stop an attempt to smuggle heroin from North Korea into Russia. The operation in this case was mounted simultaneously by several agencies: the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs Directorate for Combating Illicit Turnover of Drugs; the kray internal affairs administration; the Pacific Fleet Counterintelligence Service; border troops; and the local directorate of the Federal Counterintelligence Service. According to information available to the editorial office, the events developed in the following manner: On 9 June, operatives held two citizens of the North Korea on suspicion of smuggling in a big amount of narcotics from the territory of the DPRK. Their names have not been disclosed at the investigation's request. The detectives' expectations were justified: The check turned up eight kilograms of heroin in the possession of these citizens. Both North Koreans were arrested. Criminal proceedings have been instituted. The DPRK is a unique enclave where a Stalinist regime has been preserved in a classical form. The population in that country is under total surveillance by the special services, and to go abroad one has to go through the strictest screening. To smuggle such a large amount of the narcotic from North Korea without the deliberate connivance of the authorities appears most improbable. The value of the heroin seized from the DPRK citizens is $1 million at the going rate on the world drugs market, which is all the more impressive against the backdrop of the economic plight of Kim Il-song's regime.
