The paper says: Israel aims to promote despair among the Lebanese over the futility of the legitimate means pursued by Lebanon to end the Israeli occupation, and, consequently, push it to submit to the Israeli conditions. The paper adds: Israel is used to applying such pressures every time it finds itself encircled by an international move to pay the dues of peace; that is, withdrawing from the occupied Arab territories in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy and the laws of the world community. But every time it retreats in failure and disappointment because of the Lebanese national resistance. AL-BA'TH notes that if Israel managed to deal separately with a certain Arab party, it will not be able to achieve what it wants with Lebanon, especially since Lebanon is fortified, both in its internal front and by its special brotherly ties with Syria which are based on coordination and cooperation in all fields. In its editorial today, TISHRIN discusses Israel's aggressive acts, which have become a daily and permanent practice in southern Lebanon. TISHRIN stresses that the real and natural response to the Israeli escalation is represented by a growth in the Lebanese national resistance and continuation of its struggle against occupation. The paper says the rallying of all Lebanese people, with all their sects and constitutional, official, and popular institutions, around the Lebanese national resistance to support it and strengthen its legitimate role, is, undoubtedly, a positive phenomenon. This resistance, which defends Lebanon and the people, is based on a national and pan-Arab determination to confront Israeli arrogance with all courage and resolve to regain the usurped Lebanese territory in the South. The paper notes that Israel's repeated provocative acts have made Lebanon a cohesive front against the Israeli attacks and against the policy of terrorism and bombardment. The paper says: All signs indicate that Israel is facing a political defeat on the Lebanese front. It manifests this defeat through bombardment, continued aggression, and exacerbating the situation. Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN stresses that Lebanon's cohesion and standing as a cohesive, united front behind the resistance and against the Israeli aggression are supported by all Arabs. Syria will support Lebanon and its just causes and defend its march toward peace and reconciliation. It will also continue to stick to its right to regain its territory, implement Resolution 425, and end the occupation of southern Lebanon, the Golan Heights, and the occupied Arab territories.
