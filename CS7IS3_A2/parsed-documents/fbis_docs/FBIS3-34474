In your view, what is the national and historic importance of this document? [Tahir] The document's importance is that it represents a national consensus base in which everyone shoulders their responsibility honorably and sincerely. It embodies the Yemeni democratic political movement's ability to respond to the homeland's and people's objective need for democracy and to build the institutions of the unified state in accordance with contemporary concepts. The national and historic importance of this document transcends all the secondary and narrow agreements based on the principle of balance and power sharing between the two parties which forged unity. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] What new elements has the document introduced at the military level, and how would you assess its importance with regard to the military building of the unified state? [Tahir] At the military level it can be said that this document has drawn up a clear strategic concept to rebuild -- I repeat, rebuild -- and organize the Armed Forces on the basis of modern national foundations matching the comprehensive unionist and democratic developments on the national and international scenes. More importantly, it has drawn up principles that are bound to reinforce the army's status and positive role in the context of the development process and to turn it into a factor of progress and stability rather than an obstacle to it. And as you noted, it specified the tasks for the Armed Forces in terms of the corps, their ideal sizes, their organization, and how they should be run. It also drew up the general outlines for attaining optimum preparedness, armament levels, organization, and rehabilitation. It can be said that for the first time national forces have been able to contribute directly to formulating a methodological view of the homeland's defense issue and to enhancing the Armed Forces' capability. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] In your capacity as a leader of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], which is a party to the current crisis, do you expect the Pledge and Accord Document to succeed? And in your view, what factor and conditions are needed for its successful implementation? [Tahir] The criterion of any document's importance lies in its being turned into a transforming force and achieving the aims sought from it. It also lies in our ability to implement this document. Implementation of this document cannot be "partial" or "selective" in accordance with the criteria of narrow interests. It should be comprehensive and on schedule. And I hope the document will be different from the previous ones, namely that it will be seriously implemented and translated into reality. As for the guarantees and conditions for its implementation, they lie in a group of practical and binding implementation measures which should be formulated and crystallized by the dialogue committee as part of this document. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] What are the conditions and guarantees at the military level? Implementing this document at the military level requires huge material and human resources in moving units to new positions. Have all the arrangements been made in this connection? [Tahir] Success at the military level cannot be in isolation from the success of the implementation process as a whole. It is an integrated process. Birds cannot fly with one wing. I believe that the conditions for success are general before they can be particular, and all the country's capabilities, resources, and energies should be utilized to secure these conditions as long as they are to do with building foundations for a new unionist, strong, and prosperous state. With regard to the capabilities needed to move the more disciplined military units, it is a very significant point. There are additional requirements which I believe society and the state will not be unable to meet. Citizens who have suffered a great deal as a result of the crisis, for the sake of defending unity and building a contemporary state, can see that the aim for which they have been struggling is about to be achieved, and are thus willing to make further sacrifices, even if the situation requires that they sacrifice their own lives for the sake of important and noble aims. The country's resources and capabilities are great and sufficient if they are used rationally and utilized correctly. [Shatarah] The Armed Forces are given more attention in the national dialogue than any other institution. What do you think the reason for this is, and what are your plans to implement what is mentioned in the document with regard to the military aspect? [Tahir] As you said, the military aspect was given more attention by the various parties engaged in the dialogue than any other aspect. Maybe because of the existence of legitimate concerns. Some people are rightly concerned about the present position of the Armed Forces and hence the potential sinister dangers and risks. And maybe because the Armed Forces represent the melting pot of Yemeni unity which accommodates all contradictions and the homeland's social, political, cultural, and geographical map. And their complete unification is a necessity to ensure unity's victory and consolidation. This importance is also derived from the Armed Forces' distinctive role in safeguarding the achievements of unity, the revolution, and democracy. With regard to our plans for implementation, the document clearly specified the general outlines of our tasks in the Armed Forces, namely, to complete their merger, their redeployment, their withdrawal from the partition areas, and other tasks. It also specifies the timetable for implementing that. So we have begun to analyze and assess what is mentioned in the document and to draw up detailed tasks and steps for implementation, in addition to the necessary means and methods. We have formed specialized committees for each task and determined the orientations, aims, and principles that guarantee accurate and rigorous implementation. [Shatarah] The document stipulates that the units present in what used to be known as the fringes between the two parts of Yemen be moved. To what areas will they be moved? [Tahir] That principle is not prompted by the crisis or the present situation, to defuse that situation and avert an explosion in the present crisis, or to spare these units the risks of political frictions. It has always been part of our general view since the first day of unity. Because there is no military, security, or even economic need for these units to remain in their old positions. Their current presence has partially embodied the partition reality, even psychologically. The units should be moved to the areas that require the army's services and national and historic role in defending national sovereignty and protecting the people's economic interests against any aggression. That is, the units' movement should be governed by the principle of reinforcing the homeland's security and stability, protecting economic installations and foreign companies, closing outlets for terrorism and smuggling, and decisively contributing to combating them. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] What military units are required to be moved from the cities? [Tahir] All military units that have combat tasks and weapons and which have no service, administrative, or military tasks that require their remaining in the cities. I believe that the stipulation is very clear in the document. [Shatarah] Southern military officials demanded the need to abolish the Republican Guard and merge the Armed Forces. Why? And is there an alternative plan to provide protection for the president, vice president, and the other Presidential Council members? [Tahir] Before unity the Republican Guard existed within the military formation of the Armed Forces in the northern governorates. Its leadership is under the control of the head of state along the lines of the practice in some countries, like fraternal Iraq. There is nothing similar to it in the southern or eastern governorates. The Republican Guard is not an internal security unit, as some people think. They are combat military units with a high level of preparedness and advanced and modern armament. In terms of its structure, preparedness, and armament, the Republican Guard is above all else prepared to carry out large-scale military tasks to defend national sovereignty. This is why it is necessary for them to be within the formation of the Yemeni Armed Forces and for its units to be merged within the Yemeni Army. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] There have been numerous reports of the YSP's rejection of plans to move the camps from the fringes to the positions allocated to defending national sovereignty. [Tahir] I am talking to you in my capacity as the defense minister of the Republic of Yemen, not as a partisan element. All that is being reported about this or that party's rejection is untrue. It is a joint responsibility in all cases of failure and in all cases of success. We spoke about that earlier. The Army's deployment in the fringes continues to represent a form of partition and embody a failure to unify and merge the two armies after unity. The situation continued in that manner until the crisis emerged, when it assumed serious political dimensions. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] Some observers believe that there will always be obstacles to the unification of the Armed Forces because of the clear difference between the two armies in terms of their partisan affiliations and the personnel's military and political upbringing? [Tahir] The observers' expectations are inaccurate, indeed untrue. I do not whether this error is the result of their ignorance of the simplest axioms of Yemeni unity, which was established between two coherent social entities that are united in many aspects within a historical, geographical, and social framework and one stock and one religion. What is more, they are more united by family ties and demographic interlinkage than by political decisions, which have merely embodied the popular and official will and action. The army is part of this people. Its personnel have grown up under one Yemeni revolution and in a deep-rooted unionist foundation. No secondary factors can pose a threat to the spiritual, historical, ethical, and unionist formation of Yemeni fighters. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] How do you view the U.S. and European move to include U.S. and Western military officials in the military committees which are visiting the camps? And will their role focus on averting a military confrontation? [Tahir] Military representatives from some embassies of the friendly states that expressed interest in the crisis and internal conditions in Yemen will participate in some field visits by the competent military committees. This military activity is an extension to their political and diplomatic activity aimed at resolving the crisis peacefully and through a broadly based democratic dialogue founded on safeguarding unity, building a contemporary state, and broadening the masses' participation in power. We thank these parties for their sincere efforts to secure a rapprochement of views at the political level and reduce military tension in the fringes. We thank them for their endeavors to avert the threats of war. [Shatarah] If the parties which signed the document fail to implement its clauses, do you expect the situation to be settled militarily? [Tahir] Why should we expect failure, not certain success? That is what I believe, for several reasons: First, we are serious and indeed determined to work to make the document a success. Nothing is impossible if there is a national will and consensus to work for the sake of the homeland. Second, I believe that the document contains many success factors, namely, the national consensus, absolute popular support, and the great Arab and international blessing and support it enjoys. Talk about the possible failure or abortion of this great plan is nothing but a desire and dream among those who are harmed by national reform and the building of a contemporary state, and among the enemies of unity and democracy, who by any standards are few and have no influence. [Shatarah] What about the possibility of war? [Tahir] The possibility of war is remote from our political vocabulary. Everyone realizes -- indeed, is convinced -- that war and its calamitous devastation are futile. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] Right now, Yemen is experiencing a state of real separation. In your view, what are the ways out if the situation continues as it stands and if the clauses of the agreement are not implemented? [Tahir] The crisis is the result of objective reality. It has its own causes and forces, and surmounting it is not impossible. We always rely on the language of reason and dialogue. Because it is capable of solving the most complex of problems in a democratic and civilized manner. Despite the complexity and seriousness of the situation, it is still under political control. I always bank on the masses and their action, which achieved the Pledge and Accord Document. I believe that they are capable of implementing it. They achieved unity and they are its protectors. If the document -- God forbid -- is not implemented, I personally cannot even accurately predict the disastrous consequences for the homeland's unity and future. If something of that kind takes place, it will mean an absolute inability to control the situation and its fallout. It would be a catastrophe by any standards. Everyone has a grave national responsibility and crucial choice. Everyone must shoulder this responsibility both honorably and sincerely. And since we have succeeded in drawing up this document, we must continue to struggle in the same spirit for the sake of its implementation. [passage omitted]
