[Begin Savimbi recording] For Angola, a military solution is a totally futile exercise because no one will win the war. Once again, it is demonstrating that, although materiel is important, the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] does not have the men to fight. This could go on for years. Therefore our intention is to continue negotiating in Lusaka. If it was possible to obtain an overall cease-fire, that would be ideal. This was UNITA's [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] request. Seeing that the four-month cease-fire that was in place proved that [words indistinct] we asked the MPLA, and the Luanda government to agree to extend not only in spirit [words indistinct]. [end recording] Savimbi gave assurances that UNITA is continuing to negotiate with goodwill and determination, but also that UNITA has enough weapons to carry on fighting for many years. Savimbi said that with regard to Portugal, everything is well with [Portuguese President] Mario Soares, but he accuses [Prime Minister] Cavaco Silva of not doing so well. [Begin Savimbi recording] I appealed for better relations with the Portuguese Government, but I was shocked when I was told by our representative [in Lisbon] Adalberto that Prime Minister Cavaco Silva made a point of returning the Christmas card that Adalberto had sent. First, this is not polite. It is not polite. It is a totally aggressive gesture, aggressive. He could have torn the card and let UNITA think he had read the card. But for the prime minister to return it....[pauses] He is a member of the MPLA. Prime Minister Cavaco Silva is doing well. I have excellent relations with the President of the Republic. I ring him frequently. He is behaving like a true Portuguese politician who has a concept of the historic relations between Portugal and Angola. But the Prime Minister is not doing well.
