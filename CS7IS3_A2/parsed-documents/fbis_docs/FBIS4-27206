FBIS4-27206 "dreas104_a_94039" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 31 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Assets of Hata Cabinet Twice Those of Hosokawa Assets of Hata Cabinet Twice Those of Hosokawa OW3105085894 Tokyo KYODO in English 0818 GMT 31 May 94 OW3105085894 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The aggregate value of personal assets of ministers in Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's cabinet is 2.4 times that of the cabinet of his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, according to KYODO NEWS SERVICE calculations based on figures announced by the ministers. The political offices of Hata and his 20 ministers, as well as former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano who quit the cabinet over an outcry following his remarks contradicting Japan's wartime atrocities, announced their asset values on Tuesday [31 May] in line with a decade-long custom in Japan's political community. The Hata administration became the 14th administration to reveal the asset values of its cabinet ministers in accordance with the custom initiated by the 1984 cabinet of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone amid public pressure on politicians to clarify their personal finances. The total of the voluntarily-disclosed value of land and other fixed asset property, stock and bond holdings and bank savings held by the ministers stood at 3.22 billion yen, according to the self- assessment. However, these figures -- calculated on the basis of the face value of stock and a special official format used in the calculation of tax amounts -- do not reflect the realities of the land and stock market. The real aggregate value of the assets of Hata's ministers amounts to 13.33 billion yen, according to the KYODO calculations. The aggregate asset value of the Hata cabinet turned out to be more than double that of the Hosokawa cabinet, as Hata and nine other ministers are former defectors from the Liberal Democratic Party who used to draw their financial strength from cash-heavy corporate contributors, political analysts said. The aggregate assets held by the 10 former LDP rebels and held in the names of their family members accounted for 13.4 billion yen or 88 percent of the 15.26 billion yen held by the 21 cabinet ministers and their families. The asset value of the Hosokawa cabinet was unusually low in comparison with previous administrations, partly because several Social Democratic Party legislators were incorporated into the cabinet lineup. These SDP cabinet ministers stormed out of Hata's ruling coalition on April 26 after coalition strategists suddenly formed a unified parliamentary voting bloc excluding the SDP in the House of Representatives. Labor Minister Kunio Hatoyama, a former LDP veteran, topped the list of ministers as the most wealthy minister with his KYODO- assessed asset value coming to 8.46 billion yen. Hatoyama is now an independent. His stock holdings accounted for 5.77 billion yen, while his savings stood at 1.75 billion yen. The remaining portion comprises his real estate, and golf club membership certificates at five country clubs that could be cashed at any time. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, another ex-LDP rebel who joined Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], ranked second with 875 million yen, followed by Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 542 million yen. Kakizawa's real estate value provides an example of a gulf between the self-assessed value and the real market value. The self-declared value of his Tokyo home, office and residential land stood at 38 million yen, while their market value came to 533 million yen, according to the KYODO probe. The premier himself ranked 13th in the list with his asset value totaling 150 million yen. This compares with Hosokawa's 1.3 billion yen. One of the conspicuous features of his asset makeup was his investment in overseas investment trusts. The latest announcement by the premier's office disclosed that he failed to report in 1993 debts of 70 million yen when he declared his asset value when serving as foreign minister in the Hosokawa administration. The Hata administration initially proposed to media organizations that Hata and six other cabinet ministers who held cabinet posts in the previous Hosokawa administration be spared the obligation to declare their asset values. The administration withdrew the proposal after it came under criticism for an alleged attempt to neglect the obligation to show public transparency regarding their personal finances. Political analysts said the loopholes in the reporting requirement should be plugged in order to enable the public to assess the real situation concerning the personal finances of politicians. The requirement cannot clarify the process of personal asset- amassing, such as Hosokawa's controversial purchase of 300 shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. which he said he helped his father-in-law buy by pledging as collateral the condominium he purchased with a 100 million yen loan from a scandal-ridden trucking group, they said.
