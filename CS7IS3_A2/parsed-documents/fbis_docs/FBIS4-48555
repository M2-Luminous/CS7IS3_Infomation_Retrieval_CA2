Lukamba says that the struggle for the control of N'Dalatando involves the use of chemical warfare, leaving behind a carpet of dead and wounded people, and destruction. The Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola Military Command in the area, concerned with such a tremendous violation of the UN charter, today requested that a UN Angola Verification Mission-2 commission be urgently sent to N'Dalatando to investigate the matter. An officer of that command said that a government cannot be allowed to massacre thousands of citizens in the name of democracy.
