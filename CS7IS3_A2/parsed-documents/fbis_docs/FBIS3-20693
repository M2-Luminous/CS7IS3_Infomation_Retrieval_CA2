If Knezevic's arrival means that Belgrade wants to speed up the normalization of relations and assure Knin's consent to its inclusion in the constitutional-legal system of the Republic of Croatia with the help of a man born in Knin, then it is expected that Zagreb will accept this proposal. If, however, this appointment is intended as a provocation, which cannot be excluded by any means, then Croatia should not accept such a choice because it would certainly not lead to a normalization of relations, which, we repeat, is not only in the interest of Croatia, but should be even more in the interest of Belgrade. ``One may ask: What is the meaning of Knezevic's agreement to being appointed the Yugoslav representative in Zagreb. A logical answer is that he has recognized the Republic of Croatia and therefore would work towards the normalization of relations as soon as possible. "Of course, all this is pure speculation about what is possible, but we will not need to wait long for the answers."
