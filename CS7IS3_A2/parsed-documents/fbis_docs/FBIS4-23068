Ya. Blank, F. K. Kasimov, A. Ya. Sharshanov; UDC 537.874.6:621.317.794] [Abstract] This article examines the absorption of infrared radiation in a periodic structure, a thin corrugated metal film on a dielectric substrate. Absorption in this structure increases sharply, reaching unity. The increase in absorption is due to resonant excitation in a system of surface electromagnetic waves. The amount of absorption depends significantly on the ratio of intrinsic and radiative attenuation. The substrate is necessary to reach high absorption values. The substrate parameters and the angle of incid ence of the external wave are determined. The scattering of a plane p-polarized monochromatic wave incident from vacuum at an angle on a metal-dielectric film is studied. Figure 1; references 7: 6 Russian, 1 Western.
