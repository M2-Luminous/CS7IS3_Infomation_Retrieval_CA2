FBIS3-18591 "drweu044__a94006" FBIS-WEU-94-044-A Document Type:Daily Report 7 March 1994 ANNEX Germany Metalworkers' Wage Conflict Settled AU0503144294 Hamburg DPA in German 0830 GMT 5 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0503144294 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Excerpt] Hannover -- The strike in the west German metal industry has been averted two days before its scheduled start. After 14 hours of negotiations and consultations, on Saturday [5 March] morning, the IG Metall trade union and the Gesamtmetall employers association agreed on terminating the conflict. The compromise provides for keeping the existing holiday pay and leave arrangements. At the same time a job securing model, similar to that at Volkswagen, will be introduced. In addition, the 3.6 million metalworkers will get a 2 percent higher pay for seven months, as of 1 June. IG Metall's head, Klaus Zwickel, called the compromise an "agreement achieved virtually at the last minute." Without the 1.5 million workers out on warning strikes and the high turnout of 92.2 percent in the ballot vote, this result could not have been achieved. The agreement is to serve as a model that all districts are recommended to adopt. Gesamtmetall's president, Hans-Joachim Gottschol, said that this compromise involves "no additional costs" for compaines in the metal and electrical industries. Holiday pay and extra payments will be calculated on the basis of May 1994. This will ease costs in 1995 and 1996. In addition, there will be a one-time 10-percent cut in extra payments this year. The model, which will be valid for two years, shall enable companies to cut the work week from the current 36 hours to down to 30 hours if incoming order levels are low. In certain cases, this will be linked with securing jobs, Zwickel said. [passage omitted]
