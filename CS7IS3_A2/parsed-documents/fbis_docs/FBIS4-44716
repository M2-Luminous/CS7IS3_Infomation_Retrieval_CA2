Isnard: "Aerospatiale Warns the British Against their Refusal to Support a European Aircraft Project"] [Text] Aerospatiale CEO Louis Gallois has warned the British on the consequences that their decision--expected in June--to modernize their military transport aircraft fleet will have in Europe, if the United Kingdom were to buy new Hercules craft in the United States, and thus exclude herself from the European game plan, instead of joining the European FTA (Future Transport Aircraft) program--to replace the (aging) Transalls--for which British industry would get work awarded in return. The fate of 50,000 employees depends on the FTA program. OPIO (ALPES-MARITIMES) From Our Special Envoy. For the first time since its adoption by the Council of Ministers, the military program project has been publicly commented on by one of the most important defense industrialists, Aerospatiale CEO Louis Gallois. During an Aerospatiale seminar that took place on Monday 7 May in Opio (Alpes- Maritimes), he expressed his opinion on this official document by separating the "negatives" from the "positive aspects." On the side of "negatives," first of all, it is the fact that "all armament programs are either to be staggered or the contracts reduced." On the other hand, there is the issue of "expertise preservation" with respect to ballistic missiles, ramjet engines, Helios-2 and 0siris spy satellites, as well as the "commitment"--coupled to a prefinancing formula in 1997--to the FTA project for Europe. Mr Gallois has been very unyielding to London on the latter program, which, in the estimations of Clauder Terrazzoni, the director of the group's "aircraft" division, will cost 25.6 billion French francs [Fr], for a total of three hundred aircraft. Normally, it is next June when the British should say whether they will participate in the FTA project--along with the Germans and the French, who wish to replace the Transalls, but also along with the Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, the Turks and Belgians--or prefer to buy Lockheed's C-130 Js. The British need 60 aircraft. NH-90 Helicopter to Default. "But, if Great Britain does not want the FTA, the program will go on without her, and she will have no work contract awarded. The taxpayers on the continent could not comprehend the need to finance the part of a work that is to be given to a country not willing to participate in the project." Aerospatiale CEO has suggested to the British that if they were in such a hurry to modernize military fleet transport, a solution would be for them to "upgrade" their present Herculeses in stock, "while waiting for the arrival of the FTAs." "London's decision," Mr Gallois concluded somewhat solemnly, "is charged with consequences." Concerning France's ambition, expressed in the program project, to launch a (feasability) study for a new, over 600-km-range accuracy guided missile named APTDG, Mr. Gallois presented the candidacy of his group opposite to Matra's. According to Jean-Louis Fache, chief of "missiles" division, Aerospatiale's experience accumulated in ramjet propulsion, enables the group to design "a family of supersonic missiles starting from a common technological base," something which might lead to a 5-to-10 percent cost reduction per unit. As Mr. Gallois admitted, "If the solution chosen will be the ramjet, the question will arise as to cooperation with Matra." Finally, Aerospatiale's Eurocopter subsidiary--in partnership also with the German DASA--through the voice of its CEO, Jean-Francois Bigay, has alluded indirectly to leaving the NH-90 logistic (support) helicopter project, eliciting thus protests of seven different armies in Europe, the French army and navy included. Officially, the NH-90 program was launched in 1992, based on a multinational agreement and a development cost estimation totaling Fr10 billion over nine years. "All disclaimers," Mr Bigay warned, "will result in the cancellation of a commercial contract," with penalties imposed by the ones affected to the withdrawing signatories. "We are ready," he added, "to consider this helicopter forfeited." Mr. Bigay made it clear that the NH-90 should not exceed Fr85 million (excluding taxes) per unit, and that in the present state, development cost reductions exceeding 30 percent cannot be imagined--as this has been demanded by France from Eurocopter--without sharply downgrading this European helicopter's operational performance.
