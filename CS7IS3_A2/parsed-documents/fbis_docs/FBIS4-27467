Acting Foreign Secretary Tomas Padilla clarified, however, that the issuance of a passport to Benedicto does not mean he is being recognized as a Philippine citizen. There are reports that Benedicto is a Venezuelan citizen. Padilla said that once it is proven that Benedicto is no longer a Filipino his passport will be cancelled. The DFA's decision to issue a passport to Benedicto complies with the Sandiganbayan's [Anti-Graft Court] order. The court threatened to arrest and detain Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo if Benedicto was not given a passport.
