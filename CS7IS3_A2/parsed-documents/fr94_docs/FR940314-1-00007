FR940314-1-00007 FR940314-1-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;229&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F27 Series Airplanes (Excluding Mark 050 Series Airplanes) AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F27 series airplanes. This proposal would require accomplishment of certain structural modifications. This proposal is prompted by reports of incidents involving fatigue cracking and corrosion in transport category airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. These incidents have jeopardized the airworthiness of the affected airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent degradation in the structural capabilities of the affected airplanes. This action also reflects the FAA's decision that long term continued operational safety should be assured by actual modification of the airframe rather than repetitive inspections. DATES: Comments must be received by May 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;229&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
