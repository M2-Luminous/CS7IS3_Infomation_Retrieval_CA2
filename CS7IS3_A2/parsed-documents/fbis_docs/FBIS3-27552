Hosokawa warmly welcomed Zhu Rongji in the latter's visit to Japan. Zhu Rongji conveyed to Hosokawa the best regards of President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. Hosokawa expressed his thanks for this and asked Zhu Rongji to convey his best regards to President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. Zhu Rongji said to the prime minister: "You have attached great importance to the development of Sino-Japanese relations since you assumed office. We appreciate your efforts. President Jiang and you had a very fruitful meeting in Seattle last November. The common views shared by the two sides are important for promoting the development of the two countries' relations." Hosokawa said: "President Jiang Zemin and I indeed had very successful talks in Seattle. I myself am looking forward to visiting China in mid- or late March to further promote the development of Japanese-Chinese relations." Zhu Rongji said: "We are actively making preparations for your visit. You will be accorded a grand reception. Both President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng are looking forward to meeting you in Beijing in mid- or late March." Hosokawa said: "The Japanese Government is pleased to see the very rapid development of Japanese-Chinese economic relations and trade. Japanese-Chinese friendship is extremely significant. Not only is it in the interest of the two countries, but it also will benefit the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole. China's economy is full of vitality, and it is developing very fast. The development of Japanese-Chinese relations plays an important role in expediting Japan's economic recovery. During Deputy Prime Minister Hata's recent visit to China, our two countries reached a consensus of views on the way that the fourth yen loan should be extended. I evaluated the success highly." Zhu Rongji agreed with Hosokawa's observation. He said: Sino-Japanese joint ventures have played a major role in the rapid development of Sino-Japanese economic relations and trade. The goods produced by joint ventures, instead of competing with Japanese goods, will enhance Japanese-made goods' competitive and exploratory capabilities in the world market. Zhu Rongji said: "Ever since China embarked on the reform to build a market economy, the investment environment in China has improved significantly, and this is good for Japanese enterprises' investing in China and developing bilateral economic cooperation and trade. It is hoped that Japan will continue to render its support in this field. The deepening of the mutually beneficial and interdependent economic cooperation and trade between China and Japan will enhance the two countries' prosperity and will help promote peace, stability, and the development of the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole." Present at the meeting were He Chunlin, State Council deputy secretary general, and other principal members of Zhu Rongji's entourage, as well as Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Dunxin.
