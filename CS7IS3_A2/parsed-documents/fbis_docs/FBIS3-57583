The premier said he regrets such "energetic" reaction, which shows that Lithuania's neighbors "have not yet completely shaken off old principles and formulas." In Slezevicius' opinion, the problem also resulted from political tensions in Belarus. The Lithuanian premier said the arrest operation in Minsk was indeed very successful and fully coordinated with Belarusian authorities. Slezevicius said he will seek to further expand the earlier positive developments in Lithuanian-Belarussian relations.
