In this way he partly replied to the questions raised by his tour of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. One of the French president's aims was to shed some light on the conflicts in Central Asia at a time when attention is being focused on Bosnia, and on the Tajik conflict that may lead Russia to return to its old imperialist policy. That was certainly one of the reasons why he chose to visit these obscure Muslim states of the former USSR, going where no Western head of state had gone before; this is why he mobilized half a dozen aircraft and almost 400 people for the five-day state visit to areas with no modern infrastructure and where the heat is already crushing, especially on the many visits to archeological sites. It also explains why he has ignored the fact that the Uzbek and Turkmen presidents, although signatories to the CFCE accords, have blithely disregarded their provisions relating to civic freedoms. Internal Weaknesses President Mitterrand explained why he did not intend making demands on these countries which have never known democracy, nor "make accusations if not everything is done in Turkmenistan in the same way as it is done in Paris." If he came here despite everything, it was because he wanted to demonstrate his support for them, considering it important, for geopolitical reasons, that their fragile independence be defended. These two new states, potential targets for Russia's recolonizing ambitions, still depend on Russia for their security and are forward posts of the CIS and buffers for the Russian borders against Afghanistan and Iran. This perilous location is compounded by considerable internal weaknesses. Mr. Mitterrand said in Tashkent that there was the threat of "religious intolerance" being added to the "harshness of the times," i.e, the post-Soviet economic crisis that, in the case of Uzbekistan, is affecting the most densely populated country of central Asia, whose population grows by 500,000 each year. There is therefore every risk that sooner or later the extremists could get a stranglehold if foreign investments are delayed. There is also the risk that Uzbek President Islam Karimov will seek to position himself to an even greater extent as the leader of a regional power "imposing stability" not just on his own people, which Mr. Mitterrand welcomed, but also on his neighbors, all of which have Uzbek minorities. This, the French president indirectly condemned by praising the opposite stance adopted the Turkmen neighbors. Unlike Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan does not participate with the Russians in the "collective peace forces" deployed in Tajikstan. Also unlike Uzbekistan, and Iran and Pakistan, Turkmenistan is not involved in the inter-Afghan conflicts except as an attempted mediator. According to a presidential spokesman, the Turkmen president told Mr. Mitterrand that they were waiting for a "new man to emerge in the Pashtoon groups, capable of triggering national reconciliation." Targeting the Insidious Forces President Niyazov has good reasons for implementing this wise foreign policy. With less than 4 million inhabitants but a vast area rich in gas reserves and a border of over 1,000 km with Iran, his country may look easy prey. Mr. Mitterrand told him on Thursday at the official dinner: "Your independence is certainly not threatened and the usurpation of power today is done by more insidious means, without necessarily requiring recourse to arms." The "insidious" forces he targeted are not so much the Iranians, neighbors with whom Mr. Niazov claimed he had no problems, as the Russians, since the only gas pipeline leaving the Turkmen gas fields crosses through Russian territory, supplying the insolvent countries of the CIS. Thus, Mr. Niyazov is a proponent of building a second gas pipeline to the south, toward the European markets. Mr. Mitterrand pleased his host by stating on Wednesday that he did not share Washington's objections at sending the pipeline through Iran. He also pleased him by promising, as he had also promised the Uzbek president, that he would soon be sending a French military mission to look into the possibility of cooperation in the domain of air traffic control training and border patrols. These cooperation plans could also be envisaged within the framework of the NATO Partnership for Peace. With regard to this, the Turkmen president apparently amazed his French interlocutors by saying that he had already signed the framework agreement of the partnership. Undoubtedly satisfied, on Wednesday the Turkmen president also agreed to sign an agreement with [French construction magnate] Martin Bouygues, who traveled in the presidential plane. This agreement covers the construction of the new presidential palace in Ashgabat and has been in the making for over a year. It is worth 400 million French francs, payable in cash during the construction work. It is certainly quite legitimate and within the rules for a presidential visit to open the door for French companies. However, the Bouygues contract, which is not a priority in a country whose new currency has plummeted over recent months, could feed the discontent of the Turkmen people, despite the pride they might take in seeing their president well-housed. That was certainly not one of the aims of Francois Mitterrand's visit.
