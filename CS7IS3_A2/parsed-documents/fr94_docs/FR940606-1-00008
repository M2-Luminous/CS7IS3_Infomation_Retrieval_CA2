FR940606-1-00008 FR940606-1-00004 The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designations for Class D and Class E airspace are published respectively in paragraphs 5000 and 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993 and effective September 16, 1993 which is incorporated by reference in CFR 71.1 effective September 16, 1993. The Class D and E airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine modifications are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (Air).
