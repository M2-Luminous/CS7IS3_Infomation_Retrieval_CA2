The accord, signed last week in Washington and part of an overall agreement between both sides to form a loose federation, calls for mortars to be pulled back 10 kilometres (six miles) from front lines in southern and central Bosnia and tanks and artillery 20 kilometres (12 miles). All other heavy weapons are to be placed under UN control. The ceasefire, patterned after a similar truce for Sarajevo, has generally been holding well with only sporadic incidents reported, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman Major Jose Labandeira said Monday. He said Croat HVO [Croatian Defense Council] forces began to withdraw heavy weapons from the southern town of Mostar and the central town of Kiseljak on Sunday and that several artillery pieces had been handed over at UN collection sites. The Bosnian Army had also marked minefields between Kiseljak and Bosovaca, Labandeira said. "The HVO and BIH (Bosnian Army) continue to cooperate very well," he said. The two former allies began fighting last May when the Croats moved to carve a separate state for themselves in southwest Bosnia. They agreed to sign the U.S.-brokered truce last week in a bid to isolate Bosnia's Serb faction at peace talks and end a two-year war that has claimed some 200,000 lives. [passage omitted] Meanwhile in Sarajevo a nearly monthlong ceasefire was holding Monday despite continued fighting in one stubborn pocket. UNPROFOR spokesman Captain Niels Otto Pedersen said the main battlefront in Bosnia had moved to the northerwestern town of Maglaj which was undergoing heavy Serb shelling according to British UN troops stationed nearby. The Serbs were also continuing to block humanitarian aid from reaching the city, UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Kris Janowski told reporters. He said that even if current NATO airdrops of food worked perfectly, which is not the case, this would meet only half the food needs of the city's population of 16,000. "I know the human situation is critical" in Maglaj, Janowski said. In other developments, Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas arrived in Zagreb on Monday to meet with Croatian and UN officials before heading to Sarajevo on Tuesday. Sweden has peacekeeping troops deployed in Sarajevo and the northern town of Tuzla, where the UN is to take control of the airport so that humanitarian aid can be flown in to the Serb-besieged town. Bosnian Serb officials agreed Sunday to the creation of two air-corridors into Tuzla, where Russian military observers are to be deployed to ensure that no military equipment reaches the Moslems.
