FR940303-2-00019 FR940303-2-00015 I. Residential Housing Component 1. Residential housing and associated road construction on 119 acres of degraded wetlands and 75 non-jurisdictional acres along the inland edge of the site (Applicant's Preferred Action). The applicant contends that this alternative will provide it with sufficient usable property in the lowland to enable it to restore and convey in perpetuity the balance of its lowland holdings (approximately 767 acres) to the County of Orange. This conveyed property would be restored by the applicant in accordance with one of the restoration alternatives listed in Section II below. 2. Residential development and construction of a navigable ocean entrance and public marina with associated commercial uses. Like alternative I.1, this alternative is intended to enable the applicant to restore and convey the remainder of the lowland to the County of Orange. 3. Residential development in the areas known as the Bolsa Pocket and Edward's Thumb. The Bolsa Pocket is an area situated between the East Garden Grove-Wintersburg Flood Control Channel and the base of the Bolsa Chica mesa. Edward's Thumb is an area situated in the northeast corner of the lowland. Like alternative I.1, this alternative is intended to enable the applicant to restore and convey the remainder of the lowland to the County of Orange. 4. Creation of wetlands mitigation bank in the lowland with no lowland residential development. 5. Acquisition of the lowland by a public entity or a non-profit organization and restoration by same in accordance with one of the restoration alternatives listed in Section II below. This alternative will be analyzed with and without the development of a public parkland area along the inland edge of the site. In either case, there would be no lowland residential development. 6. No action. II. Wetlands Restoration Component 1. Full tidal restoration with construction of a non-navigable tidal inlet (Applicant's Preferred Action). This alternative includes the removal of many of the roads and oil drilling pads that traverse the Bolsa Chica lowland and requires significant excavation and discharge of fill in the central portion of the lowland in order to create a suitable tidal prism for enhancement of the ecosystem. 2. Muted tidal restoration without construction of a tidal inlet. This alternative differs in significant respects from alternative II.1 in that it would rely on an increased tidal exchange from the adjoining Huntington Harbour instead of the non-navigable inlet. 3. Minimal restoration without increased tidal action either from Huntington Harbor or from a new tidal inlet. The roads and drilling pads that traverse the lowland would largely be left intact. New water sources to the lowland would be created by breaching the California department of Fish and Game levee and the Freeman Creek corridor. 4. No action. III. Flood Control Modifications 1. Modifications to the East Garden Grove-Wintersburg Flood Control Channel that involve removing approximately 1.2 acres of embankment dirt for purposes of widening the existing channel and discharge flow into the lowland area. (Applicant's Preferred Action). 2. Modifications to the flood control channel that involve excavating the Outer Bolsa Bay at the channel outlet. 3. No action. IV. Plan Packages Based on a preliminary review of a reasonable range of alternatives, the following plan packages have been identified for a more comprehensive review in the EIS. All of the following include residential development on the Bolsa Chica Mesa. It is anticipated that the final design may encompass one or more of the components described in sections I, II, and III, but not necessarily as described below. 1. Applicant's Preferred Action: Residential development in the lowlands adjacent to the existing homes (I.1); full tidal restoration (II.1); in-channel flood control modifications (III.1). 2. Residential development in the Bolsa Pocket and Edward's Thumb areas (I.3); minimal wetlands restoration (II.3); flood control modifications involving Outer Bolsa Bay (III.2). 3. Acquisition and restoration of the lowland by a public agency or nonprofit organization (I.5); muted tidal restoration (II.2); flood control modifications involving Outer Bolsa Bay (III.2). This alternative will be analyzed with and without the development of a public parkland area in the lowlands adjacent to the existing homes. 4. Creation of a wetlands mitigation bank (I.4); full tidal restoration (II.1); in-channel flood control modifications (III.1). 5. Residential development and creation of a public marina with a navigable ocean entrance (I.2); full tidal restoration (II.1); in-channel flood control modifications (III.1). 6. No action (I.6); no action (II.4); no action (III.3). Scoping Process The Corps of Engineers invites input from other Federal, state, and local agencies, Native Americans, and other interested private organizations and individuals to comment on the scope of this EIS, including the range of alternatives and issues to be addressed. In addition, a public notice in area newspapers will be published for purposes of soliciting public comments so as to assess public concerns regarding the appropriate scope and preparation of the draft EIS. Other related public environmental assessments that have been prepared for this project include the Draft Environmental Impact Report for the Bolsa Chica Project, prepared by the Orange County Environmental Management Agency (December 20, 1993). The Corps of Engineers will also be consulting with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under the Endangered Species Act and Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, and with the State Office of Historic Preservation under the National Historic Preservation Act. Additionally, the EIS will assess the consistency of the proposed action with the Coastal Zone Management Act, as well as executive orders on wetlands and floodplain protection. Availability of the Draft EIS The Draft EIS is expected to be published and circulated in late Spring 1994, and a Public Hearing will be held after its publication. Kenneth L.
