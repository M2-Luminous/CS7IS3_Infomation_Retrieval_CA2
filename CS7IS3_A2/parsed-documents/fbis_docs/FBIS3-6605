At a news conference on 17 March, he referred to automakers' efforts to work out voluntary plans for expanding purchase of foreign-made auto and auto parts, and said: "Our import expansion plans are being discussed as voluntary efforts of the private sector. We want no comments from the government." His statement was made to check government officials' attempt to incorporate the purchase plan into their market opening package. At the same time, he severely criticized U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor's demand for the Japanese Government's guarantee for fulfilling parts purchasing targets, stressing the Kantor remark is "an attempt to ruin our efforts." Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Nissan, are individually mapping out plans for purchasing foreign-made auto parts. Chairman Kume said the JAMA is "planning business talks with auto and auto parts manufacturers not only of the United States, but also of Europe and other countries." To demonstrate "the industrial circles' initiative," the automakers' import expansion plan is expected to be released before the government's package. However, Chairman Kume noted "our plan is intended to assist foreign manufacturers, and it is not the JAMA's numerical target." Touching particularly on USTR Kantor's demand for the Japanese Government's guarantee for the amount of auto parts imports, Kume said: "That is a very improper remark which may ruin automakers' initiative to better the Japan-U.S. relations." Expansion of Japanese automakers' purchase of foreign-made autos and auto parts is the focal point of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. In connection with this, some quarters in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] say "automakers' voluntary efforts should be added to our offer to the United States." MITI Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano hinted on 17 March at possibilities of merging the JAMA's parts purchase plan into the government's market opening package, saying: "I do not know contents of the private sector's plan, but we are considering (if it should be incorporated in the government's package)." Under such circumstances, the automakers are wary of their voluntary efforts becoming "the government's formal pledge." A top official of a major automaker expressed his deep-rooted concern, saying: "At last, figures will go out of our control, and the private sector will have to suffer from them." Chairman Kume showed discord between the public and private sectors on this issue, stressing: "Since this is a voluntary effort of the industrial circles, the government's intervention would become an obstacle."
