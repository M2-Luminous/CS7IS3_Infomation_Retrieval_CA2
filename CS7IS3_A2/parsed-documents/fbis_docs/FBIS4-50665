On 15 May, THE SUNDAY TIMES carried a special dispatch which said that Nelson Mandela, who has just been elected president, will "resign from the post of president of South Africa within two years," and that this would "cause a power struggle within the African National Congress." The next morning, the BBC broadcast a so-called documentary which had carefully pulled together various pieces to claim that "China has 10 million prisoners in labor camps, who are in a hopeless situation." When these rumors came out, they were immediately refuted solemnly and forcefully by Mandela himself and by a spokesman from our country's Foreign Ministry. On the same day THE SUNDAY TIMES carried its strange report, Mandela issued a statement which said "that the article is totally groundless and is sheer rumor, its purpose is to create instability in the first democratically elected government." On 17 May, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman listed facts to point out that the allegations by the BBC were "sheer fabrications." It is not a coincidence that these two British news agencies one after the other resorted to this kind of trick to slander South Africa and China; it is a natural revelation of the dark side in the minds of a small minority of Britons who hate to see advancement in the world. South Africa, which was once under British colonial rule, has got rid of numerous obstacles, cast off the chains of racism, obtained a new life, and embarked upon a road of national reconciliation and peaceful and stable development of the country; China, implementing the policy of reform and opening up, enjoys economic prosperity, social stability, and national unity, and is firmly fulfilling the historic mission of resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong. Some people in Britain do not want to see any of these things, but they have no alternative, and although they have tried something which overrates their strength, these moves resemble a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Therefore, they have used disgraceful means and did not hesitate to create materials and spread rumors in an attempt to cheat the world and create trouble for the countries to which they are hostile in order to find pretexts to interfere in their internal affairs. The BBC and THE SUNDAY TIMES always claim that they are "objective and just" in their reporting. But facts prove that they say something in one way and do something another way, and even play a disgraceful role in fabricating rumors to mislead people. Regarding this, I do not know what kind of explanation they have to offer to the British public and international public opinion circles.
