But Germany has not had any money since unification. In the European Union [EU] prosperity league, Germany has fallen from second place to sixth or seventh place; at the end of 1995 the national debt, including the debts of the former GDR, will have reached 2.1 trillion marks [DM]. Expenditures have reached the almost prohibitive level of 45 percent of the budget. We should also not be ashamed to discuss "disparities" in financial contributions to the EU in front of our European friends, many of whom deserve our thanks for their support for German unification and for eastern Germany's integration into the EU. A good friendship must also include money. The reduction of the high German net contribution to the EU forms part of the European agenda. In 1993, Germany's net contribution to the EU was DM23.6 billion. It is supposed to rise to DM25 billion this year. The German Bundesbank assumes that it will reach DM30 billion in 1997. Were it not for German unification and the consequent reflux of EU funds, especially since 1994, Germany's payments to the EU would have been even greater. A reduction in the German contribution can hardly be achieved by means of a mere increase in the financial reflux from Brussels and the application of a red pencil to EU expenses, most of which have already been decided upon. That would require an alteration to the entire system of financing the EU. But the government, faithful to the motto "Pacta sunt servanda," [agreements must be observed] does not dare try to make the financial principles which the EC heads of state and government signed in Edinburgh in 1992 and which remain valid until 1999 the subject of new discussions. In Edinburgh, the European Council merely tried to induce the European Commission to produce by 1999 a report on the functioning of the individual finance system in the EU. [passage omitted] Helmut Kohl, for whom Europe unification is with good reason the other side of German unification, wants to achieve progress in the process of EU consolidation. He is handling the subject of EU finances with tact. In the Bundestag European debate he said: "It is true that we, as the economically strongest country, pay more to the EU than anyone else, because we have the greatest advantage. But it is also true that in the future, the concept of EU finances must be geared more strongly to per capita income in the individual countries. Our aim is that other member countries with a per capita income similar to ours should assume more financial responsibility than in the past." Helmut Kohl, duty president of the EU as of 1 July, will have to accept the fact that Germany's high net contribution to the EU is going to be a topic of the election campaign.
