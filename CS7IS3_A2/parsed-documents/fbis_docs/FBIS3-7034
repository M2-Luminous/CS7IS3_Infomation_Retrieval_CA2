Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says his remarks were an anti-compatriot declaration for cutting off even the bonds between the North and the South as the same nation, and a declaration of confrontation and war. The analyst says: Rejecting fellow countrymen and pursuing confrontation and war is inconceivable for a Korean. The traitor Kim Chong-pil is a pro-Japanese, pro-American stooge and an anti-communist fascist who served the defunct dictator Pak Chong-hui as his right-hand man and prolonged his dirty life by depending on outside forces, estranged from the fellow countrymen. A MINJU CHOSON analyst says such a traitor as Kim Chong-pil, who is fostering antagonism and confrontation within the nation and bringing the situation to an all the more grave phase must be removed with the traitor Kim Yong-sam.
