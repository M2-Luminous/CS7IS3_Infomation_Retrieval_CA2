True, since the beginning of the year Kazan has incurred a debt of 43 billion rubles, but this is mainly because of mutual non-payments between enterprises. [Yeltsin] We are living in accordance with the treaty. You understand? In the treaty we have divided up the functions between the state powers of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation. Each has undertaken certain functions which it is performing and for which it must be responsible, and for which it must receive money. So sources are obtained from here and from there. So it cannot be called subsidies. It is simply the correct distribution of labor and finance. [passage omitted]
