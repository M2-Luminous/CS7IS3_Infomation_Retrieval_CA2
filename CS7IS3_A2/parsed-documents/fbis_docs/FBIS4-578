As always, the UN special representative did not hazard any guesses, though he believes in a favorable outcome to the Lusaka peace talks. [Begin Beye recording, in French with passage-by-passage translation into Portuguese] If someone could come up with a way for us to achieve peace, I would immediately seek and consult with that person. [end recording] While in Luanda, the UN special representative was received by President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos and National Assembly Chairman Fernando Franca van Dunem. Blondin Beye was not willing to reveal the nature of his talks with the Angolan head of state or with the National Assembly chairman, saying it would be discourteous to do so. [Begin Beye recording in French, fading into Portuguese translation] It would be irresponsible on my part to leave the president of the Republic's office and promptly tell you: Here, this is what he has just told me. I do not intend to be disrespectful toward the Angolan people. I cannot do that. I want to work for peace, so I cannot disclose (?things like that). [end recording
