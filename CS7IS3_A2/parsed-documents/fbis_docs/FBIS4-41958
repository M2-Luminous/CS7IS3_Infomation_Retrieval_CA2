RACOC Press Center staffers explained that, on the eve of the operation, several mass media organs reported that an operation was being prepared.... But was it only this "public disclosure" which played a part in the operation's failure? Having checked out 689 facilities around Moscow and practically cordoned off the city (43 Dzerzhinskiy Division pickets were on the roads into and out of Moscow), the militia detained 2,251 people. Some 759 of the detainees had administrative proceedings instituted against them (mostly for breaking the city's residence regulations). No criminals were found among the detainees and they were all released. Some 1,053 motor vehicles together with 27 parking lots were also inspected during operation "Hurricane." In the opinion of RACOC, the success of this massive operation lies in the detection of 119 economic crimes (of which 8 were committed earlier) and in the closure of 193 commercial enterprises for various offenses. A total of 196 commercial enterprises, 14 hotels, 36 companies and banks, and four markets were checked. A total of 219 crimes were exposed (it is unknown what they were, given that, according to information from RACOC, criminal proceedings were not instituted). Obviously, a serious discussion of the massive operations still lies ahead. But their benefit to the city treasury is clear -- as much as 119 million rubles in fines were exacted. But this argument is hardly likely to work with taxpayers -- much more is spent on maintaining the law enforcement agencies and carrying out large-scale actions like "Hurricane." Finally, on the subject of the results achieved. RACOC staffers consider that the sheer fact that the criminal elements did not turn up at their previously known hangouts is evidence that the gangs fear and respect the law enforcement agencies. But it is also evidence of something else -- the service for the surveillance and analysis of criminal groups works much better than the defenders of public order and our security. For this reason there is little to rejoice at. Perhaps the only people who will be happy are the capital's champions of "universal equality," as well they might be now that they can, after all, burst into and turn upside down any enterprise in any form of ownership.... The reasons for our law enforcement officers' failures and their long-term plans for combatting crime will be discussed in a conversation with RACOC Leader Vladimir Rushaylo, who has kindly agreed to meet our IZVESTIYA correspondent.
