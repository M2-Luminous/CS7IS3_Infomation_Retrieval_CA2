He said that Libya possesses rockets capable of hitting targets in southern France, Italy, and Spain. JANA's international affairs editor commented on this statement. He said: This is the second statement of its kind made by the British defense secretary in less than a month. This confirms that the statements of the British officials constitute part of a psychological terrorist campaign that has been continuously waged by western colonialist circles against the Libyan people and its revolution. This campaign aims at distorting the image of the Great Jamahiriyah before international public opinion, in an attempt to prepare it to accept any irresponsible action that could be taken or carried out against the Jamahiriyah. This reminds us of the huge campaign of lies and distortion that preceded the aggression against Libya half-way through the month of al-Tayr in 1986. These allegations launched by some western officials against the Great Jamahiriyah could only be considered real official terrorism which is inseparable from the unfair sanctions imposed on Libya in the name of the Security Council by Western countries which dominate this council. The Great Jamahiriyah has repeatedly stressed that it does not have the capacity to own those destructive weapons, and that it has never been interested in them or thought of possessing them because it was mainly busy building its economy and achieving self-sufficiency in food and water and implementing its development plans despite those unjust coercive measures that seek to obstruct that and deprive Libyans from building development on their land. History shows that we have never threatened or attacked the Europeans in their lands because we consider them human beings and respect them. As for those who make such statements, history witnesses that it is they whose relations with us have always been those of invasion, colonization, and ongoing attempts to dominate us and control our destiny.
