While examining and discussing the government work report, Hu Jintao probed ways to promote economic development in central and western China with the deputies. Deputy Zhang Wule, acting governor of Gansu, was the first to speak: Gansu's economic development was fairly healthy in recent years and saw a growth rate of 8 to 10 percent every year. Its total output value of goods and services reached 34.9 billion yuan last year. Hu Jintao was very pleased to hear this. Speaking on some reform programs for this year, Zhang Wule expressed his full support for the central authorities' decisions and noted that these reforms were, in general, favorable to Gansu's economic development and that temporary difficulties could be overcome. Then, he spoke on problems in helping Gansu's poor areas extricate themselves from poverty and become prosperous; running large and medium-sized state enterprises well; developing village and town enterprises; and correctly handling relations among reform, development, and stability. Hu Jintao, who knows Gansu's conditions very well, asked directors and managers from Lanzhou Petroleum Processing and Chemical Complex, Lanzhou Chemical Industrial Corporation, and the Jinchuan Nonferrous Metals Corporation about the operation of their respective enterprises. Guo Xilian, Yang Jinyi, and other deputies answered his questions. They reported: Presently, large and medium-sized state enterprises are facing the problems of antiquated equipment, heavy social burdens, and poor internal management. The fundamental way out of such a difficult position lies in deepening reform, changing operating mechanisms, and accelerating the establishment of a modern enterprise system compatible with a socialist market economy. When Deputy Gu Jun, administrative commissioner of Dingxi prefecture, touched on antipoverty work in the prefecture, Hu Jintao asked with concern: "Have people there resolved the problem of inadequate food and clothing?" Gu Jun replied: "An overwhelming majority of them have basically resolved this problem. Now the per capita apportionment of food in the prefecture is nearly 300 kg and per capita income for peasants is about 500 yuan. The major contradiction in antipoverty work has shifted from the settlement of the food problem to ways to increase peasants' income. To adjust ourselves to the new situation, we will make corresponding changes in our ideology and work methods." Hu Jintao nodded with satisfaction after hearing this. In his remarks Deputy Lu Kejian, chairman of the Gansu Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, proposed that it was necessary to gradually intensify the supervision over governments, people's courts, and people's procuratorates by people's congress and their standing committees at various levels, and to gradually have this work done in accordance with standards, procedures, and laws. Hu Jintao said: The system of people's congress is China's basic political system and a good form for inviting people to be their own masters. In the course of establishing socialist democracy, we should further strengthen this system and constantly improve it in practice. Deputy Zheng Jinxia, a female health worker from Zhennan village, Dongxian county -- the most remote, poor area of Gansu -- reported that schools run by the people in the villages could not pay teachers on time and they had difficult lives. She hoped that the central authorities would attach importance to and tackle this problem. "You have put forward an excellent opinion!" said Hu Jintao loudly, "authorities from central to local levels must resolve to settle this problem. We would rather cut a project or cancel a construction project than default teachers' wages. Wages for teachers working in areas with hard conditions should, in particular, be ensured by taking special measures." Hu Jintao asked Gansu's party and government leading cadres sitting amid the deputies: "Do you agree or not?" Gansu Provincial Party Secretary Yan Haiwang said: "I absolutely agree. We will resolve this problem appropriately." After hearing deputies' remarks, Hu Jintao first expressed his nostalgia and concern over the land of Gansu itself and people of various nationalities there. He noted: Over the past decade or so, Gansu, like other parts of the country, has brought about a significant change in its appearance through firm adherence to the party's basic line and unity and hard work of people throughout the province. They have particularly implemented the guidance in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talk during his south China tour and the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and have further emancipated their minds to achieve new progress in various aspects of work. This has further strengthened our confidence in taking the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Hu Jintao said: There is one important reward from this session -- deputies have generally reached a consensus in the basic principles and overall interests for the work of the entire party and the whole country, which has laid a good ideological foundation for accomplishing all sorts of work for this year more satisfactorily. Now that the tasks are set and the general policies and principles are defined, as long as we unswervingly adhere to the central authorities' arrangement; keep the overall situation in mind; work in a down-to-earth manner; and correctly and properly handle the relations among reform, development, and stability, we are sure to complete all sorts of work well this year. Hu Jintao noted: To enliven Gansu's economy, we should, first of all, further emancipate the minds, get a clear understanding of the situation, seize the opportunity, and use new ideas and new concepts suitable for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure to guide our work. We should proceed from specific conditions in Gansu, promote development with opening up and reform, take the advantage of local conditions, and make good use of our own superiority. It is necessary to attach great importance to and strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the national economy; improve the basic conditions for agricultural production; gradually readjust the economic structure in rural areas after ensuring stable grain production; develop high-yield, fine-quality, and high- efficiency agriculture; vigorously develop village and town enterprises; and strive to increase peasants' income. We should further invigorate large and medium-sized state enterprises and continue to enable them to play the role as a mainstay in the national economy. We should encourage the social practice of respecting knowledge and professionals and promote economic development by relying on scientific progress. We should further enhance unity among various nationalities and maintain social stability, so that Gansu will achieve better results in various aspects of work.
