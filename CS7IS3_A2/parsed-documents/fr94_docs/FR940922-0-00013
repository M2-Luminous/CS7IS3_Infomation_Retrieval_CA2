FR940922-0-00013 FR940922-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 38 CFR Part 36 RIN 2900&hyph;AG55 Loan Guaranty: Increase in Attorney Fees AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final Regulatory Amendments. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its loan guaranty regulations to increase from $700 to $850 the maximum allowable amount VA will reimburse a loan holder for the cost of trustee's fees and legal services incurred by the holder in liquidating a loan guaranteed by VA. Increasing the maximum allowable amount will make it easier for holders to retain experience legal counsel to perform required foreclosures in a timely manner. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 24, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Leonard Levy, Assistant Director for Loan Management (261), Loan Guaranty Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20420, (202) 233&hyph;3668. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 22, 1993, VA published in the Federal Register (58 FR 49253) proposed regulations on increasing the maximum allowable amount VA will reimburse a loan holder for the cost of trustee's fees and legal services. Five comments were received on the proposed amendments. Four commenters approved of the change. One commenter stated that increasing the maximum allowable amount will not make it easier to retain experienced counsel in areas where the local VA offices do not choose to reimburse attorneys the maximum allowable amount. This commenter further suggested that the local offices be required to raise the amount they reimburse attorneys to the maximum allowable amount. The regulations are adopted as originally proposed. The suggestion that regional offices be required to pay the maximum allowable amount when they reimburse attorneys has not been adopted. We believe that local VA offices have the experience and knowledge necessary to determine the appropriate level of attorney and trustee fees for foreclosure processing in their various areas of jurisdiction. The Secretary hereby certifies that the final regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. Increasing the amount VA will reimburse holders for trustee's fees and legal services will make it easier for holders to retain experienced legal counsel to perform required foreclosures.
