In a speech to defence ministers from both the NATO countries and the former Soviet bloc, Pavel suggested the consultations be held regularly between political leaders, experts or military chiefs, as well as to look at emergency situations. Grachev the previous day announced Moscow was no longer setting conditions to join the PFP, drawing warm praise from U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry earlier on Wednesday. Perry said Grachev had given "an excellent presentation" to the NATO ministers on Tuesday on Russia's new military doctrine to replace the security blueprint of the defunct Soviet Union. "It was a truly historic event," he said, adding that it was his fifth meeting with Grachev. "We've become really close colleagues in resolving security issues of our two countries," Perry said. Grachev said Russia was not insisting on special political links with NATO as the price for signing the PFP, which has already been joined by 16 countries of the old Soviet bloc. But he said Russia still had a list detailing its requirements for PFP participation, and still wanted links with NATO outside the Partnership.
