Kozyrev made the remarks at a press conference here when talking about the downing of four aircraft earlier today by two U.S. F-16 fighters in the no-fly zone over Bosnia. He said that as aircraft will inevitably appear in the region sooner or later, it has become more necessary to solve all the issues in Bosnia through peaceful means. Violators of a peace approach should realize the grave consequences of their behavior, he warned. Kozyrev said it cannot be confirmed that the aircraft shot down came from the Bosnian Serb side because all the three warring parties possess such planes.
