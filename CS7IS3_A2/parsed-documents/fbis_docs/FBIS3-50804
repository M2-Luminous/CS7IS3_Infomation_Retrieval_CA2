The ministry also expressed hopes that the conflict would prove temporary because commercial relations could be negatively affected in both Mexico and Guatemala. The Foreign Trade Ministry emphatically denied that the meeting between Mexican and Guatemalan trade authorities scheduled for 30 November in Tabasco was suspended due to the recent armed conflicts, saying that the meeting was postponed for administrative and strategic reasons and noting that the conflicts had not even begun when the decision was made. The Foreign Trade Ministry also emphasized that talks are being held with Mexican economic authorities to establish new routes for the products. If the armed conflict continues, it is highly probable that trade will practically come to a standstill, thus bringing negative consequences, the ministry concluded.
