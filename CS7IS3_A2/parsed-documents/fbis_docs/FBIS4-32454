They made it clear that there remained five armed soldiers and three to four unarmed soldiers. The situation in this village, 12 kilometers south-west of Benkovac, which is situated within the so-called buffer zone and which is regarded by both sides as "a sensitive area," was described by the sector commander Czech General Rostislav Kotil and head of civilian affairs Enrico Aguillar, and press spokesman Alun Roberts. In their words, this was a very serious violation of the cease-fire agreement since about 100 Serb soldiers entered the buffer zone without giving any notice. Roberts said that UNPROFOR's Canadian troops had denied neither access to the waterworks system nor passage through the village of Kakma, while military observers have not noticed any concentration of Croatian forces, nor have they seen any relocation of heavy weaponry near Biograd. He told the press that yesterday a member of the negotiating team, Colonel Duburg, had visited Knin and met General Mile Novakovic, the head of Krajina's central commission for the implementation of the Zagreb agreement. They agreed to hold a meeting this afternoon between Gen. Novakovic and Bertrand de Lapresle, the UNPROFOR commander for the former Yugoslavia, probably in Topusko. A meeting of the central commission was also suggested in order to normalize the situation as soon as possible. Sector Commander Gen. Kotil was speaking about a meeting he held in Kakma yesterday with Colonel Alavanja, the commander of the North Dalmatian Corps of the Krajina army and the commander of the unit that had entered Kakma. According to him, he suggested that mixed patrols, including UNPROFOR and the militia of the republic of Serb Krajina, be set up so they could patrol this area. He agreed that all repairs to the waterworks should stop. Kotil expressed satisfaction with the latest improved situation and stressed that he understood how sensitive the Kakma area was, given the fact that it supplied water to a number of towns. Asked by a reporter whether UNPROFOR would withdraw its armored carriers from this area -- at the moment there are as many as 25 of them [carriers] -- he said that it was too early to talk about UNPROFOR's further activities but he could not accept any claim that UNPROFOR forces occupied Serbian villages.
