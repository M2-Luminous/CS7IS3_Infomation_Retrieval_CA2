Jericho tomorrow and Gaza next week. The challenges are great and you must have something to say on this occasion? [Sha'th] The Palestinian people have been anticipating this day for a long time. True, there are challenges and difficulties and, true, there is responsibility that comes with freedom, but this is the opportunity for the Palestinian people to govern themselves on their soil. It starts here in Gaza and Jericho. This is the starting point for a people who have suffered for a long time. Now, the horizons of freedom and independence have begun to be seen over their soil. This people and their leadership must rise to the level of responsibility. Freedom and independence, even at the starting point, means great responsibility in terms of the people's security, freedom, free expression, participation in decisions, and the tiring work to achieve economic development and social justice. All these things are required from us when we take the first step in Gaza and Jericho. [Mu'addi] The challenges are great, and the PLO is suffering a financial crisis that even caused a delay in the transfer of powers. What has happened? [Sha'th] Yes, we are facing a financial problem. This problem has made our entry more difficult, but we are gradually overcoming this problem. I am confident that the presence of the police force inside Gaza and Jericho will be received with thousands of invitations and real support from the citizens. I believe we have all seen the cordial welcome they received. This, however, will not substitute for the money needed for equipment, uniforms, and transportation. We are seriously seeking to overcome these problems. The United States and the European Union have pledged funds, while equipment and other items will be coming from Japan, France, Greece, Germany, and other countries. We are working day and night to realize this support and transfer it to the Palestinian police force as soon as possible. [Mu'addi] What will be the future steps after the assumption of powers and the establishment of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, which will apparently start be next week? [Sha'th] I have always told people the difficult phase is over, but the more difficult phase is still ahead of us. Undoubtedly, the transfer is important, but now we have to discuss how to form a competent, clean, and responsible government. How do we start the measures for economic development? How do we start preparations for elections? Above all, how do we continue negotiations to assume powers in the West Bank and reach an agreement on the interim phase in the West Bank and Gaza which will lead to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from cities and camps in the West Bank? All these matters are required. Some resulted from the signing of the agreement. Other topics must also be discussed after the transfer to Gaza and Jericho. These are missions for the forthcoming phase. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th has struggled for a long time to see the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. Will Nabil Sha'th be a member of the long-awaited Palestinian national authority? [Sha'th] I will do whatever I am asked to do by my people and leadership. I devoted myself a long time ago to serve this people and their cause. I will not hesitate to serve my people in any position. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much. [Sha'th] Thank you, brother.
