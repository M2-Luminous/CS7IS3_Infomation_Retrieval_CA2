Public television Monday evening [28 February] announced that Alfieri, who is believed to hold the key to the hidden connections between organized crime and politicians, had begun to provide information to investigators three weeks ago. Judicial sources at the Naples court later confirmed the report. Alfieri, reputedly the richest of Camorra bosses, was arrested in September 1992 following accusations made by another boss turned informer, Pasquale Galasso, who accused Alfieri of involvement in several gang murders. Perhaps most importantly, investigators hope Alfieri may shed light on collusions between his own clan and prominent political figures, public administrators and magistrates, connections alleged by Galasso in previous testimony. Alfieri is reportedly being questioned at an undisclosed location. He is also suspected of involvement in money laundering and extortion. The sources stressed that there was no link between Alfieri's decision to talk and the announcement made last month by the Bishop of Acerra, Antonio Riboldi, that hundreds of the clan's members were ready to turn themselves in. He was arrested by police in September 1992 after 10 years in hiding. He was found guilty but then acquitted by an appeals court for the murder of eight people at Torre Annunziata, near Naples, in 1984.
