The NP's Daryl Swanepoel was reacting to a recent statement by the Azanian Students Movement [Azasm] and threats made by the movement against white teachers in black schools. Azasm said earlier in the week threatened the lives and safety of white teachers, saying blacks would "re-enact June 16 [student uprising in Soweto] and fight with our bare hands". [sentence as received] Mr Swanepoel, a member of the provincial legislature and party spokesman for the Johannesburg and Soweto region, said the NP strongly condemned the racist statements of Azasm National Deputy President Kgomotso Modiselle. "Sentiments such as those expressed by Azasm are totally against the will of the people. They are a return to the dark days we all thought were behind us," said Mr Swanepoel. He said it was sad to see there were still people in South Africa who were prepared to sacrifice the futures of young South Africans to fanatical political ideologies. "The NP trusts the government will respond to these threats and destroy the seeds of intimidation and destabilisation before they take root. We all thought that the only bits of racism left in our country were on the lunatic right. Now we find there is a lunatic fringe on the left as well and it is just as dangerous."
