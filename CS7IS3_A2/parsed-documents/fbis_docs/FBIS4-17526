[passage omitted] [Correspondent T. Aldoshina] Representatives of political parties and public movements will be given air time and, with it, an opportunity to make their opinion known to the people - especially on the eve of the signing of the civic accord agreement. Their right to do this is guaranteed by a presidential decree. Its existence became known at today's meeting of Boris Yeltsin with representatives of the factions of the State Duma. This concession to the parties' demands was made by the president in order to confirm that there are alternatives to extremism and confrontation in Russia. The obligations proclaimed by those who are going to sign the agreement contain a hope for successful implementation of the idea of civic peace. [Begin Yeltsin recording] We are talking not about an ordinary compromise. It is capable of saving Russia at the present stage. At the same time, the participants in the agreement are by no means renouncing their convictions, programs, and platforms - there is no need for that. On the contrary, one of the aims of the agreement is to offer to all political forces peaceful, non-violent ways of achieving their goals. [end recording] [Aldoshina] Yeltsin aide Georgiy Satarov has described the attitudes of the faction leaders to the idea of an all-saving compromise, namely civic accord. In his opinion, virtually all of those present at today's meeting with the president spoke in favor of signing the agreement. The ubiquitous Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was the first to support the president. The Agrarians and Communists are also for it on the whole but they have certain conditions, so it is not yet clear if they will join the agreement together with the main group of signatories. The Yabloko bloc was the only one to speak categorically against signing it, in the sense that Yabloko is ready to do all it can for the idea of civic peace and accord but does not intend to sign any declarations.
