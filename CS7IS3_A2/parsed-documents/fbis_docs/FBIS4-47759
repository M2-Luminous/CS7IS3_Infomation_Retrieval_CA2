Port Elizabeth, the largest urban centre in the sub-region with an estimated voter population of 470,000, closed the counting. The ANC swept the boards with 252,531 of the votes for the National Assembly. Its closest challenger, the National Party [NP], won 130,085 votes. The total number of votes cast was 416,395, electoral officials announced at 10.30PM. Rejected ballots numbered 2,928. After the NP, the ANC's opponents lagged far behind: the Democratic Party [DP] with 13,867 votes, the Freedom Front with 4,757 and the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] with just 4,119. The scenario was similar for the provincial legislature. The ANC scored 246,732 votes against the NP's 115,841 out of a total 412,133 ballots cast. The DP moved upwards to 29,991, as did the rightwing front with 5,923 votes. The PAC dipped slightly to 4,101. In neighbouring Uitenhage where the white and coloured vote niggled the ANC, Nelson Mandela's party also scored an easy win with 66,066 out of the 103,002 votes cast for the National Assembly, against the NP's 31,284 and the Freedom Front's 2,494. Across the broader Eastern Cape and Kei region, the NP threat lessened throughout the day. The party dropped from 19.3 per cent in the morning to 10.7 per cent by 11PM Monday compared with 82.6 per cent for the ANC. The DP's support climbed slowly from 2.4 per cent to 2.6 per cent. Ironically the PAC and Freedom Front recorded similar percentages of just under two per cent. The African Christian Democratic Party, which some expected would gain a credible showing in the region, pegged below one percentage point. Counting was smooth throughout the sub-region except for Port Elizabeth where ballot box disputes resulted in stoppages. A criminal investigation is pending over 30 ballot boxes from the sprawling township of KwaZakele which police allege were tampered with by Independent Electoral Commission officials. Eastern Cape Attorney-General [AG] Les Roberts is to decide whether a prosecution on the charge of electoral fraud is feasible. The IEC and police have conducted separate inquiries into the alleged tampering. Agreement was reached early Monday evening between political party agents and the IEC to count the 30,000-odd KwaZakhele votes. With the mandate of the AG, the votes are excluded from the final tally, are listed separately as "disputed" and will be stored in an isolated container until the dispute is settled. The NP's formal request for the votes to be declared invalid must also still be decided on by the commission. A second complaint by the NP -- over the way ballots were compressed in another 24 ballot boxes from KwaZakhele -- was resolved after a lengthy meeting on Monday when all the parties accepted there had been no fraudulent tampering with the votes. IEC officials said no abnormal trends were spotted with the KwaZakhele votes at counting time. Neither the premier candidate for the ANC nor NP was in the region on Monday. Robben Island veteran Ray Mhlaba was at his party's headquarters in Johannesburg. Dr Tertius Delport, the former local government minister, flew to Pretoria for a meeting with F W de Klerk.
