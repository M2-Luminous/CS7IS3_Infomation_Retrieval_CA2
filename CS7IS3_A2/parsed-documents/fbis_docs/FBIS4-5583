FBIS4-5583 "dreas070_d_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 South Korea Opposition Launches Offensive Over UR Accord Opposition Launches Offensive Over UR Accord SK0804123294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0809 GMT 8 Apr 94 SK0804123294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- The opposition launched an offensive Friday against the government over the Uruguay Round [UR] accord, which will open up Korea's farm market, as the Morocco signing of the agreement fast approaches. The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) set in motion a "struggle committee," aimed at stopping parliament from ratifying the Uruguay Round (UR) accord, at a ceremony attended by Chairman Yi Ki-taek and 100 postholders and lawmakers. Chairman Yi, who also steers the committee, said the party must struggle for the national interest because dialogue has not helped in redressing the problem. The DP also agreed with the three splinter parties and the pan- national movement to preserve agriculture, in a meeting held Friday morning, to hold rallies against the UR agreement in Seoul and other major cities over the weekend. At the meeting DP Chairman Yi, United People's Party leader Han Yong-su, New Korea Party representative Yi Chong-chan, New Political Reform Party leader Pak Chan-chong and movement representative Yi Chang-pok decided to demand that President Kim Yong-sam apologize to the nation for government wrongdoings in the course of negotiating the UR pact, while guaranteeing the right of ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) lawmakers to express their opinions on the trade accord. According to the movement, all 112 opposition lawmakers had pledged to vote against the UR pact and some DLP lawmakers expressed their intention to follow suit as of Friday. Prof. Chang Won-suk of Tankuk University, one of the movement's leaders, said it will press the government to renegotiate the accord. Although it is a multilateral pact, its "unfair contents" should be renegotiated through bilateral talks, he added. Some 180 colleges and universities of Hanchongnyon (the Federation of Korean College and University Student Associations) began a two-day strike Friday to oppose the UR agreement, while 20,000 students took to the streets of Seoul to denounce the pact. After the accord is signed at the Morocco meeting, the DP will hold its own rallies to oppose parliamentary ratification while launching a nationwide signature-collection campaign. Concerned that the anti-UR struggle by opposition forces could plunge the nation into a political crisis, the government and the ruling DLP are busy taking countersteps. DLP spokesman Ha Sun-pong warned the DP would earn public censure for a struggle that could lead to political unrest just as the nation is starting to enjoy political and social stability under the civilian government. The DLP plans to obtain National Assembly approval of the UR accord by the end of August and promote the need for the pact in this era of internationalization and market opening. The government will advance the announcement of a wide-ranging rural investment plan from the target date of June 30 to assure farmers that the UR agreement is a good opportunity to make agriculture truly viable. A Chongwadae [presidential office] official said the government would deal with all anti-UR pact rallies and demonstrations strictly in accordance with the law. To cope with rallies and demonstrations by activist students in Seoul at the weekend, over 16,000 riot policemen have been deployed to ensure that these events are carried out in a peaceful manner.
