This was stated by party Chairman Ivan Petoe, who added that the coalition consultations could begin as early as next week. However, Peter Hack, another SZDSZ leader, described as doubtful the possibility of a coalition agreement after a Socialist Party victory of such magnitude. According to Hack, the electorate has unambiguously placed its trust in the hands of one party and the SZDSZ would not be able to play an emphatic coalition partner role if it were to participate in the government.
