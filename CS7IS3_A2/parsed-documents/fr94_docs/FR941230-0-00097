FR941230-0-00097 FR941230-0-00019 II. Full Implementation of the EDGAR System While Congress required the Commission only to certify that filings from the significant test group would be received and reviewed for a period of six months before mandating electronic filing for all registrants, a comprehensive study of the significant test period results was undertaken by the Office of Information Technology (``OIT'') to form the basis of a recommendation to the Commission as to whether implementation of EDGAR should proceed. In addition to the information gathered internally, OIT sponsored a two-day EDGAR Filer Conference in April 1994 devoted in large part to learning the public's views on the success of the EDGAR system and discussing its future. Comment on the system also was solicited in the Federal Register. 22 22 Release No. 34&hyph;34148 (June 2, 1994) [59 FR 29837]. Comment letters are available for inspection and copying in the public reference room at the Commission's headquarters (File No. S7&hyph;18&hyph;94). OIT has coordinated the evaluation of data and public comments and prepared a report to the Commission that encompasses a broad spectrum of issues. 23 The system's integrity, reliability, responsiveness, stability, security, capacity and other criteria were evaluated. The report indicates that each area of consideration satisfies or exceeds the requirements necessary to mandate electronic filing by all domestic registrants and third party filers. The system, including EDGARLink, the filer assistance software, is accessible to a broad base of filers at reasonable cost and can be enhanced to meet future needs of filers and users of the information as they arise. Electronic filings made by the significant test group have provided a suitable alternative to paper filings both to the staff and other users, with filings consistently being disseminated in the same form as submitted to the Commission. Finally, the report concludes that provision of information through the EDGAR system is at least as efficient and effective as in the paper filing system; in the case of dissemination, the broadcast of material information is greatly enhanced, with electronic filings being made available nationwide, if not worldwide, in a matter of minutes. 23 The report is available for inspection and copying in the public reference room at the Commission's headquarters. Some interested parties have expressed the view that the EDGAR system's current design is no longer state-of-the-art and that it should be reconfigured before phase-in recommences to reflect the newest available technologies that would allow for the preparation and retrieval of filings that look more like traditional typeset paper filings, including graphic and image material. The EDGAR project is, and always will be, dynamic in character. Some modifications already are under consideration and the Commission and staff will be vigilant in the ongoing evaluation of the system to make it as accessible and easy to use as possible. However, the staff reports that the current design successfully achieves Congress' and the Commission's goal of immediate electronic access to the vital information required to be disclosed pursuant to the federal securities laws and regulations, and that further costs and delays to overhaul a system that is currently functioning well are not now warranted. While not recommending the complete replacement of the EDGAR design, some public commenters have voiced concerns about other perceived weaknesses in the current system. Some argued that EDGARLink is not as user-friendly as it should be, or that it should be available for use with other types of system platforms or with networks. Others asserted that the procedures for payment of filing fees to the lockbox depository, while not technically an EDGAR issue, sometimes affects the timeframe for acceptance of EDGAR filings. Some filers assert that too much electronic tagging is required, while some disseminators advocate the addition of more tagging. The report states that the most pressing concerns have been given a high priority, and solutions have already been implemented or are underway; future needs for enhancements and design changes will be addressed in due course. Again, while these concerns are taken seriously, they do not approach a level, either individually or collectively, that merits further delay in fully implementing the electronic filing program.
