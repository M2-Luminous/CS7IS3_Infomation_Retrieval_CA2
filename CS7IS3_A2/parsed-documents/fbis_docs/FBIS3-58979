French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said after meeting Christopher it was important to implement NATO decisions when Tuzla and Srebrenica were concerned. It is difficult to conclude from the two statements whether Paris and Washington had agreed over what Washington described as the insufficiently clarified diplomatic initiative launched by Paris to help resolve the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the recent NATO summit in Brussels, France was the staunchest advocator of the use of air power against Bosnian Serbs for their alleged refusal to reopen the local airport in Tuzla, the Moslem enclave in northeastern Bosnia, and allow the replacement of Canadian U.N. troops in another Moslem enclave, Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bosnian Serbs have reached agreement with the U.N. Bosnia command to allow Dutch peacekeepers to replace the Canadians in Srebrenica in early February, but rejected to reopen the airport in Tuzla before a general peace accord has been signed, fearing that the facility may be used for arms shipment to Bosnian Moslems.
