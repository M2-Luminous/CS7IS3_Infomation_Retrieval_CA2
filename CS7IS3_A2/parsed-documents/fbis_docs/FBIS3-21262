In commercial reactors, the system structure, apart from the core of the reactor itself, is based on materials technologies developed by the traditional industrial infrastructure for heating boilers and shipbuilding, which is sustained by steel technology. In contrast, the materials used in the reactor core are so-called "tailored alloys," such as zircaloy for water-cooled reactors, and magnox for carbonic-acid-gas-cooled reactors. These materials are advantageous for fission maintenance from the standpoint of neutron economy, and meet soundness and safety requirements. They were developed at a relatively early stage, and have produced good results. These two methods of materials development are suggestive for future materials research. This article describes the current stage of the category "basic technology research" among the research activities of the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI). An outline of project-related research (further discussed in Part II (1) and (2)) will be included to indicate its relationship to the other categories. 1. History of Materials Research Materials research in the early 1960s, the initial stage of nuclear engineering in Japan, began with an evaluation of the appropriateness of aluminum, which was used as a fuel cladding material for the research reactor JRR-3 (the first national reactor). This evaluation consisted primarily of property and performance qualification testing for carbonic-acid-gas-cooled reactors, and materials research for semi-homogeneous reactors. Compared to other fields of nuclear research, materials research at that time did not differ radically from materials research in general engineering fields, which primarily involved basic research on radiation effects and corrosion. During the latter half of the 1960s, the examination of materials began at JAERI along with the introduction of the light-water reactor, and the development of the high-speed test reactor. The Japan Materials Testing Reactor (JMTR) also began operation, and industry finally became involved in irradiation testing for steel and in other kinds of testing. Around this time, the research style shifted to the so-called project base. (Research related to high-speed reactors was soon transferred to the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC).) About 1970, the issue of pressure wall damage, which was being analyzed for the Japan Power Demonstration Reactor (JPDR), had an international impact on research on environment-promoted cracking, such as corrosion fatigue and stress corrosion cracking, which is closely related to structural safety. Research on high-temperature structural materials corresponding to the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor project began in the latter half of the 1970s. In the 1980s, various research projects -- including fuel cycle back-end technology -- such as fusion reactor materials, fuel reprocessing, and waste treatment, based on international cooperation, were added one after another, and materials research and development finally became systematic. Since the latter half of the 1980s, when full-scale research on fusion reactor materials began, activities to secure intense neutron sources in the high-energy range -- reflecting the need for high neutron flux irradiation beds, and high-performance post-irradiation test facilities -- have been stressed and introduced. Meanwhile, research and development on organic materials, such as polymers, conducted mainly at the Takasaki Radiation Chemistry Research Establishment, played an important role in the industrial application of irradiation by gamma rays and electron beams. In the latter half of the 1980s, large-scale ion accelerating facilities were constructed, and materials research in many fields, including nonnuclear fields, began. These efforts were aimed primarily at advanced applications for radioactivity based on beam use. (1) Reliability of Nuclear System and Introduction of Technology As this historical account indicates, there is an urgent need to test the adaptability and durability of the materials selected during the design of systems with definite concepts during the period of technological introduction. It is important to implement a highly efficient property analysis of a project type. At the same time, attempts to create and to find applications for materials beyond the framework of the existing standards are considered premature. Therefore, the following should be stressed first: [1] Testing and verification of system adaptability and durability (maintenance base). As soon as the period of independent development arrives, the following is necessarily required: [2] Creation and application of materials that exceed the current systems in performance and functions. While both methods [1] and [2] are aimed at "reliability improvement," the decisive difference is that, with method [2], the process of creating materials precedes in the material formation stage according to a specific purpose. The situation there is either that required performance level exceeds the limits of the existing materials, or that the concept itself does not exist. In order to cope with such situations, neither project-type research to directly meet specific needs, nor basic research to return to general principles is appropriate. It is necessary to design a new approach from a different dimension to allow both creativity and finality. This is a problem that is peculiar to this age, where nuclear energy has become a reality. The International Symposium on Advanced Nuclear Engineering Research, which took place in spring of last year, recognized this problem, and focused on the directions and roles of materials science. (2) Correspondence to Increasingly Diverse and Advance Requirements When the industrial base, the resource situation, and the nuclear properties of reactors from the light-water reactor to the fusion reactor are considered, most of the materials they comprise are general-purpose materials, such as steel, and these will continue to improve in quality. Therefore, research on new materials is not the sole objective of nuclear materials development. However, it is certain that thermal conditions -- such as temperature and thermal flux (thermal gradient) -- and radiation field conditions -- such as spectrum and the intensity of neutrons in charge of energy conversion reactions -- will become more rigid. This problem can be solved either by new materials, or by a combination of materials with added features, in designing and device technology. Selection of the two must always be considered in research strategies. Table I-1 is a summary of the major reactor types introduced in Japan, focusing on durability and reliability in relation to their operational environment. Requirements for individual systems are varied, and newer systems have more advanced requirements. With regard to structural materials, for instance, research on a considerable scale is necessary to respond properly to the various engineering issues. Therefore, an expansion of the testing research matrix for behavior analysis and evaluation is unavoidable when various materials, including functional materials, and various operating conditions, such as stationary, anomalous, and accident conditions, are considered. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table I-1.

This is because, in the case of specialized materials that can be used only for nuclear technology, requisite human and material resources may not be derived solely through calculation. Many general-purpose materials that are used in the nuclear field are supported by an important economic factor. The quality and production base of these materials are maintained by stable and enormous commercial needs. It is necessary to realize that such an infrastructure cannot be formed in a short time even with a large investment. Another problem is that it is quite common in the development of innovative systems for design concepts to change frequently. This may contradict the process of material development, which requires a long lead time. Material research related to advanced system development needs to be guided by precise strategies built on a thorough examination of such issues. 2. Stronger Technology Base for Nuclear Development and Materials Research (Items of Importance in Long-Term Plan for Nuclear Development and Use in FY 1987) Prior to implementation of the plan, four important areas that required a stronger technology base were designated by the Atomic Energy Commission, and survey activities by special committees began. The following is a summary of the results of the survey. (1) Creative Development of Advanced Technology (Breakthrough) The guideline for the long-term plan is based on the idea that there are three research stages: conventional research and development driven by needs, the current efforts to achieve breakthroughs, and future development. In order to follow this guideline, switching to so-called "seeds-leading" research and development based on the creation of basic fields is to be implemented. The difference between an emphasis on basic research in general and this stronger technology base is that the latter has the clear mission to respond to social and economic needs in a concrete manner through nuclear development as an energy technology. That is to say the basic research envisaged here is intended to bridge traditional or pure basic research, and project research. It can be understood as research on a key technology for broad applicability, or as research on a common technology. Some of the concepts examined at the planning stage were: 1) Creativity (breakthrough and the technological lead). 2) Contribution to nonnuclear fields as well (spin-off effects). 3) Collaboration among industry, academic bodies, and the government. In terms of policy, it is intended to produce a core for technological innovation based on 30 years of past experience, with the premise that human and material resources would be restricted. (2) Survey Results -- Struggle with Radiation Environment Among the survey activities, which were conducted over a period of about six months, was a questionnaire that was distributed to nuclear-related organizations, national institutes, universities, and private enterprises. Research topics were solicited under the condition that those who made proposals had priority for their implementation. It produced over 150 items over a broad range. Figure I-1 indicates the results in several categories. According to the results, materials to be studied should not remain in conventionally mainstream metals, and should cover a broad range of possibilities, including organic and inorganic materials. It suggests the consideration of technological spin-off to other fields, long terms for implementation, and dependence on large-scale facilities. In the section on "Form of Implementation," there is no indication of incestuousness, while there is the expectation of cooperation and interchange to acquire a broad range of knowledge. Further, the technological contents of the proposals have been systematically classified in detail with some additional items to consider. Figure I-2 divides research activities into two conventional types: activities to produce materials, and activities to apply them by studying their properties. The items classified in the second category indicate that the overwhelming number of proposals concern the achievement and improvement of radiation tolerance, or the reduction of radiation. It has been considered that solving problems related to neutrons, among others, is the key to the next step, and to the point of breakthrough. It is necessary to prepare the answers to the following questions: What properties from the standpoint of materials science do materials with tolerance to neutron irradiation have, and how should they be produced? What means are necessary to determine their behavior during their actual use? How should the results of such research and development be used for system design as well as safety and reliability? 3. Research Implementation and Progress Based on these principles as set out by the government, individual research organizations made implementation plans, and, with approval for the organization budget, and so on, began to execute them in 1988. The major research projects sponsored by JAERI already had included the development of materials for fusion and high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, and newly undertaken basic research included some projects that partly supported and complemented them from the standpoint of key technologies. Figure I-3 illustrates its structure. It relates to the projects more or less directly in terms of long-term behavior testing and demonstration, as well as databases. The following is an outline of its history. (1) Project Supporting Research The current status of nuclear fusion, and of the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, is introduced in Part II (1) and (2). Research and development of fusion reactor materials began in the second half of the 1970s for structural materials, and developed into a full-scale activity in 1983 with the cooperation of the United States. At present, it has broadened to include tritium breeding materials and insulation ceramics, and has been conducted actively with the cooperation of many nations within the framework of the IEA agreement. Development of materials under the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor project began in 1971, and proceeded all other activities, such as test method development, materials development, tolerance behavior study, tolerance testing in the real-machine approximation environment, and database development. The major structural materials for the High-Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR) now under construction are those developed in the project. (2) Material Tolerance Forecast and Database Crucial to the technological base necessary to forecast and extend the life of nuclear power plants are a quantitative method for forecasting the tolerance of the constituent materials, and a database to support it. Assuring the tolerance of the constituent materials requires not only experience, but also the ability to forecast life expectancy and behavior built on the mechanism of materials deterioration. Examples of the systematic development of testing methods, equipment, and database systems are introduced in Part III. Development of life expectancy evaluation technologies for materials tolerance for nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, an example in the section, can be considered one of the technology bases for commercial plants. Development of the database, which is particularly important as a key technology, began with the analysis of crack propagation in pressure vessels for light water reactors. At present, work on the JAERI Material Performance Database (JMPD), which has made it possible to achieve computer control and use of tolerance test data of materials in real conditions for various new reactors, and on a data highway system among organizations, which will lead to general use of the former, are in progress. (3) Design and Development of New Materials The performance of materials subjected to radiation is often determined by factors that are fundamentally different from those for materials put to more general uses. A typical example is the radiation tolerance of ceramic materials. This is related both to fundamental solid state properties, and to factors related to the production process. A material design process that raises fundamental issues related to the atomic and molecular structures of materials, and that uses such methods as molecular dynamics and computer simulation, is a symbolic process for basic research on nuclear materials. In addition, there have been efforts to create new materials with highly controlled composites, purity, and structures using totally different compound processes, and to find breakthroughs and new possibilities. The current status of, and future perspectives for such efforts are introduced in Parts IV, V and VI. (4) Development of Innovative Testing Facilities and Testing Technology In conventional research, the use of radiation beds has been restricted mainly to nuclear reactor neutrons, gamma rays from radioisotopes, and electrons. Although these will remain important in future, there are fatal restrictions in terms of their radioactive energy, intensity, and irradiation operability. Therefore, solutions to such problems are of primary importance in implementing highly innovative research projects. With regard to neutrons, JAERI has proposed an Energy Selective Neutron Irradiation Test Facility (ESNIT). This would involve creating nuclear reactions using accelerated deuterons, and liquid lithium as an energy-variable intense neutron source. This proposal attracted international attention, and a technological examination was conducted based on international cooperation. Meanwhile, various radiation, and heavy and light ion accelerating facilities were constructed intensively. These facilities made it possible to conduct single, double, and triple simultaneous irradiation, which in turn facilitated materials improvement and behavior study. The concept and structure of such methods, as well as the current status and prospects for research and development based on their use, are introduced in Parts VII (1) and V. Micro-test-piece testing technology is a development method that is intended to overcome restrictions on the test volume (the size of irradiation field) specific to the neutron and ion beam irradiation experiment facilities mentioned above. This also may be applied to general use. The results of integrated development as a key technology, including remote control technology, are described in Part VII (2). 4. Perspective and Conclusion Macroscopically speaking, most materials research and development involve activities that belong inherently to key technology research. However, the significance of emphasizing key technology is due to a recognition that nuclear development, including the role of materials in nuclear technology, is at a turning point. It is difficult to summarize our activities and experience over the past five years. It is a subtlety of technological research that slight changes of intellectual perspective sometimes sparks a new burst of creativity, or that a relatively small but continuous budget activates research and produces efficient results. Fortunately, in FY 1992 the Evaluation Committee of the Science and Technology Agency showed us a sufficient understanding, which encouraged everyone concerned. In the future, the formation of a material base in general will be developed in the areas listed in Table I-2. One of the remaining issues will be the proper revision, discontinuation, and development of themes as research progresses. At the same time, it is necessary to implement technology transfer to projects reflecting this principle. This involves nurturing the seeds of creativity, and maintaining an active network of research organizations. Struggling with such a dilemma is the fate of pioneer research, which must be implemented with limited resources, including human resources, and which must display a high level of intuition and efficiency. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table I-2.
