[Villalobos] Yesterday, 1 January, the Government Secretariat issued a news bulletin. I would like to quote parts of that bulletin. Throughout 1 January the Mexican Army and Police refrained from taking any action whatsoever despite the fact that an armed group had taken over several cities in the area of Ocosingo, Chiapas. This armed group is endangering the lives of the residents of these communities, and consequently the state and municipal authorities issue a call for order to be reestablished, for the members of the group to desist, and for a dialogue to be held to find a solution to this situation that is painful for all Mexicans. Today, which is the second day of the incident, the armed group left the town of San Cristobal de las Casas. The group then carried out an act of aggression by heading toward a military installation and engaging in a clash with the Mexican Army. The military authorities already have reported on this incident. The authorities and the residents themselves of the town of San Cristobal de las Casas and its environs would like this armed group to cease its activities and participate in a dialogue with the authorities. There is a broad offer from all three levels of government -- municipal, state, and federal -- for the lines of communication to be opened to respond to the specific demands that the group has been making. On earlier occasions talks have been held with groups from this area. Important steps were taken in August regarding a number of requests that were made quite some time ago, and we believe that substantial progress has been made in the area over the past five years. Nonetheless, the invitation stands for communication to begin with authorities at any of the three levels of government. This is a request from the people of Chiapas, and the municipal, state, and federal authorities are heeding this request with great interest. [Reporter] In the past few hours there was an exchange of gunfire between the two parties. How many casualties have been registered so far? [Villalobos] Several casualty counts have been provided over the past two days. I would like to refer to some of them. So far 26 policemen and civilians have been killed; one Red Cross volunteer was tortured and killed; 24 civilians were injured; and one woman was raped. Regarding the clash you mention, which I presume is the clash with the Mexican Army in the area of Rancho Nuevo, the Army itself has already reported that five soldiers were killed and six were wounded. The bodies of 24 rebels were found, as well as a large amount of materiel that the rebels had abandoned. Among the abandoned materiel there are weapons of the type used by the armies of several countries, as well as non-military-issue firearms, knives, and other articles such as two tear gas grenades. This is the result of two days of actions in that area. [Reporter] What message can the federal government give to the residents of Chiapas at this difficult time? [Villalobos] This is an unusual situation, of course, so I believe the people of Chiapas know that they should remain calm. Civilian organizations as well as the municipal authorities have asked for more direct action by the Mexican Army to prevent other possible clashes. Consequently, the people should remain calm and follow any instructions given to protect them. We hope that this situation will be resolved shortly. [Reporter] Would you like to add anything more, sir? [Villalobos] I would like to ask those who have been carrying out these unusual actions to cease and desist.
