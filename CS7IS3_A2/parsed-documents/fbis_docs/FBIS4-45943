On top of its departure from the already accepted position of Kashmir's accession to India, the Bill Clinton administration's move to make available to Pakistan 38 F-16 deep penetration strike aircraft (DPSA) provided Islamabad agrees to a nuclear `cap' or freeze through a so-called one-time exception to the Pressler amendment clearly shows its partisan posture. The Pressler Law bars economic and military aid since on its own assessment Islamabad possessed the nuclear bomb. It is common knowledge that the F-16 provides an effective delivery system for nuclear weapons. The External Affairs Minister, Mr Dinesh Singh's assessment that the United States is encouraging Pakistan to use nuclear weapons against this country should be regarded as a genuine concern for it adds a new dimension to the internal security of India. Pakistan already has 10 F-16s and was supposed to get 71 more when the Pressler sanctions were imposed. Eleven of the 71 aircraft were already built and paid for but Pakistan could not get them because of Pressler. Under the current proposal, if Pakistan `caps' its nuclear weapons programme it is possible that up to 38 aircraft could be made available. The American postures and Pakistan's hectic activity internationally, with the main thrust on false propaganda to enlist sympathy of not only the Organisation of Islamic Countries but of other western nations on the ground that India had systematically violated human rights, should make New Delhi prepare for any eventuality. And this demands not only national discipline to brave the challenge, but all political parties should also once again demonstrate that they are one in the determination to thwart the designs of United States and Pakistan. There is a suspicion that America has designs to see that an independent Kashmir can be brought under its hegemony as part of its secret plan to control the region. While such a proposition is not only unacceptable to India it is also bound to be opposed by countries like China and Iran, not to speak of other Central Asian Republics. The immediate consequence of the supply of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan is the upsetting of the security arrangements in India and it will be forced to beef up its defences, which may entail enormous expenditure to the point of dislocating our own developmental plans. This is one area where the nation cannot be complacent and the people should be prepared for any sacrifices that the situation demands. New Delhi would be well advised to match the mischief of Pakistan perpetrated by its Inter-Services Intelligence in a tit-for-tat manner rather than giving the impression that India is complaining from a position of weakness. By now it should be clear to the Indian Government that Pakistan understands only the language of offensive and not reason. Delhi should neither be apologetic nor go on the defensive but take effective steps to thwart Pakistan's evil designs, what with its Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, becoming increasingly desperate, probably to save her political power, and the growing opposition to her internally including from her home province of Sind. The Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao, had already hinted that his government would review or reassess its defence policy to face the Pakistani challenge. And that challenge can be met only by India going nuclear, notwithstanding pressures and threats from the United States and other western powers.
