It already has two regular air routes: from Wuyishan city to Xiamen city, Fujian Province, and Wuyishan to Shanghai. Next month a regular service to Hong Kong is expected to start. Located in the Wuyi Mountains in the northern part of Fujian, Wuyishan city has a national nature reserve and is a tourist area. More than 6.22 million tourists went there between 1986 and 1992. The local government raised 100 million yuan to expand the Wuyishan Airport. The work started in 1992, and in November last year, new runways, parking areas, waiting rooms and office buildings were completed, while imported telecommunications and navigation facilities were installed.
