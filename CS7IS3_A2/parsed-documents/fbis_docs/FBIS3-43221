FBIS3-43221 "cr00000005394001" 30 January 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-013--JAPAN JAPAN TO LAUNCH H-II ROCKET ON 1 FEBRUARY AS SCHEDULED Summary: The Japanese press reports that the National Space Development Agency of Japan [NASDA] will keep its 1 February launch date for the H-II rocket despite difficulties experienced during a 23 December fueling rehearsal. The launch will be a major event attracting nearly 1,000 government and company representatives, and members of the press. NASDA announced on 18 January that it will launch the H-II rocket on 1 February, according to the 19 January MINAMI NIHON SHIMBUN. NASDA held an unscheduled fueling rehearsal on 14 January after problems were discovered during the scheduled rehearsal on 23 December. During the December rehearsal problems arose in eight places, including a leak in the helium pressure valves on the LE-7 main engine which resulted in insufficient pressure, according to the 18 January MINAMI NIHON SHIMBUN. During the 14 January rehearsal the moveable nozzles on the the solid rocket boosters developed problems, but NASDA "determined that they were not major" and decided to keep the 1 February launch date. NASDA may feel under pressure to proceed with the launch of the H-II, which cost 2.7 trillion yen ($2.45 billion) to develop. The H-II launch has already been rescheduled twice, delaying the launch about two years because of problems in developing the LE-7 main engine. In 1991 the LE-7 engine exploded during a pressure test and killed a technician. In 1992 another LE-7 caught on fire during a combustion test, according to the 25 January NIKKEI SANGYO. Furthermore, the launch of "Japan's first indigenously developed large rocket" is being touted as "placing Japan on par with the United States and Europe in space technology," and, according to the 23 January YOMIURI SHIMBUN, will attract "nearly 1,000 members of the press, and NASDA and company representatives to Tanegashima." The H-II rocket will be launched from the Yoshinobu launch pad at the Tanegashima Space Center at 7 am on 1 February, according to the 19 January MINAMI NIHON SHIMBUN. It will carry a 3.27-metric ton payload consisting of the 865 kg OREX vehicle, and the 2.4-ton VEP. The 24 January NIKKEI BUSINESS reports the objectives for the launch are to 1) launch the rocket, 2) place the VEP in a transfer orbit, and 3) have the OREX reenter. NASDA reportedly will consider the launch a success if objectives one and two are accomplished. The VEP, which is a dummy of experimental technology satellite 6 (ETS-6), is scheduled to separate 28 minutes after launch and enter an elliptical stationary transfer orbit with an apogee of 36,200 kilometers and a perigee of about 450 kilometers. Because its apogee-motor fuel tanks will be loaded with water rather than fuel it will remain in this transfer orbit. The VEP's batteries will give it a life of 100 hours and it will transmit H-II vibration and orbit-positioning accuracy data to the ground during that time, according to the 5 January SANKEI SHIMBUN. The OREX will separate 14 minutes after launch and orbit the earth once at 450 kilometers, according to the SANKEI SHIMBUN. About 1 hour and 40 minutes after launch the OREX will fire its retro rockets and reenter the atmosphere, according to the 27 October 93 NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN. Two hours after launch OREX will splash down in the Pacific near Christmas Island, according to the 5 January SANKEI SHIMBUN. The 5 November MINAMI NIHON SHIMBUN reports the OREX will not be recovered after splashdown because of the costs that would be involved. (AUTHOR:COOK.
