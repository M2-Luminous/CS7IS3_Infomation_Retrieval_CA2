FR940610-1-00089 FR940610-1-00008 The long term savings in health care costs and increase in years of life could result to the extent that lower intakes of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium, and increased intakes of grains, fruits and low-fat vegetables either throughout the school years or over a more extended period of time could reduce the risk of diet-related chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and atherosclerosis. These diseases accounted for almost 65 percent of all deaths in the U.S. in 1991. 7 McGinnis and Foege, in an analysis of actual causes of death in the U.S., reported about 300,000 deaths per year, 14 percent of the total deaths, as the lower bound estimate for deaths related to diet and activity patterns. 8 These factors cannot be readily separated due to their interdependence in determining obesity. The savings in years of life and the value associated with a population reduction of fat, saturated fat and cholesterol has been estimated for the U.S. adult population. These estimates were incorporated into the regulatory impact analysis for the food labeling regulatory proposal published on November 27, 1991, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 9 While no comparable estimates are currently available for dietary changes by school-age children, it is useful to consider the magnitude of effects expected from the proposed changes in the school meal programs with that projected for food labeling. The study by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) developed for the food labeling proposal estimated the following changes in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol for male and women due to the labeling changes: 10 Table 3._ Average Daily Estimated Changes in Fat, Saturated Fat and Cholesterol for the U.S. Adult Population Due to FDA Food Labeling Changes 1‚ê£ 1Men 1Women 1Average Changes in fat intake: Grams ^1.49 ^0.67 ^1.08 Percent ^1.4% ^1.1% ^1.25% Changes in saturated fat intake: Grams ^0.48 ^0.16 ^0.31 Percent ^1.3% ^0.7% ^1.0% Changes in cholesterol intake: Milligrams ^0.42 ^0.26 ^0.34 Percent ^0.1% ^0.1% ^0.1% Adapted from Food and Drug Administration regulatory impact analysis statement for the proposed food labeling regulations, Federal Register , November 27, 1991. Average assumes equal numbers of men and women. RTI and FDA then used the changes for men and women in a computer model developed by Dr. Warren Browner to estimate the effects on years of life over a period of 20 years. The increased years of life estimates were then used to estimate a value for the added years of life. These changes were found to result in an estimated 20-year reduction of 35,179 cases of cancer, and a reduction of 4,028 cases of coronary heart disease. As a result they estimated avoiding 12,902 deaths and increasing life-years by 80,930. FDA used two different approaches to estimating the total value of the food labeling changes, a remaining years of life approach and a mean value approach (see November 27, 1991 Federal Register , pages 60871&hyph;0872, for a more detailed description). They also estimated totals using two different dollar values for consumer willingness to pay for risk reduction_a conservative estimate of $1.5 million and a higher estimate of $3.0 million. The value of the benefits from increased life-years was estimated to be $3.6 billion (discounted at 5 percent over a 20 year period). When benefits were valued based upon the number of early deaths prevented and the higher willingness to pay figure of $3.0 million, the estimate (similarly discounted) increased to $21 billion. In January 6, 1993, when publishing the final food labeling rule with a comment analysis, FDA updated their 20-year value estimates to between $4.4 billion and $26.5 billion. 11 USDA agrees with FDA that for government policy evaluation, society's willingness to pay for risk reduction is an appropriate concept to use in evaluating the impact of government actions which will reduce risks. The FDA estimates of $1.5 million and $3.0 million used in their analysis are quite conservative. Economists have three decades of experience in estimating the value of reducing the risk of fatalities using labor market data. Fisher, Chestnut and Violette (1989) evaluated the merits of these studies of the extra wages that would have to be paid for accepting a higher risk of fatality on the job; concluded that the results from the studies without obvious design flaws were reasonable consistent; and reported that the studies implied a value-per-statistical-life of $1.6 million to $8.5 million (in 1986 dollars). 12 This range of value-per-statistical-life becomes $2 million to $10.4 million in 1993 dollars (updated using the change in Bureau of Labor Statistics' average weekly earnings paid to nonagriculture nonsupervisory workers).
