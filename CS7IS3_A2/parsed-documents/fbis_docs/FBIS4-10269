He also dismissed the possibility of decreeing a state of emergency. "Unfortunately, there are people in Guatemala who think like Neanderthals, and for many years they have fought ideas with bullets, not with words," he said. Upon reiterating his condemnation of the murder of Constitutional Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez on 1 April and the attack against Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla on Wednesday, De Leon emphasized that he is "worried" about the recent violence. "The government rejects any kind of violence and will act strongly to counter it," the president told reporters. He added that security forces have been given precise instructions to get to the bottom of their investigations and find the people responsible for Gonzalez's murder and the attack against Chinchilla. De Leon pointed out that Guatemala must enter without further delay a phase of reconciliation to stop the violence and the civil war that began in 1960 so it can achieve welfare and social development. The president asked the groups causing the violence to reconsider and reflect on the "serious damage" they are doing the country through their actions. "It is not violence but dialogue that will solve our problems," the president emphasized. [passage omitted]
