I would appreciate your publishing in your newspaper a note from the Jesuits of Mexico that denies the information published in that newspaper. As we indicated in our communique, public opinion needs truth. False opinions encourage -- during the difficult times the nation is experiencing -- slander, violence, instability, and insecurity. I reiterate my appreciation for the objectivity that has characterized LA JORNADA's reporting. [Signed] Carlos Morfin Otero, S.J. Member of the Mexican Chapter Official Explanation by the Jesuits of Mexico: On 8 April 1994, the daily newspaper SUMMA, whose director is Jose Antonio Perez Stuart, published on its front page the following news: "Marcos" is the Jesuit Jeronimo. This was an exclusive report for SUMMA by special correspondent Ernesto Esparza. The report says that this information came out of an investigation conducted by a special federal government group whose operations are headquartered in Chiapas. The Society of Jesus in Mexico (the Jesuits), reports: 1. Jesuit priest Jeronimo Alberto Hernandez Lopez is not subcommander Marcos. We would like to state clearly that from 5 August 1992 to 5 April 1994, Father Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez, S.J., was assigned as a pastor to Guatemalan refugees in Campeche State. This information was made public and is known to national authorities, as is demanded of anyone who wants to work with the refugees. 2. As of this date, Father Jeronimo Hernandez has been assigned to our project in Bajon-Arena, Chiapas State. Attorney General Diego Valades and Goverment Secretary Jorge Carpizo were duly informed of the preceding. 3. Several days ago Father Jeronimo was interviewed and photographed by National Security agents from the Campeche State delegation, allegedly to confirm his whereabouts and his work with refugees. These agents were provided with the requested information. 4. We strongly condemn the report published in SUMMA. It is unprofessional to contribute to slander and insecurity based on false reports, without indicating who is responsible for the mentioned investigation. It is very serious to involve the federal government in general. That report should be added to a long list of false information orchestrated by some media. Public opinion demands the truth. False opinions encourage -- during the difficult times the nation is experiencing -- slander, violence, instability, and insecurity. [Signed] Carlos Marfin Otero, S.J. Member of the Mexican Chapter
