But a "highly-placed political sources" hinted in a report in the government newspaper "AL-INGAZ AL-WATANI" that the expulsion order could be reversed if Britain showed understanding of the reasons behind the order. On Thursday Sudan said that it was giving Streams two weeks to leave. Britain has given Sudan until Tuesday to reverse the decision or face retaliation. The Sudanese official said that the expulsion had nothing to do with the ambassador's contacts with Sudanese opposition leaders or controversy over a visit to southern Sudan by George Carey, the archbishop of Canterbury.
