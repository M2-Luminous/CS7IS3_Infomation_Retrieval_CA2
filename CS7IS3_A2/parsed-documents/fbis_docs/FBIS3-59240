Before dwelling on the intricacies of the negotiations going on in Brussels, I would first like to tell you a story about our most famous Finnish composer, Jean Sibelius. In his younger days, Sibelius used to spend a lot of time in Helsinki restaurants. When one particular spree had lasted several days, his wife finally telephoned her husband to ask for a tentative forecast of when he was likely to come home. "My dear," Sibelius sighed, "I am a composer. My vocation is to compose, not to make forecasts." In a similar vein, I would prefer to refrain from detailed forecasts at this critical and delicate juncture in Finland's negotiations over European Union accession. However, I am more than keen to explain the background to our membership initiative and the high stakes involved in the process under way. Finland has always been a thoroughly European nation. Western and Eastern influences have met on our Nordic soil, moulding our culture and lifestyle. Much of our heritage and civilisation is of West European origin. Since the Middle Ages Finns have travelled to European capitals to study and do business. The idea that Finland is knocking on the door of Europe for the first time gravely distorts the historical facts. The profound European transition that started in the late 1980s has led us to assess our European policies in an open-minded way. In this exercise, we have been guided by our postwar policy of neutrality and active economic intergration. Many things have changed around us while some others have not. In the modern age, Finland's economic links have always pointed to West Europe. More than two-thirds of our foreign trade is carried out with our EU and European Free Trade Association partners. Germany, Sweden and Britain top the list of our individual trading partners. Finnish companies have vigorously broadened their activities abroad. Nokia, Neste, Repola, Outokumpu Kemira, Metra, Enso, Valmet and many other names with a Finnish ring remind European business people of our industries' high level of skills. In order to grow and prosper, Finland needs access to Europe's single market. Much of this essential aim has been accomplished through the recently enacted European Economic Area. But to have real influence where the decisions on the political and economic future of our continent are taken, we have applied for membership of the EU. We also trust that we can make a positive contribution. The Nordic candidates, in particular, would bring the Union new territories and natural resources. But more than that, they would bring developed, stable societies, valuable traditions and advanced economies. It has not been difficult to find common ground on enlargement. To many observers, the process has seemed quite straightforward, apart from the many technicalities which always abound in issues of integration. While this overall picture has been largely correct, it has perhaps concealed a number of real problems that must be settled. Therefore, no one should be surprised that now, in the final straight, we have a set of tough issues on our hands. As a rule, the difficulties in question stem from a single source: our unique geographical location and harsh climate. In the negotiations we are genuinely seeking to ensure that Finland will be able to reach the objectives of the various EU policies. We have to find innovative solutions to problems such as short grow ing seasons, harsh winters and long distances in a sparsely populated country. These handicaps are permanent and can be compensated for only through a permanent support system based on clear and objective criteria. One possibility would be to use the criterion of latitude, in line with that of altitude already used in hill farming, to define less-favoured agricultural areas. We are convinced that without proper solutions to these problems, Finland as a whole, and our rural areas in particular, will face untenable consequences. Both our politicians and most of our people are keenly aware of that. A number of EU studies also support that conclusion. In spite of the recent polls in favour of EU membership, I believe that ultimately the terms of accession will be decisive. Therefore, my government can only submit to referendum a negotiated result which meets our basic requirements. In these circumstances, our firm choice is to press ahead with the negotiations under the tight schedule that we have agreed to observe. While we fully recognise the advantages involved in completing the negotiations quickly, in view of the approaching end of the European Parliament's term, we cannot make the timetable more important than the substance of our assessment. We need a satisfactory set of terms for accession and we are prepared to fight hard for our corner in the remaining negotiations. As far as I can recall, a similar spirit characterised the final phases of previous enlargement negotiations. We understand that the solutions to our agricultural and regional problems must be tailored to meet our specific needs. In this way we can avoid any spillover of the Nordic support systems. Finally, let me draw attention to one further aspect. The accession process with we Finns may occasionally prove to be tedious, but once happily concluded EU partners will be able to count on our solidarity, common sense and seriousness in all EU affairs. It lies deep in the Finnish character to keep one's word and stick to one's commitments. We can be stubborn but only on issues of vital interest to us. Even there, we are always open to pragmatic solutions if they are honestly designed to take our concerns into account. Finland's European policy is based on a practical assessment of our own needs and of European political and economic developments. EU membership offers answers to many of our aspirations, but only if the terms of our accession properly take into account our specific circumstances.
