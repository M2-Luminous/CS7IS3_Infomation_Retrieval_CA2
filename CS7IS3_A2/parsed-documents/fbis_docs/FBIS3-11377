These bonds will be offered to creditor banks as guarantees during the exchange of old foreign debt bonds for new ones with better repayment conditions. Cardoso said Brazil is prepared to produce the necessary bonds to guarantee an agreement with creditor banks on 15 April. William Rhodes, president of the Creditor Banks Advisory Committee and Citibank vice president, said at the end of his meeting with the minister that he will consult with the committee today, seeking to waive a clause in the agreement requiring the purchase of those bonds directly from the U.S. Treasury. He will also seek to do away with the requirement of an IMF stand-by agreement for the purchase of those bonds. In a note distributed after the meeting, Rhodes said: "We are consulting with the committee seeking the approval of the necessary exemptions (waivers) in order to put together a package to finance the foreign debt on 15 April, as agreed. I trust tomorrow afternoon (today) at the latest, the committee will be ready to recommend the approval of the waivers to the international financial community." Standing next to the minister in the Intercontinental Hotel's lobby, Rhodes said: "I trust the committee will maintain the agreement to renegotiate the debt." The minister admitted that the country has purchased, is purchasing, and will continue to purchase bonds to shore up the negotiations.
