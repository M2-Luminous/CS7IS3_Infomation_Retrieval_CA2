FR940603-2-00145 FR940603-2-00088 Section 383.21(a) provides that no operator of a commercial motor vehicle ``shall at any time have more than one driver's license.'' Whether compliance with both this regulation and the Maryland certification requirement is impossible hinges on whether the Maryland operator's certificate is a ``driver's license'' within the meaning of the regulation. The short answer to the claim, however, is that it is not within the scope of HMTA preemption. Part 383, unlike Parts 390 through 397 of the FMCSR, is not incorporated into the HMR. See 49 CFR 177.804. Accordingly, Part 383 is not a regulation ``issued under'' the HMTA within the meaning of 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)(1), and cannot be the basis for a determination of preemption under the statute. B. The ``Obstacle'' Test While neither operator certification requirement fails the dual compliance test, either requirement nevertheless is preempted if it ``stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives'' of the HMTA. Colorado Pub. Util. Comm'n v. Harmon, 951 F.2d at 1580. The ``full purposes and objectives'' of the HMTA are, foremost, furthering safe hazardous materials transportation and establishing a uniform system of regulation that, by reducing confusion and promoting compliance, contributes to enhanced safety. As noted in section I.B, above, we consider the oil cargo tank operator certification requirement only as it applies to transportation of oil that is a hazardous material under the HMTA. The HMTA does not preempt Maryland's application of the regulation to the transportation of oil that is not a designated hazardous material. In addition, in determining whether the certification requirements are an ``obstacle,'' we consider them ``as enforced and applied.'' 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)(2). Therefore, we consider the hazardous waste vehicle operator certification requirement with respect to the transportation of RCRA-designated hazardous waste only. See section I.B, above. When a non-Federal requirement differs from the HMR, RSPA must determine whether that difference is an obstacle to the statutory purposes and objectives. The degree to which a requirement may differ from the HMR before it becomes an obstacle depends on the subject matter of the requirement. With respect to certain areas identified in the HMTA, namely, the ``covered subjects'' of 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(4)(B), uniformity is paramount and no material deviation is permitted. 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). In other areas, RSPA must determine the necessary degree of uniformity in light of existing statutory and regulatory language. In the area of training, the HMR already have established the extent to which States may regulate differently. Under 49 CFR 172.701, a State may impose training requirements more strict than those of the HMR only if those requirements: (a) Do not conflict with the training requirements in [49 CFR part 172, Subpart H and part 177]; and (b) Apply only to drivers domiciled in that State. The authority granted to States to impose stricter requirements on their domiciled operators ``recognizes the traditional regulation by States of their own resident drivers.'' 57 FR at 20947. It recognizes as well that were States permitted to impose stricter requirements on non-resident operators, operators potentially would be subject to numerous sets of training requirements, with resulting confusion, cost and paperwork burdens. The Federal regulation ``represents an appropriate balancing of the interests of the States and the transportation industry.'' 57 FR at 20947. Cf. IR&hyph;26, 54 FR 16314, 16322 (Apr. 21, 1989)(considering preemption of State training requirements before promulgation of 49 CFR 172.701). The 49 CFR 172.701 limitation on State regulatory authority over non-domiciled operators pertains only to State ``training requirements.'' The term ``training,'' as defined at 49 CFR 172.700(b), means: A systematic program that ensures a hazmat employee has familiarity with the general provisions of [the HMR], is able to recognize and identify hazardous materials, has knowledge of specific requirements of [the HMR] applicable to functions performed by the employee, and has knowledge of emergency response information, self-protection measures and accident prevention methods and procedures. The two Maryland regulations, see section I.A, above, require that operators of motor vehicles transporting regulated materials, including hazardous materials, pass an examination. The examination is to ensure that the driver is trained in procedures for identifying and marking regulated materials for transportation, safely transporting regulated materials and instituting emergency procedures in the event of a spill. The regulations stipulate the required areas of training, provide for an examination to demonstrate training in those areas, and authorize issuance of a driver's certificate to identify those who satisfactorily have been trained. These are elements of a ``systematic program'' of ``training requirements.'' Accordingly, the Maryland regulations, as they apply to those transporting hazardous materials, are subject to 49 CFR 172.701.
