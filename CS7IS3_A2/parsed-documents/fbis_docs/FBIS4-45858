Here is a report by Senada Cumurovic: [passage omitted] Ohranovic: The greatest problems that the citizens of Gorazde are now facing are the accommodation of the population that has been streaming from the occupied regions into the town and the problem of water. We are seeking the best solutions here and are insisting that the international organizations help solve the problem. The International Red Cross has tried to do something and has brought some equipment to supply at least the hospital with drinking water, that is, water for cleaning. However, the problem of the entire town has still not been solved. We are working together with the international organizations to solve the problem, but this is nevertheless going slowly. Gorazde's people are having a real problem with water and are using the murky waters of the River Drina. Cumurovic: Thanks to the packages from the International Committee of the Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres, the medical supplies to Gorazde and its hospitals have been improved, Dr. Alija Begovic said. However, he indicated a major health problem. Begovic: It seems that we are facing an epidemic of infectious hepatitis. We already have several cases of it in different parts of the town. In such unhygienic conditions, this will be fatal if something is not done urgently. Cumurovic: In three days, 265 wounded people have been evacuated from Gorazde but the need for further evacuation is still great. At this moment, UNPROFOR teams are visiting villages in the commune in order to transport people to Gorazde and then further on. Besides, in the town itself, 400 to 500 wounded people are awaiting evacuation, Dr. Begovic said. [passage omitted]
