But Mr. Keating's office in Canberra said Australia was a strong supporter of freedom of the press which was regarded as a basic right. A spokesman said Mr. Keating would go ahead with his planned trip to Jakarta despite a call by a leading Indonesian human rights lawyer to cancel the trip following the banning of the magazines by the government of President Suharto. Michael Marr reports from Jakarta. [Begin Marr recording] The head of Indonesia's Legal Aid Institute, Adnan Buyung Nasution, has urged Mr. Keating to cancel his trip to Jakarta which is scheduled for next week to protest against the closure of the three news weeklies. The leading human rights lawyer has also called on U.S. President Bill Clinton to call off his planned visit to Indonesia due to take place during the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum's leaders summit later this year. The government has yet to fully reveal why it banned TEMPO, the country's leading news magazine, and the popular publications DETIK and EDITOR. However, all three magazines have recently published articles critical of the country's research and technology minister, Dr. Yusuf Habibie, who is a confidant of President Suharto. Pro-democracy activists have been quick to declare the closure of the publications as a major setback to openness in Indonesia. So far, authorities have yet to say whether or not the bans will be permanent. [end recording]
