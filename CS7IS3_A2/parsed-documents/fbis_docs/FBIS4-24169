Yesterday alone, French soldiers officially carried out four patrols within Rwandan territory from their Zairean bases in Goma and Bukavu. The strategy of the French forces is to increase the number of patrols in refugee camps. General Lafourcade, the commander of Operation Turquoise, outlined the details to Christophe Boisbouvier: [Begin Lafourcade recording] In the north we went to Kanama some five km east of (Ndjihi), where we found a camp housing 400 Hutus. It seems that health conditions there are not disastrous, but this remains to be confirmed. We also went to (Manyumba). We are now stepping up our effort: we have some 1,000 soldiers and around 100 vehicles. There are around 40 soldiers in Rwanda -- we are sending more today on reconnaissance missions -- some of them are returning to Zaire for the night. They are in the south; I will not tell you precisely where because they are on permanent reconnaissance missions. They stop at night, usually near a refugee camp. [end recording] One thousand French soldiers and 40 Senegalese soldiers are already taking part in Operation Turquoise. What are the relations between Operation Turquoise and soldiers of the Rwandan Army? Gen. Lafourcade gives some more details: [Begin Lafourcade recording] We have very few contacts with the Rwandan Armed Forces apart from normal courtesy contacts with the authorities to prevent errors. You will understand that it is important to avoid confusing government soldiers and rebels or poorly organized militiamen under no one's authority. So we are simply establishing contacts with the (?local) authorities and moving on to refugee camps to protect the population. [end recording]
