Zhu Chunhong, one of the survey's sponsors from the management committee in the area, said that most of the real estate companies are well organised, since qualified professionals make up over 70 percent of the staff in 199 companies out of 205 sampled. Some 80 percent of the firms have sound accounts and good management, he said. Housing construction has also kept up a reasonable growth rate, he said. In the period from May, 1992, to June, 1993, some 300 such projects were approved in Pudong, to cost 16 billion yuan and covering an area of 2,000 hectares. So far, 180 projects have started construction, with ordinary commercial houses making up for 47 percent of the planned floor space, and luxury ones, 18 percent. Zhu said that 38 ha. of land belonging to 15 companies has been reclaimed by the government, because the projects have failed to go into operation within two years.
