FR941206-0-00124 FR941206-0-00017 Authority: Secs. 2, 3, 4, 301, 303, 307, 308, 309, 48 Stat. as amended, 1064, 1065, 1066, 1081, 1082,1083, 1084, 1085, 1101; 47 U.S.C. Secs. 152, 153, 154, 301, 303, 307, 308, 309, 532, 535, 542, 543, 552 as amended, 106 Stat. 1460. 2. Section 76.901 is amended by adding paragraph (d) to read as follows: ยง76.901 Definitions * * * * * (d) New Product Tier. A new product tier (``NPT'') is a cable programming service tier meeting the conditions set forth in ยง76.987. 3. Section 76.922 is amended by revising paragraphs (d)(3)(x), (d)(3)(xi) and (e) to read as follows: ยง76.922 Rates for the basic service tier and cable programming services tiers. * * * * * (d) * * * (3) * * * (x) Adjustments to permitted charges on account of increase in costs of programming shall be further adjusted to reflect any revenues received by the operator from the programmer. Such adjustments shall apply on a channel-by-channel basis. (xi) In calculating programming expense, operators may add a mark-up of 7.5% for increases in programming costs occurring after March 31, 1994, except that operators may not file for or take the 7.5% mark-up on programming costs for new channels added on or after May 15, 1994 for which the operator has used the methodology set forth in paragraph (e)(3) of this section for adjusting rates for channels added to cable programming service tiers. Operators shall reduce rates by decreases in programming expense plus an additional 7.5% for decreases occurring after May 15, 1994 except with respect to programming cost decreases on channels added after May 15, 1994 for which the rate adjustment methodology in paragraph (e)(3) of this section was used. (e) Changes in the number of channels on regulated tiers_ (1) Generally. A system may adjust the residual component of its permitted rate for a tier to reflect changes in the number of channels offered on the tier on a quarterly basis. Cable systems shall use FCC Form 1210 (or FCC Form 1211, where applicable) to justify rate changes made on account on changes in the number of channels on a basic service tier (``BST'') or a cable programming service tier (``CPST''). Such rate adjustments shall be based on any changes in the number of regulated channels that occurred from the end of the last quarter for which an adjustment was previously made through the end of the quarter that has most recently closed preceding the filing of the FCC Form 1210 (or FCC Form 1211, where applicable). However, when a system deletes channels in a calendar quarter, the system must adjust the residual component of the tier charge in the next calendar quarter to reflect that deletion. Operators must elect between the channel addition rules in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section the first time they adjust rates after December 31, 1994, to reflect a channel addition to a CPST that occurred on or after May 15, 1994, and must use the elected methodology for all rate adjustments through December 31, 1997. A system that adjusted rates after May 15, 1994, but before January 1, 1995 on account of a change in the number of channels on a CPST that occurred after May 15, 1994, may elect to revise its rates to charge the rates permitted by paragraph (e)(3) of this section on or after January 1, 1995, but is not required to do so as a condition for using the methodology in paragraph (e)(3) of this section for rate adjustments after January 1, 1995. Rates for the BST will be governed exclusively by paragraph (e)(2) of this section, except that where a system offered only one tier on May 14, 1994, the cable operator will be allowed to elect between paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section as if the tier was a CPST. (2) Adjusting Rates for increases in the number of channels offered between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1997, on a basic service tier and at the election of the operator on a cable programming service tier. The following table shall be used to adjust permitted rates for increases in the number of channels offered between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1997, on a basic service tier and subject to the conditions in paragraph (e)(1) of this section at the election of the operator on a CPST. The entries in the table provide the cents per channel per subscriber per month by which cable operators will adjust the residual component using FCC Form 1210 (or FCC Form 1211, where applicable).
