Vyakhirev visited the Perm design and production joint stock companies Aviyadvigatel and Permskiye Motory, the Iskra scientific-production association and one of the city's machinebuilding enterprises. Until recently these converted enterprises worked on orders from the defense and aviation industries, producing engines for military and civilian designation as well as missile equipment. Last year RAO Gazprom and the Perm enterprises concluded a three-year agreement on the development and experimental production, on the basis of aviation engines, of gas pumping units with a 12MVt capacity and a coefficient of useful service life of more than 34 percent. Beginning in the 1970's the gas industry used aviation engines as drive pumps at gas compressor stations of the main gas pipelines. However, at that time Gazprom used old equipment which had already exhausted its flight resources and which had low technical-economic indicators. During its visit to Perm the Gazprom delegation reviewed the experimental gas pumping unit models working at one of the gas pumping stations under Perm and discussed the course of further work on developing and implementing production of these units with the leadership of the Perm enterprises and design bureaus. Production of this equipment ordered by Gazprom at Perm enterprises will allow for carrying out reconstruction at the currently existing compressor stations. As a result, the productivity of the mainline gas pipelines will increase 15-20 percent, waste of gas will drop and expenses for repair work will decrease. In addition, the orders from RAO Gazprom will allow the Perm enterprises to maintain their scientific and technical potential. Purchases of imported equipment will decrease as a whole for each sector.
