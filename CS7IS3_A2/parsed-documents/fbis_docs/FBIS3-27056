U.S. President Bill Clinton, followed by French President Francois Mitterrand and British Prime Minister John Major, were all around appealing to King Fahd for better chances for their own countries. Behind the heavy lobbying was the hot rivalry for survival prominently between American aircraft makers, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, and Airbus Industries, owned by four European countries. Like his counterparts abroad, Clinton, though busy with health care reform and crime fighting at home, still has a new role to play: the salesman-in-chief for corporate America. In announcing Saudi Arabia's purchase of American planes worth nearly six billion U.S. dollars here today, Clinton made good on his promise to strive for more and fair trade opportunities for U.S. firms. "We worked hard on this, and we will continue to work hard at home and abroad to help our people thrive in the global economy," Clinton said at a hastily arranged White House ceremony this morning. Flanked by Frank Shrontz, chairman of Boeing company, and John McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell Douglas Corp., the President said he was proud to be called the salesman-in-chief of corporate America. According to Commerce Secretary Ron Brown today, who visited Saudi Arabia twice late last year to discuss potential plane sales to Riyadh, President Clinton called King Fahd on the phone in person last year. "I have talked with the President many times on this issue," Brown said. "He was very familiar with everything that we were doing." In selling 50 airplanes to Saudi Arabia, the U.S. is expected to keep nearly 200,000 high-paying, high-tech jobs in the two companies, and in United Technologies Inc. and General Electric Co., makers of aircraft engines. Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, the first and third largest aircraft makers, are competing with the European Airbus consortium, the producer of one in every four of the world's commercial airplanes. In the Seattle-based Boeing company, commercial jetliner deliveries dropped from 440 in 1991 to 300 last year, while its profit margin -- the net income as a percentage of the total sales, was pared down from 5.3 percent to 4.6 percent. The overall earning of the Long Beach, California-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. is up thanks to increasing demand for key military planes like C-17 transport aircraft and F-15 fighters. But as far as commercial aircraft were concerned, the firm had more orders canceled than won in 1993. The two companies, which have a combined workforce of 150,000 are still cutting hands. The total employment in U.S. civil aircraft industry stands at some 250,000, down nearly one third from the peak level in 1991. The plight, observers noted, explains how dependent corporate America has become on foreign sales in the wake of defense conversion and their own fat cutting. A year ago, President Clinton, in his first major foreign trade policy speech, pledged that his government would be more than aggressive in assisting American companies abroad in order to make them "compete, not retreat." In the national export strategy unveiled late last year, the administration promised to help boost the exports of key industries like auto, telecommunications, petroleum, banking and insurance services. The Commerce Department, meanwhile, is listing 10 countries as key emerging markets for American products and preparing specifically targeted export strategies. According to government officials, every billion dollars of exports means 20,000 new jobs at home. The new deal with Saudi Arabia is 15 percent of the annual U.S. exports of commercial aircraft. The administration is also eyeing the profitable phone markets in Saudi Arabia, which plans to put in 1.5 million more phone lines, willing to help AT&T against Siemens of Germany in winning four billion dollars worth contracts. "If there are two or three or four American companies competing against foreign competitors, we're going to support all of them," Secretary Brown said. "We're not going to choose among or between American companies."
