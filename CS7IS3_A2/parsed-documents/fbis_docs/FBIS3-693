In the last two days, Mr. Kingibe held talks in Yaounde with the Cameroonian foreign and defense ministers. Before departing for Abuja, Mr. Kingibe said the two sides would have to sit down at some point to sort out whose territory Bakassi is. Cameroon's state radio later reported that President Biya would not be meeting the Nigeria leader, General Sani Abacha, until Nigerian troops had withdrawn from Bakassi.
