Documents determining the nuclear-free status of Ukraine were signed at the tripartite consultative (?) meeting in Moscow. We had already written in the last issue of NEZAVISIMOST that these decisions had been determined in advance, as attested by the words of A. Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs of Russia, who by no means considers the tripartite accords the main result of the Moscow summit, and the very vague statement of L. Kravchuk at the news conference in Borispol, which may be formulated briefly approximately thus: Ukraine cannot go against the wishes of the main world powers. Well, let us once again spread out the cards in the nuclear solitaire to better understand what kind of legacy we are renouncing. And why. Arsenal No 3 The reader who has been following the problem closely might have noticed that Ukraine's nuclear potential has frequently been defined as third in importance after the United States and Russia. What did this arsenal No. 3 represent? Of the components of the strategic triad (ground-based and sea- and air-launched missiles), the first and the third were represented here. Broadly speaking, each element of the triad worked for the others, complementing and mutually reinforcing the others. Strategic offensive arms (SOA) in the system of the Ministry of Defense of the former USSR were always considered the "holy of holies." In all the years that I have been writing on military matters not once have I spent time on operational duty in units of the strategic missile forces or on a nuclear-powered submarine equipped with ballistic missiles. Nonetheless, I learned a great deal in those, "stagnation," times. Although the main information was still obtained when the disarmament process was actively under way. Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM's) were rightly considered the basis of the Soviet SOA. Those in the fixed-site category were deployed in launch silos--most intricate underground structures capable of withstanding a nuclear blast. The shaft of the silo is covered by a special metal roof, and the launch canister, fitted with a reliable shock-absorption system, is capable of withstanding colossal impact. The post-boost section of the Soviet missiles could carry from 1 to 10 nuclear warheads. Almost one-fifth of the warheads of the ground-based component of the triad is deployed in Ukraine. This is more than the nuclear warheads of Britain and France put together. Two ICBM bases are known. SS-19's are based in Pervomaysk of Nikolayev Oblast, as in the environs of Khmelnitskiy. These are quite powerful two-stage liquid-fuel rockets. A very important detail: The three-stage solid-fuel SS-24's--the main part of the Soviet ICBM's of this type of silo basing--are deployed in Pervomaysk also. It is these missiles that were manufactured in Pavlodar, which is in the Dnepropetrovsk region. And SS-18's are manufactured in Dnepropetrovsk itself, at the celebrated Yuzhmash. These missiles, the world's only heavy type, were with good reason christened Satan. Each of them is capable of delivering to target up to 10 one-megaton warheads. The air component of the triad, less significant (but with its advantages), was composed of heavy bombers capable of carrying nuclear bombs or long-range nuclear cruise missiles. Note that each "cruise" could carry one nuclear warhead, but each bomber could be fitted with 16 such missiles. There are two major heavy bomber air bases in Ukraine--in Kiev and Poltava Oblasts. Although we have no test ranges or centers for instruction in work with ICBM's, there is a facility for converting and eliminating ICBM's in Sarny. Heroic Surmounting of Difficulties In May 1992 in Lisbon the heads of the foreign policy departments of the four "nuclear" republics of the former USSR and the U.S. secretary of state signed a protocol to the Soviet-American Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms (START I), which was to have been followed by the ratification of START I by the parliaments of these states. Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus not only confirmed the USSR's START Treaty obligations but also undertook to completely eliminate the strategic offensive arms deployed on their territory within seven years. In addition, the three states promised to subscribe to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as nuclear-free states. This step afforded Russia the opportunity to lay claim to the status of "sole legitimate nuclear successor of the USSR." Handsome gestures, splendid declarations.... How much in our history have we lost on account of the ineradicable passion for political posturing! Without murmur, almost, we allowed the tactical nuclear weapons on our territory to be withdrawn. And although in March 1992 L. Kravchuk announced a suspension of the withdrawal of the tactical nuclear weapons, many observers merely smiled ironically at this inasmuch as they believed that the withdrawal was wholly controlled by Moscow. In addition, from the formal viewpoint this decision of the president's was contrary to the declaration on the nuclear-free status of Ukraine. Thus was the first step en route to the world community's distrust of Ukraine's ability to keep its word taken. The euphoria from the proclamation of independence caused problems. We should, oh how we should, have consulted specialists. And then, perhaps, events would have developed differently. While having agreed to the destruction of our part of the SOA's, we could perfectly well have kept for ourselves the tactical missiles. We would not here have acquired so mighty an opponent as the United States (the strategic missiles deployed in Ukraine are targeted against the United States, and fighting Russia with them is impossible). The nuclear warheads would not have needed to be replaced for a very long time or the missiles could have been converted to deliver point weapons, say. There would doubtless have been problems in the international arena here also. Nonetheless, I believe that mobile and efficient tactical nuclear weapons would have been far more suitable for us from the viewpoint of deterrence than the strategic missiles, which are not only a target for the ICBM's of a probable enemy but which also, if launched, would cause the deaths of the inhabitants of the villages in the vicinity of the silos. But the tactical missiles were removed, and only then did the bargaining over compensation begin. Bitter arguments arose over the SOA's also. In a word, the Ukrainian state followed the distressingly well-known principle: Having initially created the difficulties, it set about heroically overcoming them. `For'... The West's policy in regard to the nuclear weapons that constitute the legacy of the USSR has in this time been quite clearly defined. This is how it was formulated by B. Clinton: Europe would be more stable were Russia to be the sole nuclear power-successor of the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, certain political scientists advocated Ukraine's nuclear status. They adduced as the main argument the historically difficult relations between Ukraine and Russia. Giving our country serious guarantees of its security was proposed, therefore. Forecasting the course of events, the scholars examined several possible causes of a significant deterioration in the mutual relations of Ukraine and Russia. They include the common unprotected border, the danger of hyper-nationalism, an escalation of existing tensions (Crimea, the Black Sea Fleet), and the problem of Russians in Ukraine and Ukrainians in Russia. The supporters of nuclear deterrence believe that Ukraine's nuclear weapons could be an effective means against an attack involving the use of conventional armed forces or against nuclear blackmail. Their arguments were approximately as follows: In the pre-nuclear world between 1900 and 1945 there were two world wars, in which approximately 50 million Europeans died. In the nuclear era only 15,000 Europeans died in small wars between 1945 and 1990. And to speak of the superpowers, on the other hand, there was a stable peace between them. It is nuclear weapons, in their opinion, that have been the firm basis of this peace (the concept of "nuclear stalemate," when neither side can win inasmuch as it would itself perish, is well known). ...and `Against' Who could have guaranteed that Russia would have handed over to us its nuclear weapons unimpeded? After all, we are not in command of them even now, essentially. Would we have had the experience and wisdom sufficient for correctly disposing of the nuclear legacy of the USSR? Their storage and maintenance have constituted a serious problem. And were we, for all that, to take over the command and control of the SOA's, Russia would know full well how to paralyze the launch complexes, and nuclear espionage would develop to exaggerated proportions, which would only poison the two countries' mutual relations. Add the political instability in Ukraine: What if forces that might want to make use of the missiles were to come to power? It is most unlikely, observers believe, that nuclear weapons could resolve all the problems of Ukraine's security. The missiles of the nuclear powers would be retargeted on it in an instant. It is perfectly possible that the possession of SOA's would lead Ukraine's leaders into the temptation to brandish the "nuclear nightstick" a little. And preservation of the nuclear status would hardly contribute to our country's integration in the European process. And in conclusion, some calculations. Were Ukraine to want to become a medium-sized nuclear power (like France or Britain), it would have to spend up to $5 billion annually on its nuclear programs. According to some estimates, Ukraine would need no fewer than 10 years and expenditure put at hundreds of billions of dollars to make good the supplies of components and fuel for the missile plants, create its own enterprises manufacturing nuclear warheads and guidance systems, and develop the facilities and methods of the control and safe operation of strategic systems and an early-warning system, space-based missile-targeting facilities, and sites for testing nuclear munitions, spacecraft launches, and missile testing (it would, in addition, be necessary to obtain the consent of neighboring countries to the flight over their territory of the missiles being tested). Blackmail and Threats Peering into the future, political scientists have observed that the basis of the new multipolar Europe will be rivalry between Germany and Russia in the field of security. An independent Ukraine could ease this rivalry. It is, after all, a considerable barrier between Germany and Russia. But take away this key barrier, and the borders of the two strongest states of Europe draw closer for there are weak countries between them, after all. Thus Ukraine becomes an arena of new political rivalry. In the case of the nuclear weapons it is absolutely clear that Russia (and, broadly speaking, the United States inasmuch as it is the latter that is the rival of Germany in the world, as Russia is in Europe) has bested the FRG. Everything has been used to achieve this goal: from disinformation of world public opinion and economic blackmail through a refusal to maintain Ukraine's nuclear arsenals, despite current agreements. One Further Option At the time when Russia was attacking Ukraine's nuclear policy "on all azimuths," in de Gaulle's well-known expression, the United States was deafeningly silent. But this could not have lasted long, and new approaches were manifested at the time of Les Aspin's visit to Kiev, apparently. What was Ukraine's nuclear potential at that time? Some 130 SS-19 missiles (six warheads each), 46 SS-24's (10 warheads each), and 30 strategic bombers, which all together can carry 416 bombs. It was rumored that Ukraine could aspire to definitive control of the strategic bombers and could launch those SS-24's that had been built in our country. And, indeed, had things turned out differently, this could have been a prospective program. Even in this case Ukraine's nuclear potential would have remained the third in the world. There is reason to believe that these matters were discussed during the negotiations with Les Aspin. It was at this time that the idea of international control of the nuclear warheads from the missiles stood down from alert status, which would have been warehoused on the territory of Ukraine until a decision on the amounts of compensation for them had been adopted, was advanced. Observers allow that Aspin's negotiations were a deft maneuver aimed at increasing the political isolation of Ukraine as a "latter-day European aggressor." This worked in the Western press. Many publications appeared on this subject. This is why B. Clinton's speech in Brussels and, subsequently, his meetings in Kiev and Moscow assumed the nature of a sensation. Way Out of the Impasse. But Which? Ukraine has, for all that, I believe, emerged from the impasse to which it had been brought by irresponsible petty "peacemaker" politicians. Russia has agreed to compensation for the withdrawn tactical nuclear weapons, the amounts of which will be determined by experts. On the basis of an agreement between Ukraine and Russia the uranium from the warheads of our strategic missiles will be compensated by fuel for the nuclear power stations. Technical assistance in the dismantling will be rendered. Ukraine's rating in the international arena has risen. Economic assistance has been promised. True, all this is possible, in my view, only if Ukraine sails, if not in the wake of Russian (or, rather, Russian-American) policy, at least a parallel course. And whereas what we noticed at the meeting in Borispol was our president's forced smile, in Moscow it was his shifty eyes. Of what was agreed there is, as before, much that is unclear. The security guarantees, for example. The Treaty on Nuclear Nonproliferation cannot be deemed such on account of the imprecision and vagueness of the wording contained therein. L. Kravchuk's references to the "honest word" of the presidents of the United States and Russia are naive. Or take the problem of the missile silos. How are they to be destroyed? Explosions would cause the region's ecology irreparable damage. One way or another, the deed is done. In acquiring (de facto) nuclear-free status Ukraine is, it would seem, losing part of its independence. Ukraine has never yet throughout its history been absolutely independent, for that matter. The question is to what extent and on whom we will be dependent today.
