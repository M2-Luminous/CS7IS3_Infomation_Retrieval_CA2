Mak Ben said that Samdech Euv the king thought that in order to resolve the current serious situation there was only one magic solution, which was to reconcile the nation by uniting all our national forces around the king and the throne. On 21 November 1993, the king put forward a five-point political initiative requiring that all national forces soften their respective positions so that everyone can unite and move toward genuine national reconciliation and peace. The PDK has fully and unconditionally supported the king's five-point political initiative. The entire Cambodian nation and people in rural areas and cities and inside and outside the country have assisted and supported this five-point initiative. The world, particularly the ASEAN countries, are happy about the proposal and have welcomed it because they want Cambodia to have genuine peace and national reconciliation, which is conducive to peace, security, and stability in the entire region. Mak Ben said that on 22 January Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh sent his representative to inform the PDK representative in Phnom Penh that Prince Krompreah and FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] fully accept the king's five-point initiative and that all the points should be implemented simultaneously. Furthermore, agreement was reached on setting up a nameless technical group for talks based on the king's five-point initiative. Replying to the above clarification by Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, PDK chairman, expressed his joy and thanks to Prince Krompreah and noted that this is an important step, enabling the king's five-point policy to move toward realization in accordance with the king's lofty desire and the profound and sacred aspiration of the entire Cambodian nation and people. It should be noted that the PDK has not demanded that any personalities or parties be excluded. The PDK wants to see all national forces united, including FUNCINPEC, the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party [BLDP], the Cambodian People's Party [CPP], the PDK, and other national forces, in order that there might be genuine national reconciliation, national unity, and peace. Previously the CPP and H.E. Hun Sen repeatedly stated that only three points were to be discussed. On 7 January 1994, and later, the CPP and H.E. Hun Sen continued to demand that DK accept and implement the three points first before they agree to talk about other issues. This is offensive to the PDK and runs counter to the spirit of national reconciliation and the rallying of national forces. We hope that H.E. Hun Sen and the CPP will reconsider this issue, accept the royal five-point political guidance, and send representatives to work in the technical group in accordance with the united aim of Prince Krompreah and H.E. Khieu Samphan. This is in order to move the king's five-point initiative toward its realization. In the immediate future, H.E. Khieu Samphan suggests that the technical group start its work straightaway with representatives from FUNCINPEC and the PDK. Once H.E. Hun Sen and the CPP clearly announce acceptance of the royal five-point initiative, then the CPP will also be included. Mak Ben recalled that the BLDP has also declared support for the king's five-point initiative.
