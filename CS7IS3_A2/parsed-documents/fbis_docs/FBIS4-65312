Speaking in Vienna, Austria, Rehn gave assurances that cross-border countries will continue to hold an important position in bilateral relations irrespective of the EU. She addressed a meeting of the second government party, the People's Party. Defense Minister Rehn pointed out the end of the Cold War had not changed the situation in northern Europe. For Russia, the strategic importance of its northwestern corner had only grown following the breakup of the Soviet Union and nuclear disarmament. Rehn reiterated Finland's stance that a country could retain an independent defense and military nonalliance within the EU.
