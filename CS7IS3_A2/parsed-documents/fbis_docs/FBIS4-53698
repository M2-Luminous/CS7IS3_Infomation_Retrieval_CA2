FBIS4-53698 "dreas099_a_94034" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 20 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Review of HDTV Broadcasting System Proposed Review of HDTV Broadcasting System Proposed OW2205075594 Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese 1049 GMT 20 May 94 OW2205075594 Tokyo NHK General Television Network Japanese BFN [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" program] [Text] The Radio Regulatory Council, an advisory body to the post and telecommunications minister, has submitted a report on the future use of high-definition television [HDTV]. The report proposes that licenses for HDTV broadcasting should be granted to different stations for each day of the week beginning this autumn, when test-broadcasting is scheduled to begin, and that one of the satellite television channels should be tentatively allocated for HDTV broadcasting after 1997, when fully-fledged broadcasting is scheduled to begin. The Post and Telecommunications Ministry plans to start test- broadcasting HDTV programs after the current round of test-broadcasting ends this autumn. It also plans to start full HDTV broadcasting after 1997 using a new satellite to replace the current BS-3 satellite. Licenses for HDTV broadcasting are currently granted only to the Hi-Definition Television Promotion Association. Today's report recommends that this should be revised so that all television stations will be able to produce programs independently. According to the report, licenses for test-broadcasting will be granted to different stations for each day of the week, and each station will be allocated more than five hours of broadcasting time. NHK will also have more than five hours of broadcasting everyday, providing a combined total of more than 10 hours of HDTV broadcasting a day by NHK and commercial stations. Commercial stations will be allowed to air advertising. The report says three of the eight channels on the new broadcasting satellite will be allocated for current satellite broadcasting channels. However, these channels will be used for HDTV broadcasting when HDTV sets become more common. The other five channels will be allocated for both HDTV and conventional broadcasts -- one will be tentatively reserved for HDTV broadcasts. The report says commercial stations can specialize in sports, news or other areas of their choice, and they will be allowed to air advertising and charge fees for their programs. NHK and commercial stations will soon apply to the ministry for licenses for HDTV test-broadcasting.
