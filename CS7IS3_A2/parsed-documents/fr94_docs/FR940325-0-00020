FR940325-0-00020 FR940325-0-00005 Other Matters Environmental Impact At the time of development of the November 29, 1993 interim rule, a Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. That Finding remains applicable to this final rule, and is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address. Impact on Small Entities The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this final rule before publication, and, by approving it, certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule's major effect is on housing agencies which are state and local governmental entities. The final rule revises the manner in which the total development cost is calculated, and in so doing, reduces delays and costs in the development of public and Indian housing, which is beneficial to housing agencies. Federalism Impact The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12612, Federalism, has determined that this final rule will not have a substantial, direct effect on the States or their political subdivisions or on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power or responsibilities among the various levels of government. The rule removes, rather than imposes, a program requirement. Impact on the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this final rule does not have a potential significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and thus is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.
