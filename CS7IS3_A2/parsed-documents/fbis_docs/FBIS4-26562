It is believed that Britain has informed China that if no agreement is reached officially by early July, Britain cannot guarantee that all military facilities would be ready for handover by July 1, 1997. Hopes of reaching an overall agreement on defence sites will rapidly fade unless China accepts Britain's position at this morning's meeting. Britain's bottom line includes two contentious points that remain unresolved despite protracted negotiations: A limit on the size of the Stonecutters Island naval base and the number of military residential blocks to be handed over to China. It is understood that Britain told China of its position on both issues at yesterday's plenary session of the Joint Liaison Group (JLG). China has insisted on a much larger naval base and complained that Britain was willing to hand over only 30 percent of the residential blocks available. Britain had hoped an agreement could be reached this morning by the expert team, in time to be endorsed by the plenary session. Britain's timetable is for the Hong Kong Government to apply for the funding necessary for redeveloping these military sites at the last Legislative Council finance committee meeting of the political calendar on July 15. A JLG agreement will have to be reached soon to allow enough time between now and mid-July to prepare the necessary papers on funding for committee members. The funding will be essential for the redevelopment of military hospitals and refurbishment of a number of buildings at some military sites, as well as the expansion of the Stonecutters Island naval base before 1997. This will take time to complete. Further land reclamation works on Stonecutters Island, for example, will take at least three months. China has agreed to hand over any military sites not used by the military to the future Special Administrative Region government. The expert team talks on the military sites have been conducted simultaneously with the JLG plenary session, which is due to end today. At yesterday's meeting, both sides failed to agree on right of abode for returning Hong Kong migrants. Britain has also failed to secure China's agreement on the construction of the much-delayed Container Terminal Nine (CT9). The granting of CT9 development rights is one of the main issues on the JLG agenda. Guo Fengmin, the head of the Chinese JLG team, said China would not agree on the terminal until Hong Kong people had been consulted. China has insisted that the terminal must be built in a cost-effective way. If no agreement on defence lands is made this morning, it is expected that both sides will announce agreements on a number of multilateral treaties affecting the economy and trade. Meanwhile, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping, has said an agreement on airport financing could come as early as the end of this month. In an interview with the ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL published yesterday, Lu was quoted as saying China would accept debts for the airport far above the HK$5 billion limit once insisted upon and contained in the Memorandum of Understanding. Lu's comments are the strongest signal of support from China so far on the latest airport financing proposal.
