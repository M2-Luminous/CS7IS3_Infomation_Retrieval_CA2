The Food Agency is selling an initial 14,000 tons of U.S. rice, 16,000 tons of Chinese rice and 20,000 tons of Thai rice for a trial period in February. U.S. rice from California has already reached retail outlets. The government sold the Californian rice to wholesalers from February 8 at prices some 16 percent lower than the price of domestic rice. The Thai and Chinese rice is likely to hit the supermarket shelves at different times around the country because of delays caused by inspections and snowfalls. In Tokyo it is likely to reach consumers by Friday. The Chinese rice is similar to the medium short-grain Japanese staple, while the Thai rice is the long-grain type. Wholesalers and retailers alike are striving to fit the rice into categories which might appeal to customers. Many rice outlets have indicated they will not blend the different types of rice and will market the imported rice separately in small bags. Blended rice is likely to become more commonly available on the market after March when larger volumes of foreign rice are released for sale, according to Food Agency sources. Japan began to import rice as an emergency measure after a poor harvest last year left the nation with a major shortfall of its main staple. In December, Japan agreed at global trade talks to partially open its rice market, breaking a long-standing policy of barring most imports of rice. Japan is expected to import as much as two million tons of rice to make up for the shortage resulting from last year's worst postwar harvest.
