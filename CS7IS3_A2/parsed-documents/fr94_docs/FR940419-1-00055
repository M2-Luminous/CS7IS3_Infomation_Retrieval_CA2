FR940419-1-00055 FR940419-1-00009 The current rule under subpart B would be expanded substantially to establish policies and procedures for HAs with respect to resident participation activities. For example, HAs shall provide any funds they receive for resident participation activities to the duly elected resident council. Parts 990 and 905, subpart J would be amended to require an ``add-on'' of $25 per unit per year to the HA's operating subsidy calculation, which would be paid to the HA only if appropriations were available for that purpose, to support activities of the duly elected resident council. The HUD Circular HM 7475.9 dated February 10, 1992, authorized funds not to exceed three ($3) dollars per unit per year. The Department believes that an increase of $22 per unit per year is reasonable and, if available, would guarantee the resources necessary to create a bonafide partnership among the duly elected resident council and the HA. Strong partnerships are critical for achieving mutual goals contained in this subpart. Also, HUD proposes to encourage HAs to provide stipends in an amount up to $200 per month/per officer to resident council officers who serve as volunteers in the public housing development to carry out these duties and functions as officers of the resident council. The Department believes that these volunteers should be reimbursed for their expenses related to volunteer efforts, such as child care, transportation, special equipment, clothing, etc. The current part 964 regulations lack specificity regarding resident elections and organizational policies, and have made it difficult to determine what is a duly elected resident council and that has caused conflicts among the residents. The proposed regulations would add new policies and procedures for resident councils by defining what is a duly elected resident council, detailing minimum standards for elections of resident councils and specifying the relationship between the resident councils and resident management corporations. Resident councils would be required to meet HUD's election standards in order to receive official recognition from the HA and HUD, as well as to receive funds in conjunction with the conduct of resident council business. The role of the jurisdiction-wide resident council would be established under the proposed rule. The rule also contains provisions that expand the resident participation requirements to strongly support resident participation in all aspects of a HA's management operations and that give rights to residents to freely organize and represent their interests. The proposed rule would add a new subpart D to implement the Family Investment Center (FIC) Program under section 22 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437t) (added by section 515 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act). The FIC program provides families living in public housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities. This new subpart will be added to part 964 to include FIC because it complements the Department's resident participation and self-sufficiency initiatives. The program was proposed by a national association on behalf of numerous housing authorities. Representatives from public/Indian housing authorities, resident councils/resident management corporations and nonprofit housing agencies were convened at the Department to discuss program provisions and provide policy recommendations during the initial program planning stage. Some HAs will combine their FIC and Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) programs. This rule would provide that section 8 FSS Program participants are eligible to participate in the FIC program when it is combined with FSS, but that income exclusions that are provided to public housing residents participating in employment training and supportive service programs would not apply to Section 8 FSS families. The treatment of the FSS escrow account for public housing FIC/FSS families is not addressed in this proposed rule, but will be included in the final rulemaking. Proposed ยง964.320 provides HUD policy on training, employment and contracting of public/Indian housing residents under section 3 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1968. Section 915 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 made significant changes to section 3. HUD recently published a proposed rule implementing those changes (see 58 FR 52534, October 8, 1993). Section 3, as amended, requires that HAs make their best efforts, consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, to amend contracts for work to be performed in connection with development, operation and modernization assistance provided pursuant to sections 5, 9 and 14 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. As amended, section 3 establishes an order of priority to which the HA's efforts must be directed. Thus, the first level of priority is to residents of the housing development, for which the assistance is provided. This proposed rule includes provisions consistent with the proposed section 3 rule.
