The lower chamber of parliament was informed of this by Vladimir Gusev, leader of the State Taxation Service. The basic reason for this, according to him, is the nonpayments crisis and numerous cases of tax evasion. Briefing deputies on progress in fulfilling the Russian President's Edict "On the Implementation of a Tax Amnesty in 1993," Vladimir Gusev noted that nonpayment of taxes has essentially become widespread. He cited the following figures: Since the presidential edict came into force 44,000 corporate bodies and 2,000 individuals guilty of ignoring tax legislation have been detected. As a result the exchequer has experienced a shortfall of 350 billion rubles.
