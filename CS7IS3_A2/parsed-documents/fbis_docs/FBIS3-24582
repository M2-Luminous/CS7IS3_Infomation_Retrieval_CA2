Rakhley; UDC 621.383.52] [Abstract] The photo-electric linkages between the matrix elements of photodetectors made with GaAs and InP, which are the most common of the A[.sup]III[/]B[.sup]V[/] compounds. For determination of the coefficient of photoelectric linkage K[.sup]c[/], current I[.sub]�[/] was measured by illuminating the examined photodetector matrix. Next, the photodetector was covered by a light-tight screen and its current value was measured when the adjoining photodetector was illuminated. The value of K[.sup]c[/] was determined from equation K[.sup]c[/]=I[.sub]c[/]/I[.sub]�[/]. Spectral measurements were performed with a diffraction monochromator MDR- 23. The results of this study indicate that the diffusion length of the minor charge carriers is the parameter of the material, which significantly affects the value of K[.sup]c[/]. It was demonstrated that in the high sensitivity spectral region, the curve of K[.sup]c[/] as a function of the substrate thickness has a maximum, whose value depends on the relationship between the absorption depth and the radiation wavelength. It was established that the spectral characteristic of the coefficient K[.sup]c[/] of the GaAs and InP photo matrices is shifted to the shortwave spectral region, compared to silicon.
