FR940607-0-00024 FR940607-0-00008 Interest on Overpayments That Are Credited Against Certain Additions to the Tax Prior to DEFRA, interest only accrued on additions to the tax from the date of notice and demand, and then only if not paid within 10 days from the date of notice and demand. In §158 of DEFRA, Congress added §6601(e)(2)(B) to the IRC, requiring taxpayers to pay interest on certain additions to tax from the due date of the relevant return (including any extensions) until the addition to the tax is paid. The number of additions to the tax that bear interest from the due date of the return was increased by Congress in 1988 and again in 1989. This regulation amends §70.92(d)(2)(iv) to clarify that interest ceases to accrue on any portion of an overpayment that is credited against certain additions to the tax for any period after the due date of the return (including extensions) to which the addition to the tax relates. Prior Regulations Obsolete When ATF assumed responsibility for the collection and enforcement of taxes imposed under Subtitle E of the IRC, it patterned many of its procedural regulations upon those already promulgated by the IRS. See, e.g. , T.D. ATF&hyph;301, 55 Fed. Reg. 47608 (November 14, 1990); T.D. ATF&hyph;251, 52 Fed. Reg. 19314 (May 22, 1987). However, since enactment of §6622 of the IRC in TEFRA and §6601(e)(2)(B) in DEFRA, the prior regulations regarding interest and certain additions to tax have been obsolete. Accordingly, ATF has been computing interest consistent with the statutory changes and these regulatory amendments acknowledge existing agency practice. Regulatory Flexibility Act The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to a final regulatory flexibility analysis (5 U.S.C. 604) are not applicable to this final rule because the agency was not required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other law. A copy of this final rule has been submitted to the Administrator of the Small Business Administration for comment on the impact of such regulation on small business, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 7805(f). Executive Order 12866 It has been determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action because (1) it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the Presidents priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. Administrative Procedures Act Because this final rule merely adopts existing IRS procedural regulations regarding overpayment interest, it is found to be unnecessary to issue this Treasury decision for notice and public procedure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b) or subject to the effective date limitation in 5 U.S.C. 553(d). Paperwork Reduction Act The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR Part 1320, do not apply to this final rule because it does not impose any new recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

In the case of a credit against interest that accrues for any period ending prior to January 1, 1983, the due date is the earlier of the date of assessment of such interest or December 31, 1982. In the case of a credit against interest that accrues from any period beginning on or after December 31, 1982, such interest is due as it economically accrues on a daily basis, rather than when it is assessed. (iv) Additional amount, addition to the tax, or assessable penalty. In the case of a credit against an additional amount, addition to the tax, or assessable penalty, the due date is the earlier of the date of assessment or the date from which such amount would bear interest if not satisfied by payment or credit. * * * * * Signed: May 11, 1994. Daniel R. Black, Acting Director. Approved: May 19, 1994. John P. Simpson, Deputy Assistant Secretary (Regulatory, Tariff and Trade Enforcement).
