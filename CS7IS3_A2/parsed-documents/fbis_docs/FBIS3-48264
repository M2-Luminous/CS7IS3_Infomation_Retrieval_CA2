In response to the proposal, Khanitson Nawanukuro, deputy director-general of the Business Economics Department, said Asean senior economic officials will bring up the issue at their upcoming meeting in Jakarta Jan 27-28 to sound out opinions. He said apart from the copyright issue, Asean senior officials will discuss how to reduce tariffs on pulp under the Asean Free Trade Area (Afta) programme to a maximum of five per cent this year instead of within eight years as previously agreed. Afta requires its members to cut tariffs on pulp to zero-to-five per cent over an eight year period. But Khanitson said Asean members will try to move faster on the tariff cuts to make Afta a reality as soon as possible. Earlier, the Afta working committee studied the harmonization of product codes for customs purposes in a drive to lower barriers to trade. They concluded that Asean nations should accelerate tariff cuts for pulp, among others because it would be most beneficial to the member countries.
