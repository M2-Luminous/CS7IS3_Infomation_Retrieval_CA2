FR940204-2-00110 FR940204-2-00080 The regulation at 20 CFR 655.107(a) requires the Director, U.S. Employment Service, to publish USDA field and livestock worker (combined) wage data as AEWRs in a Federal Register notice.

Allowable Meal Charges Among the minimum benefits and working conditions which DOL requires employers to offer their alien and U.S. workers in their applications for temporary logging and H&hyph;2A agricultural labor certification is the provision of three meals per day or free and convenient cooking and kitchen facilities. 20 CFR 655.102(b)(4) and 655.202(b)(4). Where the employer provides meals, the job offer must state the charge, if any, to the worker for meals. DOL has published at 20 CFR 655.102(b)(4) and 655.111(a) the methodology for determining the maximum amounts covered H&hyph;2A agricultural employers may charge their U.S. and foreign workers for meals. The same methodology is applied at 20 CFR 655.202(b)(4) and 655.211(a) to covered H&hyph;2B logging employers. These rules provide for annual adjustments of the previous year's allowable charges based upon Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.
