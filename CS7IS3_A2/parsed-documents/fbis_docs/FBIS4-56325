It shows that former President and Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] is the second most popular presidential candidate with 19 percent of the votes. He comes behind Luis Inacio Lula da Silva (PT) [Workers Party], who has 30 percent. Sarney is ahead of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], who has 15 percent. Between 23 and 25 April, the institute interviewed 3,100 voters countrywide. Just 10 days earlier, the IBOPE [Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics Institute] released the results of its poll which showed Sarney in third place with 13 percent of the votes, Lula in first place with 31 percent, and Fernando Henrique Cardoso in second place with 16 percent. Of the three PMDB pre-presidential candidates, Vox Populi only inquired about the support for Sarney and Orestes Quercia, leaving Roberto Requiao aside. Requiao received the least support in a poll about PMDB pre-presidential candidates only. When Quercia is included in the list of candidates, he occupies the fourth place with 5 percent of the votes, Lula receives 35 percent of the votes, Fernando Henrique Cardoso 16 percent, and former Governor Leonel Brizola 9 percent. With the votes that were given to Sarney, the number of votes given to Lula decreased by five points, those given to Cardoso by one point, and those to Brizola by two points. Progressive Renewal Party candidate Espiridiao Amin and Liberal Party candidate Flavio Rocha remained stable in their positions with 3 percent and 1 percent, respectively. Brizola was chosen by 20 percent of those interviewed as the worst candidate on the list. The next worst candidate is Lula, who is rejected by 13 percent of the people. He is followed by Quercia (8 percent), and Sarney (7 percent). Fernando Henrique Cardoso is rejected by just 4 percent of those interviewed. In three different projections about the second round -- with Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Quercia, and Sarney as his rivals -- the Workers Party candidate, Lula, wins. His tightest victory is over Sarney: 40 percent to 32 percent.
