A KDU-CSL proposal concerning the restitution of church property was discussed and tasks were set which should be solved before a relevant resolution is discussed by the government. The Civic Democratic Party (ODS) still insists that no more claims concerning the redressing of property injustices should be proposed, ODS Deputy Chairman Jiri Vlach said. He added that in the ODS's view the debate on the completion of restitutions had come rather late, though the coalition partners consider it to be premature. The issue of church property restitutions could be solved in an executive way in the framework of the existing laws, Vlach said. It was agreed at the meeting that the issue of church property should be solved before a full stop is made to end restitutions, Deputy Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) Miroslav Tyl said. He said the KDS was not concerned about the form in which church property was to be returned. It only insists that the return of church property be set down by law as firmly as was the restitution of property which has already been returned to its initial owners, he said. ODS Deputy Chairman Jan Strasky told CTK that the next coalition meeting on the same topic was to be held in a fortnight.
