France banned the Serbs' Europe-wide peaceful protest from being staged in Strasbourg on February 6 and their more recent rally, organized by the Paris Union of Yugoslav Clubs. This discriminatory practice culminated on Thursday in the information to the president of the Serbian community in France, Ivan Jankovic, of the Paris police decision to ban the latest demonstration in Paris, planned for March 6. The demonstration was to take the form of a march from the Place de la Republique to the Bastille, to end in a rally for an equitable peaceful settlement for war-shattered Bosnia-Herzegovina, the lifting of anti-Serb sanctions and the condemnation of the media demonisation of the Serbs. As the reason for the ban, French authorities again offered the well-worn cliche that a Serb rally would "jeopardise public law and order." In his protest against the decision, Serbian community President Jankovic dismissed the offered pretext as thin and groundless, and pointed out that Serb protests in France to date had never produced a single incident. Considering the fact that Moslems are allowed to organise militantly-intoned demonstrations in France in which they clamour for retaliation and military intervention against the Serbs, it is obvious that the explanation that a Serb protest would be "jeopardising public law and order" is nothing but an effort to prevent the Serbs from raising their voice against the West's shameful policy towards Serbia, of which Paris is a foremost champion. After being denied all access to the French media, which continue to foment hatred of Serbia and the Serbs, the Serbs in France are now being denied one of the basic democratic rights, viz. the right to public and peaceful demonstration. France, which takes every opportunity to boast of its being in the forefront of the struggle for human rights, is violating in the case of the Serbs some of the basic provisions of the human rights declaration, initiated in its soil. The question remains why French authorities have done nothing to prevent frequent attacks on Yugoslav diplomatic and other representations in France. Last month, the Yugoslav Embassy and cultural center in Paris were attacked in full view of an indifferent police. Shortly before, the Yugoslav consulate in Lyon was attacked. No blame has officially been apportioned for the assaults, although French authorities have made promises of quick and efficient investigation.
