A high-ranking Russian diplomat close to Kozyrev told INTERFAX that this was an extremely important aspect of Russian-American cooperation for the nonproliferation of missiles and other dangerous know-how. "Suffice it to recall the incident involving the export of Russian cryogenic boosters to India and the restrictive moves of the West in relation to Russia, to understand how important this question is. The American side has understood at last that the nonproliferation of dangerous know-how is our common concern and treats Russia with more trust now," he said. The fact that Russian experts will be involved in drafting the concept of a new COCOM from the very start is particularly important, he went on to say. They will not have to wait for what America will prepare for them, he added.
