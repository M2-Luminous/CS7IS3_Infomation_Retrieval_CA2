They said it was the third such swoop since Piat was murdered in a contract killing on February 25 that exposed links between political corruption and France's Mediterranean mafia out for kickbacks. Piat's two presumed killers, Epifanio Pericolo, 28, and Denis Labadie, 27, were arrested and charged two weeks ago, but police are trying to find out who ordered the murder. Several prominent local politicians have been questioned in connection of the slaying of Piat, a member of the center-right UDF-RPR [French Democratic Union-Rally for the Republic] parliamentary group, who was also campaigning against drug trafficking. In a posthumous letter, Piat, 44, denounced what she had called "collusion between elected officials and the local underworld" in a variety of financial deals. Piat's killing was the first of a French parliamentarian since December 1976 when Prince Jean de Broglie was murdered. That case remains unsolved.
