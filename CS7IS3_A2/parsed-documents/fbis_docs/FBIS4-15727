Grigoriy Karasin, the director of the Information and Press Department of the RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made this statement today at a briefing for Russian and foreign journalists. "We are opposed to the practice of Russia being consulted only in order to get an affirmative `yes' from us," the diplomat said. "We have naturally reached the appropriate conclusions from what occurred on 10th and 11th April in the region of Gorazde."
