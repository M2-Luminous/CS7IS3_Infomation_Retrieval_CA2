That is what the fourth plenum of the science workers union in the city of Havana did. The plenum was held recently at the Center for Medicines Research and Development [Centro de Investigaciones y Desarrollo de Medicamentos], or CIDEN [acronymn as heard]. The leaders of the science workers union in the capital agreed to focus their efforts on the union's integrating influence, on strengthening the base-level organizations, and, fundamentally, on political-ideological work. Their analysis concluded that the 146 assemblies of the Parliaments in the Workplace process held at scientific institutions, in which more than 28,400 workers participated, allow us to typify the political situation, the revolutionary atmosphere, economic management problems, and the monitoring of sector production and research. As a first conclusion, they found that the political-ideological work of the union could be its biggest contribution to solving problems, based on the workers' high and militant morale and support for the Revolution. Working from that premise, the science workers union in the capital laid out for itself a series of concrete tasks. The first opportunity will come at the Assemblies for Economic Efficiency, which are to begin in mid-May. During that process, each suggestion from the parliaments will be evaluated and the joint measures to be adopted by the various administrations, the Communist Party of Cuba, the union, and the UJC [Union of Young Communists] will start to become concrete reality. Among these measures are, for example, specific actions that will establish the obligation to bear in mind cost and efficiency indicators in connection with each and every task, decentralized down to the level of every individual researcher, technician, or support worker. Another intent is that of taking advantage of the potential of mechanisms already in force, such as evaluations, to guarantee the suitability of science workers, in response to a majority demand expressed during the parliaments. The union will take precise measures to restore labor discipline, as much to combat absenteeism as to get every worker to make the best possible use of the workday and to produce according to his position. Each center will go into greater depth regarding the concept and scope of self-financing, based on the premise that the nation needs for science to continue increasing its contribution to financing the nation's economy. Jorge Lezcano, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Havana City Province, expressed his satisfaction at these vital subjects as the focal point of the attention of the science workers union. For his part, Alfredo Morales, CTC [Cuban Workers Federation] secretary general in the capital, used the occasion to explain that the Assemblies for Economic Efficiency differ radically from the old Production and Services Assemblies. He said that it is now the workers -- jointly with the administration -- who are seeking solutions to difficulties, and that the discussion now centers not only on production, per se, but also on efficiency of production. It seems the young science workers union, and particularly its organizations in the capital, are setting standards for a union management that has moved away from mere useless formalities and has set its sights on the main objectives of contributing to saving our societal project and attaining development. The way the science workers union vanguards celebrate their successes constitutes proof of this. This past Sunday [24 April], they did voluntary work at the Augusto Cesar Sandino agricultural-livestock cooperative in San Antonio de los Banos. Meanwhile, the rest of the union members worked at cleaning up and beautifying their work centers.
