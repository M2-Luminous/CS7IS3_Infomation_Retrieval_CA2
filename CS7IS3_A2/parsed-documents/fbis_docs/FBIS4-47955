There is such a concentration "of men and equipment in the area that at any moment, anything could happen," he said in a statement published today by the pro-government daily CAMEROON TRIBUNE. As far as the minister is concerned, the reaction of the UN Security Council, before which Cameroon presented its border conflict, was favorable to Cameroon, and that in itself constitutes "a victory." "Furthermore," he added, "the fact that the Security Council endorsed the OAU statement of 4 April reiterating the principle of the inviolability of borders inherited from the colonial era, is satisfactory on at least two scores." "On all the maps drawn up to 1990 Bakassi is Cameroonian, only Nigerian maps drawn after this date try to show the contrary," the minister pointed out, adding that "when the OAU called for the withdrawal of troops from the area, it was a thinly veiled allusion to the occupation forces" of Nigeria, which has been "increasing its diversionary tactics." He expressed satisfaction at the Togolese mediation and indicated that Cameroon remained open to dialogue on one condition: that "the Nigerian troops withdraw from our national territory."
