The defense force said that a decision to deploy the SANDF outside South Africa was a political one, to be taken by the government of national unity. However, several practical implications would have to considered. These included the strain on manpower, logistics, and funds caused by the integration of about 30,000 people into the force. Moreover, the legal aspects would have to be resolved before there could be any involvement in a major role beyond the borders. The SANDF was reacting to speculation about the possible role of the force in operations outside South Africa.
