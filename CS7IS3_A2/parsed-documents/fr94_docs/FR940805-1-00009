FR940805-1-00009 FR940805-1-00001 §1710.112 Loan feasibility. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (10) The borrower's projected capitalization, measured by its equity as a percentage of total assets, is adequate to enable the borrower to meet its financial needs and to provide service consistent with the RE Act. Among the factors to be considered in reviewing the borrower's projected capitalization are the economic strength of the borrower's service territory, the inherent cost of providing service to the territory, the disparity in rates between the borrower and neighboring utilities, the intensity of competition faced by the borrower from neighboring utilities and other power sources, and the relative amount of new capital investment required to serve existing or new loads. 6. Section 1710.115 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: §1710.115 Final maturity. * * * * * (b) Loans made or guaranteed by REA for facilities owned by the borrower generally must be repaid with interest within a period, up to 35 years, that approximates the expected useful life of the facilities financed. The expected useful life shall be based on the weighted average of the useful lives that the borrower proposes for the facilities financed by the loan, provided that the proposed useful lives are deemed appropriate by REA. The proposed useful lives proposed by the borrower for the facilities financed must be consistent with the borrower's proposed depreciation rates for these facilities. In states where the borrower must obtain state regulatory authority approval of depreciation rates for rate making purposes, the depreciation rates used for the purposes of this paragraph shall be the rates currently approved by the state authority or rates for which the borrower plans to seek state authority approval, provided that these rates are deemed appropriate by REA. In other states, if the rates proposed by the borrower are not deemed appropriate by REA, REA will base expected useful life on the depreciation rates listed in Bulletin 183&hyph;1, or its successor, revising such rates as necessary to reflect current industry practice. Final maturities for loans for the implementation of programs for demand side management and energy resource conservation and on and off grid renewable energy sources not owned by the borrower will be determined by REA. * * * * * §1710.116 [Removed and Reserved] 7. Section 1710.116 is removed and reserved. 8. Section 1710.251 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: §1710.251 Construction work plans_distribution borrowers. * * * * * (b) A distribution borrower's CWP shall cover a construction period of between 2 and 4 years, and include all facilities to be constructed which are eligible for REA financing, whether or not REA financial assistance will be sought or be available for certain facilities. Any REA financing provided for the facilities will be limited to a 4-year loan period. The construction period covered by a CWP in support of a loan application shall not be shorter than the loan period requested for financing of the facilities. * * * * * 9. Section 1710.252 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: §1710.252 Construction work plans_power supply borrowers. * * * * * (b) Normally a power supply borrower's CWP shall cover a period of 3 to 4 years. While comprehensive CWP's are desired, if there are extenuating circumstances REA may accept a single-purpose transmission or generation CWP in support of a loan application or budget reclassification. The construction period covered by a CWP in support of a loan application shall not be shorter than the loan period requested for financing of the facilities.
