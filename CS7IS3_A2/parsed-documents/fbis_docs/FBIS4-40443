Zaytseva, Crimean finance minister: "On Currency Regulation in Crimea"] [Text] The Crimean president's edict, "On Currency Regulation and Currency Control," which actually does contradict Ukrainian legislation in terms of a number of positions, evoked an ambiguous reaction from official Kiev. In this connection many of our readers are interested in why the Crimean president was forced almost to enter into a certain confrontation with the leadership of Ukraine over this issue. The factors that brought about the appearance of this presidential edict are explained by Crimean Finance Minister L.M. Zaytseva. The fact is, says Lyudmila Mikhaylovna, that as a result of the establishment by the Ukrainian Government of a fixed rate for the karbovanets many enterprises of Crimea that have foreign partners, including Russians, were placed on the brink of financial disaster. For example, a critical situation developed with airline tickets in the Simferopol airport, where mostly Russian air carriers are based. They were prohibited from selling airline tickets for Russian rubles and the sales were transacted for karbovantsy at the reduced exchange rate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Security. At the same time it was impossible to buy rubles at the low exchange rate and return them to their legitimate owners. But the aircraft still continued to fly, taking a loss. Even though in December the Crimean Council of Ministers adopted a resolution concerning the sale of airline tickets for Russian rubles, the situation has not improved, because Russian rubles were still subject to mandatory sale at the same reduced exchange rate. In general, the exchange rate fixed below market turned out to be an extremely favorable environment for destroying domestic producers who were still capable of competing on the world market. At the dawn of Ukrainian independence there was not a single politician who did not emphasize that Ukrainian industry exports products to more than 100 countries of the world; now, to be sure, they try not to recall the times of the past Union, when this really was the case. Exports from Russian industry have fallen severalfold as well. Crimea has ended up in an especially difficult situation. As a result of certain events it has lost the Russian market and has gained nothing except the karbovanets. In Ukraine only a small part of the commodity output finds its way to the world market, and the exchange rate of the karbovanets has been scandalously reduced. In addition to all that, they immediately permitted foreign economic activity without creating favorable conditions on the world market through intergovernmental agreements. And when domestic money began to rapidly lose its value, there appeared the idea of introducing a compulsory exchange rate below market for the dollar, but this was a struggle with an effect rather than a cause. As a result the enterprises, in order not to be ruined, were forced to conceal foreign currency, and the already poor budget became even slimmer. Yet the exchange rates of the world currencies are changing every day. This means that our economy is being artificially slowed down, while on the market it is necessary to seize the moment. But any currency is a commodity, and it is necessary to handle the commodity in one's own way and carefully, and the edict of the president of Crimea lays the foundation for this civilized attitude toward the Republic's main commodity. In the first place, currency revenues should be transferred to one's own republic and not left in foreign banks where they will circulate in the interests of anybody except Crimea and, in the second place, the earnings will be sold not at a fixed rate, but on the interbank currency exchange formed by the government. Even now there are branches of 85 Ukrainian banks operating in Ukraine and there can be no doubt that at the first signs of political stabilization and the formation of a civilized currency system dozens of Russian and non-Russian banks will come here. Bankers are well-to-do people and they can afford a good climate and peace. In any case, hope is inspired by the fact that Ukraine itself (which previously declared that Crimea's currency innovations were unacceptable) is following the Crimean path and preparing a package of documents providing for normal currency regulation. Naturally, the creation of a foreign currency system worthy of Crimea is not a simple matter and we must not limit ourselves to the presidential decree alone. From the enterprises we are already receiving more letters with proposals to simplify the currency regulation system. On the other hand, certain Crimean companies will have to seriously revise their foreign economic activity and reorient it in the interests of Crimea. There is no other way.
