A nation with 1.1 billion people is also enjoying political stability, national unity, and social progress. The Chinese Government has demonstrated maturity and greater insight during the past year by resorting to economic means, instead of mere administrative decrees, to regulate the once overheated economy; it is fostering the rule of law and introducing a civil service system to improve efficiency; and it has waged a timely campaign against corruption to keep the administration clean and honest. The decision endorsed by the Party's Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee last November blueprinted the framework for the socialist market economy and spelled out the immediate tasks and goals for the country's reform and opening up during the 1990's. In fact, China has steadfastly embarked on a road that starts from a centralized planned economy and leads to a socialist market system throughout the last 15 years of reforms. The decision further provides principled guidance for the most crucial stage of such a transition. The nation has a reason to be proud of its achievements last year: Its gross domestic product rose a hefty 13 percent over the previous year. The output of cereals, edible oil, and meat all surpassed records. The income of urban dwellers, accounting for the double-digit inflation, was 10 percent higher than the previous year, while the living standards of the rural population continued to improve. Internationally, China's prestige rose remarkably thanks to its firm adherence to an independent foreign policy that emphasizes world peace and progress and, in particular, to President Jiang Zemin's successful overseas tour. This in turn, has contributed to building up a favourable international environment for China's domestic development. The year 1994 will be crucial for the country's development of a market economy because the heaviest reform package is to be put forward, including a substantial restructuring of the banking, financial, taxation, and state industrial sectors. They are indispensable in the framework of a market economy. The task is challenging indeed because the deepening reform will readjust the functions and interests of different departments and the national and local governments. This requires, on the one hand, the various sectors and localities to place the interests of the whole nation above departmental and regional gains while, on the other hand, the policy-makers to be extremely considerate of the demands of ordinary people. Macrocontrol It is essential for the central government to continue and improve its macroeconomic regulation. This is a delicate job because an overdose will suffocate the economy while a looser package will fuel inflation. Agriculture deserves special support because it remains the basis for China's economic development and because income of the 800 million people in the countryside has yet to catch up with that of the nation as a whole. The State-owned industries need to undergo thorough restructuring to adopt modern enterprise mechanisms and to maintain their leading role in the economy. It is only natural that various problems may crop up during the reform process, considering the scope of the change and the size of the country. Yet it has become the nation's consensus that only further reforms can lead the country forward. It is hoped the new year will see more extensive development of the socialist market economy, social stability, democracy, and cultural life. After all, China's progress and prosperity will mean greater contributions to world peace and development, and to the whole civilization of the human race.
