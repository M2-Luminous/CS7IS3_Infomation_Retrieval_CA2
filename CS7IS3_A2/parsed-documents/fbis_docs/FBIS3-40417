One of the four chapters of the document is dedicated to the environment (the other three deal with new technologies, Italian participation in the European fusion program, and the development of the technical-scientific support services at the ministry). According to the signatories to the agreement, it will constitute a fundamental instrument for the reinforcement of collaboration between the two bodies, directing resources to the realization of projects with precise goals. For the three years 1992/1995 the total resources amount to 400 billion lire. There are plans for the diffusion of advanced technologies relating to the environment and for participation in wide-ranging initiatives that already are in existence, such as the national plan for environmental research and the Community's EUREKA [European Research Coordination Agency] program. Some sectors of intervention have however already been singled out. In fact models showing climatic changes will be prepared. This is a subject in which Italy is historically behind, and technologies will be developed to reduce impacts on the environment and manage the various types of monitoring. The research will mainly concern the Mediterranean Sea, natural risks to the environment (earthquakes, soil erosion), water resources and radioprotection.
