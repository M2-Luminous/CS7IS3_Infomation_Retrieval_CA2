The President Is Tired of Being a President"] [Excerpts] Kalmykia President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who has repeatedly scandalized the Russian public with his unconventional steps, has once again come to the attention of politicians and the press. Addressing Kalmykian parliamentarians, he proposed that they abrogate the republican constitution and lower Kalmykia's status to that of a kray or an oblast. Against the backdrop of habitual demands by Federation components about greater autonomy, the Kalmykian president's proposal for the voluntary return "under Moscow's heel" sounds sensational. If it is adopted by the deputies, the Great Steppe Code, the draft of which the president submitted yesterday to the parliament for consideration, may become Kalmykia's fundamental law. [passage omitted] The Kalmykian president's new political move is apparently the strongest one in his entire political career -- both according to the effect it produced and its possible consequences. At a time when Chechnya is stubbornly chanting independence mantras, Tatarstan is relishing its special status, and a number of other Federation components are dreaming of repeating Kazan's success, many advocates of a "soft" federation appear to see Ilyumzhinov's initiative as a subversive action by "Moscow agents." This is how it seems to have been received by the Federation Council; Mr. Ilyumzhinov says that he has already had telephone calls from the Council wondering if this step had been agreed on with Yeltsin. Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, however, in a conversation with your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent flatly denied the suggestion about the alleged preliminary agreement with the federal authorities. In his view, the republican status impedes, not facilitates, close cooperation with the center. Federal ministries are reluctant to embark on joint projects with republics for fear of unpredictable steps, "even a cessation." Observers do not doubt that the parliament will approve the president's proposal. In this event, the future of Kirsan Ilyumzhinov himself so far remains uncertain, but it is evident that upon losing the status of president he may acquire something more valuable: the laurels of a pioneer paving the way for Russia's return to a guberniya-based structure, something for which certain politicians in Moscow have been calling for a long time.
