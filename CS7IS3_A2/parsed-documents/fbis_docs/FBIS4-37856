The sources said that Abu-Mahir, head of the Mobilization and Organization Department [MOD] and member of the Central Committee, has decided to quit political action and that he intends to reside in Amman or Damascus or remain in Tunis. According to the sources, the Palestinian president, who has close social links with Abu-Mahir, tried early in the week to persuade him not to resign, but his attempts failed, although 'Arafat personally visited the MOD head's office last Sunday and had lunch with Abu-Mahir the day before yesterday. Other information indicates that Abu-Mazin too has expressed to the Palestinian president his wish to quit organizational and political action -- which some people have interpreted as resignation from Fatah. Meanwhile the new appointments made by 'Arafat have provoked angry reactions among numerous Palestinian leaders, especially Abu-Mahir, Abu-Mazin, and Abu-al-Lutf. Some circles say that they now regard themselves as merely formal leaders in the movement and that the ship's helm is now steered by hidden hands.
