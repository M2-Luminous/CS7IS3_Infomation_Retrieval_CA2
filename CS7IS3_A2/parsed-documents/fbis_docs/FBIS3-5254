Speaking to reporters after holding talks with Foreign Minister Ali Alatas in Jakarta this afternoon, Haris Silajdzic said he deeply appreciated the spirit of the volunteers. According to Silajdzic, the spirit of the volunteers is important because it reminds the Bosnians that they are not fighting alone. Bosnia, however, more urgently needs the diplomatic and political support of Indonesia as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement. According to the prime minister, the Indonesian volunteers will find it difficult to enter Bosnia because the country is in a critical condition.
