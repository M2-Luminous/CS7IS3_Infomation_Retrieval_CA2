Dissemination and Utilization The purposes and expectations associated with Title IV discretionary projects extend well beyond the immediate confines of a particular project's local impact. Projects should have a ripple effect in the field of aging in terms of replicating their design, utilizing their results, and applying their benefits to a widening circle of older persons. This section suggests certain principles of dissemination to be considered in developing your application: •the most useful projects make dissemination and utilization a central, not peripheral, component of the project; •dissemination starts at the beginning of a project not when it is completed; •potential users should be involved in planning the project, if possible, and products developed with the needs of potential users in mind; •dissemination is a networking process; •at a minimum, dissemination includes getting your final products into the hands of appropriate users and making presentations at conferences; and •coordination with other related projects may increase the chances of your products being used.
