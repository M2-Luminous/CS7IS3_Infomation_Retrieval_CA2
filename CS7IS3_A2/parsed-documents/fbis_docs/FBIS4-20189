The public is expecting a reshuffle and a restructuring within the cabinet. While the public expects a reshuffle the leaders of the coalition partners have other problems to tackle.... Let us begin with Ciller. Ciller is struggling against a secret "Demirel opposition" within the TPP [True Path Party]. This opposition, which was working against the TPP during the local election campaign, supported the ANAP [Motherland Party] candidates in important centers such as Istanbul and Bursa. The aim was to prepare a great election defeat for Ciller thus ousting her from the party. The election results, however, did not please the opposition. This opposition, which retreated a bit given the election results, has bounced back since then.... There has been no change in either goal or calculation. There has only been a slight delay and postponement. That is all.... Ciller does not have many trump cards against the opposition because the TPP has a weak majority in the Assembly anyway. As for the TPP electorate, it is not ready for such a struggle.... Furthermore, the opposition is led by the president (in other words Demirel).... Therefore, Ciller, whether she wants it or not, has to maintain harmonious relations with Demirel.... The main characteristics of this opposition are the following; The first is staffing... They want the best state cadres to be at their disposal. Their complaints to the president are based on the principle that "she is isolating and antagonizing our senior colleagues"... Whatever the conditions, they want the state to increase employment and they want to be in charge of appointing personnel to the newly created cadres. Secondly, this opposition is against the economic stability measures. Many among them believe that the Ozal Model is responsible for the current crisis and that, therefore, if this model is abandoned the economy will automatically heal itself.... Almost all within this opposition, and especially [Assembly Speaker] Cindoruk, are against the closing down or liquidation of the State Economic Enterprises that are in the red. One will recall that in the past Demirel has also said that the duty of the state was not to close down these enterprises and lay off workers but to find a solution, though he did not specify what this solution should be. These conditions are, in a way, putting Ciller in a difficult position. The prime minister has, thus far, not been able to form a good team around herself. People like Esat Kiratlioglu and Necmettin Cevheri, though they are very valuable on an individual basis, cannot contribute much to the masses. If one removes Yildirim Aktuna from the picture, there will be no one else left.... Ciller should speedily surround herself with charismatic cadres like Aktuna but who are also experienced and youthful.... [passage omitted]
