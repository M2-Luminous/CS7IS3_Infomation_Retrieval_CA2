Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 914.10, 914.15, and 914.16. II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment By letter dated October 1, 1993, (Administrative Record No. IND&hyph;1325) Indiana submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. The amendment consists of statute changes made by the Indiana General Assembly and contained in the 1993 SEA 179. SEA 179 contains numerous amendments to Indiana statutes, but only those which pertain to the Indiana program are discussed below. IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;4‚ê£Permit Approval or Denial Indiana has amended subsection IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;4&hyph;3(a) concerning the findings required to be made by the director of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) prior to issuing a permit. New subdivision 3(a)(10) is added to provide as follows: (10) if any part of the operation would take place in a floodway (as defined in IC 13&hyph;2&hyph;22&hyph;3), the operation will not: (A) result in unreasonably detrimental effects upon the fish, wildlife, or botanical resources; (B) adversely affect the efficiency; or (C) unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. In its submittal of this amendment, Indiana explained that the proposed language quoted above is being added to the Indiana program as a consequence of an amendment to IC 13&hyph;2&hyph;22&hyph;13. New subdivision 13(c)(3) is added to IC 13&hyph;2&hyph;22&hyph;13 to provide that operations conducted under IC 13&hyph;4.1 (Indiana SMCRA) are exempted from the need for a ``construction in a floodway'' permit issued by the IDNR, Division of Water. Instead, any activity in a floodway which is to be conducted as part of an operation regulated under IC 13&hyph;4.1 must be identified in the permit application to the Division of Reclamation. A determination must then be made by the Division of Reclamation that the environmental standards identified in the proposed language are met. This determination will then become part of the ``Findings Document'' which accompanies each of the Division's final permit recommendation.
