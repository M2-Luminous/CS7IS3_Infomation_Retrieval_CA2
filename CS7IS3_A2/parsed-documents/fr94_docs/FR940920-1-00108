FR940920-1-00108 FR940920-1-00008 E. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) requires Federal agencies to give special consideration to the impacts of regulations on small entities, which are small businesses, small organizations, and small governments. The major purpose of the RFA is to keep paperwork and regulatory requirements from getting out of proportion to the scale of the entities being regulated, without compromising the objectives of, in this case, the Act. If a regulation is likely to have significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small entities, the EPA may give special consideration to those small entities when analyzing regulatory alternatives and drafting the regulation. In the case at hand, the EPA considers that a regulation that is likely to affect 20 percent or more of small entities with MWC's is a regulation that will affect a substantial number of small entities. Definitions of small entities are flexible. For analysis of the guidelines being proposed today, the EPA considers a small business in this industry to be one with gross annual revenue less than $6 million, and a small government to be one that serves a population of less than 50,000. (A typical city of 50,000 generates about 90 Mg/day of MSW.) Most small governments dispose of their MSW by landfilling and, therefore, will not be affected by regulation of MWC emissions. In regard to small organizations such as independent not-for-profit enterprises, the EPA finds that they have no more than a very minor involvement with MWC's, and for that reason the EPA has not found it necessary to study potential direct impacts on small organizations. A limited number of MWC units exist that range in size upward from a capacity to combust less than 1 Mg/day of MSW to those capable of combusting 35 Mg/day. The EPA estimates that MWC's under 35 Mg/day in capacity except for MWI's, which will be regulated under a separate action, contribute a negligible fraction of total MWC emissions. Many MWC's under 35 Mg/day in capacity, and a few larger ones, are owned or operated by small entities. The EPA estimates that considerably fewer than 20 percent of small-entity MWC's will be affected by the emission guidelines being proposed today. Thus, the number of affected small entities is not expected to be substantial, and a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. Nevertheless, the EPA has conducted an extensive analysis of potential regulatory impacts on households, small governments, and small businesses. The full analysis is included in the economic impact assessment in the docket and listed at the beginning of today's notice under SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed standards and emission guidelines that applied to all sizes of MWC's. The proposal had no lower size cutoff. Small businesses, small governments, and groups representing small-entity interests commented extensively on the need to lighten the potential regulatory burden on small entities. Most commenters suggested a small size cutoff considerably smaller than the one now being proposed. The most frequently suggested levels were 5 to 11 Mg/day, 18 Mg/day, 23 Mg/day, and 45 Mg/day. The EPA has used these suggestions and the information submitted by these commenters, as well as information from other sources, to fulfill the intent of the RFA. The EPA has incorporated into the guidelines being proposed today several features that will mitigate, and in most cases eliminate, any potentially adverse economic impacts on small entities. These features are as follows: (1) The emission guidelines will apply only to MWC's with a plant capacity of greater than 35 Mg/day. This cutoff eliminates from the purview of the guidelines the overwhelming majority of existing very small MWC's (There will be a one-time requirement for MWC plants in the 25 to 35 Mg/day range to report for verification the capacities and locations of the plants, but this paperwork will impose a very minor economic burden.); (2) The guidelines are ``tiered'' so that the stringency (and therefore potential economic burden) of the emission guidelines increases as the size of the MWC plant increases. Plants with capacities of 25 to 35 Mg/day would have only the one-time reporting of capacity and location. Plants with capacities of 35 to 225 Mg/day would have guidelines for PM, opacity, dioxins/furans, SO 2 , HCl, Cd, Pb, Hg, operating practices, and operator training and certification. Additionally, small MWC plants would be required to perform compliance testing, but the guidelines and compliance testing requirements would not be as stringent as those for plants larger than 225 Mg/day. Furthermore, the plants would not be required to control NO X . Plants with capacities above 225 Mg/day would be subject to guidelines for NO X in addition to all other pollutants, and compliance testing would be required more frequently; (3) The emission guidelines consist of emission limits, as opposed to design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards. Emission limits give MWC owners and operators the freedom to select the most economical means of reducing emissions; and (4) The emission guidelines are not the usual type of regulation governed by the RFA. The guidelines will not apply directly to any MWC's, but will be used as a guide by individual State air pollution control agencies in developing site-specific regulations for MWC's. States are allowed some flexibility in implementing the guidelines. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the EPA certifies that these proposed emission guidelines, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because the number of small entities affected is not substantial.
