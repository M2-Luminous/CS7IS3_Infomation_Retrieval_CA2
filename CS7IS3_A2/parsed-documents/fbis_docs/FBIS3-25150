At a leaders' summit that ended in Pretoria a short while ago, the alliance said any further initiative to break the deadlock in negotiations would have to come from the ANC. [passage omitted] We have a report from Gary Alfonso in Pretoria: Freedom Alliance negotiators arrived for the summit to report back to their leaders about last night's deadlock. After a two-hour meeting, the writing was on the wall. Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje said that their group could not and would not make any more concessions. IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said his party would not feel threatened by the looming deadline for parties to register for the election. That means if no compromise is reached on the issue of entrenching powers for regions in the constitution, the Alliance parties will not register, and that means that they will not take part in the election. The Alliance members say the ball, and their continued participation, is now in the hands of the ANC and the government.
