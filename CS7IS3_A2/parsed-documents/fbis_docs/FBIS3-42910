Both the recent Russian elections and the referendum conducted on 12 December throughout the Russian Federation, with the exception of these two republics, once again clearly demonstrated the reality of this generalization. But a different, no less "sweetheart couple" has emerged in Tatarstan itself--a firm bloc of the ruling nomenklatura and "opposition" nationalists has arisen. The former oblast party committee apparatchiks have found for themselves in the national radicals new and, as it seems to them, firm social support. And the nationals are making adroit use of the forces and connections of the nomenklatura and the Communist Party of Tatarstan, hoping subsequently "to strangle them in their embrace" or to paint their red foundation green--the color of Islam--and the colors of Tatar nationalism. This "red-green" national-nomenklatura bloc took shape at the time of the discussion and adoption of the separatist constitution and the discriminatory Language Act. On 12 December this alliance strengthened even more and became an "indestructible bloc of party and nonparty people." Despite the fact that less than 24 percent of the electorate voted at the elections in the republic, certain conclusions may be drawn from their results. Official, but unlawful, calls for a boycott of the Russian ballot, the corresponding "set of instructions" to bureaucrats on the part of the authorities, the daily campaign in the Tatarstan newspapers and on radio and television, the refusal to send out notices and an explanation of the procedure of the ballot--this is a far from full list of its particular features. I would add here the silent transfer of the locations of many polling stations, at not one of which were there even Russian flags, moreover, and the unchecked tallying of the results by working groups. They were formed for some reason or other under the auspices of the administration heads for the collection of information from the stations and their presentation to the district election commissions. The threats of extremists and their blockade of a number of stations in Menzelinsk, Bugulm, and Kazan went unpunished. All this reduced the percentage turnout, but, what is most important, did not strengthen but, however paradoxical it may seem, weakened the sovereignty of the republic. After all, the fervent supporters of Zhirinovskiy voted for him, all the same. And hundreds of thousands of his opponents did not go to the polls. So those who are expatiating only on the fault of the democrats for the success of the latter are greatly deluded. Having stymied the elections, the ruling circles of Tatarstan may with every right consider themselves the cofounders of the LDPR parliamentary faction. They contributed to the revival of the extreme polarization of Russia, from which the components of the Federation gain nothing. The inhabitants of the Kazan Kremlin are once again hoping, possibly, to make capital out of the showdowns between the authorities in Moscow, as they did in 1990-1991 and in 1992-1993. But this is short-sighted: Zhirinovskiy has a more radical program, and under pressure thereof Yeltsin would be forced to adopt decisive measures to restore the single legal space of the Federation. As can be seen from poll results, it was this for which, in fact, many Russians, Russian-speaking Tatars, and Jews were hoping in voting for the LDPR. One further outcome of the elections was the clear defeat for the "Tatarstan Party," the people of this republic, and its leaders. After all, all seven seats for Tatarstan in the Federal Assembly remain vacant, and there will be no one to pursue and defend the interests of its population in the Russian Parliament. This is obvious. In the last three years the ruling elite has thwarted practically all Russian elections and referenda. But you cannot step on one and the same anti-Russian rake ad infinitum. On this occasion its error is of an unforgivable nature, the leaders of the local Equality and Legality bloc believe. Everyone knows that it is Russian money that is used to pay the pensions, grants, and allowances, and also wages and credit in the military-industrial complex and subsidies. Less obvious is the new fissure in interethnic relations that has formed since the elections. However much the power-invested persons assert that the 12 December elections showed the people's political wisdom and their maturity, term "civicism" the action of many Russians, Tatars, Chuvash, and Ukrainians who did not discharge their civic duty, and give assurances concerning a "strengthening of interethnic unity," in practice everything is just the opposite. The true act of civic courage was performed by those who went to the polls in defiance of the plain instructions of the administration heads. The same applies to the "strengthening" of national unity. The proposition concerning the "strengthening of interethnic unity" also may be evaluated with the same reverse precision. Let us take the ballot data for the mixed 24th Moskovskiy District. It has urban and rural, Russian and Tatar rayons. In a group of four small rural Tatar rayons, only 0.6 percent of the electorate voted, while 8.2 percent of inhabitants went to the polls in the four large multinational rayons. At the same time, on the other hand, 27.3 percent of the electorate took part in the elections in the predominantly Russian areas of the northwest of the republic, in the city of Zelenodolsk and Vekhneuslonskiy Rayon particularly, which was more even than in polyethnic Kazan. What conclusion follows from this? We are talking about a manifest delineation with an ethnic basis. And this came as no surprise to the analysts. A highly transparent conclusion, although "blurred" by the republic's ruling elite: Any attempt to fence off the republic from the Federation will signify a division of society in Tatarstan itself. A division with, we repeat, an ethnic basis. This playing with the patriotic feelings of the citizens of the Russian Federation who live in the republic is very dangerous. It is "preparation" for all interethnic conflicts. And the conditions for this are being created by the "boycottists" of the elections to, as they believe, a "foreign" parliament themselves. And, the final point: As the analysts foresaw, what we see is the success of the bloc of all federalist forces opposed to the disintegration of Russia such as Equality and Legality (RiZ) and its constituent Concord pacifist multinational movement of Tatarstan. It was their candidates who won a relative victory at the elections: The leader of the RiZ bloc, Ivan Grachev, former deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan, was elected to the Duma on the slate of the Yavlinskiy Bloc. Although not elected in his 27th Privolzhskiy District ("only" a 25.3 percent turnout), Valentin Mikhaylov, a RiZ activist, who was also formerly a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan, amassed over 40 percent of the vote--almost three times as much as his closest rival. Over 47 percent of the votes cast were for Vladimir Belyayev, leader of Concord--almost twice the number of those cast for Yuriy Voronin, his most serious rival. It is obvious that while the showdowns of the supporters of "radical" reforms and reforms "in the interests of the people" continue in Moscow, Kazan is setting a convincing example of the benefit of the unity of all reform forces--both centrists and radicals. And any incitement of national egotism in the interests of sovereignty is having a directly opposite effect.
