The article says: The Angolan Government set forth the principle of settling the present political crisis through dialogue and negotiation in the spirit of national reconciliation and has made consistent efforts to carry it into practice. The government made arrangements for peace talks with UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola], took an initiative step for ceasefire and has striven to end the domestic revolt, cooperating with the international community. The government side is striving for national reconciliation, territorial integrity and unity, showing a top patience and generosity at the talks. The good faith and generosity of the government side in transferring many seats of the regional government over to the UNITA, returning UNITA parliamentarians to the People's Assembly, and other matters show part of the honest efforts of the government to put an early end to the internal troubles lasting nearly 20 years at any cost. The Korean people express solidarity with the Angolan people in their just struggle. The master of Angola is the Angolan people themselves. If the sides at the talks, deeply conscious of this, make efforts for national interests and peace, the internal troubles would be ended and a bright vista be opened ahead of the Angolan people.
