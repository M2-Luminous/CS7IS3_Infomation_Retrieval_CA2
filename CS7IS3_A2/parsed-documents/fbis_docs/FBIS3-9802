Here is Sokol Balla: [Balla] Both the Albanian and Bulgarian foreign ministers held a joint news conference today in a hall in the Palace of Congresses in Tirana. Albanian Minister Serreqi first spoke about the main questions that were the focus of bilateral talks, such as the crisis in former Yugoslavia, the situation in the region, the reciprocal information of both governments on reform, the process of European integration of both post-communist states, etc. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov stressed that we have once again rebuilt our present vision of relations and how to expand them by first defining their juridical basis so as to open the way to further economic cooperation. At this conference they stressed that there are presently no outstanding problems between the two countries. Nevertheless, more frequent political contact is expected. Daskalov said that wonderful prospects lie ahead of us. Asked about whether or not the Balkan countries will intervene in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia if it spreads to the south of the peninsula, the Bulgarian foreign minister gave a negative response; this, according to him and the position maintained by the Bulgarian Government, would complicate the situation. He also answered a question on the presence of Turkish or Greek soldiers in the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [not further specified] Albanian Foreign Minister Serreqi answered the same question by stressing that we should overcome several prejudices related to the presence of Turkish or Russian [as heard] soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serreqi said that what is left is the hope that Blue Helmets of every nationality will play a peacekeeping role, always within the UN framework and under its flag. Asked about the international peacekeeping presence in Kosova, the Bulgarian foreign minister answered that Bulgaria supports all peacekeeping initiatives that attempt to prevent the spread of the conflict to the south. However, Daskalov declared that, as far as an international presence in Kosova is concerned, we should first ask the Serbian party. The Bulgarian foreign minister did not pronounce himself on the problem of Albanians in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] because, as he presented the argument, this is an internal affair of the Macedonian state. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Daskalov left our country today.
