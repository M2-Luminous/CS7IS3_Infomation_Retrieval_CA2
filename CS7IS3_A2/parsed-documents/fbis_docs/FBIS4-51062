The real significance in setting out this issue today lies in the fact that our cause of reform is developing in depth. The reform measures presented this year are particularly important, because they will affect the underlying structure of the interests of various social areas in a relatively broad scope, and will sooner or later affect the regions, units, and individuals to various degrees. Just as we have seen, our social life is full of vitality and is extraordinarily active; however, the other side of the coin is the complex situation created by the entanglement, collision, and friction among various kinds of contradictions. True, those contradictions take place under the prerequisite of the identification of the people's basic interests, but, if they are not handled properly, negative consequences will surface and will give rise to problems which will be serious enough to affect the overall situation. This precisely requires our leading organs and leading cadres to be aware of the times and size up the situation, to be sober and good at properly handling the relations between reform, development and stability, to firmly take the initiative in their own hands in work, to convert negative to positive factors, and to give play to mass enthusiasm for reform and construction initiatives. I. Today we can see a great difference in the expressive forms and characteristics of the contradictions among the people. It is very necessary for us to have a clear picture of the background to today's situation and the historical conditions that have given rise to those contradictions in order to adopt the correct policies and strategies to appropriately arrange work. This can be generalized in the following aspects. First, the various reform measures we are presenting today are primarily based on the goal of reform, which is to build the socialist market economic structure while continuously readjusting the interest pattern and relations in various areas, thus meeting the requirements for the development of the productive forces. When the old balance is tipped, it will inevitably result in a series of contradictions. For example, the interest relations between the central government and localities, between the local government and enterprises, between the enterprise and its workers and staffers will all undergo new changes. Generally, these changes will make the interest relations in all aspects tend to be more rational; however, every aspect has its own specific interests and hopes that it will gain benefits but not suffer losses in the readjustment of the interest pattern. That being the case, various contradictions at every tier will markedly increase. At the same time, there is the contradiction between nurturing a socialist unified market and the separatism of departments and localities, the contradiction between legitimate and illegitimate operations, and the contradiction between proper and improper competition. Under the highly centralized planned economic structure of the past, such conditions were not so obvious, but they have become increasingly conspicuous with every passing day in the course of converting to the market economy. Second, we have been pushing forward economic restructuring amid the high-speed operation of the national economy and have been maintaining rapid economic growth in the course of accelerating structural conversion. This being the case, the entire economic environment has been relatively tense. There are several contradictions in this area: between accelerating the growth rate and improving both the economic structure and economic returns; the imbalance between the eastern coastal areas and the middle and western areas in regional economic development; between the people's expectations in their longing to improve their living standards as quickly as possible and the limited material and financial strength; and the expansion in the scale of production and increased consumer spending, which will again result in a shortage of capital and skyrocketing prices. In addition, the differences in distribution and income between different regions and between employers of different economic forms, the imbalance between those having a relatively easy time and those taking up arduous tasks in their work, and the widening gap between prosperity and impoverishment have all surfaced. And, Third, China has also gone through profound changes in its superstructure and ideology as the country opens up wider to the outside world with every passing day. During the transitional period when the old structure is being converted to the new, both practical work and ideology have taken on extraordinary complexity and activity. For example, we will find contradictions between the issue of how to guide the market mechanism into distribution and distribution according to work as well as common prosperity, the contradiction between the issue of how to handle the price system and existing wage and consumption policies, and the contradiction between money-worship and egoism and collectivism and between hedonism and corruption and the tradition of struggling hard amid difficulties. A solution to all these contradictions cannot be found overnight; consequently, some knotty problems and mistakes in work will often appear. Many units and departments are facing these kinds of problems, which will eventually be reflected in every individual's personal interest; this being the case, it is liable to result in fluctuations and a loss of balance to some extent in the people's thinking, psychology, and emotions. There is no need to be evasive about the fact that a huge amount of various contradictions exist among the people today. Each pair of contradictions, however, contain the restriction of various complicated factors, which affect one another as they interact. The state's reform policy, the masses' practical interests, the people's thinking and concepts, and the effects of the social environment are more often than not interwoven. This being the case, there is a certain degree of difficulty in their solution. Our attitude is as follows: First, we must recognize that this is an inevitable phenomena in the course of social progress and development; some are old problems, but there are new contradictions as well. Our reform serves precisely to gradually resolve or ease these contradictions and iron out these kinds of problems in relations. Second, we must, at the same time, be brave in facing the difficulty and complexity of the cause of reform, adopt the correct policies and strategies to appropriately handle all kinds of contradictions and maintain the vitality of reform, while taking the opportunity to guide reform in depth. II. To seize the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and maintain stability is the overall direction for the work of the whole party and the whole country this year. In handling the contradictions among the people in the new situation, it is necessary to proceed from, be subject to, and serve this overall direction. Based on this understanding, in handling the contradictions among the people in the new situation, we should do a good job of grasping the following points: First, our starting point is to resolve contradictions, iron out differences, promote understanding, and give play to positive factors. Most of the various kinds of contradictions among the people which exist today fall into the category of interest relations or issues of ideological understanding and concepts; generally, they do not have a confrontational quality. Our principle is to do more work in reconciliation, coordination, and mediation. When faced with contradictions and disputes, the leading organs and leading cadres should be good at eliminating misunderstandings, removing hurdles to find channels for solutions, building bridges for mutual communication, and balancing the interest relations between all parties involved. Practice has pointed to the fact that understanding and communication are very important and represent an effective way to resolve contradictions. If all sides involved are able to seek common ground while reserving differences and understand and make concessions to each other -- all the while taking the overall situation into account -- many contradictions, including some very knotty ones, can find relatively appropriate solutions peacefully. The key lies in showing sincerity, adopting a constructive attitude, and taking practical measures. Second, our basic train of thought is that those problems that surface in the course of reform should be resolved by deepening reform and those problems that surface in the course of development should be resolved in the same manner. Take, for example, the issue of employment -- it is by no means a simple issue of making arrangements. If we fail to open up more channels for employment, do not adopt various forms of employment, and continue to rely on the government to take care of everything, a solution will be very difficult to find. To use another example, some enterprises are suffering from deficits due to poor management, overstocking of products, and attempts to sell poor-quality products at high prices. Simple protective measures cannot provide a radical solution; only by pushing the enterprise toward the market to participate in competition will the problems be solved. From a long-term point of view, development is the last word [fa zhan si ying dao li 4099 1455 2508 4289 6670 3810]; when the national economy develops, there will be far greater leeway for resolving all kinds of contradictions and problems. As social material and spiritual wealth increases, the nation becomes prosperous and strong, and the people become well off, many contradictions will be easily resolved. If the economy fails to develop, everything else will be out of the question. Third, resolving contradictions by means of democracy and the legal system constitute an important principle which we must follow. The masses of the people are the main force of reform. Without the support and cooperation of the majority of the masses, we will accomplish nothing in our work. Hence, it is necessary to develop democracy and consult the masses on all major issues. Before a major policy is introduced, it is necessary to listen to opinions from various quarters and choose and follow what is good. After a policy is announced, it is necessary to organize the broad ranks of the cadres and the masses to earnestly implement it. At the same time, we should solicit the views of the masses and constantly revise, compliment, and improve the policy. Centering on the requirements of establishing a socialist market economic system, we have formulated a series of laws, regulations, and systems. This is the foundation for settling all kinds of contradictions and problems. No unit or individual may override the law, regulations, and system and do as it or he likes. The style of "seriously resolving the major issues while paying little attention to minor ones" must be discouraged. Whatever reason one has, the contradictions and problems can only be resolved within the framework of state law, regulations, and systems. Practice has proven that complying with the law and regulations is the effective way to eliminate unreasonable quibbling and remove artificial interference. III. Leading organs at all levels, particularly the leading cadres, shoulder great responsibility for properly handling the contradictions among the people in the new situation. New contradictions and problems will emerge in large numbers at a time when we are making strenuous efforts to push reform forward. We must work conscientiously, seriously, and earnestly and pay special attention to the following: Make great efforts to strengthen ideological and political work. During the transition, in which the old system will be replaced by a new one, the thinking of the masses will be exceptionally active due to changes in the social structure and interests setup. The expression of differing views and thinking is quite natural. If we neglect ideological education and lack correct guidance, a trifling matter can easily lead to an incident. Hence, ideological work should be more meticulous alongside deepening reform. It is necessary to conduct ideological education work in connection with reality rather than evade contradictions and put on bureaucratic airs. We should resolve practical problems one by one, explain the policies as well as the difficulties to the masses, and keep from covering up problems and contradictions. This is one of the methods for dispelling misunderstanding and increasing common understanding. For example, the policies on grain delivery, tax imposition, retention of profits, residential land, land requisition, and resource exploitation should be clearly explained. The masses should understand the duties they must undertake as well as the rights they can exercise. In the distribution of income, it is necessary to explain the difference between income gaps and unfair distribution and clarify which ways of becoming rich are reasonable and which are not. It is particularly necessary to tell them that we are against those who make exorbitant profits. We should take special note of conducting education among the masses with the idea of reform so that they can understand that short-term individual and immediate interests should be subordinate to the long-term interests of the state and society as a whole. When the facts are presented and the truth is explained, the majority of the masses will certainly take the overall situation into account. Fighting corruption, running a clean administration, and getting rid of bureaucracy constitute an important way to mitigate all kinds of contradictions. The masses of some localities hate corruption and bureaucracy more than anything else. Corruption is primarily manifested by some cadres making a profit through abusing their special position to engage in economic activities. Although this involves only a handful of people, it has had a negative influence among the masses. The disputes in interests in a number of localities have been complicated precisely due to this factor, and some have even become antagonistic. A bureaucratic work style is also an essential reason why contradictions come about and are aggravated. Some contradictions and disputes, though not serious, may lead to drastic mass reactions if they are left unattended for a long period of time. We should encourage the spirit of earnestly undertaking responsibility and opposing the practices of shifting responsibility onto others and glossing over mistakes. If the opinions and requirements of the masses are reasonable, they should be met immediately where conditions permit. Regarding reasonable opinions and requirements which cannot be resolved for the time being for various reasons, it necessary to do persuasive work and create the conditions for resolving them. As regards the requirements which are not very reasonable, as long as they are not deliberately provocative, we should explain principles, introduce policies, and give the masses a clear answer. In a word, we must go deep into the realities of life among the masses. Leading cadres should do work in those places where there are contradictions and problems. We should be concerned about the well-being of the masses and help them resolve their difficulties. For various reasons, the income of some workers in loss-making enterprises has dropped and they have had difficulties securing their livelihood; the interests of some peasants have also dropped, and they have had to deal with a number of problems in production and livelihood. This is related to the stability of the overall situation. The enthusiasm of some localities for construction is now running high, but, due to the shortage of capital, they often neglect the basic livelihood of the masses. This merits attention. We would rather cut a number of projects and curtail other expenditures and use the money that is saved to ensure that the "rice bags" and "vegetable baskets" of the masses are full. It is particularly necessary to show concern for the workers in some loss-making enterprises who have financial difficulties, provide timely help, and make proper arrangements for their livelihood. We should always bear in mind the problems related to the livelihood of the masses -- such as social order, water and electric supply, and schooling -- and must be eager to meet their needs. In this way, our social life will be filled with tranquility and harmony. There will be fewer contradictions and friction, and those that appear will be easily resolved. In the new situation, the contradictions among the people will be extremely complicated. These contradictions should be resolved through persuasion, education, mediation, and consultation. We must absolutely avoid being rigid, rough, and brutal [sheng ying cu bao 3932 4289 4723 2552]. However, it is also necessary to take note of the change in the nature of the contradictions. When tackling the phenomenon of complicated contradictions, we should make an accurate judgment of their nature and adopt timely measures. We should strive to gain an initiative in all our work and try to nip all problems in the bud. The handling of contradictions among the people covers much ground. Therefore, we should mobilize the forces of all fields and encourage everybody to do work. Party committees and governments at all levels must properly perform organization and coordination work; the democratic parties at all levels and mass organizations should vigorously offer cooperation; and all localities, departments, and units should get involved. To handle the contradictions among the people in the new situation, we must have correct guidelines and work methods, and this requires a powerful organizational guarantee.
