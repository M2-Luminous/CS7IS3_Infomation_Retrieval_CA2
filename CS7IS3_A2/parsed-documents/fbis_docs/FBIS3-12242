The same source said that when 'Arafat received U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia John McCarthy, he asked for some clarifications regarding the level of the negotiating delegations, the date for beginning the negotiations, the reason for moving them from Cairo to Washington, and the role the United States will play in these negotiations. The Palestinian official added that 'Arafat informed the United States of the need for an Egyptian presence during the negotiations and that Egypt should play a clear role because it has been following the negotiations since they started. It has also been the host country, both in Cairo and Taba, ever since the Declaration of Principles was signed. The Tunisian paper AS-SABAH today quoted informed Palestinian sources as saying that the Palestinian leadership is in the process of drafting a detailed memorandum to be handed to the U.S. Administration and the Israeli Government. The memorandum contains several demands that need to be met before returning to the negotiating table. The memorandum contains the following: 1. All those connected with the Hebron massacre must be put on trial, particularly since the Palestinian leadership has confirmed information that the massacre was not an individual or isolated incident as Israel is trying to show, but was conducted with the participation and the collusion of leaders of their Army. According to the information, there were more that 20 assailants involved in the Hebron massacre, including soldiers and settlers. 2. That the settlers in the occupied territories be disarmed, security settlements be dismantled, and the settlements' extremist leaders expelled from the occupied territories and banned from returning there. 3. That the Qiryat Arba' settlement near Hebron, which is a bastion of Jewish extremists in the occupied territories, be dismantled. 4. That the issue of Jerusalem be put on the agenda of the talks and protection given to the unarmed Palestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem against the practices of the Israeli Army and settlers, in view of the Hebron massacre. 5. That Israel accept the entry of international troops into the cities, villages, and camps on the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, that are not subject to the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 6. That the timetable for the Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and Jericho be fully honored and the Palestinian security forces allowed to enter as soon as possible. The same Palestinian sources pointed out that the majority among the Palestinian leaders insists on the need to suspend the negotiations if no "clear-cut and explicit" decision is made to prevent the settlers' excesses and crimes. The sources noted that the Palestinian leadership is also awaiting a clear-cut and explicit stand from the U.S. Administration that would reflect its credibility in cosponsoring the peace process.
