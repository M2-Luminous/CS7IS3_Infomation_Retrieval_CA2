The statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman: The process of the peaceful solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula now faces a grave challenge. The United States is creating a grave crisis which can lead the situation to a catastrophe [paguk] at a decisive juncture when the DPRK-U.S. talks can be rescued from a stalemate and when the prospects are opened for a package solution of the nuclear problem. As is known, the DPRK and the United States agreed toward the end of last year that they will hold a third round of talks, that the United States will stop the Team Spirit joint military exercise for 1994, and that we will accept a limited inspection [hanjongdoen pomwiui sachal] necessary to ensure the continuity of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] safeguards on our nuclear sites, as a present measure for a package solution of the nuclear problem. Accordingly, with extraordinary patience and utmost broadmindedness within the framework of the DPRK-U.S. agreement, we have discussed with the IAEA Secretariat the scope of the inspection for ensuring the continuity of the safeguards. However, the IAEA Secretariat intentionally ignored our special position of tentatively suspending the validation of the withdrawal [haengmugi chonpa pangji choyak taltoe hyoryok palsaengul imsi chongji sikin] from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], and foolishly attempted to realize an overall inspection [chonmyon sachal] which is comparable to returning to the treaty [choyak pokkwie manmongnun], which could be settled through the DPRK-U.S. talks in the future, rather than an inspection to ensure the continuity of the safeguards. This not only clearly contradicts the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreement, but also is a matter which cannot even become an object of discussion at all at this time when the U.S. nuclear threat, which brought about our withdrawal from the treaty, remains unremoved, and when the issue of the IAEA's partiality remains unresolved. This notwithstanding, the United States, the party to the talks, instead of making efforts to correct the improper steps of the IAEA Secretariat, has completely reversed the promise on conducting inspections in order to purely guarantee the continuity of the nuclear safeguards accord. Rather, the United States is officially urging us to accept the full-scale inspections [chonmyon sachal] which the IAEA Secretariat has put forward. Worse still, the United States has set a time limit and is assuming an ultimatum-like attitude that if we do not accept the IAEA's demand, the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks cannot be held and it cannot but take the road to impose sanctions against the DPRK. What is graver is that by once again bringing up the issue of conducting special inspections of two military sites which have nothing to do with our nuclear activity, the United States stands in the van of the international-pressure commotions against us. This is a brazen-faced betrayal of the party to the dialogue. After all, it becomes clear that the fact the United States has been busy talking about the solution of the nuclear issue through talks is a delaying tactic to make a pretext to crush us and to buy time needed for this. The United States' anti-Republic crushing maneuvers are clearly shown in a new war-provocation maneuver which has been sought in the behind-the-scenes DPRK-U.S. talks. Contrary to its repeated promise of not using armed forces, including nuclear weapons, and of not making a threat through armed forces, the United States is persistently trying to conduct a large-scale nuclear war exercise against our Republic, including the Team Spirit joint military exercise. U.S. official circles are now saying that if the Team Spirit joint military exercise cannot be conducted, they plan to continue another joint military exercise against the DPRK and are openly raving that if the exercise cannot be held in South Korea, it should be held even in Hawaii. We have raised the issue of discontinuing the Team Spirit joint military exercise as a major agenda in the DPRK-U.S. dialogue. This is aimed not at taking off the signboards of the military exercise but at basically removing the U.S. nuclear threat against us. While enforcing the nuclear war exercise against the dialogue partner, the United States assumes the impudent attitude of claiming that the nuclear issue be resolved. This cannot but be a mockery of us and a negation of the dialogue itself. In particular, what cannot be overlooked is that U.S. hard-line conservative forces are full-fledgedly hurrying to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea as one of the attempts to gain military supremacy over us. There is no one who believes that the United States--which employs a smile strategy as if it were interested in withdrawing the nuclear weapons at talks and which runs wild to deploy Patriot missiles against the partners behind the scenes--has the will to resolve issues. This nonetheless, the U.S. State Department spokesman's sophistry that the deployment of missiles cannot be regarded as a provocation of us can be said to be extremely brazen-faced. The United States' reckless, new war-provocation maneuvers do not end here. The U.S. Administration dispatched the director of the Central Intelligence Agency to South Korea early in the new year and made a plot to strengthen intelligence gathering on the North. This strongly implies a full-fledged stage of the maneuvers for war preparations. It is not difficult to think that the United States will take a road to find a pretext to enter a practical military activity. Considering the facts, it becomes obvious to everyone that the fact that the IAEA Secretariat has premeditatedly delayed negotiations with us, waited for the monitoring cameras' film and batteries to run out, and made the attempt of full-scale inspections by means of a collusive method of additional inspections [chuga sachal] is a premeditated U.S. strategy. All facts clearly show that the United States has no will to peacefully resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and invariably seeks its inner intention to crush our Republic through strength. Regarding the current emergency situation [uigi sanghwang] evoked by the mean and extremely dangerous traitorous acts of the United States, the DPRK Foreign Ministry solemnly declares its position as follows: First, in the event the United States reverses the promise made with us, we no longer are bound to the promise made with the United States [miguki uriwa han yaksokul kkunnae twijipo omnundamyon urido toisang migukkwa han yaksoge kusoktoeji anulgosida]. The promises we made with the United States include all the steps and commitments of good will, such as suspending the validation of the withdrawal from the NPT, freezing all nuclear activities, and abandoning the graphite-moderated nuclear reactor system, which we have unilaterally made for the U.S.-DPRK talks and for the peaceful solution of the nuclear problem. Second, if the United States does not want the DPRK-U.S. talks, we are not in a position to insist on them. It is a great miscalculation [kodaran osan] if the United States thinks the DPRK-U.S. talks is any gift to us. The reason we consistently insisted on negotiations with the United States from the first stage of the emergence of the nuclear issue was to peacefully resolve the nuclear issue, not because we wanted anything from the United States. We have lived up to now without relations with the United States, and we can and will live on ever so. Third, in the event the United States wants to make any other choice, we will also choose the reciprocal countermeasure. [kue sangunghanun taeung pangdo] The right of choice is not only that of the big countries. The U.S. hard-line, conservative forces should take all responsibility for the catastrophic situation that could come about. The South Korean authorities, who are thoughtlessly following this, can never be free from this responsibility. [Dated] 31 January, 1994, Pyongyang
