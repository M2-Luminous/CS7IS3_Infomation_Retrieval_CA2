The reporter recalled that the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in December last year reviewed the fulfilment of the Third Seven-Year Plan and put forward an economic strategy, setting a three-year period of adjustment, on the basis of a scientific analysis of the present situation and the state of socialist economic construction in the country. He quoted the great leader President Kim Il-song as saying: "At the twenty-first plenary meeting of the sixth party Central Committee, the next three years were set as a period for adjustment in socialist economic construction and during this period we must implement the agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first policies. Along with this, we must give precedence to the coal industry, power industry and rail transport, which must advance ahead of the other sectors of the national economy, while continuing to develop the metal industry." The task of socialist economic construction in the period for adjustment is to thoroughly implement the agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first policies and give precedence to the coal industry, power industry and rail transport, which must advance ahead of the other sectors of the national economy, while continuing to develop the metal industry. The revolutionary economic strategy for the period of adjustment in socialist economic construction represents the steadfast determination and will of the Workers' Party of Korea to radically improve the people's living standard in the next few years and develop the national economy into an economy strong in independence which can walk on its own feet, remaining unshaken under any circumstances. When we, by implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategy, bring about a new turn in the development of agriculture, light industry and foreign trade and keep the preferential sectors of the national economy definitely ahead of the others while continuing to develop the metal industry, the departmental structure of the economy will be further improved and its independence and potential will grow immensely. Our party's economic strategy is a just policy which makes it possible to more successfully implement the basic line of economic construction in conformity with the demand of the prevailing situation and the developing realities. The agriculture-first policy is the primary task to be carried out in the adjustment period. By implementing this policy to the letter, we must make an advance in all domains of agricultural production such as grain, meat, egg, fruit and vegetable production, thus satisfactorily solving the food problem for the people. We must, above all, consolidate the achievements in irrigation and electrification to give full scope to their potential and raise the level of comprehensive mechanization and application of chemicals to a higher stage. We must raise the utilization rate of the existing farm machines to the maximum and, at the same time, produce above 30,000 tractors and 10,000 or more lorries and other farm machines of various kinds needed for mechanizing labour-consuming work in the adjustment period. And the supply of nitrogenous, phosphatic and potassic fertilizers must be increased for the rural communities. The green revolution must be pushed ahead to obtain high-grade strains of seed, which are high-yielding, suitable to the climatic and soil conditimns of our country, early-ripening and resisting storms, cold and moisture, blight and harmful insects, including the first filial generations of rice and maize which can yield 12 to 15 tons per hectare. The per hectare yield in paddy and non-paddy fields must be raised to above 8 tons on an average and gradually to more than 10 tons to produce 15 million tons of grain in the near future. During the period of adjustment fruit and meat output must be raised 30 percent respectively. A big effort must be directed to the implementation of the light industry-first policy. Textile output must be boosted above 20 percent and the output of shoes more than 10 percent in the period. Food processing industry must be further developed to supply more abundant and diverse food to the people and the quantity and variety of consumer goods must be continuously increased. The chemical factories and industrial establishments producing raw materials for the light industry must lift the output of vinalon and other chemical fibres and synthetic resin more than 10 percent and produce enough raw materials for the light industry including paper, dyestuffs and basic chemical goods. A new turnabout must be made in foreign trade to cope with the changed circumstances. A brisk drive must be launched in all sectors of the national economy to expand the production bases of export goods and improve the quality of products for a radical increase of exports. Efforts must be directed to the building of the Najin-Sonbong free economic and trade zone to fully ensure conditions for investment by foreign businesses. We must expand and strengthen economic ties with countries which are on good terms with our country and further develop trade and economic dealings with Southeast Asian countries which are within easy reach geographically and favourable for transactions. Coal and power output and railway freight turnover which should advance ahead of other sectors must be increased 30 percent respectively during the period of adjustment. And investment in oil prospecting must be increased to discover more oil deposits. The metal industry must be developed to satisfactorily meet the growing demand for irons and steels.
