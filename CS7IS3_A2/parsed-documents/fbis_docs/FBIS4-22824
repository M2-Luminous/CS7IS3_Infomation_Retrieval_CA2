A series of experiments were conducted to find simple methods of synthesizing trichlorogermyl-substituted amides, lactams, and imides. The experiments confirmed that it is just as easy to form trichlorogermyl-substituted amides, lactams, and imides by condensing HGeCl[.sub]3[/] with compounds containing the fragment NCH[.sub]2[/]Cl as it is to form the said compounds by reacting HGeCl[.sub]3[/] with compounds containing the groupings NCH[.sub]2[/]OH and NCH[.sub]2[/]OH. The yields of the products RCH[.sub]2[/]GeCl[.sub]3[/] produced during the experiments reached 70-83 percent, which is 10-25 percent higher than when the respective N-methylolamide or N-methylolimide is used. Further studies of the chemical properties of amides, lactams, and imides with a Cl[.sub]3[/]GeCH[.sub]2[/]NC(O)-group established that the phthalamide derivative, unlike previously studied amide and lactam derivatives, splits upon boiling in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Next, several never-before-synthesized tribromo- and triiodogermyl derivatives were produced. In those cases where the intermediately formed sesquioxanes were water soluble and difficult to isolate, a new technique was used to obtain triiodogermyl derivatives, i.e., the effect of concentrated hydriodic acid directly on the respective trialkolxygermane. The new compounds were subjected by x-ray crystallographic and elemental analysis. The newly synthesized compounds were confirmed to contain a pentacoordinated germanium atom.
