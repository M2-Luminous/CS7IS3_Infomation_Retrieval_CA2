The meeting was of fundamental importance for the Japanese side since it was to attest that, following the parliamentary elections, there had been no change in Russia's acknowledgment of the territorial problem as a real, pressing problem. It became known yesterday evening that the bilateral meeting has been postponed indefinitely on the Russian side's initiative. The reasons given have plunged the Japanese into profound depression: The Russian side gave domestic political factors linked with the new parliament as the reason. In Tokyo this was interpreted unequivocally as meaning that the political changes taking place in Russia do not as yet allow Moscow to clearly make up its mind about Japan. And this means that the accords secured during Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan in October are, as it were, up in the air. Japanese concern intensified after the first press conference given by Vladimir Shumeyko, who has just been elected speaker of the Russian parliament's upper chamber. News agencies reported that the new speaker said that the disputed islands are Russian territory and cannot and will not be surrendered to anyone. According to Shumeyko, there is no question of the ownership and future of the islands of Kunashir, Iturup, Habomai, and Shikotan at all. What is more, the speaker pointed out that the government and cabinet of ministers apparatus backs the stance espoused by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, which boils down to the idea that the territorial question does not exist in Russian-Japanese relations. But the most significant point in Shumeyko's statements, as reported by news agency channels, is a previously unheard-of statement: The speaker said that the Russian Government's stance on territorial matters is at variance with Russia's official position. Shumeyko virtually admitted that not only does the Russian president not have the last word or the deciding say as far as the parliament is concerned but even as far as members of the cabinet, which the president himself formed, are concerned. People in Japan have not so far commented on this revelation -- evidently they are at a loss to find the necessary words and phrases straightaway. But ultimately it is not a question of Japanese comment but of the fact that Moscow seems to see nothing bad in this situation.
