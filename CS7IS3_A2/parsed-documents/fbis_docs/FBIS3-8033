Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and his Croatian counterpart Franjo Tudjman will sign the document, following the accord reached Tuesday [1 March], Silajdzic said from Washington. The accord calls for a federation of Bosnian Croats and Moslems, comprising a number of cantons. The cantons would have equal rights, with a central government in charge of foreign affairs, defense and trade. Bosnian Serbs are not included in the deal. Silajdzic added that experts from the two sides would in the meantime work on a new constitution, both for Bosnia-Herzegovina and for a future confederation of the Bosnian and Croatian republics. These experts would meet in the U.S. embassies in Vienna, he said. Silajdzic said he would shortly travel to Moscow.
