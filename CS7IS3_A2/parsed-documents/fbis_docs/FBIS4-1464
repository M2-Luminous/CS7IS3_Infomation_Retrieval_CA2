"We want to state clearly and unequivocally that if the fuel crisis is not resolved by 29 April, by those who orchestrated it, the CD will call on the Nigerian people to go into the streets to drive the Abacha clique away," CD pointed out in a communique signed by its Secretary General Sylvester Odion-Akhaine, a copy of which was sent to AFP. Furthermore, CD, a collective of some 40 student and human rights organizations, described the government's 26 April ultimatum to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation [NNPC] as "hypocritical," given that "the fraud perpetrated within the NNPC is orchestrated by government officials," the communique stressed. The government has given a seven-day ultimatum to the NNPC to restore fuel supply in the country. Nigeria is currently facing one of the most serious fuel shortages in many years and a chaotic situation is prevailing in the country. The CD communique called on the country to get ready for "a great confrontation...because the decisive moment has come."
