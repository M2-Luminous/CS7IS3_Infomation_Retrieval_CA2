Similar evidence presented in testimony before the House Minority Enterprise Subcommittee on May 20, 1994 indicates that African American business borrowers have difficulty raising capital mainly because they have less equity to invest, they receive fewer loan dollars per dollar of equity investment, and they are less likely to have alternate loan sources, such as affluent family or friends. Assuming two hypothetical college educated, similarly-situated male entrepreneurs, one black, one white, the testimony indicated that the white candidate would have access to $1.85 in bank loans for each dollar of owner equity invested, while the black candidate would have access to only $1.16. According to the testimony, the problems associated with lower incomes and intergenerational wealth, as well as the discriminatory treatment minorities receive from financial institutions, make it much more likely that minorities will be shut out of capital intensive industries, such as telecommunications. This testimony also noted that African American representation in communications is so low that it was not possible to generate meaningful summary statistics on underrepresentation. 69 69 Testimony of Dr. Timothy Bates, Visiting Fellow, The Woodrow Wilson Center, before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Small Business, Subcommittee on Minority Enterprise, Finance, and Urban Development (House Minority Enterprise Subcommittee), May 20, 1994. 101. The inability to access capital is also a major impediment to the successful participation of women in broadband PCS auctions. In enacting the Women's Business Ownership Act in 1988, Congress made findings that women, as a group, are subject to discrimination that adversely affects their ability to raise or secure capital. 70 As AWRT documents, these discriminatory barriers still exist today. Indeed, AWRT reports that while venture capital is an important source of funding for telecommunications companies, women-owned companies received only approximately one percent of the $3 billion invested by institutional venture capitalists in 1993. Citing a 1992 National Women's Business Council report, AWRT further argues that even successful women-owned companies did not overcome these financing obstacles after they had reached a level of funding and profitability adequate for most other businesses. 71 70 Pub. L. 100&hyph;533 (1988). In 1991, Congress enacted the Women's Business Development Act of 1991 to further assist the development of small businesses owned by women. See Pub. L. 102&hyph;191 (1991). 71 See Letter of AWRT to the Honorable Kweisi Mfume, Chairman, House Minority Enterprise Subcommittee, June 1, 1994. 102. A study prepared in 1993 by the National Foundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO) further illustrates the barriers faced by women-owned businesses. For example, it finds that women-owned firms are 22 percent more likely to report problems dealing with their banks than are businesses at large. In addition, the NFWBO study finds that the largest single type of short-term financing used by women business owners is credit cards and that over half of women-owned firms use credit cards for such purposes, as compared to 18 percent of all small to medium-sized businesses, which generally use bank loans and vendor credit for short-term credit needs. With regard to long-term financing, the study states that a greater proportion of women-owned firms are turning, or are forced to turn, to private sources, and to a wider variety of sources, to fulfill their needs. Based on these findings, the NFWBO study concludes that removal of financial barriers would encourage stronger growth among women-owned businesses, resulting in much greater growth throughout the economy. 72 72 See The National Foundation for Women Business Owners, Financing the Business, A Report on Financial Issues from the 1992 Biennial Membership Survey of Women Business Owners, October 1993. 103. If we are to meet the congressional goals of promoting economic opportunity and competition by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of providers, we must find ways to counteract these barriers to entry. Over the years, both Congress and the Commission have tried various methods to enhance access to the broadcast and cable industries by minorities and women. For example, in the late 1960s, the FCC began to promote nondiscriminatory employment policies by broadcast licensees. These equal employment opportunity efforts have taken the form of Commission rules and policies that require licensees not to discriminate, to report hiring and promotion statistics, and to implement affirmative action programs. 73 The Commission also has adopted similar equal employment rules for licensees in the common carrier, public mobile, and international fixed public radio communication services, 74 as well for cable operators. 75 The cable EEO rules were recently revised as part of the implementation of the Cable Act of 1992, and they now apply to cable entities, satellite master antenna television operators serving 50 or more subscribers and any multichannel video programming distributor. 76 73 47 CFR §73.2080 (broadcasters must ``establish, maintain, and carry out a positive continuing program of specific practices designed to ensure equal opportunity in every aspect of the station's employment policy and practice''). 74 47 CFR §§21.307, 22.307, 23.55. 75 47 CFR §§76.71&hyph;76.79. 76 See 47 U.S.C. §554. In addition, the Commission has proposed adopting EEO requirements for all CMRS licensees, including PCS licensees.

A decade after it first addressed discriminatory hiring practices, the Commission began to look into the serious underrepresentation of minorities among owners of broadcast stations. Recognizing that it could play an important role in alleviating this problem through the licensing process, the Commission adopted its tax certificate and distress sale policies in 1978 to encourage minority ownership of broadcast facilities. 77 It noted that full minority participation in the ownership and management of broadcast facilities would result in a more diverse selection of programming and would inevitably enhance the diversity of control of a valuable resource, the electromagnetic spectrum. 78 77 See Commission Policy Regarding the Advancement of Minority Ownership in Broadcasting, 92 FCC 2d 849 (1982) (1982 Policy Statement); see also Statement of Policy on Minority Ownership of Broadcasting Facilities, 68 FCC 2d 979 (1978) (1978 Policy Statement). 78 Because of the role of cable television systems in retransmitting broadcast signals, the Commission has also issued tax certificates in connection with sales of cable systems. See Statement of Policy on Minority Ownership of CATV Systems, FCC 82&hyph;524, released December 22, 1982.
