Vladislav Ardzinba, the leader of the autonomy, says that the decision is due to the fact that the Georgian Supreme Council -- quite illegally, in his opinion -- has declared the supreme legislative body of the former autonomous republic disbanded. [Ardzinba] "The Law on State Power in the Republic of Georgia, to which the Georgian Supreme Council refers as the legal foundation for its decision, was adopted unilaterally after the state and legal relations between Abkhazia and Georgia were terminated. In view of this, it cannot apply to events taking place on the territory of the Republic of Abkhazia." [Announcer] This is how Valeriy Advadze, the Georgian ambassador to Moscow, commented on Ardzinba's statement at our request. [Advadze] "This unilateral decision -- well, it is being applied to Abkhazia and the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia that was elected on the basis of a discriminatory law when 17 to 18 percent of the electorate had 28 seats in parliament, whereas 50 percent of the Georgian population had 26 seats. I do not think another such discriminative law exists anywhere in the world -- this is simply impossible. Therefore, the fact that this law was made invalid, together with the Supreme Soviet elected on the basis of this law, is simply a belated measure. It should not have been adopted in the first place, or it should have been removed earlier." [Announcer] I would like to point out, however, that Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze considers the decision of the Georgian Supreme Council to disband the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet a rash measure. Also today, Vladislav Ardzinba spoke sharply against the UN peacekeeping troops being introduced in the republic without the consent of the Abkhazian [Ardzinba] "If these troops are introduced throughout the territory of Abkhazia in the interest of the Georgian side, we will regard this as occupation, as an attempt to occupy the territory of Abkhazia, with all the ensuing consequences. I do not think there is any need to say anything else." [Announcer] Valeriy Advadze, the Georgian ambassador to Moscow, comments again. [Advadze] "The peacekeeping troops, if they do come, should be deployed on the entire territory of Abkhazia so as to insure that the residents who fled from there, the refugees, can return and to guarantee a normal life and safety for them when they return. It cannot be otherwise." [Announcer] This evening the Russian Foreign Ministry expressed its concern over the developments in Abkhazia and the emergence of a real threat of armed clashes.
