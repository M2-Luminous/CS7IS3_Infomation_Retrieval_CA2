FR941213-2-00071 FR941213-2-00046 [Docket No. 50&hyph;286] Power Authority of the State of New York; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendment to Facility Operating License No. DRP&hyph;64, issued to the Power Authority of the State of New York (the licensee), for operation of Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3 (Indian Point 3) located in Westchester County, New York. The proposed amendment would revise Section 4.4 of the Indian Point 3 Technical Specifications. Specifically, TS 4.4.E.1 would be revised to allow a one-time extension to the 30-month interval requirement for leak rate testing of Residual Heat Removal (RHR) containment isolation values AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870. This one-time extension for leak rate testing of the RHR valves would be deferred until prior to return to power following the current outage, which defined as prior to T avg exceeding 350 ○F. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilities in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a siginificant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards based on the following information: 1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? Response: The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change is limited to a one-time extension of the containment isolation valve leak rate test for RHR valves, AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870. Testing the RHR containment isolation valves while T avg is above 200 ○F and below 350 ○F is considered to be a more practical time to test the valves because, in this configuration, the reactor coolant pumps and steam generators can be used to remove decay heat. Additionally, the revised testing procedure required to test the RHR containment isolation valves with T avg above 200 ○F and below 350 ○F can be performed in accordance with the current Technical Specifications. Therefore, the probability of a previously evaluated accident is not significantly increased. The consequences of a previously evaluated accident would not be significantly increased because each of the three RHR lines associated with valves AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870 has redundant isolation barriers and is supplied by the IVSWS [isolation valve seal water system] which would minimize any leakage past the isolation barriers. Further, due to the periodic surveillance that ensures that leakage from RHR components located outside containment does not exceed two gallons per hour, even if significant leakage past the RHR containment isolation valves occurred, this would not significantly affect off-site exposures. 2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? Response: The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not introduce new accident initiators or failure mechanisms since the change does not alter the physical characteristics of any plant system or component. The change is limited to a one-time extension to the leak rate test interval for RHR valves AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870. 3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? Response: The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Testing the RHR containment isolation valves while T avg is above 200 ○F and below 350 ○F is considered to be a more practical time to test the valves because, in this configuration, the reactor coolant pumps and steam generators can be used to remove decay heat. Additionally, the revised testing procedure required to test the RHR containment isolation valves with T avg above 200 ○F and below 350 ○F can be performed in accordance with the current Technical Specifications. Therefore, there is not a significant reduction in a margin of safety. With respect to containment integrity, there is not a significant reduction in a margin of safety because each of the three RHR lines associated with valves AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870 has redundant isolation barriers and is supplied by the IVSWS which would minimize any leakage past the isolation barriers. The most recent test results associated with valves AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870 show that the leak rates of the valves were well within the acceptance criteria of the tests. Further, due to the periodic surveillance that ensures that leakage from RHR components located outside containment does not exceed two gallons per hour, even if significant leakage past the RHR containment isolation valves occurred, this would significantly affect off-site exposures.
