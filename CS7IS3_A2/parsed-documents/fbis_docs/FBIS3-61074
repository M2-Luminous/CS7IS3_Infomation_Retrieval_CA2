Industriousness and efficiency, knowledge and an unconventional way of thinking -- resulting in not just reprimands, but early promotions and two academies behind him. He accepted as his destiny the move from the General Staff to the Border Forces. A new stage in the border guards' life began with the presidential Edict on the Creation of the Federal Border Service (FBS). We offer for your attention an interview by our military observer Vladimir Klimov with Col. Gen. A. Nikolayev. How To Equip the Border [Klimov] What is fundamentally new in the Border Forces' tasks and functions? [Nikolayev] First and foremost the separation of the Border Forces into an independent structure with the rights of a ministry can in no way be regarded as a repetition of the story of the creation of the Committee for the Protection of State Borders, which left the KGB. The amorphousness of that committee and the fact that is belonged to everyone and no one predetermined its failure. The subordination of the present FBS is clear -- it is subordinate to the president and the government. The Border Forces are henceforth implementers of Russian foreign policy. In subordinating a number of structures in the state security system to himself and introducing the post of assistant for national security, the Russian Federation president is creating a well-integrated system for safeguarding the country's security in which each of the structures has a clearly prescribed role. This not only raises the border forces' status. We are moving away, as it were, from the notion that we are purely military people. From an international viewpoint this is a very important fact. The edict encapsulates the reality dictated by life. The future may possibly be different. But today we have a clear awareNess of our role and place in the country's security system. [Klimov] Protecting the border remains one of the main tasks. Andrey Ivanovich, when will the Russian border be equipped, and how? [Nikolayev] Our border with Kazakhstan, for example, stretches for 7,500 km. If we started equipping it we would spend so much money that we would be left not only without jackets on our backs, but even without pants. Why should the Russian people be deprived of shoes if we are in a position to safeguard their interests in not only political but purely practical border-protection terms on Turkmenistan's border with Iran, Kyrgyzstan's border with China, and so forth. It is along these borders that Russia's strategic interests lie. Politicians in the Commonwealth countries have now come close to understanding that the border of their state is the border of the entire CIS. That is the first point. The second is that it is economically much more advantageous to protect the former Union borders: Russia's share of the cost is 50-50 in terms of money and 50-50 in terms of personnel. It is a different matter if some people in the CIS disagree with our approach or if Russia is not confident about the safeguarding of its security or the protection of its interests. This would spark a counter-reaction, and Russia would get involved in equipping the border. At the first stage this would mean border checks, at the second stage -- searches, at the third stage -- protection involving troops. But we will not be the initiators of this kind of approach. Our states' peoples wish to move freely around the territory of the Commonwealth. If we build fences on our national borders there can be no question of such free movement. [Klimov] Andrey Ivanovich, you were in Azerbaijan recently. You cannot talk about a reliably protected border there. Mojahedin are coming in via Iran and participating in the fighting against Armenian troops. Arms and drugs come from there, and our border with Azerbaijan is transparent. How is this? [Nikolayev] We have a special approach to the Caucasus region. Border protection in the Caucasus is built along two boundaries. The first, the former USSR border, coincides with CIS countries' borders with Iran and Turkey. The second is the line of the Russian state border. It is necessary to guard this border and at the same time to create a protection system and build housing for officers, barracks, parks, stables, and so forth. By no means everything has gone smoothly. A particularly difficult situation developed in the Dagestan sector and on the territory of Karachayevo-Cherkessia on the border with Georgia. The arrival of border troop units here met with active resistance both from certain local residents and also from power structures. Around 150 criminal acts have been committed against North Caucasus District border troops on Georgian territory alone; three border troopers have been killed and over 20 wounded. However I can say that on the second border we are ensuring the protection of our interests. Let me cite a few figures. Around 700 intruders were detained and dozens of weapons and large quantities of ammunition were confiscated on Russia's border with Georgia and Azerbaijan last year. In Azerbaijan we said: If Russia can be confident that its interests are reliably protected on the Azerbaijan-Iran and Azerbaijan-Turkey borders, protection of Russia's borders in the Dagestan sector can be carried out jointly -- that is, the border posts are all in one line and Russians and Azerbaijanis serve together. This represents a special degree of trust. We have the same approach with Belarus and Ukraine. They and Russia are three independent states, but they cannot be divided by a border. Therefore we are proposing to Ukraine, for example: We will operate in the Bryansk sector and Ukrainian border troopers will operate in the Kursk sector. This is a fundamentally new attitude stemming from Russian foreign policy. Border Post Lessons [Klimov] Your first trip as head of the Border Forces, Andrey Ivanovich, was to the Tajik-Afghan border. What lessons have been learned from the fighting in that distant border post sector, where Russian border troopers have died? [Nikolayev] The Tajik-Afghan border is an acid test of the Commonwealth's solidity. The fighting on the border marked the beginning of efforts by the Commonwealth countries to safeguard their security. This is most probably the main lesson of that fighting in the border post sector. On the other hand, there is no problem with the border there. What we have there is bandits who break through the border. There is no military solution to the problems of the Tajik-Afghan border. Its stability can be safeguarded only by peaceful means involving negotiations between the country's leadership and the opposition. [Klimov] In times past the border sometimes "spawned" new weapons. The Damanskiy island incident was followed by the appearance of automatic grenade launchers among the troops. Is the experience of hostilities in border post sectors still heeded now? [Nikolayev] The Border Forces have specific weapons, of course. Our aircraft and helicopters differ from military ones and carry the identifier "P." There is also other combat equipment intended solely for border protection. Nevertheless the Border Forces need to change. Not to copy the Armed Forces but to be powerful and capable enough, when required, to fulfill a task involving the use of weapons. What we should be is the subject of great research. The next two or maybe three years will be a period of transition for the creation of virtually new Russian border forces. As we determine the Border Forces' role and place in the country's security system we are also determining its specific operational methods. Combat equipment and weapons must be produced to suit these methods. Dispensing Apartments With a Lordly Gesture [Klimov] Border Force officers have a difficult, nomadic life. What is being done for their social protection, Andrey Ivanovich? Have you personally helped any border trooper's family? [Nikolayev] In terms of "personally" I'm not going to answer. If I say "no," you won't believe me. If I say "yes," you'll demand that I give their name. But why is this necessary? I get many letters asking for help with an apartment. This is probably best quiet, but let me say that never in my life have I personally tried to solve a housing issue. Although many people have approached me both now and when I was serving with the troops. The conversation would start: "Comrade commander, you are such a good commander to us...." And it would end: "Give me an apartment." I know some commanders have responded to blandishments and indulged their charges: "There, have one." But I am neither lord nor king. I cannot hand out apartments with a lordly gesture. We have a system that provides people with housing. If I see someone who is really in need, I can instruct the housing commission to examine the matter. It is up to the commission what it decides. Any other approach would destroy the entire system of social justice. We have 7,000 people without accommodation at the moment. We will be building 2,200 apartments this year. In the next three-four years we can provide housing for all. But only with specific support from state structures. It is time it was recognized that the servicemen should not have to face a housing problem. I believe too that incentives in service must only be given for specific deeds. And what do we do: Holiday coming up -- draw up a detail. An unhealthy approach that has corrupted us all. If a man does something good, say to him: "Well done." If you cannot decorate him, give him 10,000 rubles [R]. Not much money, but a concrete incentive that works. Write about the soldier in the district newspaper and he will remember it the rest of his life. Because all of us -- from commander in chief to common soldier -- are normal people with normal reactions. I once asked our officers: What do you get more of in a border unit -- military or family ethos? I must say that many found it an incredible question. In the Army the barracks are the model, the motorized rifle company in which everything is by the book. But you have a quite different, family atmosphere in a border unit. The commander is not figuratively, but literally like a father. He is always there for his charges to see and can instill in them only what he himself exemplifies. And they do not want to rely on directives from Moscow. We have around 1,000 border units and no two are the same. How can someone in Moscow decide how one is to work with people in a border unit. All that is rubbish. We have made a mess of this work so far. Many people are scratching their heads now and wondering how to rectify matters. We have lost our points of reference, they say. Hang on, did a state leader ever say that patriotism was obsolete? Or that internationalism does not exist? We are not building ethnic Russian border forces, we are building the Border Forces of Russia. If I were in charge, I would abolish paragraph five on nationality [in Russian passports] today. What is needed is citizenship, not nationality. We are the people of Russia, the most multinational people. We will destroy Russia if we do not raise internationalists.
