FR940419-0-00029 FR940419-0-00010 33 CFR Part 165 [CGD08&hyph;93&hyph;027] RIN 2115&hyph;AE79 Regulated Navigation Area: Oliver Lock and Dam; Black Warrior River-MM 338 AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Interim final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a Regulated Navigation Area at the Oliver Lock and Dam at MM 338 of the Black Warrior River. This regulation places restrictions on downbound tows passing through the lock during periods of high Tail-Water Gauge readings. Strong currents exist during high water conditions below the lock and dam that set downbound tows against the right protruding bank. The regulations applicable in this regulated navigation area in high water conditions will alleviate this problem. DATES: This regulation becomes effective on April 19, 1994. Comments on this regulation must be received on or before June 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed to Commander (mps), Eighth Coast Guard District, Hale Boggs Federal Bldg., 501 Magazine St., New Orleans, LA 70130&hyph;3396. Comments may also be hand-delivered to this address. The comments and other materials related to this regulation will be available for inspection and copying in room 1341 at the above address. Normal office hours are between 7:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lieutenant Verne Gifford, Marine Safety Division, Eighth Coast Guard District, room 1341, Hale Boggs Federal Building, 501 Magazine Street, New Orleans, LA 70130&hyph;3396. Phone number: (504) 589&hyph;6188. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation, and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been contrary to the public interest. Several near miss marine casualties have occurred previously as a result of the conditions cited above. Immediate action is needed to prevent marine casualties and to protect the environment during instances of high water. Although this regulation is published as a final rule without prior notice, an opportunity for public comment is nevertheless desirable to ensure that the regulation is both reasonable and workable. Accordingly, persons wishing to comment may do so by submitting written comments to the office listed under ADDRESS in this preamble. Commenters should include their names and addresses, identify the docket number for the regulations, and give reasons for their comments. Based upon comments received, the regulations may be changed.
