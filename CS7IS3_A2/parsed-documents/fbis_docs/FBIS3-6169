"It is a clear violation of the truce," said Gov. Nestor Gumana of Sultan Kudarat who disclosed that 826 new cadres of the MNLF finished their guerrilla training at the foothills of the Daguma Range last 10 January. Moro rebels led by Kamsa Itom, alias "Commander Ronnie," were planning to hold this month another training for rebel recruits in the mountain sitio [district of a village] of Baton, barangay [village] Lagandang, Isulan, a Muslim-dominated village, Gumana said. The apparent infraction of the peace record, Gumana also said, prompted the Peace and Order Council of Sultan Kudarat to file a protest with government panel chief negotiator Manuel Yan. "It's up to General Yan to act on our protest but certainly we believed that ongoing training and recruitment indicated bad faith," he added. "This could heighten tension as it is sending the wrong signal to Christian constituents." Gumana's report came in the wake of information that some Christian groups believed connected with the Ilaga, an underground movement opposed to Muslim domination, have been courting police authorities at the PNP Recom [Philippine National Police Regional Command] 12 headquarters to allow them to conduct raids on known rebel lairs in the province. "I told them to hold their line since the police and the military can contain lawlessness," Sr. Supt. [Senior Superintendent] Jovencio Sales, PNP Recom 12 chief, said, adding that several Christian leaders have signified their willingness to fight the rebels in retaliation of the recent ambush-slaying of a busload of passengers in Tulunan, Maguindanao and the bombing of the Catholic cathedral in Davao City. Police sources said that Christians in Central Mindanao, fearing that the collapse of the peace talks between the government and the MNLF could spark hostilities, have been rearming themselves discreetly.
