"We agreed that all the parties should do their utmost to sort out the current political turmoil and fulfill their duties," Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida told a news conference. The coalition parties and the SDP, a former coalition partner, reached the agreement when coalition chiefs and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met to discuss the possibility of the SDP's rejoining the coalition. Departing Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata also attended the top-level gathering as he heads Shinseito, a key coalition force. Although the coalition parties and the SDP agreed to kick off talks to narrow their differences over key policy issues, this does not necessarily imply the SDP's imminent return to the ruling camp, political sources said. "We will move on to talks to form a new government after reaching an accord on policy," Takashi Yonezawa, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, told the same news conference. The policy talks between the coalition and the SDP, which left the governing alliance in April, will begin Wednesday when the SDP presents a fresh blueprint for a new coalition government. The seven coalition party chiefs and Murayama also concurred on the need for a more transparent and democratic political management style, Ishida said. In a related development, Murayama and Yohei Kono, president of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), will open talks at 8 p.m. Tuesday in what appeared to be an attempt to explore the possibility of forging an alliance to form a new government. The top-level meeting will be preceded by talks between the secretaries general of the LDP and the SDP, party officials said. The seven coalition party chiefs and Murayama also confirmed the SDP will call on new party Sakigake, also a former coalition member, to join a new government, Ishida said. The SDP's withdrawal stripped the coalition of its majority in both houses of the the Diet. To avert certain defeat in a no-confidence vote, Hata resigned with his two-month-old cabinet Saturday, prompting a flurry of plays for power over the framework of a new government. The LDP continued efforts Tuesday to launch a grand coalition with the SDP, the LDP's archrival during its 38-year unbroken rule that ended last August, in a bid to regain power. LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, in a meeting with SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, proposed putting up Murayama as head of a new three-party coalition government among the LDP, the SDP and Sakigake, an LDP splinter party. Kubo, however, did not respond immediately to the LDP's offer and instead told Mori that the SDP will give priority to talks with the coalition. Meanwhile, Murayama and Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura agreed to hold another round of talks Wednesday, officials said. Takemura, speaking at a Tokyo party commemorating the anniversary of the establishment of Sakigake, criticized the SDP for its moves to rejoin the coalition. "An increasing number of SDP legislators are making moves by basing their judgments on benefits they will be able to enjoy at the next election under the single-seat constituency system, rather than on ideals and policies," he said. Takemura was apparently referring to anxieties among some SDP legislators that unless they were nominated as joint coalition in single-seat constituencies, they might lose in the next election. "I want the Social Democratic Party to become the core" of a new coalition government, he said. "Sakigake will not waver between the right and left spectrum of political forces," Takemura said in an apparent appeal to the SDP not to return to the fold of the present coalition.
