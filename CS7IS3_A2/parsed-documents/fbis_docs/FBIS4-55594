This is currently the most important issue. The task of the commission will be constantly to meet to supervise the implementation of these Agreements' provisions. Ivo Komsic, president of the council and member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, spoke about other issues at the conference. He stressed that among the Croatian people there is a consensus on the implementation of the Constitution of the Federation. However, the problem lies elsewhere, in the interpretation of the essence of the Federation, Komsic said, immediately answering the question on what the Croatian National Council considers the essence of the Federation's organization and establishment: The Federation is not some final state of affairs set by the Croats and the Bosniaks in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but is primarily a [word indistinct] or a path toward the reintegration of all the occupied territories of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croatian National Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina will continue to interprete the Federation in this way, Komsic said. On behalf of the council, Komsic invited the Serbian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina to join in with the agreements on Bosnia-Herzegovina as a common homeland, stressing that the Serbian Civil Council is the true representative of these people. He also repeated the view of the Croatian National Council, namely that the council opposes the corridor through Bosanska Posavina [in the Brcko region], because the corridor is not in the interest of the Croatian people as a whole.
