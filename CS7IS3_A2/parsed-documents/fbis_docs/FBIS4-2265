Last year, the whole province conscientiously studied Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; implemented in an in-depth manner the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; further emancipated the minds; sought truth from facts; seized each and every excellent opportunity to quicken the pace of development; and maintained rapid and vigorous national economic growth with the result that the province's total GNP exceeded 68 billion yuan, up 15.8 percent on the previous year, while the province's total industrial and agricultural output value reached 122.1 billion yuan, up by 27.5 percent, and total financial revenue 6.56 billion yuan, up by 30.8 percent. Despite serious natural calamities, the province still reaped a good agricultural harvest with the total grain output reaching 30.34 billion jin. Wu Guanzheng went on: Last year, Jiangxi also successfully and comprehensively improved economic efficiency with the result that the total amount of profits and taxes realized by budgetary industrial enterprises registered a 46 percent increase. The province's total social commodity retail volume reached 27.9 billion yuan, up by 21.2 percent. The subsistence income of the province's urban residents rose by 26 percent while the per capita net income of the province's peasants went up by 13.3 percent. In 1993, Jiangxi absorbed a total of $1 billion in foreign funds and actually used $343 million of foreign funds. Moreover, Jiangxi also successfully kept the natural population growth rate within its planned limit. Reviewing the past and looking forward to the future, Wu Guanzheng maintained: This year, we should try to handle relations between reform and development correctly on the one hand and stability on the other; seize each and every excellent opportunity to deepen reform, expand opening up, push forward development, and maintain stability; work in a down-to-earth manner; promote industrial development on the basis of agricultural development; and lay a solid foundation for Jiangxi's future development. This year is a crucial one for deepening reform aimed at building a socialist market economic structure and an important year for concentrating on building basic facilities and pushing the province's economic growth onto a new stage at a faster pace. On the premise of improving economic efficiency, readjusting economic structure, and quickening construction pace, we should strive to keep Jiangxi's economic growth rate at a level higher than the country's average. We should strive to attain the following national economic and social development tasks in 1994: 1. Increase the province's GNP by 12 to 14 percent. 2. Increase the province's total industrial and agricultural output value by 18 percent, of which total agricultural output value is to be increased by 5 percent and total industrial output value by 23 percent. 3. Increase the province's financial revenue by 12 to 14 percent. 4. Increase per capita net income of the province's peasants by 100 to 130 yuan. 5. Keep the province's natural population growth rate within limits set by the state. In order to attain these goals, Wu Guanzheng stated, first and foremost, we should conscientiously implement "The CPC Central Committee Decision on Several Questions on Building a Socialist Market Economic Structure" and waste no time in pushing ahead with reform; second, we should strive to improve the productive forces layout and concentrate on successfully building such basic facilities as electrical energy, communications, telecommunications, water conservancy, and so on; third, we should strive to quicken both the pace of economic exploitation and the pace of inviting foreign funds and expanding opening up; fourth, we should strive to develop, more successfully and more rapidly, a high-yield, high-efficiency, and high-quality agriculture, township and town enterprises, and large and medium state-owned enterprises with an eye to bringing about rapid and highly efficient industrial growth; sixth, we should strive to carry out in-depth circulation system reform, open up more markets, invigorate circulation, and build a new market circulation system as well as a new market management system; seventh, we should strive to actively integrate science and technology into the economy and train a strong contingent of qualified personnel with a view to infusing the provincial economy with new vitality; and eighth, we should try to step up building spiritual civilization under the conditions of a socialist market economic structure and strive to create a favorable environment for reform, opening up, and economic construction. Wu Guanzheng concluded by stating: The work we are doing at the moment is aimed at promoting economic growth, improving people's livelihood, and pushing ahead with Jiangxi's comprehensive development. We should arm our minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; adhere to the party's basic line; unite as one; enhance cooperation; focus more on furthering in-depth reform; push ahead with economic construction; and make greater contributions to Jiangxi's overall development under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core!
