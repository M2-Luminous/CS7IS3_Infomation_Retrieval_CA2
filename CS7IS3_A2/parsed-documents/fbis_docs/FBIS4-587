He proposed a Government of National Unity [GNU], as we revealed in our edition last week. We would like to begin our round table asking the secretary general to give us more information on this proposal. [Ululu] The proposal made by President Dhlakama is aimed at obtaining national reconciliation. We want Mozambique to belong to all Mozambicans. We want unity, reconciliation, and the participation of all Mozambicans... [Mabunda] Those are the objectives that you have in mind. What I would like you to do is to explain what Renamo means by a Government of National Unity? [Ululu] I am getting there. The idea is to prevent one party from doing everything alone. We want a Government of National Unity where everyone will have a role to play. [Mabunda] In our edition last week we presented three possibilities for a GUN. One, where the majority party, Renamo or Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front], would be represented; two, a government involving all parties; and three, a government involving people from all ethnic groups in the country. To which of these three does Renamo subscribe? [Ululu] Well, our view is that there should be a GNU that brings together all Mozambicans, regardless of their religious beliefs or political ideologies. By doing this, we shall be eliminating the old thinking that this country only belongs to one party and cannot be governed by any other force. With the establishment of democracy in the country and for national reconciliation, we feel we should have a government of national unity. There are people who talk of federalism and so on. This means that there is an imbalance; others say that this or that group has no participation in the government. These gossips cause tensions and can bring about conflicts. [Mabunda] We still do not understand each other. Mr. Secretary General, give me a direct answer: for you, a government of national unity is one which brings together members of all parties or members of different ethnic groups? [Ululu] The proposal is the following: We shall have elections and the party that wins must not think that it won alone. It should not only appoint individuals from that party, but should also appoint other competent individuals from other parties. Monamo's Views [Mabunda] What does Monamo [Mozambique Nationalist Movement] understand by a government of national unity? [Dias] Monamo has a track record on the GNU or national reconciliation or the union of the Mozambican family. This record can therefore serve as a basis to explain this view. As early as 1986 Monamo, in its work entitled "Immediate Peace," and in the letters it wrote to the president of the republic and the president of Renamo, called for the establishment of multiparty democracy, immediate peace, the establishment of a transitional government for a minimum period of three or five years, but not longer, in order to prepare free and fair multiparty elections. Answering your question, this government would be made up mainly of Mozambique Liberation Front and Renamo elements; mainly Frelimo and Renamo elements because we were at war. This government would then be completed with the participation of other individuals with national prestige. Thus, a government which would have brought about peace between Frelimo and Renamo would make use of individuals with national prestige to establish a strong, nonauthoritarian government. This proposal was made in 1986 and it was a condition for immediate peace. During the protracted peace talks in Rome, Monamo once again insisted on the establishment of a transitional administration to organize the elections. This would eliminate mistrust and subsequent accusations of electoral fraud. The government and Renamo did not show any interest. Renamo preferred the system of two administrations: one belonging to the government and the other to Renamo in areas it controls militarily. Monamo held various contacts at political, economic, and social levels at both national and provincial levels. At a conference held at Rovuma Hotel in 1991, we came to the following conclusion: There is no party, neither Renamo that we knew reasonably well nor Frelimo, that we knew well and the entire people know well, that would be able to govern well. That included Monamo and other political parties. What would be the solution? After the signing of the General Peace Accord, after the holding of elections, it would not be possible for a single political force to present a good government and carry out a good public administration. Thus, we conveyed our views to various religious denominations, particularly the Catholic Church -- because even last Sunday during a mass, Cardinal Don Alexandre said "it is necessary that we choose a strong government, a government that gives orders and knows how to give orders." It will not be the elections that will bring about a strong government. Our people are not in a condition to choose a party that would offer better conditions. Our people are more concerned with their daily famine, they are not even interested in politics.... Now We Hear Voices Calling For GNU's Establishment [Mabunda] In brief, does Monamo favor establishing GNU? [Dias] Absolutely, but let me finish...what kind of GNU, that is the question you posed. As far as we are concerned, the country is almost ungovernable. The economy is out of state control, corruption has become increasingly more generalized. All this means that there is a need for establishing a GNU. The country is experiencing very serious difficulties, the number of individuals who are both competent and honest is very low, because of corruption. To establish a strong but nonauthoritarian government, there is a need to form a GNU that would make use of the available and effective political, economic, and social forces. Unfortunately, it is only now that we begin to hear authorized national and international forces advising establishing a GNU. It is better late than never. [Mabunda] I think we are still finding it difficult to define GNU. What does it mean for Monamo? [Dias] It means to obtain what is good and useful in Frelimo; what is good and useful in Renamo; and what is good and useful in other parties, representatives of social forces. There are people in trade unions, churches, students organizations, and company sectors that can be well utilized. Thus, we can form a government of consensus that would be free from destructive criticism, a government that would be supported by all. Not even Renamo would raise a finger. Let us suppose that Frelimo wins the elections, as it is claiming, and Renamo, Monamo, PCN [National Convention Party], other parties, and so on... we shall only try to find fault. If we participate in the government, however, we shall be equally blamed for its failures. We shall combine all our efforts. When there is no one who is strong, capable... you cannot tell me that Frelimo is capable because it has already proved that it is unable to govern. Likewise, you cannot tell me that Renamo is capable, because it is not.... [Mabunda] If I understand you correctly, Monamo favors establishing a GNU more than holding elections? [Dias] No, no. The transitional period has already passed. I do not think that the Renamo president wanted to postpone the elections. The Renamo representative is here.... To Realize People's Wishes [Mabunda] Mr. Ululu, a GNU before or after elections? [Ululu] What Dr. Maximo Dias is saying is very clear. We are about to hold elections. Elections are most important for people to have their choice. What we are saying, however, that a GNU is a government of harmony, where every Mozambican will be able to make his or her contribution to the country's reconstruction. There are two things that we need to see: There are party views, that is party ideologies, and party programs. When it comes to establishing a government, it is something else...those who take part in the government need not necessarily be party members, the government has to be formed by responsiblle and competent people to realize people's wishes. [Mabunda] Does the National Convention Party [PCN] want to speak before Frelimo? [Chire] Let Frelimo speak.... Elections Must be the Point of Departure [Ngwenha] For Frelimo, it is natural that people should try to find and study various ways of guaranteeing the success of the Mozambican peace process, which is so difficult and complex. Our first aim is to guarantee the consolidation of peace. We think that the fundamental instrument of this process is the General Peace Accord. Our main concern, therefore, is to guarantee that this accord is implemented. This does not necessarily mean that we are dogmatically refusing to hear views that could be useful for our country's future. The elections, the acceptance of democratic rules of the game, are in our view extremely important. That is why we could put the question this way: GNU before or after elections? The establishmentof a GNU would first of all naturally signify discouraging the peace process; it would signify renegotiating the General Peace Accord and we think that this would be the beginning of a lot of problems. We, therefore, think that the point of departure should be elections, despite all the difficulties, all the shortcomings that may ensue. Elections should be the point of departure -- the government that will be elected, the program that will be voted for. In Frelimo we make efforts to overcome our difficulties. We have always said that we examine our form of governing. We have experience, we know our mistakes, and perhaps it is because of this that we are at an advantageous position. Who makes mistakes must have be able to do better by learning from those mistakes, but the person who has not made a mistake, he still needs to learn. If you read the Frelimo Party sixth congress report, you will see what Frelimo says about the whole process. Thus, we guarantee that the program that we shall present to the electorate will be a program that will ensure peace, stability, and the normalization of the Mozambican people's life. This being the case, the issue of the formation of a national or coalition government depends mainly on the results of the elections. This issue cannot be viewed before the elections. We need to know the position of each party. We, the parties, cannot be the ones to decide on this issue. This would be dictatorship. What is the difference between this and dictatorship? We shall have to submit our legitimacy to the electorate. We must hold elections so that we can know who is who and the elected party will have the responsibility to maintain a machinery that guarantees peace, stability, and the government operations. In conclusion, I would like to ask those who defend a GNU the following question: Where in the world has GNU been successful? What is its justification? Dr. Maximo Dias said Frelimo cannot govern... it is not a permanent position... I even look at myself and say: What do I have to do with that? I think that we cannot see things that way, in the negative way. If we want to obtain positive justifications for establishing a GNU, it would be more advisable to see what is positive in parties, that can unite us.... GNU After Elections [Mabunda] Is the PCN in favor or against a GNU? [Chire] It is obvious that the PCN favors a GNU. From the understanding that we have of the country, we think it would be extremely dangerous for the country if we failed to establish a GNU. It should be clear that we support a GNU after the elections. All the same, we think this issue can be discussed now, despite the Frelimo representative's feelings that the most important thing is to guarantee the implementation of the General Peace Accord [AGP]. We cannot postpone the discussion of important issues because we are apparently going against the AGP. In any case, the accord is not being fully implemented. It is being constantly violated by the parties. The first timetable was not implemented and the second one is not being fully implemented. We should therefore be more moderate and reflective when we speak of the AGP's implementation. The Frelimo representative said that in the coming elections, the people will vote for a program. I do not think it is true that the people will vote for programs, because they have not even been able to digest the meaning of a multiparty system. Most of our people are not even aware that there is a multiparty system in the country. They do not know the meaning of a political party, party program, or voting. The people will vote into power the party with most resources, the party that will be able to reach the most areas, the party that will be able to maintain control over a specific part of the population. The Frelimo Government will try to maintain control over areas that have always been under its control, and Renamo will do the same. Let us not speak of programs. We are in a country where most of our people are peasants and are not in a position to know the meaning of party programs. That is why, we propose a government.... We should convene a meeting on this issue. This meeting should be attended by parties, churches, and organizations. We would obtain different ideas and proposals and come up with an agreement. We are now defining the meaning of GNU. Is that necessary or not? The thing is that even if the parties reach an agreement on the issue, the final decision lies with the ruling party. If it decides that there should be no debate on the issue, then there will be no debate. We are not respecting the rules of the democratic game, which always try to seek a constant consensus. No matter how right we may think we are, we must always seek a consensus. There are countries which have adopted the system of a minimum percentage. Let us say, for example, that the minimum percentage is set at 25 percent, the party that obtains over 25 percent should be able to have a vice president in the government. A party that obtains over 15 percent should be able to have a minister. These are just examples. Everything could be defined accordingly.... [Mabunda] As is the case in South Africa.... [Chire] Exactly. [Mabunda] It seems there is an agreement.... [Ngwenha] There is no agreement.... [Mabunda] For those who support a GNU there is an agreement that this is only possible after elections.... The Opposition Does Not Always Understand What We Are Saying [Ngwenha] Yes, there is an issue that I would like to stress. It is sometimes difficult to work with the opposition. There is a tendency not to understand what is being said and this will not help matters. It is not true that I said we should postpone the discussion of important problems facing the country. It would be unbelievable for a ruling party like ours, with its responsibilities, to say that we must postpone the discussion of important matters. I would like to point out in clear terms: We accept the discussion of important problems facing the country. It must not be said that Frelimo refuses to discuss important problems facing our country. It is normal for one to speculate and say that one does not believe in this or that, but we must have more objective criteria. It is not just enough to form a party and claim to speak in the name of the people. Simply doing that does not mean that a party is truly legitimate and represents the people. There is a need for more objective, more acceptable criteria. I think that is the advantage of democracy, which is mankind's major achievement. It is only through elections that matters can be defined. The elected government has the responsibility to guarantee peace, stability, and a national balance -- which could include reconciliation and a broader government concept, provided it works. For this, it is necessary that the parties discuss their programs, find how their views coincide and differ, try to bring their positions closer. [Chire] I would like to clarify to Dr. Ngwenha that I did not say that he said that we should postpone the discussion of the issue. I said that in my view, while it is important to see that the AGP is implemented, we should not postpone the discussion of important issues. Why Only Now? [Mabunda] There is an issue that was raised by the Frelimo representative. Dr. Ngwenha said the important thing is to implement the AGP. On the basis of this, I would like to ask a different question: Why is Renamo only now coming up with the establishment of a GNU, Mr. Vicente Ululu? [Ululu] What is taking place in Mozambique now is the process of evolution. When we discussed the AGP in Rome, we did not reach agreement on every issue. If we were to discuss everything in detail, we would have spent years and years, and bloodsuckers -- forgive my expression -- would have benefited from the situation. When we raised certain questions about the Constitution, people began to say we did not want peace. They said the Constitution cannot be discussed, but it is fundamental for the Mozambican people. Thus, it was not discussed, but there are many things in the Constitution that can be questioned, as Dr. Maximo Dias has pointed out. The parties agreed that there were two administrations in the country. To answer your question, the issue is being raised now because of the process of evolution in the country... Answering the Evolution [Mabunda] What developed exactly between the signing of the AGP and now? [Ululu] I think many things coincided. When the issue of state administration came up, the president of the Republic and President Dhlakama met and agreed on the way elections should be conducted. There were undoubtedly two zones controlled by the rival parties. As part of the implementation of the accord, the parties agreed that those zones should be integrated. This was a development, because two administrations were recognized in Rome. Today we speak of GNU because we think that Mozambicans can live together. [Mabunda] Let us assume the PCN won elections in Mozambique. Would it not like to rule alone? [Chire] Not during this phase. We believe that the resolution of the problems facing the country entail the participation of many more people than those who are in the PCN. [Mabunda] In any case, the PCN would have a program in different fields. Would it appoint a Renamo minister to implement the PCN program? How would this function? [Chire] Mozambique would not be the first country in the world with ministers from different parties. I know the difficulty that exists in understanding certain things, because we lack democratic experience. We have to understand things in a different way because in democracy, it is normal to find elements from other parties in the government. The PCN has a program, but it would invite in members from other parties. It would negotiate its program with other parties, in the country's interest. If we establish a GNU, I believe the government will have greater trust from the international community. [Mabunda] What does Monamo have to say about this? [Dias] Normally, when people speak of a GNU, it is because there is a very serious social, economic, and political crisis in the country. It is because the country has become ungovernable, in a multiparty system. This is the reason, I believe, why the Renamo president (he now understands the country's reality) thought a GNU was fundamental for the country. To speak of a GNU in terms of power sharing is completely wrong. It will not work. In the present chaotic conditions of the country, a GNU can work. When there is a public administration crisis, the government does not govern, politicians do not assume their responsibilities, our police do not work, nothing works. It is not the fault of the party in power, but it is because of the total chaotic situation in the country. That is why those who support a GNU say that we have to sacrifice our party ambitions in the supreme interest of the nation. To participate in a GNU means to sacrifice one's political program. It means to sacrifice one's strategy for power. Thus, if we are selfish, we shall say let Frelimo or Renamo govern alone. We know however that no one would be able to govern alone and it will be our people who will suffer. We have had enough of experiments, and that is why even Renamo supports a GNU. I do not believe that those who support a GNU do so in order to share power. Monamo supports a GNU, but the aim is not to share power. It was agreed here that when we speak of a GNU, we mean after elections. The PCN proposed here that all parties, regardless of their party programs, should hold a meeting to come up with a consensus on the establishment of a GNU. To sum up, there are two reasons that lead us to support a GNU: In a serious economic situation, in a serious social situation... it is not enough for Renamo President to say that he will not return to the bush. Savimbi also said that. It is not enough for Joaquim Chissano to say there will not be another war. Wars are not avoided just because people say there will be no war. The war results from circumstances on the ground....There could be a madman in Renamo, a madman in Frelimo, a soldier who will say: We have not lost the elections, let us fight -- and shots could begin and never stop again. This can be avoided if there is a agreement before the elections that whether Frelimo wins or Renamo wins, there will be no problems. We shall have a government in which everyone participates, because of the serious economic situation in the country. This government can be established on the basis of different criteria: percentages, as was pointed out here by the PCN president [as published], but for me, percentages are not very significant. The elections are not 100 percent democratic, because our people are not fully politically aware and do not know all the parties existing in the country. We should not forget that 80 percent of our population is illiterate and has no access to radio. Thus, when we argue for a GNU, it is because the situation is serious.... [Mabunda] Would the representative of the Frelimo Party care to comment? [Ngwenha] My comment is as follows: I cannot stress enough that it is fundamental that the principal points in the accord be complied with. I believe that such compliance must arise from the political will of the various sides. We are still faced with the problems of demobilization, administration of certain areas, and the implementation of all other measures which can guarantee a small margin for errors during the elections. Important though it may be, that matter of striving for a government that is effective and that can settle the serious problems facing our country is no justification for entering into compromises before the time: that could be a strategy for each party to follow. For instance, should it win the upcoming elections, Monamo's strategy will be to form a government of national unity. That is Monamo's strategy. Should Renamo think along the same lines, that will be Renamo's strategy, but it is our belief that there is the need to respect the electorate's wishes. There are people who will vote for Renamo so that Frelimo is removed from power. We cannot tell our electorate: vote for whom you please, but be sure to know that such and such people will be in power, irrespective of the result. It is important that we accept the rules of democracy from the beginning and that we stop humiliating our people, saying they know about this but not about something else. Such humiliation I can accept when it comes from outside, but when it comes from Mozambican people...such exaggerations can reflect a certain ignorance about our people's abilities. We are going to do things, and the people will show what they want when elections come up and prove whether they can or cannot vote. I would also like to say the following: we have often heard people say that Angola's events must not be repeated here. I do not know what was repeated or what should not be repeated in Angola. What is happening in that country is that the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, is not abiding by the rules of the game. Now, in Mozammbique, who is it that does not want to accept the outcome of elections? Is there a political will to accept elections? This has to be the starting point and the rest is compromise. The type of government that we will have in the future must reflect the people's wishes. Then, we can enter into compromises. Frelimo will be entering into compromises with Monamo and the PCN depending, of course, on the outcome of elections... [Ululu] Pardon me, but there are some things...namely, who is going to participate in the government after elections have been held. Dr. Ngwenha has said that the people may feel humiliated if they see a Frelimo official participating in a government run by some other party...now, here we are talking about seriousness and complete respect for the government of this country. As Mr. Maximo Dias has indicated, the country is staring bankruptcy in the face, experiencing an economic crisis, there is social instability, and the police are incompetent...I have been very clear in saying that when we go to elections, it is not the party but the person who wants harmony in the country who should participate. It makes no sense that Mr. Ngwenha should feel humiliated if Renamo wins the elections and appoints him as head of some department. This is a matter of rescuing the country from its misery.... [Mabunda] There is one problem here and I am going to touch on it again because I feel that it needs to be clarified. Let us suppose that Renamo wins the upcoming elections and that it invites Dr. Ngwenha, of the Frelimo Party, to implement Renamo's program in the area of education. What if Dr. Ngwenha fails to agree with that program? [Ululu] There are other Mozambican people, there are many other Mozambicans.... [Ngwenha] I would like to ask: This man Ngwenha has had no votes, is on the sidelines, but Renamo selects him. Ngwenha competed but received no votes.... [Ululu] He can be selected.... [Ngwenha] But, by doing so, you would be violating some rules.... [Ululu] In this particular context, such a thing would be no violation in a democracy. Dr. Ngwenha has just said that there is some difficulty in working with the opposition. That is why it is called democracy: it is indeed very difficult to work with the opposition because it will oppose those government plans that it deems to be incorrect.... [Chire] Naturally, I understand Frelimo's position. It is the ruling party, it makes an apparent change for transition and for democracy, and it creates a situation in which it continues to control everything and it believes it can win the upcoming elections. I think it is understandable that the Frelimo Party should think it will win the elections. Dr. Ngwenha has talked about political will, but Frelimo neither has now nor has ever had the political will to change. We have not seen Frelimo show any willingness to change, or any tendency to change.... [Ngwenha] But what is the direction of change? [Chire] I shall answer that right now. I think that Dr. Ngwenha, as a politican, knows that there is a set of prerequisites that have not been met in Mozambique.... [Ngwenha] In concrete terms, what prerequisites are those? [Chire] Now, you are becoming a journalist.... [Ngwenha] No, I would just like to know!.... [Chire] Let me tell you...because like this you are breaking down my reasoning. I get very confused and we will end up without dialogue...I do not believe that conditions have been created in this country for a transition to a democratic society. This is what happened: a cease-fire accord was signed, it was written in the Constitution that there is democracy as of today, a number of laws were approved and they will apparently be good for a democratic society, but those laws have not been implemented. The government has done nothing to prepare society for that transition but you, the Frelimo Party representative, are here telling us that the people know whom they are going to elect. The people do not know what is happening and are poorly informed. Those people who have said for many years that they were the only ones, and that they were the best, continue to say so today. That is not democratic behavior. Democratic behavior is to say that there are a number of parties, that each party has its own program, that our program is as follows, and to give others the opportunity to present their plans. To this day, all one hears is about Frelimo and Renamo...now, what programs will the people choose? Conditions are not in place yet for a democracy....
