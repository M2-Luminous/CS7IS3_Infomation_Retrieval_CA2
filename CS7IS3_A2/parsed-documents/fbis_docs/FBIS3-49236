The Serb civilians reached the territory of the Bosnian serb republic (RS) sometime in the afternoon. The RS authorities in cooperation with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will take charge of them. RS government representative Branko Djokic who took part in the talks with the Moslems arranging for the Serbs' departure from Zenica said after the talks that the Moslems had expressed readiness to allow some 1,300 Serbs leaving Vitez, Novi Travnik and other central Bosnian cities under Bosnian Croat control to pass over their territory. The possibility of a meeting of representatives of all three warring sides in connection with this was also mentioned. A civil, ethnic and religious war has been raging in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina since April 1992 between the local Moslems, Serbs (Orthodox) and Croats (Catholic) in response to the Moslem leadership's efforts to turn Bosnia into a Moslem-dominated unitary state.
