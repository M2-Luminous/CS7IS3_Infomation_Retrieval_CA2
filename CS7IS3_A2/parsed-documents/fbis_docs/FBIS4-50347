He was convinced that a satisfactory settlement for restoration of China's status as a signatory to GATT would be eventually made. The GATT chief said that he hoped this day would not be too far away. Mr. Sutherland made the remarks in a joint press conference with the Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and head of the negotiation group on restoration of China to GATT Mr. Gu Yongjiang. Earlier, the GATT chief when delivering a speech in an international seminar held here expressed his support for resumption of China's status in the world trade organization. He made the commitment in his capacity as the head of GATT and said that the secretariat of the world trade body would try its best to achieve this end. Following the final accord on the Uruguay round talk was signed, talks on China's restoration to GATT and its status in the world's multilateral trade system entered into a crucial stage. Should China have to complete the process for its restoration to GATT by the end of this year, a substantive accord would have to be reached by this summer. [paragraph as received] Mr. Sutherland was convinced that the progress was quite positive for China to move toward the resumption of its status in GATT. He stressed, however, that it was rather difficult to complete the process within a limited period of time which needed much more flexibility for a solution to existing problems. [sentence as received] The GATT official pointed out that he was impressed by the positive attitude shown by China in its determination to return to the world trade body. He went further, saying that China's foreign trade law approved at home was considered a positive factor for resumption of China's place in GATT. He stressed that the world trade system had to be one that has rules to be abided by. He appealed to developed countries for the overcoming of a trend for trade protectionism and to developing countries for quick opening to the outside world for trade.
