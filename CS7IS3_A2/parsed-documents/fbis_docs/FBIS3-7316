The proposals were made in an interim report compiled by a disclosure study group under the Financial System Research Council, an advisory panel to the finance minister. The report calls on financial institutions to improve their disclosure periodicals, featuring recommendations to start disclosing operational results at securities and trust banking subsidiaries and to upgrade explanations of risk managements. A Finance Ministry official, briefing reporters, said the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan is to revise its disclosure standard based on the report for its members that virtually covers all private banks in Japan. It will start with their business results for the current fiscal year ending March 31, the official said. Under the banking law, private banks are required to publish the disclosure periodicals every year, and they follow the standard decided by the federation. While urging further improvements in disclosing information on subsidiaries on a consolidated basis by parent banks, the report stresses the need for securities and trust banking subsidiaries to offer their own operational results. "The significance of disclosure (at such subsidiaries) is great because of their importance in management strategy (of parent banks) and their large scale (compared with other subsidiaries) and operational divergence with the parent financial institutions," the report says. Banks were allowed to enter securities and trust banking businesses through subsidiaries in April last year under financial system reform. The Finance Ministry official said disclosure at those subsidiaries will include earnings and assets. But the recommendations are limited to domestic subsidiaries, and the report leaves disclosure of overseas subsidiaries for further study due to "diverse business fields and scale." On risk management, financial institutions are urged to make "easy-to-understand explanations" of their strategies and systems on interest rate, credit and other risks, thus upgrading from the current disclosure limited to their awareness of risks and management of assets and liabilities. But the report calls for further study on implementation of a numerical measurement of risks while closely following the effects of "explanatory disclosure" and the ongoing international discussions on such risk-management benchmarks. The ministry official said the panel will set up a working group on the issue. Meanwhile, the report urges banks to make the disclosure periodicals more "convenient and easy to understand" since they are offered primarily to depositors at branch offices.
