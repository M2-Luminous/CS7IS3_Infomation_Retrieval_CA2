FBIS4-2059 "drchi066_v_94006" FBIS-CHI-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 TAIWAN Information Products `Backbone' of Export Business Information Products `Backbone' of Export Business OW0504141994 Taipei CNA in English 1311 GMT 5 Apr 94 OW0504141994 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Flor Wang] [Text] Taipei, April 5 (CNA) -- Thanks to its outstanding export performance in recent years, the information industry has overtaken the electronics industry to become the backbone of Taiwan's export business, sources said here Tuesday [5 April]. Taiwan's info product exports totaled nearly U.S.$10 bill on last year, and the figure is expected to climb by 15 percent this year, the semi official Information Industry Institute said, adding that Taiwan is already the world's No. 1 producer of several info products such as monitors and motherboards. In contrast to the booming information industry, the once flourishing electronics industry experienced a big decline in exports last year. Statistics made public by the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) show that exports of consumer electronics products dropped by 16.9 percent last year from 1992 to U.S.$1.29 billion, with items such as electronic clocks and watches, audio-visual equipment, video games, and calculators posting the biggest falls. However, imports of those items in 1993 surged by 5.7 percent from a year ago to more than U.S.$1 billion, indicating that the industrial upgrading by local manufacturers has fallen short of the public's expectations, and that fierce competition from Southeast Asian countries has strained the market, an ITRI official said. He said many local manufacturers of traditional, low-end electronics products have been forced to relocate their production sites overseas to cut down on costs, which is the main factor behind the continuous decline in exports of those items by Taiwan makers. The manufacturers who have chosen to stay in Taiwan, he said, must start producing more value-added products in order to survive, and need to spend more money on software development rather than simply acting as manufacturers for foreign buyers.
