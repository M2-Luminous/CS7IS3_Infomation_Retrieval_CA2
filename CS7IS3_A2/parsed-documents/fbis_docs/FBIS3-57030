In an interview with Interfax news agency on Sunday, he gave a highly negative response to the outcome of the Geneva talks between Georgia and Abkhazia including the problem of Georgian refugees. In his view, Russia cannot act as mediator because of Moscow's role in the conflict leading to the loss of Abkhazia. Chairman of the national security and defence commission Nodar Natadze was likewise sceptical about the Geneva talks. The deployment of Russian troops along the Inguri river separating Georgia and Abkhazia as asked by the negotiating teams will prevent Georgians from crossing it and turn Abkhazia's Georgian population into slaves or hostages, he told Interfax. Natadze says, "if Russia is really keen to see Georgia as a stable and integral state, it ought to deploy troops not along the Inguri but Psou river on Russia's border with Abkhazia".
