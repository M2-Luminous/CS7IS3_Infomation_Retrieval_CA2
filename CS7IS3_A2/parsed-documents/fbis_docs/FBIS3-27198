Such deeds on the British side infringed on the interests of Hong Kong residents and creates an economic burden for Hong Kong's future administration, said Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, after attending a spring festival cocktail reception held here Thursday [17 February]. He called on local residents to heighten their vigilance on this matter. He pointed out that the aim of the British side in its financing arrangements for the new Hong Kong airport is to spend money to the maximum extent and shift debts onto the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). According to the Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on the Construction of the New Airport in Hong Kong [HK], the total amount of debt on the ten airport core projects to be repaid after June 30, 1997 should not exceed five billion. However, Zhu said, the British side has tried every possible means to outgrow this limit in a bid to leave a big burden for the future SAR government. The fourth financial plan put forward by the British side still aims at imposing a debt of 23 billion HK dollars (2.9 billion U.S. dollars) on the future SAR government. Zhu said that it is not convincing for the Hong Kong Government to describe the debt borrowed by the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) on the airport construction as non-government debt. The above-mentioned two units are government-funded and the Hong Kong Government serves as the sole shareholder of these two units. Therefore, the Hong Kong Government is, of course, responsible for the refunding of the debt, the deputy director said.
