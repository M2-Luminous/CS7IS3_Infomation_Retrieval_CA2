He told so in the Senate last night. The Senate ratified the framework treaty, which strengthens the ties between the Netherlands and Suriname in the fields of legal, military, diplomatic, cultural, and aid policies. However, Pronk demands from the Suriname Government that a Structural Adjustment Program be implemented shortly. As far as the verification procedures are concerned, the minister says that they can be discussed with Suriname. Pronk also says that the restoration of the balance of payments aid which was suspended by the Netherlands in June last year without any prior consultation, can only be considered if an international financial institution supervises Suriname's progress with the Adjustment Program. Pronk hopes that he can still reach an agreement with Suriname on the increase of aid before the elections. [passage omitted]
