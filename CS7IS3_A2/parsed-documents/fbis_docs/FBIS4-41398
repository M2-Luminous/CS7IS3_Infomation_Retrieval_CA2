Kovalev, chairman of the Russian Federation president's Human Rights Commission, has sent a letter to B. Yeltsin regarding his edict "On Urgent Measures To Protect the Population From Banditry and Other Manifestations of Organized Crime." It is obvious to us, S. Kovalev writes, that it is necessary to step up the fight against crime, the growth in which is naturally of concern to all sectors of Russian society. The work of law-enforcement organs, which are meant to conduct this fight within the framework of existing legislation, needs radical improvement. Needless to say, the possibility of improving their work is not ruled out. The tragic experience of Russia, S. Kovalev stressed, shows that citizens' safety cannot be protected by violating the basic rights and freedoms enshrined in Chapter 2 of the Russian Constitution. It is no accident that Articles 64 and 135 of the Constitution envisage a special procedure for making changes to this chapter. The conflicts with the norms of existing criminal procedural legislation and the legally vague formulas used in the edict create a possibility of its being interpreted as broadly as people like, S. Kovalev believes, and he voices the fear that implementation of the edict would be accompanied by arbitrary actions by law-enforcement departments -- unjustified arrests, interference in citizens' private and economic activities, and a growth in corruption among officials. This, in particular, is confirmed by reports from the Republic of Bashkortostan and Tatarstan, where similar acts of legislation are already in force. Under the Constitution, the letter goes on to say, you, as Russian president, are the guarantor of the rights and freedoms of the individual and the citizen. We are confident that you do not share the concept espoused by certain leaders of power structures who think that the rights of some citizens can be protected by violating the rights of others. This approach shows that we have still not learned the lessons of our own past. The edict you have signed is also dangerous because, by pursuing short-term political advantage, it essentially undermines respect for the law and faith in the stability of the recently adopted Constitution. The letter concludes with a request from the Human Rights Commission for B. Yeltsin to suspend Edict No. 1226 of 14 June 1994.
