FBIS4-29355 "dreas117_a_94023" FBIS-EAS-94-117 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Coalition `Lost Credibility' Coalition `Lost Credibility' OW1706131794 Tokyo KYODO in English 1303 GMT 17 Jun 94 OW1706131794 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- The largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) decided Friday [17 June] to propose a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata as soon as the 1994 budget passes the Diet, party sources said. The 73.08 trillion yen budget was approved by the House of Representatives on June 8 and is expected to clear the House of Councillors during the current session ending June 29. LDP President Yohei Kono wants to meet at an early stage with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan], and Masayoshi Takemura, head of New Party Sakigake (harbinger), to ask for cooperation on the planned no-confidence motion, they said. Hata is not deserving of confidence, the sources said, because his minority government does not represent the will of the people. The LDP also criticizes the ruling coalition for having lost credibility in international society as well by its reluctance to uncover the facts about questionable financial deals by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the sources said. If a no-confidence motion is approved by the Diet, Hata must either have his cabinet resign en masse or dissolve the lower house for a general election. LDP secretary general Yoshiro Mori, speaking at the party's headquarters Friday, said the budget is likely to be approved in the latter half of next week and the political situation will be "busy" thereafter. Some powerful LDP figures, including former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe and former Transport Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, have insisted that "conservative" forces in the LDP should ally with those in the coalition government rather than seek cooperation with the SDP. Former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu also reiterated at a press conference in Asahikawa, Hokkaido, on Friday that the LDP should not immediately propose a no-confidence motion. However, the party made the decision to submit a no-confidence motion because it became more convinced that the SDP would cooperate, LDP sources said. On Thursday, the LDP and the SDP cooperated to force a motion through the lower house budget panel summoning Hosokawa to testify next Tuesday under oath about his questionable personal finances, over which he was forced to resign in April. Meanwhile, Yuichi Ichikawa, a major coalition government strategist, said Friday he will urge the SDP next week to come back into the ruling camp. Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, a Buddhist-backed party in the ruling coalition, told reporters in Makubetsu, Hokkaido, that he wants to represent the ruling parties and meet SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo as early as the middle of next week to "exchange opinions frankly." The SDP seceded from the coalition in April shortly after other ruling parties formed a lower house parliamentary group, "Kaishin," without consulting with the SDP. Sakigake leader Takemura met some LDP members Friday and expressed a positive view on alliance with the LDP, political sources said. Takemura has also been eager to cooperate with the SDP, they said. A high-ranking SDP official said Friday Hata's cabinet must resign en masse before the SDP will return to the ruling camp. The official suggested the party may allow Hata to be prime minister again once a new cabinet is formed after his resignation.
