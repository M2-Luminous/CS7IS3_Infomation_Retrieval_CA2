His ideal is not the Iron Lady, Mrs. Thatcher. Neither is it the former U.S. president, Ronald Reagan. On the contrary, he is convinced that efficiency and solidarity are not antithetical. Mario Segni is not giving up, because he sees plenty of room for a political force in opposition to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. [Biello] Well Deputy Segni, the progressive front has found its identity. Where are the "Pactists" looking? [Segni] The current objective is to create a liberal-democratic and reformist group, an alternative to the PDS's leftist group. Therefore, I launched the Pact for National Rebirth, asking citizens for a million signatures. I explained the key points of my program clearly: those who agree with them can join the pact. I will never agree to place national unity in discussion, just as I have already said that the MSI [Italian Social Movement] or National Alliance is not an alternative to the PDS. [Biello] Let us go to the economic program. What will you do about the budget? [Segni] Spending must be reduced, but this does not mean destroying the social state. For many years it was said that efficiency and solidarity are irreconcilable; well, I want to build a state that is able to guarantee both requirements. For example, the South still needs assistance, but productive assistance, not welfare. [Biello] Quite a challenge. Unless you are thinking about raising taxes. [Segni] The tax burden absolutely cannot be increased, and I have proposed setting a 40 percent ceiling on rates. The obstacles that make the tax system a hindrance to development must be removed. And decentralization is needed that will give local administrations the means to govern. [Biello] And the labor emergency? [Segni] We must provide greater flexibility to the labor market, especially to facilitate entry into it, aside from eventual temporary departures. And we must invest in human capital.
