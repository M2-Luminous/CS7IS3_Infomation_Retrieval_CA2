Does this in your view as a professional correspond with reality and how does the Security Service feel in the present situation in Crimea? [Marchuk] In spite of the atmosphere there in this episode in particular and that surrounding the service -- the former security service of Crimea -- in general, the people we are working with are high-standard professionals, rather than (?hysterical) nervous wrecks, which is why situations like this, as they say, do not make us feel at a loss. To date, the National Security Service of Ukraine has fulfilled the requirements of Ukrainian President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk's directive of 18 May on reforming the Crimean security service and setting up on the basis of that service the Security Service of Ukraine Main Directorate in Crimea. The president in this particular case exercised his constitutional right. In accordance with Article 114.5, the president as a guarantor of the Constitution, territorial integrity, and national security, has the right to reorganize -- I would like to emphasize that this is exactly what that article in the Constitution points out -- to create, reorganize, and disband various executive power establishments such as ministries, departments, and so on. The security service is a branch of executive power and it is exactly on the basis of those requirements in that article of the Constitution that the reorganization was carried out. What does it mean? It means that a Security Service of Ukraine subdivision is in action in Crimea. It functional duties, structure, and numerical strength, however, have not been altered. I, incidentally, informed Crimean President Meshkov about this in writing in a telegram. And secondly... [Correspondent] As for -- I beg your pardon -- as for the accusations that the Security Service of Ukraine and its subdivisions in Crimea are now pursuing an anti-Crimean policy and engaging in anti-Crimean activities, can you respond to these accusations and can you say if they conform to reality? [Marchuk] This, as they say, is a preplanned misinformation because, as I have already said, neither the functional duties nor the structure or the numerical strength of this subdivision have been changed. And the priority tasks of this subdivision remain as they were before: to combat corruption, organized crime, protect the economy, and protect civil peace in Crimea. However, at present, unfortunately, by virtue of the circumstances which are now taking place in Crimea we had to slightly shift emphasis and give priority to carrying out the work which is necessary to ensure civil peace and ease tensions in society. And, without fail, one of our principal tasks is to provide the bodies of power with information... [Correspondent] By the way, I would like to ask you how does the Security Service build relations with the local administration? [Marchuk] ...today -- I have not completed the sentence -- to provide the bodies of power with information about the most vital problems of Crimea, as, by the way, is the case with all our territorial subdivisions. In this respect we changed nothing. As we were providing information before, the Main Directorate of the Ukrainian Security Service in Crimea now informs the leading bodies of Crimea in writing, both the president and the Supreme Council, about issues which, even at a local level, the issues which are of vital importance for Crimea. Two written reports of this kind have been made today. In all, a few reports have been made in the last few days since 18 May when the status of the [Crimean] security service was changed and it was reorganized. Because there is a very large number of various insinuations, I would like to emphasize and to some extent explain why the president of Ukraine took that decision. You know that a decision of that kind was also taken in relation to Internal Affairs Ministry structures, but I would only like to speak on the security service. The thing is that the Crimean leadership made two attempts, unilaterally and without any coordination with Kiev. The first one was the attempt to give the chair of the head of the Security Service of Crimea to a former or retired military general who had been chief of staff of the XXXII Army Corps. But in compliance with our law, the security service of Crimea, as all territorial bodies, is a constituent part of the single security system, which is, by the way, the case with all countries, even federative ones. Then the second attempt. [Correspondent] A relevant militarization, so to say, of the power-wielding structures. Am I right? [Marchuk] Yes, you are right. To be more precise and to compare the two actions, the first one being the appointment of the former commander of the XXXII Army Corps minister of internal affairs by the president of Crimea and then by the Supreme Council [of Crimea], and then the attempts to give, as I have already said, the chair of the chief of the Security Service of Ukraine to the former chief of staff of this XXXII Army Corps; that is to say, he is also a former military general. And it became clear that the leadership of Crimea was embarking on the road of militarization of the power-wielding structures; that is, these former, retired generals, as it had probably been planned, were supposed to establish order in Crimea. You can understand what it means when generals in retirement establish order on such a small territory as the Crimean autonomous region. No great deal of forecasting need be made here, as they say, because it is already known what kind of heroic deeds have now been undertaken by the internal affairs minister as a result of his unprofessional actions, which he himself, incidentally, admitted saying that he was not a professional (?in that field). [Correspondent] Once we have started disproving rumors and some unverified information, can you refute reports by some of the media on spetsnaz troops being deployed in Crimea, on bringing National Guard units to full combat alert, and so on, as the list is endless? And incidentally, as a professional, what in your view are these allegations aimed at? [Marchuk] Before I answer this question I would like to underline, and I want all citizens of Ukraine to know this, first and foremost those who reside in Crimea: The Security Service of Ukraine as a whole and all its subdivisions and the Main Directorate of the Security Service in Crimea -- I am saying this with absolute responsibility and officially -- is one of the factors of stabilization of the situation in Crimea. I have already said that we had to do and we now have to do much, even here in Kiev, so as to neutralize and alleviate the situation in Crimea. I will provide the following example. Quite often I speak with various Crimean leaders, including president Meshkov, and so on. But most often I have to talk with the Black Sea Fleet commander Eduard Dmytrievich Baltin, because you understand that such a gigantic military structure is stationed there and the situation in Crimea will very much depend on how it behaves. During one of our conversations he complained: Yevgeniy Kirilovich, you understand, how should I, as a serviceman, as the one responsible for the fleet, perceive this, for example, report that in the vicinity of some village in Kherson Oblast a hospital is being deployed to receive those wounded by shrapnel, that in the vicinity of some village in Odessa oblast a hospital is being deployed, allegedly the hospital of the Odessa military district is being deployed according to a war-time scale, that attacks are being prepared against the Black Sea Fleet riverine brigade's ships in Izmail. It took me no more than 20 minutes to immediately give the task to our directorates in Odessa and Kherson and to the military counter-intelligence and then to contact the minister of defense, Radetskyy, to clear up in 20 minutes that this is an outright lie -- excuse me for this word. But someone is bringing it to the knowledge of the Black Sea Fleet commander. Incidentally, you and we are in a way colleagues in that, being professionals, both you and we operate primarily on the basis of information. It seems to me, however, that that information has a somewhat specific character and just a journalist without a prompt from a specialist would simply not be able to present or invent it. This is someone being used as a mouthpiece and the mass media have spread this misinformation with a particular aim. But what is this aim, (?I would like to ask)? After that conversation with Baltin, tension was eased, as it were. I, by the way, had some information too. [Correspondent] As a challenge? [Marchuk] As a challenge. I had some information about a plane from Moscow, incidentally with a spetsnaz group on board too, flying towards one of his airfields. As officials, I trust Baltin and he trusts me. We may withhold something from each other but I do not think we could tell untruths. At least I do not do this. So literally within 20 to 30 minutes we disposed of much of the information that was causing tension. Some two-and-a-half to three hours later, however, with a map and a sound accompaniment on top of it all, and I am told by our staff in Crimea about whom this all benefits and who presents this information this way. From the point of view of a professional, all this, unfortunately, is very simple: All this is qualified as information of a purposeful nature, popularly known as misinformation or, in even simpler terms, a lie. It is presented, however, at a certain moment in time, in a certain way and on a certain territory in order to -- it is aimed at something after all -- to cause tension, intimidate, for example, the Crimean leadership by saying: "You see what is happening" and push someone towards some careless or even, forgive me, hysterical actions. However, unfortunately, those who were organizing this so-called help to Crimea, those who thought they were helping it, they did grave harm to Crimea. Very many applications from other countries have been withdrawn by today. I do not know exactly how many. [Correspondent] Up to 15,000 according to information available to me. [Marchuk] I believe the losses suffered by Crimea will amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions due to this very information. It was spread all over the world. It was spread all over the CIS countries. We already know that foreign companies from the CIS countries cancelled many routes and tours. So as they say, it was quite excessive, ostensibly endeavoring to achieve a noble goal but at the same time, I think, harming Crimea primarily by creating an atmosphere of quite serious tension, if not a panic, and, secondly, frightening off the people whose stay there could have generated some revenues to the local budget. [Correspondent] That is, to the detriment of their own? [Marchuk] Mainly to the detriment of Crimea, rather than that of their own as they are not in Crimea. I think that there is a way out of it after all but everyone should cool down, as they say, and realize it is they themselves who are responsible for their decisions.
