This is now a question worth asking after Friday's [13 May] visit of Beijing Mayor Li Quiyan in Paris, which resulted in various companies announcing partnership agreements. Manufacturers had been calling insistently for improved bilateral relations, whose past acrimony had slowed the progression of trade agreements and investment in China. The positive impact of Edouard Balladur's trip to China in early April had been rather overshadowed by internal policy disputes triggered by the various arrests of dissidents in Beijing. People soon seemed to ignore the trip's actual goal: To put an end to the crisis following the sale of aircraft to Taiwan and to restore relations between Paris and Beijing. However, in a few weeks' time, French companies have managed to successfully expand their activities in China. GEC Alsthom, which was defeated in the competition for the Canton subway, announced yesterday that it had signed a letter of intent for the creation of a joint venture near Beijing which will manufacture steam turbines and alternators for nuclear plants. As for Lafarge-Coppee, it is tackling the Chinese cement market (350 million tonnes per year and a 10-percent growth rate). It signed an agreement with the Beijing city authorities involving the establishment of a joint venture. Later this year, Carnaud-Metalbox will begin with the construction of a plant for beverage cans capable of producing 500 million cans per year to meet the demand of local and international brewers. "Diplomatic relations between France and China have improved greatly following the visit of the prime minister," the company says. "This undoubtedly helped us win this contract, which is worth almost Fr200 million. But one must also mention the years of talks, meetings, trips, and negotiations." There is action on the agro-food market as well. On Wednesday, the Danone group, formerly BSN, signed an agreement involving the creation of a joint venture on a number of products that remain to be identified, with the exception of the group's leading product: Danone yogurt. Pernod-Ricard has also created a joint venture with Beijing Winery for the production of 11 million bottles of wines and vermouths worth Fr80 million. Pernod-Ricard will be hard-pressed to compete with Remy-Cointreau, whose cognac has been enjoying a good reputation in the Chinese community in Singapore and Malaysia since 1979. "Drinking cognac is a sign of success, it is the trendy thing to do," the company explains. Since 1980, two joint ventures have been established. The first produces a wine called Dinasty on a site 120 kilometers from Beijing and has now reached the 10-million-bottle mark. The second produces a sparkling wine based on the champagne method, called Imperial Court. Its first vintage won instant approval last year with 150,000 bottles sold. Last March, Degremont, a Lyonnaise des Eaux subsidiary and the world leader in water processing, announced five contracts for the design and construction of waste water reprocessing plants. The company first established itself in China as early as 1987; today it has 25 plants in the country. Because it had been largely benefiting from financial grants by France, Degremont was hit by the tension between Paris and Beijing caused by the Tiananmen massacre and by the susbsequent sale of aircraft to Taiwan. As a result, there were no new developments between 1990 and 1993. The company is currently seeking to end its dependence on the state's changing moods and is pleased to note that more and more contracts are funded with Chinese capital.
