FR940722-0-00127 FR940722-0-00019 161. Relaxing the attribution standard somewhat in determining eligibility of women and minority-owned companies to bid for licenses on frequency blocks C and F directly addresses what most commenters have stated to be the biggest obstacle to entry for these designated entities: obtaining adequate financing. By this measure, women and minorities who are eligible to bid in these blocks ( i.e. , who otherwise meet the $125 million gross revenues/$500 million total asset standard) will be required to maintain control of their companies and, at the same time, will have flexibility to attract significant infusions of capital from a single investor. The requirement that the minority and women principals hold 50.1 percent of the company's equity mitigates substantially the danger that a well-capitalized investor with a substantial ownership stake will be able to assume de facto control of the applicant. Because this step gives large companies, who are otherwise ineligible to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, a significant incentive to ``partner'' with minority and women-owned firms, it will enhance the likelihood that these designated entities will be both successful in the auctions and become viable, long-term competitors in the PCS industry. 162. Of course, women and minority-owned firms, like any other applicant for a C or F block license, may sell a larger portion of their companies' equity, provided that they also abide by the general eligibility requirements to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Specifically, the gross revenues, total assets and net worth of all investors holding 25 percent or more of the company's passive equity (as defined to include 5 percent or more of the voting stock) will be attributed toward the $125 million/$500 million caps or the $100 million personal net worth standard. In this event, the control group will be required to hold at least 25 percent of the company's equity and 50.1 percent of its voting stock. 163. Qualified Publicly-Traded ``Entrepreneurs''. We also believe that these attribution rules may impose a particular hardship on publicly traded companies, which have little control over the ownership of their stock, and whose voting stock typically is widely held. Therefore, for purposes of determining eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, we adopt an exception from these rules for publicly traded companies. 140 Specifically, we will not attribute the gross revenues or total assets of a shareholder in a publicly traded company that owns up to 25 percent of the corporation's equity, even if that equity is represented by up to 15 percent of the voting stock. To take advantage of this exception, however, the eligible control group of the applicant still must control the corporation, hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock, and at least 25 percent of the company's equity. 141 140 ``Publicly-traded company'' shall mean a business entity organized under the laws of the United States whose shares, debt or other ownership interests are traded on an organized securities exchange within the United States. 141 We note that this exception for publicly held companies is only applicable for purposes of assessing eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks and for the general installment payment option. In the event that a publicly traded company can demonstrate that the 15 percent threshold would impose a serious hardship, the Commission would entertain a request to raise the threshold in individual cases. Companies seeking such relief must also demonstrate that raising the threshold would not contravene the Commission's control objectives, as described in this Order. We do not believe, however, that publicly traded corporations with individual shareholders owning up to 15 percent active equity require additional special provisions such as bidding credits, ``enhanced'' installment payments, or tax certificates to overcome capital access problems. Thus, we will not apply this exception with regard to the small business definition or the definition of a woman or minority-owned business. 164. De Facto Control Issues . We shall codify in our rules a provision explaining more explicitly the term ``control,'' so that applicants will have clear guidance concerning the requirement that a control group maintains de facto as well as de jure control of the firms that are eligible for special treatment under the rules for broadband PCS. For this purpose, we shall borrow from certain SBA rules that are used to determine when a firm should be deemed an affiliate of a small business. 142 These SBA rules, which are codified in 13 CFR 121.401, provide several specific examples of instances in which an entity might have control of a firm even though the entity has less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a concern, and thus provide a useful model for our rules. Through reference to circumstances such as those described in the SBA rules, our rules will expressly alert designated entities that control of the applicant through ownership of 50.1 percent of the firm's voting interests may be insufficient to ensure de facto control of the applicant if, for example, the voting stock of the eligible control group is widely dispersed. In those and other circumstances, ownership of 50.1 percent of the voting stock may be insufficient to assure control of the applicant. Of course, apart from these structural issues relative to control, eligible entities must not, during the license term, abandon control of their licenses through any other mechanism. As we stated in the Second Report and Order, designated entities must be prepared to demonstrate that they are in control of the enterprise. 143 142 As discussed below, these SBA affiliation rules also will be used as a basis for our own rules defining ``affiliates'' for purposes of determining whether particular entities meet the financial thresholds for bidding in the entrepreneurs' blocks or for qualifying as a small business. 143 Second Report and Order at Â¶278, citing Intermountain Microwave, 24 Rad. Reg. 983, 984 (1963). 165. Financial Benefits. To ensure that the control group has a substantial financial stake in the venture, we shall adopt certain additional requirements, also borrowed from SBA rules. As noted previously, we shall require that at least 50.1 percent of each class of voting stock and at least 25 percent (or 50.1 percent for the alternative option for minority and women-owned businesses) of the aggregate of all outstanding shares of stock to be unconditionally owned by the control group members. In addition, 50.1 percent of the annual distribution of dividends paid on the voting stock of a corporate applicant concern must be paid to these members. Also, in the event stock is sold, the control group members must be entitled to receive 100 percent of the value of each share of stock in his or her possession. Similarly, in the event of dissolution or liquidation of the corporation, the control group members must be entitled to receive at least 25 percent (or 50.1 percent, as the case may be) of the retained earnings of the concern and 100 percent of the value of each share of the stock in his or her possession, subject, of course, to any applicable laws requiring that debt be paid before distribution of equity.
