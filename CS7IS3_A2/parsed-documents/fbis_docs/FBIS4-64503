He was to have been received in the Vatican by Pope John Paul II, but because of the Pope's accident, he was received by the Vatican's head of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano. Kohl gave an interview to Paolo Borrella. [Begin recording] [Borrella] Is the destiny of Germany still that of a united Europe, as you said at the time of reunification? [Kohl, in German with superimposed Italian translation] Adenauer said in 1950 that the reunification of Germany and the unification of Europe were two sides of the same coin. If the German people who received this gift of reunification now concentrate only on themselves, then they would not be worthy of this historic duty. We need European unity just as much as the air that we breathe. In the 21st century there will be neither peace nor liberty for the European people unless we pursue and realize this ideal. However, we are already on the right road. We are not forgetting the others. There are millions of human beings in the Balkans who are waiting for our help, and there are billions of people in the third world who are also waiting for our help. It is a duty that we must not shirk. [end recording]
