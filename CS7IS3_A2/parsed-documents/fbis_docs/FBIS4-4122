Xie Fei, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Guangdong provincial party committee, presided over the forum and delivered the concluding speech. The forum mainly discussed the issue of using the joint-stock cooperative system for land development that is evolving in relatively rich rural areas of the Zhu Jiang delta. The participants conscientiously discussed the important significance, basic requirements, guiding ideas, working principles, and policies of the reform. Participants held that reforms related to the joint-stock cooperative system for land development which have been initiated in the developed areas of the Zhu Jiang delta are worth being introduced into other localities in the delta with a relatively developed economy and where there is a large, redundant rural labor force available, where secondary and tertiary industries, especially township and town enterprises, account for a great portion of the economy, and where the system is readily accepted by the peasants. It is necessary to gradually implement this system under strong leadership on the basis of pilot projects and in accordance with the principle that reform should give full play to the peasants' initiative and help to stabilize and promote agricultural production, promote economic returns, and increase peasants' incomes.
