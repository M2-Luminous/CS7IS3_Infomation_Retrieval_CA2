The Chinese Government welcomes discussions on the human rights issue. In fact, China's human rights situation is continuously improving, and its human rights situation is better than that of the United States in many areas. China's human rights are of a broad, fair, and authentic nature. China places itself in the lowest position in the world in criminal rate terms. China goes ahead of the United States in approving and carrying out the human rights treaties. Beginning in 1980, the Chinese Government signed, approved, and participated in seven international human rights treaties and has strictly and conscientiously carried out its own obligations. The United States participated in just one treaty, however, and refused to accept the others because they were not "in conformity with" U.S. interests. If the U.S. Secretary of State discusses "human rights" so as to jointly safeguard and improve human rights and the development of bilateral relations, naturally, this would be worth welcoming. If he wants to link MFN treatment with human rights and achieve political objectives by using "human rights" as a weapon, he is bound to run into a stone wall. A few days ago, Christopher said: Since September of last year, U.S.-Chinese relations have entered a new stage. The talks in Seattle between President Bill Clinton and President Jiang Zemin were the most important proof of the new relations. Following the meeting of Qian Qichen, vice premier of the Chinese State Council and concurrently minister of foreign Affairs and the U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, there were a series of talks between senior officials of the two countries. The governments of the two countries must have had broad discussions and actively developed bilateral relations -- particularly economic and trade relations -- under such as a good atmosphere and foundation. This is the wish of the peoples of the two countries and is in their interest. Over the past two years, major advances have been made in economic and trade relations between China and the United States. Large numbers of big U.S. enterprises have vied with one another in investing in China. Hence, U.S. investment in China has exceeded Japanese investment. More and more American people have come to realize that "human rights" should not be a condition and man-made barriers should not be erected in the development of economic and trade with China, because the MFN treatment that China and the United States grant one another is a reciprocal preferential arrangement rather than a favor given to one side by the other. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji was being forthright when he said: MFN treatment is the foundation of normal trade between China and the United States. If the foundation is shaken, both sides will suffer. In fact, the United States will be hurt more, not China. According to an estimate, if China's MFN treatment is abolished, the American consumers will have to spend an additional $14 billion a year; the United States will lose 160,000 jobs; and the country's aircraft industry will possibly lose $10 to 15 billion in business over the next 10 years. Restricting economic and trade relations between China and the United States by using "human rights" criteria will make some Americans jobless and will infringe upon their right to subsistence, which is the human right of principal importance. This way of doing things, which is formerly aimed at harming others, will end in self-destruction. The linkage of MFN treatment with human rights is a violation of the principle of respecting other countries' sovereignty that is stipulated in the "United Nations Charter." Clause 7 of Article 2 stipulates: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." Although the human rights issue has an international component, it is a matter which is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of a state. The attempt of any country to impose sanctions against other countries, to make indiscreet remarks or criticism of the domestic matters which other countries handle independently and state-to-state affairs, or to compel other countries to relinquish their sovereignty to accept its values, ideology, political standards, and development pattern by making use of human rights is an act which violates human rights. We strongly endorse the following view: Human rights first of all represent the right to subsistence, and, in order to secure the right to subsistence, a country must first of all fight for the right of independence. This rule has been proven time and again by the history of many countries. If a country is deprived of its sovereignty, its people's personal rights cannot possibly be safeguarded. It seems difficult to understand why the United States, while posing as a "fighter for human rights," refuses to sign some international conventions on human rights and has joined a relatively small number of such conventions, claiming that in so doing it wants "to vigorously defend the sovereignty of the United States of America." On the other hand, however, the United States is demanding that those conventions it has signed be subordinate to the U.S. Constitution and laws. It also seems difficult to understand why this country, while reproaching other countries for their "poor human rights conditions," has done its utmost to support some cases of massive and outrageous infringements upon human rights. In fact, this only indicates that the United States, in pursuing "human rights diplomacy," definitely does not mean to fight for human rights for other countries or for some people, but to make use of the "human rights" issue to interfere in others' internal affairs and sell its own values, ideology, political standards, and development mode. These deeds have of course been boycotted and condemned by many countries. What must be pointed out is that a small number of Chinese who have been preaching human rights are groveling at the feet of the westerners and begging foreign governments to impose sanctions on their own country and deprive their own country of sovereignty. Some people speaking at forums in the United States have called for imposing conditions related to "human rights" on the offer of MFN status to China. Some people speaking before U.S. officials have urged the United States "not to extend China's MFN status before substantial improvements are made in mainland China's human rights record." Still others who have been vigorously defending colonial rule and opposing China's resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong are criticizing the human rights condition in China by citing some cases of judiciary actions that China has carried out in accordance with the law. These people have abandoned even the minimum standard for being considered Chinese, and they are absolutely not qualified to talk of human rights! In preaching "human rights" they are putting up a false front, concealing their real motives. We should never lower our guard against these people.
