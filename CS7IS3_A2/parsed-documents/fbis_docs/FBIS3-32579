During his short visit to Caracas following an official six-day visit to Brazil and en route to Colombia, Lage met with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas and other authorities. In statements to the media in Caracas, Carlos Lage said the accusations of human rights abuse in Cuba are unjustified and just a part of Washington's harassment policy against Cuba. Upon commenting on the changes taking place on the island, the Cuban vice president said that his country does not intend to become capitalist but to adapt itself to world conditions and perfect its socialist model. On 9 February Vice President Lage will begin an official two-day visit to Colombia on the invitation of President Cesar Gaviria, with whom he will meet in Santa Fe de Bogota, as well as with several ministers of Gaviria's administration and with representatives of the National Industrialists Association of Colombia.
