During his stay in Shanghai, he separately met with Shanghai party and government leaders Wu Bangguo, Huang Ju, Chen Zhili, Chen Liangyu, Chen Tiedi, Xu Kuangdi, Pudeng New District Administrative Committee Director Zhao Qizheng, and former Shanghai leaders Chen Guodong, Hu Lijiao, Wang Daohan, and Yang Di on 26 and 27 December. At the meetings, Deng also talked about Shanghai's reform and Pudong's development. Deng Xiaoping said: When I was in Beijing, I often thought about Shanghai and Pudong. It was impossible to forget them. The development of Pudong is too late, but a good opportunity remains now, so we must keep a high speed and must not slow down. Some people are worried that such a practice may cause trouble. What trouble could there be? I do not believe this. Those who have such concerns also cannot say what trouble there will be. Our minds should be further emancipated. We must have courage and must not slow down the speed. Quicker economic development may bring about a better situation in reform and opening up. You should not fear. Otherwise, you will not be able to accomplish anything. I will give protection to you all. (Those present all laughed). The development of Pudong in Shanghai was announced in the 12th year of China's reform and opening. During the 12 years, China's economic reform took two separate, major steps in regional opening and industrial opening. In the first step, China successively set up five special economic zones in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan, as well as 14 economic and technical development zones in coastal areas between 1979 and 1988. In the second step, in 1990, China decided to open and develop Shanghai's Pudong New District. The two strategic steps were both personally decided by Deng Xiaoping. Deng's decisions were made on the basis of his assessment of the world situation and China's current realities. China has a large population, but China's economic foundation is weak. It is impossible to start large-scale construction in all parts of the country in one single move. Breakthroughs should first be made in some key points in the process of economic development. The first-step and second-step decisions were made by Deng on the basis of such realities. Deng held that Pudong's development had a bearing on Shanghai's development, and if Shanghai develops, "the situation of reform and opening in the Chang Jiang Delta area, in the whole valley of the Chang Jiang, and even the whole country will be different." Therefore, he required that "Pudong's development be tightly grasped without vacillation through to its completion." On 3 January, in the company of State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing, Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee Secretary Wu Bangguo, and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, Deng Xiaoping mounted the Yangpu Bridge and tried to walk 100 meters on the bridge. The officials and the assistants around tried hard to dissuade Deng from doing this. So he stood in the middle of the bridge to look at both sides of the Huangpu Jiang. He stretched his hand to point and said that he was glad to see that the buildings were getting taller and taller. That evening, Deng met with principal leaders of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and Zhao Qizheng, Xia Keqiang, and Hu Wei, responsible officials of the Pudong New District Administrative Committee, and he delivered a speech to them. Deng Xiaoping said: Things that can be accomplished within this century should not be postponed to the next century. Developing the economy at high speed is a major principle and policy. Pudong is the locomotive of such development. Its development has been delayed, and I was anxious about this. Major construction projects in the fields of energy and transportation should be started as soon as possible, with the necessary funds being concentrated so that they will yield returns at an earlier date. He added: An international financial center is certainly a place where all currencies can be freely converted. For Shanghai, this is of great importance. If China tries to acquire a certain international status in the financial aspect, it should first rely on Shanghai. I have reiterated this point many times. I have said this in Shanghai and have also mentioned this in Beijing. Some people say that I have partiality for Shanghai, but I said that no place could replace Shanghai's status. Pudong is the locomotive of development, and this has been written into the report to the 14th CPC Congress. (CHING PAO editor's note: On 12 October 1992, CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin particularly mentioned in his report to the 14th CPC Congress that "the opening and development of Shanghai's Pudong will function as a locomotive to promote the further opening of the cities along the Chang Jiang, and Shanghai should be built into an international economic, financial, and trade center as soon as possible, thus bring along a new leap forward for the regional economy of the Chang Jiang Delta area and the whole valley of the Chang Jiang.") Therefore, You must do a good job! Your successes in development will enable me to speak aloud. (All of those present laughed.) Deng Xiaoping then added: I have seen the model of the Lujiazui Financial and Trade Development Zone you sent to me (author's note: this was the latest of three models.) It is very nice. Such projects should be started. There are more than 100 buildings with a total of more than 4 million square meters of floor space. They are indeed impressive! There is no limitation in the emancipation of people's minds. Nothing will be accomplished if people fear this or that. In the final analysis, Shanghai's development was the result of daring practice. You should advance the process of reform and opening by grasping the opportunity and should not waste your time by getting involved in unnecessary courtesy activities and, thus, should not let the opportunity slip. This time, I came a bit earlier than before, because I want to have more time to listen to your reports and to see what you have done. Shanghai is able to make great accomplishments, but I must again emphasize that the faster economic development, the more attention we should pay to the building of material and spiritual civilization. This is also a constant principle, which must be understood by our cadres at all levels. Rapid economic development will also require us to further improve our work style. We should say less and do more and should stress practice. Whatever they are doing, our cadres should give consideration first to whether the people are glad and satisfied or not and whether the people support the policies or not. This is the key to the success of our reform and opening. Deng Xiaoping also said: The development of the present international situation is favorable to us, and we are facing an opportunity that has rarely been seen. Recently, there have been some little troubles in Hong Kong. Chris Patten is playing little tricks there. We should ignore him and do what we need to do on our own. Hong Kong's prosperity and stability are still dependent on our economic development. In my view, they do not understand the Chinese people and the Chinese Government. There is no Li Hongzhang [Qing Dynasty official blamed for ceding Hong Kong Island to Britain] any more. The people will not agree if we do not recover Hong Kong. Therefore, Patten and the British Government will get nowhere on the Hong Kong issue. Reportedly, after leaving Shanghai, Deng Xiaoping may travel southward to inspect Guangdong and Hainan. On 13 January, JIEFANG RIBAO, the organ of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, published a commentator's article at the top of the front page, entitled "Further Emancipating People's Minds," which revealed Deng's talk about emancipating people's minds. Next day, XINHUA dispatched the excerpts of the article. On 14 January, RENMIN RIBAO published a lengthy article entitled "Deng Xiaoping's Ideas About Opening and Development and the Development of Shanghai's Pudong" by Huang Qifan, deputy director of the Pudong New District Administrative Committee. All this formed another "opinion storm" in Shanghai after the series of commentaries written in the name of Huangfu Ping in 1991. Zhou Ruijin, the former party committee secretary of JIEFANG RIBAO, who organized the writing of the Huangfu Ping articles, has been in the post of deputy editor-in-chief of RENMIN RIBAO for several years. This time, RENMIN RIBAO in the north and JIEFANG RIBAO in the south echoed each other, and brought about a lively and dynamic situation in public opinion. It is believed that the CPC newspapers will publish more articles with original ideas in 1994 to meet the needs of economic development.
