The Finnish Aviation Department early last month delivered to its Estonian counterpart body its proposals concerning a possible takeover of the control by Finnish operators in Tampere. The plan was considered because of reports that the technical equipment used by fight controllers in Estonia is several decades behind the present-day level. The Cabinet today decided that there were no serious political or economic grounds to hand over the control and that the step would contradict Estonia's responsibilities under international agreements. Laar said Estonia will start preparation of a long-term program aimed at purchasing state-of-the-art equipment for flight control. Operations by commercial airlines in several international air corridors crossing Estonia in the upper air space, or higher than 6,000 meters above the ground, brought to Estonia some 30 million kroons in fees last year. "We have been able to ensure flight security so far also in the upper air space -- the question is on what level," Jaan Tamm, deputy head of the Estonian Aviation Department, told BNS. According to estimates by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Estonia needs 39 million dollars, or some 530 million kroons, to update its flight control systems and train the personnel.
