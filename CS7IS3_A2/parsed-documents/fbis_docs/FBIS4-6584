The head of the delegation said he extended congratulations to the great leader His Excellency President Kim Il-song on his birthday. I am convinced that although the United States, with huge Armed Forces deployed in and around South Korea, tries to destroy the Democratic People's Republic of Korea through military aggression, the people under the guidance of illustrious leaders, the people with revolutionary faith in their leaders will certainly win, he said. Noting that the United States is now using the UN Security Council, the International Atomic Energy Agency and other international organisations as means of putting pressure on progressive countries, he stressed the United States would bump into resistance of revolutionary countries and meet its doom finally.
