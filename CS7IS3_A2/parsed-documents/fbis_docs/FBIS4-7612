In the "Hallmark of Time" program on Radio Kragujevac, General Milovanovic referred to the setting up of a federation between the Muslims and Croats and went on to explain the reasons why it was created and the role of military circles in this move. "First, the Muslims rid themselves of the Croats as the enemy, while on the other hand the Croats were facing total military defeat and had to agree on the federation." Asked if the Croats had joined in Muslim armed attacks against Serbs, General Milovanovic said: "No. They have been completely passive in relation to us and the Muslims and, like cunning Latins, are waiting to see who is going to win and then take the side of the stronger." Explaining the main objectives of the Muslim offensive, General Milovanovic singled out Posavina and Podrinje as its main targets. "In Posavina the Muslims want to cut through the Serb corridor. They need to capture Brcko, and the Croats want to keep the areas where the Croat population was in the majority before the war. The Muslims have two options in the Drina river basin -- one of them is a lateral operation [esast to west] to reach the left bank of the Drina river from Tuzla and Kalesija to Zvornik, then to link up with Srebrenica from Kladanj via Vlasenica, to link up with Zepa from Olovo via Sokolac and Han Pijesak and also to link Sarajevo with Gorazde. The other option is a vertical operation [south to north] to connect the Muslim enclaves from Gorazde toward Zepa, from Zepa to Srebrenica and from there to Zvornik, or the other way round." Milovanovic said that there is a rift between the Muslim military and state leadership and that the offensive was originally scheduled for the autumn. This is clearly a result of the military leadership's wish to prove themselves. Commenting on the arrival of Turkish units, Milovanovic said that this is a clear provocation or a sign of the UN Security Council's weakness. "This is a religious and not a civil war, and the world should be aware of it. This is a war between Christianity and Islam."
