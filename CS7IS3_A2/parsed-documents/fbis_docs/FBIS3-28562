The administrative guideline attached to the new 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package focuses on liquidation of the so-called "restructured loans," or loans for which banks have reduced or suspended interest payments as part of a bailout program for financially troubled borrowers. The ministry said it will allow banks to set up a special entity to shift their restructured loans to nonbank money lenders such as housing loan companies. The ministry also said it will expand the scope of a special write-off reserve account to include loans that have a risk of default. These steps are designed to rebuild public confidence in Japan's financial system which was substantially eroded following the bursting of the speculation-driven "bubble economy" of the late 1980s. The latest package is expected to maximize the effects of measures envisioned in an administrative guideline for the financial industry unveiled in August 1992, a ministry official told a press conference. The amount of restructured loans held by Japan's 21 major banks is estimated to far exceed some 14 trillion yen in nonperforming loans they reported at the end of last September, which has weighed heavily on their earnings. Banks are not required to disclose the size of restructured loans but are required to do so on loans to bankrupt borrowers, nonperforming loans or those with interest payments in arrears for six months or longer. Currently, loans recognized by the Finance Ministry as bad assets can be provided for in the special reserve account, in which half the outstanding claims are free of tax. Ministry recognition requires that loans be unrecoverable, such as those to bankrupt borrowers. Under the new step, banks will be allowed to use their own judgment to write off risky loans on a taxable basis, the ministry said. The aim of the company tasked with liquidating restructured loans is to help avoid sales of such loans to third parties, which hamper smooth rescue of the troubled nonbank, the official said. A creditor bank sells to a new entity its loan principal to a nonbank at discounted prices that reflect market prices. The bank then uses the proceeds to set up the entity. The mechanism improves the bank's financial standing by producing a tax-free loss equal to the gap between the principal and the selling price. The guideline calls for stable fund supply by financial institutions. Specifically, it says banks should adopt an accommodative lending stance for small companies to meet their fund needs in new business areas. In order to promote bank lending, the package also recommends that banks boost their capital base through issuance of preferred stocks and subordinated bonds. The guideline says the Finance Ministry, in order to ensure stable housing and land supply, will ease restrictions on real estate-related lending. It says the ministry will continue to ask financial institutions to refrain from resorting to the sale of stockholdings to generate profits ahead of book closing. It encourages banks to step up use of Cooperative Credit Purchasing Co., a debt-buying entity set up in January 1993, as a way to smooth disposal of their nonperforming loans. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, in a press conference, said he hopes these measures will wipe out public concern over the eroded financial system, particularly the huge amount of nonperforming loans squeezing it.
