The paper says that the lies included in Christopher's article are fabrications that will not stand up before the facts and that they are an obvious misrepresentation of reality and a sign of weakness, for a strong stand does not need lies to support it. The papers add that Christopher's article is a nervous response to Iraq's diplomatic moves and the international changes acknowledging and praising Iraq's cooperation and calling for taking the required steps to remove the blockade after the disappearance of its justifications. Under the headline "Iraq's steadfastness and Christopher's Allegations," AL-QADISIYAH says that thanks to its patience, jihad, balanced political stand, and the wisdom of its historical leadership, Iraq has destroyed the chapters of conspiracy against it. Despite their unfairness, Iraq has fulfilled its obligations fully toward relevant UN Security Council resolutions. This has been acknowledged by the fair UN Security Council member states and the special commissions that have dealt with those resolutions. The paper explains that Christopher's stand reflects the reality of the tendentious and unjustified U.S. stand against Iraq, thus increasing U.S. isolation and showing that the United States is the sole power antagonizing Iraq and seeking to perpetuate the blockade against it. This is contrary to the will of the majority of permanent UN Security Council member states, other member states, and the rest of the world states that sympathize with Iraq's suffering and view positively its honoring of its obligations in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions. Under the headline "Christopher Is Swimming Against the Current," AL-JUMHURIYAH says that Christopher has fallen into a glaring contradiction when, claiming to be speaking on behalf of the international community, he said that he opposes Iraq's efforts to have the blockade lifted. He said, however, that he sees that the unity of the Security Council has begun to disintegrate and that the majority of the international community are now in favor of lifting the blockade. He also said that a minority--specifically the United States and Britain--still want the blockade to continue. The paper adds that some may think that like his president, Christopher may have little information about the suffering of the Iraqi people. But in his article, Christopher shows complete awareness and acknowledges the Iraqi people's suffering. Yet, he called for maintaining the blockade against Iraq, turning a blind eye to that fact and deliberately seeking to prolong that suffering. The paper asks: Can any double standard be clearer than this? Under the headline "Exposed Fabrications in Warren Christopher's Article," AL-THAWRAH says: Warren Christopher's article reflects the embarrassing situation the U.S. Administration, led by Clinton, has put itself in as a result of its continued unjustified confrontation with Iraq and its desperate attempts to continue to harm Iraq by calling for tightening the blockade and extending it at every review session. The paper adds that the U.S. secretary of state's article was a direct reply to the voices, which are growing louder even inside the United States, saying that the U.S. attitude not only conflicts with the changing international position but also with the interests of United States itself, especially after French, Italian, German, and Japanese companies have opened negotiations with Iraq to protect their interests. The paper says Christopher's accusation that Iraq tried to assassinate criminal George Bush during his visit to Kuwait has been refuted by the trial of those accused of the attempt. The statements made by the defendants and the fact that the sessions have been adjourned several times to reach a verdict prove that the story is nothing more than a fabricated and exposed attempt aimed at maintaining a tense situation and pressing for continuing the blockade imposed on Iraq. On Christopher's claims about the so-called displacement operations of Arabs in the marshlands, the paper says: The report prepared by a special UN committee -- formed to look into chemical use allegations propagated by Western quarters and Iranian authorities -- has conclusively refuted these allegations after examining all aspects of this affair. The committee would not have missed the slightest indication of such operations, especially since it hoped, along with those who sent it, to find even a shred of evidence to facilitate condemning Iraq. On Christopher's allusion that Iraq is still holding Kuwaiti prisoners, the paper says Iraq is willing to cooperate with any party to ascertain the truth of the information sent by Iraq to the Arab League through its envoys who visited Iraq and saw with their own eyes that there are no Kuwaitis detained in Iraq. The latest Iraqi initiative in this regard was the invitation extended by the Iraqi National Assembly speaker to a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation to visit Iraq and see that Iraq is not holding any Kuwaiti prisoners, but Kuwait has rejected the offer. On Christopher's accusation that Iraq continues to produce weapons of mass destruction, AL-THAWRAH says: The statements of Rolf Ekeus are still fresh. Ekeus said two days ago, after meeting with Iraqi officials, that Iraq is cooperating with the Special Commission and that both sides are working together to shorten the trial period of the monitoring regime. Also, all reports by the UN committee supervising the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction show, in documents and figures, Iraq's full response to its demands to facilitate its mission. On Christopher's talk about our beloved north and his accusation that Iraq is assassinating relief workers and UN observers, the paper wonders: Has Christopher forgotten that the region he is talking about is currently outside the control of the central authority and that the forces of his country and the allied states are supervising the region and claim to be providing security and peace for it? AL-THAWRAH concludes: Christopher's article amounts to nothing more than a repeat of conniving U.S. positions that seek to create excuses and pretexts to maintain the blockade and target the people and leadership of Iraq, who have proven, through their remarkable steadfastness, that it is possible to defeat the schemes of the enemies. The enemies did not imagine Iraq would return a giant, as it was, having dealt it a blow with all of the weapons of mass destruction in their arsenal.
