It is under these conditions that the skillful physician of the world of Islam--the esteemed guardian of the Muslims' cause--approved canceling the disavowal of polytheists' ceremony. Until the direct confrontations between the enemies of the Muslims and the pagan-breaking ceremonies for the disavowal of polytheists, some people had not understood the philosophy behind the Islamic Republic's insistence on holding the disavowal marches and ceremonies and asked themselves and others: What need is there for marches and struggles during the Hajj pilgrimage and in the hot weather? And if the cry of disavowal is raised, what harm will be done to arrogance? The simple-minded thought that the so-called civilized world of the world-devourers would tolerate such political problems and allow opponents the right to live, to demonstrate, and to hold marches. This allegation was based on permission being given for marches in the so-called free Western countries. But it should be clarified that those marches do not harm the superpowers and other powers; it is the Mecca and Medina marches that spark Muslim unity. It is the march in the city of God that makes the polytheists tremble with fear. The brave and alert Iranian nation and Muslim nations of the world should know that their declaration of solidarity and their marches in support of the Muslim nations, especially of the Palestinian and Bosnian nations, are not only effective, but will make the polytheists tremble.
