An official in the Department of Trade and Industry, which handles London's trade relations with Beijing, said Mr Patten would be told his political reform policies no longer had the unanimous support of the British Government. Mr Patten leaves this Friday [20 May] on a 10-day trip which will include meeting ministers and Foreign Office officials. The meetings are expected to focus on whether the Government will accept recommendations in the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee's (FAC) report -- especially its call for a human rights commission. The trade official said Mr Patten was "just too expensive a luxury for Hong Kong in terms of our China trade". It is the first public attack by a serving British civil servant on Mr Patten's policies. Previously, such criticism has only come from retired officials, such as former foreign affairs adviser Sir Percy Cradock. The official said that, while opinion polls continued to show popular support for Mr Patten: "At the end of the day it's the pound or the dollar in the pocket that counts". "We don't have the same agenda as Mr Patten. We want to see trade with China burgeoning, and we see a lot of it going through Hong Kong. We think this is the strongest base for freedom in Hong Kong," he said. "We're at a dead end. We know that, Patten knows that and the Chinese know it too. We've got to break the deadlock." Foreign Office and Downing Street officials have insisted the British Government continued to unanimously back Mr Patten. In Hong Kong, Government House spokesman Mike Hanson rejected the trade official's attack. "His statements do not reflect the British Government's position on Hong Kong," he said. "There is an important place for integrity, as well as commercial interests, in foreign affairs." Mr Patten is expected to come under further fire from British business interests in a House of Lords debate this Wednesday, sponsored by former Hong Kong minister Lord Glenarthur. Previous such debates have seen stringent criticism of the Governor's political reform policies. The visit has already sparked suggestions in the British press that Mr Patten is bored of the governorship, since his last trip to London was only six weeks ago. However Mr Patten has defended this pattern of visits, saying it was similar to that followed by his predecessor, Lord Wilson. In meeting ministers and officials, he will hammer out the British Government's response to the FAC report, which must be delivered to the all-party body by the end of June. The ethnic minorities campaign for British passports, which was backed by the FAC, is also expected to be discussed.
