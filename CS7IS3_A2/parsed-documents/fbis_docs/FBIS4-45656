A survey covering southern Finland carried out by plane a few weeks ago revealed regions where radioactivity in the area is still surprisingly high. In addition, there were smaller regions, including Myrskylae and Kuhmoinen, where cesium 137 was found in quantities of 200 kilo- becquerels per square kilometer. These amounts are not dangerous for humans even though they are conspicuously high. Levels of 560 kilo-becquerels would demand protective measures.
