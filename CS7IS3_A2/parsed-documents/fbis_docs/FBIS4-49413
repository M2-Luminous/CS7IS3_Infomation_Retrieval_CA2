A commission official said that by the end of 1993 Beijing's manufacturing industry had launched 40 joint ventures with trans-national companies, each with an investment of at least 10 million U.S. dollars. The ventures involve 2.08 billion dollars in total investment, he added. Joint ventures have been set up with the Matsushita Company of Japan, the Chrysler Company of the United States, the Philips Company of the Netherlands and the ABB Company of Switzerland. These ventures are all being run at a profit, the official said. For example, the Beijing Jeep Company, a joint venture between the Beijing Motor Vehicle Plant and the Chrysler Company, has generated four billion yuan in profits and tax payment since it started operation ten years ago. The company, the first Sino-foreign joint venture in Beijing, has also increased the value of its fixed assets 10 times since 1984. The Matsushita Company has launched a number of joint ventures with manufacturers in Beijing, including the Beijing-Matsushita Color TV Tube Company, the Beijing-Matsushita Electrical Appliances Company, the Beijing-Matsushita Electronics Company and the Beijing- Matsushita Control Device Company. In addition, the Siemens company of Germany, the Pepsi-Cola company of the United States and the ABB Company of Switzerland are expanding their investments in Beijing, the official said. Gao Zuozhi, director of the commission, said that joint ventures with a turnover of one billion yuan in 1993 were all ventures between manufacturers attached to the commission and overseas businesses. "This shows that there are bright prospects for trans-national companies investing in Beijing's manufacturing industry," he said. "It alsO indicates that major state-owned enterprises in Beijing can enter into successful co-operation with trans-national companies," he added. He said that in the future Beijing will give priority to the growth of 12 industries, including automobiles, electronics, meters and instruments, new chemicals, building materials and pharmaceuticals. He pledged more efforts to expanding co-operation with trans-national companies in order to spur the growth of Beijing's industry as a whole.
