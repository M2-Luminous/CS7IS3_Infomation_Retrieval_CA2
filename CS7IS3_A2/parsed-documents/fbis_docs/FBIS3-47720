According to sources at the foreign affairs department, the OIC will not renege on its vow to help Mindanao on its path to economic recovery, since it was convinced that President Ramos is sincere in peacefully settling the decades-old Muslim secessionist movement in the southern Philippines. Earlier, a high-ranking OIC official, Secretary-General Hamid al- Gabid, had committed to the president during a meeting at Malacanang that the 52-nation OIC would bring in investments to Mindanao. Officials said OlC's commitment to the Ramos administration was a giant step in helping improve Mindanao's economy. The commitment is also doubly significant, according to officials, since the government's previous bids to seek the support of the OIC to assist Mindanao, were fruitless. Al-Gabid, however, has committed to the president the OIC leadership's strong support for the Philippines' investments' pitch during the annual OlC foreign ministers meeting which will be held in Tunisia this April. According to officials, al-Gabid had been satisfied during his visit here in seeing for himself that the president was committed to Mindanao's economic development and the grant of autonomy to Muslim-dominated areas in the region. Foreign affairs officials said this view has not changed despite the bombings in recent weeks in Mindanao, particularly in Christian and Muslim religious sites. Last December, the San Pedro Cathedral in Davao City was bombed leaving scores of people killed and hundreds injured. The cathedral bombings was followed by explosions which rocked two Muslim mosques. Aside from supporting the Ramos' administration's economic programs for Mindanao, the OIC had also assured the government that it will not tolerate any moves to violate the territorial integrity of the Philippines.
