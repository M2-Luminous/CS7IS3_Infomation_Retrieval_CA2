Mossie van den Berg by Radio Pretoria announcer -- live] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Van der Berg] Let us make an appeal and direct a plea to all our people. Let us -- man, woman and child across the breadth and length of our country -- throw in our weight behind the resistance strategy which the National Front is in the process of getting off the ground, and which we hope -- and I want to try and announce this at this stage -- on Friday 25 March will reach a climax by what we have decided to call, and which we will advertise during the coming week, `Capital Day in Pretoria.' During the coming week the National Front will start distributing information throughout the entire country. This will begin on 22 March -- from the furthest corners, and it will gradually move toward Pretoria, and on 25th of this month we hope to -- for the first time -- stage a real demonstration in Pretoria not only for our people's enemies to see, but they must also feel it in their bodies that they cannot provide security and safety for anybody in this country without having satisfied the Boers regarding their own future. My plea to all our listeners is: Let us stop flinging accusations: let us -- with more resolve than ever before -- tackle and perform the task at hand shoulder to shoulder. As far as we are concerned, it is a forgone conclusion: There is no way that we will get involved in the election on 27 April. Our task is to see to the resistance campaign and to muster the force of the Boer people. Thank you very much. [Announcer] Reverend, I just want to ask you. You have just mentioned Capital Day on the 25th. What is going to happen on that day, or is it premature to talk about that now already? [Van der Berg] We are going to get every man, woman, and child from throughout the country, and particularly from around Pretoria, to come to Pretoria and show the world that if there is one piece of soil on which the Boer nation can make an undisputed claim, then it is Pretoria. And from that point the freedom struggle must continue forward. [Announcer] Where is this meeting going to take place? [Van der Berg] We hope Pretoria will be too small [announcer laughs]. But the nucleus of the meeting will be at Church Square. [Announcer] Rev. Mossie, thank you very much. We will get more detail in the course of next week to give our people.
