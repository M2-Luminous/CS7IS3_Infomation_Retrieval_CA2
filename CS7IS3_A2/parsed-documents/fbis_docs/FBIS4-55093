FBIS4-55093 "dreeu090__a94004" FBIS-EEU-94-090-A Daily Report 6 May 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Stability Issued Debated Stability Issued Debated AU0605202594 Prague CTK in English 1658 GMT 6 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0605202594 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, May 6 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic and Britain agree that the question of stability of Central and Eastern Europe is important for the continent, but differ in the accent on what is the cause and what is the consequence, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told CTK today. He was referring to his talks with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd earlier today during which the European security and stability pact was also taken up. An international conference on the pact will be held in Paris at the end of May. The pact, proposed by French Premier Edouard Balladur last June, is to ensure stability and security in Europe, protect economic and trade interests, and result in the conclusion of agreements on good neighborhood and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities. Zieleniec said all European countries, including the Czech Republic, espoused the goals set by the European Union (EU) -- finding a way of making Central and Eastern Europe a genuine part of the continent and gradually integrating it into the EU. He stressed that views on ways of achieving these goals were not always entirely identical. The Czech Republic stresses the Western experience that the problems of ethnic minorities are best solved within a democratic and law-abiding state which has a well functioning economy based on private ownership. Zieleniec said it was very difficult to treat the minority issue as an isolated one in a multilateral international agreement, without stressing the need for democracy and a law-abiding state.
