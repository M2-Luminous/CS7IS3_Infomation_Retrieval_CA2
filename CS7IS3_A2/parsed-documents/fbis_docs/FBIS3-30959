This is the very reason why any interference by NATO, which sent an ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs, would be completely wrong, Karadzic said ahead of his talks with the Bosnian Croat delegation which began this morning. "I have seen on television that the Serb artillery is being withdrawn from around Sarajevo and I hope that this is true," Croat delegation head Mile Akmadzic said prior to the talks, underscoring that "this will indeed be a step towards peace if the artillery is removed." No significant progress was made at the talks between the warring sides during the previous two days. The essential question--the future organization of Bosnia and its territorial division--cannot be resolved by the negotiators at this time, since Moslems rejected the concept of a union of three republics, proposing instead a model of 17 cantons within a single state of Bosnia. The Moslem side also refused to discuss a separate agreement on the demilitarization of Sarajevo and the placing of this city under a two-year U.N. administration, which was proposed by the co-chairmen of the Conference on Former Yugoslavia in order to arrive at a comprehensive agreement more easily. Lord Owen, one of the two co-chairmen, also warned on Saturday that there would be no progress in the talks until the expiry of NATO's ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs--that they would be bombed unless they withdrew their heavy weapons to 20 km from the center of Sarajevo by the midnight of February 20. Lord Owen said that the Moslems would wait to see the results of this ultimatum, so that it will not be possible to get the peace process moving before the expiry of this deadline.
