Summary of Response Mission In a radiological emergency, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) assists with the assessment, preservation, and protection of human health and helps ensure the availability of essential health/medical and human services. Overall, HHS emergency response is coordinated by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Office of Emergency Preparedness. HHS provides technical and nontechnical assistance in the form of advice, guidance, and resources to Federal, State, and local governments. The principal HHS response comes from the U.S. Public Health Service. HHS actively participates with EPA and USDA on the Advisory Team for Environment, Food, and Health when convened. 2. Capabilities and Resources HHS has personnel located at headquarters, regional offices, and at laboratories and other facilities who can provide assistance in radiological emergencies. The agency can provide the following kinds of advice, guidance, and assistance: (1) Assist State and local government officials in making evacuation and relocation decisions; (2) Ensure the availability of health and medical care and other human services (especially for the aged, the poor, the infirm, the blind, and others most in need); (3) Provide advice and guidance in assessing the impact of the effects of radiological incidents on the health of persons in the affected area; (4) Assist in providing crisis counseling to victims in affected geographic areas; (5) Provide guidance on the use of radioprotective substances (e.g., thyroid blocking agents), including dosage, and also projected radiation doses that warrant the use of such drugs; (6) In conjunction with DOE and DOD, advise medical personnel on proper medical treatment of people exposed to or contaminated by radioactive materials; (7) Recommend Protective Action Guides for food and animal feed and assist in developing technical recommendations on protective measures for food and animal feed; and (8) Provide guidance to State and local health officials on disease control measures and epidemiological surveillance and study of exposed populations. 3.
