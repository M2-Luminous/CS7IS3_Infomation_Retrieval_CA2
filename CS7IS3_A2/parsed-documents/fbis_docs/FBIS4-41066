Agrarians' Conference in State Duma"] [Text] The State Duma has been working for six months now but there are still no laws whatever regulating relations in the economy's agrarian sector. Why is this? What are the reasons for such a long period of disorder? It emerges that the answer is fairly simple. An extremely irregular situation has arisen with regard to the passage of draft laws on agrarian reform. The list of priority legislative acts in this area was decided long ago, and work on them has been and continues to be carried out. However, the government has not officially submitted a single draft law to the State Duma. And the drafts which the Duma committee on agrarian questions has elaborated do not receive support from the...government. This is a vicious circle! In order to get a clear and unequivocal picture of the sides' positions, last Friday (17 June) members of the Duma's agrarian faction and leaders of the agrarian sector met -- Vice Premier A. Zaveryukha, V. Khlystun, minister of agriculture and food, N. Komov, chairman of the Russian Federation Committee for Land Resources and Land Management, S. Ignatyev, deputy minister of economics, A. Krasnopivtsev, deputy minister of finance, and other executives from government structures. The deputies were unanimous that the draft agrarian laws are clearly being blocked by the government team. All references to difficulties in coordination were deemed to be unfounded. Our draft laws, M. Lapshin emphasized, are being blocked not for technical but for ideological reasons. What remains in Russia that has not been privatized? Only the land, it seems. For this very reason radical reformers are stubbornly seeking to adopt first of all a Civil Code incorporating paragraphs which make land a commodity, and only then to enshrine these provisions in a Land Code. In the opinion of Deputy V. Vershinin, the agrarian sector's leaders are today powerless to change the situation somehow. It is necessary to appeal to the president and the public. It has actually been decided to make such an appeal. These most important questions for the fate of rural areas will be broached in the course of the forthcoming meeting between agrarian deputies and the Russian president 27 June.
