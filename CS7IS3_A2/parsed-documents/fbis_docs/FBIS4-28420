The letter of the Zimbabwe-Korea Solidarity and Friendship Association said the Japanese authorities' search of Chongnyon organizations and murder of Japan-resident Koreans are part of Japan's hostile policy towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and a very ill-boding move assuming political character. It warned that if they continued to commit reckless acts, failing to lend an ear to the voices of the world peaceloving people, they will face a stern judgement by history. The Lausanne Cultural Information Centre on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Switzerland in its letter denounced the Japanese authorities for harshly suppressing Chongnyon organizations and Koreans in Japan and strongly demanded that they be ensured democratic national rights. The chairman of the Bulgaria-Korea Friendship Association branded the suppression of Chongnyon by the Japanese authorities as a reckless and inhumanitarian act trampling down the democratic national rights of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and a challenge to the DPRK.
