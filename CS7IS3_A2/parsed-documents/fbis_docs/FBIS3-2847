He firmly believed that Tibet will be better off tomorrow. Having attentively listened to delegates' remarks, Hu Jintao noted: This year is an important year for deepening reform and stepping up development; we must accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic structure under the condition of a high- speed economic growth and strive to achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development while changing enterprise operating mechanisms. Currently, we are under a good situation, shouldering heavy responsibilities, facing many difficulties, and having a bright future. He stressed: The CPC Central Committee has scientifically analyzed the current situation, definitely set "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability" as the overall interests of the entire party and the whole nation, and demanded that all kinds of work be subordinated to and serve the overall interests. We must gain a clear understanding of the situation, keep overall interests in mind, unite as one, and work in a down-to-earth manner. We should not only press forward in the face of difficulties -- steadfastly and constantly push the cause of reform and construction forward -- but also judge the hour and size up the situation and study and resolve contradictions and problems cropping up in the course of progress with a sober mind. Hu Jintao said: Development and stability are two major issues for Tibet's work. The establishment of a socialist market economic structure has brought Tibet new opportunities for economic development; in the meantime, however, some new conditions and problems have surfaced too. In face of the new situation, we should further emancipate the mind and guide Tibet's economic development with new concepts and thinking that are suited to a socialist market economy. We should firmly keep Tibet's special conditions in mind, consider the reality in Tibet in approaching all problems and doing everything, and make Tibet's stability and economic development, as well as the pursuit of interests of various nationalities in Tibet, the starting point and standpoint of our work. We should continuously carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, do a solid job, and fulfill all sorts of work. Hu Jintao concluded: The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have always attached great importance to Tibet's work and shown concern over people of various nationalities in Tibet. Since reform and open policies were launched, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have adopted a series of special policies and flexible measures for Tibet, which have favorably promoted economic development and social progress in Tibet and are well received and supported by people in Tibet. In the course of developing a socialist market economy, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council will continue to pay attention to and show concern for Tibet as usual. We believe that with the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee, vigorous support of other fraternal provinces and regions, and the concerted efforts and hard struggle of various nationalities in Tibet, Tibet will be better off tomorrow.
