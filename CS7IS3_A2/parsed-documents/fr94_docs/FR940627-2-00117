FR940627-2-00117 FR940627-2-00045 VII Standard of Review Under the Tunney Act for the Proposed Final Judgment The APPA requires that proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the United States are subject to a sixty-day comment period, after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment ``is in the public interest.'' In making that determination, the court may consider: (1) the competitive impact of such judgment, including termination of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement and modification, duration or relief sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered, and any other considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment; (2) the impact of entry of such judgment upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be derived from a determination of the issues at trial. 15 U.S.C. 16(e) (emphasis added). The courts have recognized that the term ``public interest'' ``take[s] meaning from the purposes of the regulatory legislation.'' NAACP v. Federal Power Comm'n, 425 U.S. 662, 669 (1976); United States v. American Cynamid Co., 719 F.2d 558, 565 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1101 (1984). Since the purpose of the antitrust laws is to ``preserv[e] free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade,'' Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 4 (1958), the focus of the ``public interest'' inquiry under the Tunney Act is whether the proposed final judgment would serve the public interest in free and unfettered competition. United States v. Waste Management, Inc., 1985&hyph;2 Trade Cas. ¶66,651, at 63,046 (D.D.C. 1985). In conducting this inquiry, ``the Court is nowhere compelled to go to trial or to engage in extended proceedings which might have the effect of vitiating the benefits of prompt and less costly settlement through the consent decree process.'' 13 Rather, 13 119 Cong. Rec. 24598 (1973). See United States v. Gillette Col., 406 F. Supp. 713, 715 (D. Mass. 1975). A ``public interest'' determination can be made properly on the basis of the Competitive Impact Statement and Response to Comments filed pursuant to the APPA. Although the APPA authorizes the use of additional procedures, 15 U.S.C. 16(f), those procedures are discretionary. A court need not invoke any of them unless it believes that the comments have raised significant issues and that further proceedings would aid the court in resolving those issues. See H.R. Rep. 93&hyph;1463, 93rd Cong. 2d Sess. 8&hyph;9, reprinted in (1974) U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 6535, 6538. Absent a showing of corrupt failure of the government to discharge its duty, the Court, in making the public interest finding, should *␣*␣* carefully consider the explanations of the government in the competitive impact statement and its responses to comments in order to determine whether those explanations are reasonable under the circumstances.
