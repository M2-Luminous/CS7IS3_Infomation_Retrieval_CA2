Most opposition deputies -- who form the majority in the committee -- rejected the proposals, while the coalition deputies were for them. The committee members' report concentrated on the nine-member Czech Television Council, an organ supposed to guarantee the public's right to control the making and broadcasting of Czech Television's programmes. The proposals were put forward by deputies of the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) and the Liberal National Social Party (LSNS).
