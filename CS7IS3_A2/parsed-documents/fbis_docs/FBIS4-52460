He said Thailand is happy to be the gateway for visitors wishing to visit that country. The Burmese government has signed a contract with a Thai company to invest in accommodation in Burma. A number of hotel projects financed by foreign investors are underway to cope with the growing number of tourists. Two first-class hotels are scheduled to be built in Pagan and another in Ranong, the ambassador said. Thai Airways International's flight frequencies will also be given a boost provided agreement with the Burmese government is reached. There is now in effect a plan to double the length of stay for visitors from two to four weeks. The Burmese government also proposed to grant "visas on arrival" to tourists travelling to the old capital of Mandalay, Mr Wira said. The foreign visitors, however, have to pay US S300 to purchase coupons which can be redeemed for accommodation and other service facilities in place of money, said the Thai ambassador.
