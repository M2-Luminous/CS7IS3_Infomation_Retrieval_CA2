Source is cited in parentheses following each item. The National Administrative Department of Statistics, DANE, reported on 30 December that retail sales rose by 3.7 percent from January to October 1993, compared to the same period in 1992. Furniture and home appliance stores registered a growth of 14.1 percent in sales. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 31 Dec 93 p 1C) A report by the National Association of Industrialists, ANDI, indicated that in 1993 the economy grew at the 5.16 percent rate announced by the government. The contribution of the industrial sector to this growth was less than 1 percent, meaning the Colombian economy in 1993 was marked by low vitality in productive activity, it added. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 31 Dec 94 p 27) A cold spell in Santa Fe de Bogota's savannas destroyed 30 percent of the areas's flower harvest. In addition to harming exports, approximately 26,000 workers will lose their jobs. The cold weather also destroyed the potato harvests in Boyaca and Cundinamarca Department, the country's chief suppliers. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1730 GMT 7 Jan 94) The government granted a 21-percent pay increase to all its public officials, except the members of the military and some members of the Judicial Branch, who will receive a higher increase as part of the strategy to control public order and upgrade the system of justice. The increase represents 0.9 percent of the total production of goods and services of the economy or the GDP. The state indicated the raise will not hurt its macroeconomic goals because it has been included in the estimates for the 1994 budget. During the first half of 1993, the state's total spending grew 39 percent, and functioning costs rose 46.2 percent.

Jose Manuel Arias Carrioza, president of the Colombian Association of Textile Producers, sent a letter to Pedro Nel Ospina, director of the National Customs and Tax Directorate, complaining that port controls have slackened. Arias reports that 80 percent of Colombian textile factories suffered losses in 1993. The "civic overseers" are not intended to check customs work, but to ensure that the type of textiles imported do not compete unfairly with local production. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 5 Jan 94 pp 1a, 8b) Colombian coal exports increased 27 percent in 1993 with shipments totalling 13.7 millions tons and worth $464 million, the Colombian Coal Enterprise, Carbocol, reported. During 1992, exports were 2 million tons less than the amount of coal produced. Carbocol disclosed that in 1993 production costs were reduced by 10 percent from $272 million to $245 million. Colombia faced a tough situation during 1993 when world coal surpluses topped 11 million tons, thus reducing long term contract prices by five dollars per ton. Currently, Colombia sells coal at $35 per ton maximum. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1735 GMT 7 Jan 94) Housing and food prices were the main culprits for the government overshooting its 22 percent inflation rate goal for 1993. The inflation for 1993 has been reported at 22.6 percent. Dane Director Rodolfo Uribe says that the 1.13 percent increase in Christmas prices was mainly due to increases in the cost of gasoline at the end of the year. Housing costs for December reflected the greatest increases and were rated at 1.37 percent followed by food that registered a 1.18 percent increase. Clothing, health, transportation, and education registered below average increases. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 3 Jan 94 pp 1, 9)
