FBIS4-36773 "drnes114_d_94001" FBIS-NES-94-114 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 Libya Palestinian Claims Responsibility for Lockerbie Bombing Palestinian Claims Responsibility for Lockerbie Bombing LD1306215694 Tripoli Libyan Television Network in Arabic 1930 GMT 13 Jun 94 LD1306215694 Tripoli Libyan Television Network Arabic BFN [Text] Foreign news agencies and radios reported today that a Palestinian national, Yusuf Sha'ban, who belongs to Fatah-Revolution Command, stated before a Lebanese court that he carried out the bombing of Pam Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, six years ago. These media organs, including AP, CNN, and REUTER quoted the Palestinian national as saying: I brought down the airliner over Lockerbie. I have already told the investigators, but my confession was not recorded. I repeat here what I have already said. The Palestinian national's statement is the latest development in the so-called Lockerbie case. It is an element which should acquit the two Libyan nationals who have been indicted by America and Britain. These two countries should, furthermore, refrain from levelling such a false accusation if they really want to discover the truth. The state-controlled Voice of America has stated that Yusuf Sha'ban's confession will embarrass the Western powers, which have repeatedly accused the two Libyan nationals of masterminding the incident. The attorney of the two Libyan nationals, Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, states that such a confession affirms his belief that his two clients are not guilty. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] What will be the position of your clients following the latest development? [Al-Ghuwayl] Actually, this is a very important development. Had matters been proceeding normally toward finding the truth this new development should have drawn people's attention to carry out a comprehensive investigation in the presence and under the supervision of neutral and decent foreign lawyers, judges, and human rights observers. It was a coincidence that Mr. Mitchell, who is my first assistant in the defense team, was here to examine the defense of the civil case against our two clients. We have been following the news with great interest. And it is our intention to ask -- in our capacity as the defense team and in the name of the accused -- the director of the criminal chamber of the [Beirut] district which was conducting the case, counsel Philip Khyr Alla, to investigate the new development, in view of the fact that the news agencies have reported that there was no indication that the Lebanese state prosecutor, Mr. Sa'id Mirza, took seriously the confession of the Palestinian national. Given the fact that such information is serious, and that we have a legitimate and serious interest in it, we will, thereby, be requesting an opportunity to continue our investigation in the presence of a number of honorable and decent Lebanese, Arab and foreign lawyers and human rights observers. We will be informing the president of the court of the name of our colleague who will be selected to represent us in Lebanon in order to take the necessary measures in conformity with the law in order to enable us, in our capacity as a party with a legitimate interest in the case, to follow such investigation seriously. We believe that any serious and unbiased investigation into this confession will affirm our firm belief in the innocence of our clients and that the truth will surely come to light and will prevail.
