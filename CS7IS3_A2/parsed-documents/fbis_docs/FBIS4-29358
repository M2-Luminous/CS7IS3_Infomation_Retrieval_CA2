The report said a plan to lower the maximum annual sales, below which businesses are allowed to keep the consumption tax they have collected from consumers, from the present 30 million yen, should be shelved. The report was released at a general meeting of the commission. The commission is expected to present a report on a set of tax reform recommendations, focusing on income tax cuts and a raise in the consumption tax from the present 3 percent, to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on June 22. The draft report also said the maximum annual sales for businesses to which a simplified tax computation formula is applicable should be cut from the present 400 million yen but did not propose a margin for reduction. It also called for a revision of the present system of allowing businesses with annual sales of less than 50 million yen to keep some of the consumption tax income. The report did not propose a specific margin of increase for the consumption tax but did say tax burdens for Japanese will grow from increased fiscal demand for welfare measures. It also said the combined maximum tax rate for income and residential taxes should be cut to 50 percent from the present 65 percent.
