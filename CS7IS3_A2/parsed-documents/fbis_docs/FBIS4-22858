Chachin] [Text]The conversion of defense enterprises to the manufacture of civilian products has already been occurring for several years. Nonetheless, the state conversion program has not yet been developed, and discussions on ways to implement it continue. While ways to solve the problem are being discussed, conversion continues. Many major, well-known defense enterprises which are part of the Aviation Industry Department, Radio Industry Department and Communications Industry Department of the Russian Industry Ministry (now the Russian Federation State Committee on Defense Industries), are beginning to fill civilian orders. Their activities in the telecommunications field can be attested to by the exhibits shown at the end of last year in Moscow at the ``Conversion-92'' International Fair Showroom, the ``Science, Business, and Industry to Agriculture'' displays, and the ``Communications-93'' International Exposition organized in May of this year. Materials from these exhibitions were used to prepare the article published below. In the Russian Federation, where 69% of enterprises and organizations of the former U.S.S.R.'s military industrial complex are concentrated, conversion encompasses a wide circle of industrial enterprises, research institutes, and construction, operating and other organizations. In order to use their potential in the interests of developing a civilian communications network, the following main conversion trends have been provided for: - redirecting the industrial, scientific and technical potential to produce and develop communications equipment for civilian purposes; %using military communications equipment that has already been created and is already in production by making the necessary modifications for the economy; %using scientific and technical achievements obtained during the development of military devices in order to create modern civilian communications equipment. The main trend in the work to convert enterprises from military to civilian production is the creation of telecommunications systems and equipment within the framework of the Russian Federal Target-Oriented Program for Developing Communications Equipment and Information Systems in 1992-1995. The components of these programs (conversion programs for individual enterprises and scientific research institutes) have undergone an expert's analysis in the Communications Industry Department and Ministry of the Economy of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Finance and Russian Central Bank. Military communications equipment is being more widely used in the civilian industries of the economy. Though operators on geologic expeditions, on gas and oil pipelines, in energy networks and so on previously thought it was an impossible dream to acquire this military equipment, now many former limitations have been removed. A significant percentage of special radio communications and radio relay communications equipment commercially-produced by enterprises of the military industrial complex can be used without any kind of significant modifications or modernization in various spheres of the economy, especially in the agro-industrial complex, where advantages of military equipment such as operation in broad temperature ranges, dust and moisture resistance and anti-shock qualities of the equipment, independent electrical powering, easy maintenance, etc., may be required to the greatest degree. These types of devices are small ones (hand-held and driven) for dispatcher communications, stationary radio communications devices, radio relay and tropospheric communication devices for arranging interregional, regional and technical communications. In total, specialists of the ``Telecom'' joint-stock company have calculated that about 40 types of communications devices can be supplied to consumers in the economy without any type of alterations. Some types of these devices are made by the Popov Factory AN Production Association (Nizhni Novgorod). Among them are R-980 ``Canoe'' mobile control centers, R-849M1 mobile communications radio unit, and the R-986 communications unit. Among the purely civilian communications equipment, the ``Iset'' digital radio relay system must be mentioned. It was developed by the ``Vektor'' State Enterprise (Yekaterinburg) and operates in the 15 GHz range of telephone channels (with a digital information transmission speed of 8.448 Mbit/sec) between urban and rural automatic telephone stations and telephone stations of individual industrial and commercial facilities. The digital information transmission distance is no less than 30 kilometers for one transit of the radio line. The stationary equipment of the ``Iset'' radio relay station connects with standard devices of IKM-120, IKM-30 and IKM-15 digital transmission systems, which markedly simplifies its usage in local communications networks. The ``Polet'' Scientific Research Institute (Nizhni Novgorod) is one of the largest producers of aviation radio communications equipment in the country. It is offering portable radio stations, automobile data transmission terminals, etc., to the economy. The ``Moscow Scientific Research Television Institute'' Joint- Stock Company creates low-power television retranslators and transmitters, cable television systems, television monitoring receivers, and a specialized computer for colored television studios. The low-power television retranslator is designed to provide television broadcasting to small towns blocked by the local relief from the direct signal of a powerful television transmitter. A small-power television transmitter generates and radiates standard high frequency television display and sound signals on any given channel in meter and decimeter wave ranges. It can also be used to provide television broadcasting to small towns located along radio relay line routes, to create local broadcasting television centers in small towns, collective farms, and state farms, and to organize training television centers, etc. The commercial system of cable television is designed to distribute television programs to subscribers along fiber-optic communications lines via subscriber switches located remotely from the program distribution point. This allows the transmission of one of eight television programs with sound to the subscribers' receivers at their selection. The number of subscriber switches is not limited in this system. Backward channel equipment for cable television systems permits data to be exchanged between the head station and distribution network devices, as well as subscriber devices, in order to broaden the number of services provided to the subscriber, and in order to make it possible to supervise the status of the distribution network and the line, distribution and house amplifiers, as well as other engineering facilities located in homes serviced by that cable television system. By using this promising equipment, subscribers can obtain additional services, such as fire and intrusion detection for rooms, medical assistance, and pay-per-view for commercial television programs. The KTV-1 specialized computer is designed for colored television studios, mobile television stations, training television centers and video libraries. It generates a TV signal of text and graphic information simultaneously with the control room signal and allows work to be carried out in the mixing, special effects and rear projection modes. The KTV-1 can use a variety of text and graphic editors and programming languages. The use of this device allows the technical and creative potential of television studios to be broadened. The ``ASTRA'' Scientific Production Association has developed a stationary transmitter-receiver control room called ``Liliya-S,'' which is designed to be placed at terminals of reporting radio relay junction lines of the ``Liliya'' and ``Liliya-1'' type, and to service television channels and the sound accompaniment channels of reporting radio relay lines. It is possible to place from one to six reporting radio relay line terminal units in the control room. Depending upon how it is equipped, the stationary transmitter- receiver control room services from one to three duplex communications channels. The control room corrects, controls and switches video signals and sound accompaniment signals, remotely controls the antennas, loud speaker and telephone communications, and dispatcher radio communications. The ``Vektor'' state enterprise manufacturers TMS-1517 and TMS- 1517V international and long-distance pay phones. Payment for conversations is made with coins, tokens, or by credit card. There is precise control of the tokens, money and credit cards; slugs are weeded out; the deposited tokens are counted; the number being dialed and the connection time remaining after the next coin or token has been collected are optically displayed; the sum remaining can be used to pay for making a connection with another subscriber with the appropriate recalculation of the tariff; conversations are automatically tariffed; and pay phones are monitored from the automatic control panel. The Lavochkin Scientific Production Association, the Academician A. A. Raspletin Scientific Production Association of the Russian Federation, the ``Radio'' Scientific Production Association, MRTZ (Moscow) and a number of other organizations are developing the ``Nord'' commercial satellite communications system. This system is designed for the northern regions of Russia, in particular the Tyumen region. The system will include a full set of space and ground equipment created under a unified project. This will allow qualitatively new services to be provided to stationary (fixed) and mobile subscribers, and will ensure the system functions no matter what state the traditional domestic communications equipment is in. It will be possible for users to have direct access to the satellite via their individual stations, which will make two-way subscriber communications possible almost throughout all of Russia and the foreign countries, bypassing the existing communications network. Individual fixed communications stations can be interfaced with the local telephone network. An operating mode and signals which correspond to international standards have been provided for. The stations will provide telephone, telefax and telex communications, and intercomputer data exchange according to international protocol. Portable stations with 1.5-2 meter antennas will be developed. The frequency range is 11-14 GHz. Satellites of the ``Nord'' system will be launched from the territory of Russia into a high elliptical orbit with a 12 hour orbital period. The highest point of the orbit (40,000 kilometers) is located in the northern hemisphere at 63 degrees latitude. Within a 24 hour period, the satellite will rise above the northern hemisphere two times. The length of the communications session last 6.5 hours on each loop. Thus, one satellite provides communicates for practically all regions of the northern hemisphere in a 24 hour period, as well as a portion of the southern hemisphere for two time intervals lasting 6.5 hours each. The total time is 13 hours. If two satellites are functioning, 24 hour communications is provided. `` Nord'' plans to use three or four satellites in the system for redundancy. The use of satellites in elliptical orbits for timely communications in the northern hemisphere is advisable for several reasons. First, all northern hemisphere countries which are inaccessible to traditional communications satellites located in geostationary orbits fall within the line of sight of each satellite. Second, effective communications at high latitudes are possible. Third, launching a satellite into an elliptic orbit requires significantly less expenditures and can be carried out in a compressed time schedule (the advantages in launch time and cost of the carrier rocket are a factor of five to six), and the cost of providing the services can be two or more times less that the existing level of both world and internal Russian prices. This year there are plans to assemble and perform surface testing of two satellites. The Makeyev Design Bureau (Miass) is developing a personal satellite communications system. In order to implement this system, the ``URALKOSMOS'' Joint Stock Company has been formed. It has been directed to attract support for the project from commercial structures. The personal satellite communications system is similar to the ``Iridium'' system of the American Motorola Firm. Since it has its own carrier rockets which can launch satellites into low orbits (approximately 700 km), the specialists of the design bureau have decided to independently develop a domestic system. V. Kalashnikov, the leading specialist of the marketing service of the Academician Makeyev ``Space-Rocket System'' Machine Building Design Bureau feels that, ``...there is no problem in connecting these two systems.'' The cooperative of development engineers includes about 100 enterprises and organizations. The number of communications satellites in the orbital group will be 32-48. The frequency range will be 1.5-1.6 GHz. The information transmission speed will be 32 kbit/second. The creation of several types of terminal equipment has been proposed, from stationary systems, which include a computer, telex, printer, and fax, to simple portable stations weighing from one to two kilograms. The latter can be of wide use in expeditions, geological teams, for servicing gas and oil pipelines, electrical networks, in special services, etc. The Radio Device Construction Scientific Research Institute (Moscow) is developing the ``Signal'' mobile satellite communications system. The ``Energiya'' Scientific Production Association and the ``Polet'' Production Association are among those carrying out the project. It is a commercial system based on low orbiting satellites. It contains a central amplifier station, a flight control center, a space segment composed of 48 artificial earth satellites, a base station network consisting of 5 stations, and subscriber stations. The number of orbits is 4, the inclination is 72 degrees, the elevation is 1,500 kilometers, and the satellite's orbital period is 116 minutes. As a launcher, the ``Tsiklon'' carrier rocket will be used. A launch is planned in 1993, and deployment into the national system in 1995. Deployment into the global system is planned for 1997-2000. Based on the space communications devices launched into operational orbits by the ``Energiya'' carrier rocket, the ``Globus'' space communications system is being developed. Space devices for the system are being created on the basis of achievements made by the ``Energiya'' Scientific Production Association and on the basis of cooperation in the area of complex space systems, including the ``Energiya-Buran'' shuttle transport system and piloted orbital systems. A spacecraft's potential to position heavy payloads with large power-to-weight ratios of unified space platforms allows retranslators to be furnished on one craft. These retranslators simultaneously carry out several functions (fixed and mobile communications, and direct television broadcasting). This potential also allows the productivity of the satellites to be sharply increased, and the number required in orbit to be sharply decreased. Moreover, it simplifies and reduces the cost of receivers. The Moscow-based Radio Communications Scientific Research Institute is creating the ``Oreol'' on-board retranslator, the ``Kanat-1S'' on-board antenna system, the ``Potok-P1'' and ``Potok-P2'' small satellite communications stations, the ``Format-P'' device, the ``Shtrikh-P'' channel receiver and a demonstration program for processing satellite information. These are being created for a domestic space system for observing the Earth's surface. This system is based on the ``Planeta-S'' geostationary satellites and is similar to the Meteosat European system now being operated at the present time, the American GOES, the Japanese GMS and the Indian ``Insat.'' The ``Potok-P2'' small satellite communications station (radio buoy) is designed to receive and transmit formalized messages from meteorological data collection platforms. The ``Potok-P1'' station only receives messages. Both stations can operate on vehicles, on geological expeditions and in other areas. They meet the requirements of the international information collection system. The on-board ``Oreal'' retranslator collects and transmits data from data collection platforms and from ice exploration aircraft on the hydrometeorological and heliogeophysical situation on the Earth's surface and in the world's oceans. It transmits televised information on cloud, ice and snow cover on the Earth. Its functions also include the transmission of data on the radiation and magnetic situation in near-Earth space, and the distribution of weather maps and other processed meteorological information to users. With the launch of the domestic artificial Earth satellite for operating in the global operational meteorological satellite system, the country has obtained a large flow of meteorological and geophysical information for use in the economy. The Avtomatiki Scientific Industrial Association (Yekaterinburg) has developed the IGLON inertial satellite system. The system is designed for navigation of spacecraft, aircraft, sea and lake craft, and automobiles, as well as for determining coordinates when resolving mapping, geodesic and geophysical tasks. The system includes a small inertial gyrostabilized platform and a multichannel receiver for radio navigation signals of the GLONASS and NAVSTAR satellite systems. Depending on consumer requirements, it is thought that various models of the IGLON device will be manufactured. Each has different characteristics and design. Among the other interesting developments in communications, there are the ``MAG'' subscriber station (President's Federal Agency of Governmental Communications and Information of the Russian Federation), the packet communications controller (COMPAS-R., Ltd. packet communications company), the multifunctional antenna system (``Fayvish Sheyner and Co., Ltd.'' joint stock company in Nizhni Novgorod and the Pravdin Factory of Radio Relay Equipment), the ``STELA-64'' automatic electronic telephone station (SVT Scientific Production Association in the city of Kirov), the KST-300 telephone scrambler (coding device on a digital channel) and the KST-101 device for closed communications (``KOMREK'' joint stock company in Moscow). The ``KOSMOS'' Joint Stock Company (in Krasnoyarsk) has developed the ``Kosmos-S'' satellite communications system, which is designed to: (1) organize communications in inaccessible regions; (2) create organizations which make it possible for banks, stock exchanges, trade houses and other producers of goods and services to begin using the newest electronic operating technologies; (3) create commercial informational data bases on various fields for Russian and foreign users; and (4) to open international computer networks to Russian users. The ``Kosmos-S'' satellite communications system is based on the usage of stationary artificial Earth satellites of the ``Gorizont,'' ``Raduga,'' and ``Express'' type, and it consists of a network of ``Kosmos-SA'' ground subscriber stations which operate under the command of a ``Kosmos-STs'' ground central station. In 1993, 60 subscriber stations were deployed in Russian territory and neighboring countries. In future, their number will be increased to 1,000-1,500. The DALS firm (St. Petersburg) is one of Russia's leading developers and manufacturers of telecommunications systems and equipment for various purposes. Using the potential that was released under conversion, this firm has created a number of new products. The mobile radio fire and intrusion detection warning system developed by the firm is a wireless system for fire and intrusion detection for various industrial, cultural, and agricultural facilities. It is significant in that the devices can be deployed, dismantled and set up again in a new location quickly. It has various configurations, depending on the specific requirements for facility protection, and it operates without regard for the serviceability of the facility's main electrical power network. There is one other product of the firm--the SA-1 hearing aid for individuals with weakened hearing. It is made in a small, over-the-ear case, and is held in place on the outer ear with a sound wire that ends with an ear insert. The device is equipped with a volume control, and a switch for conversation modes where the speaker is present or is speaking on the telephone, and a power switch. The ``TEKOS, LTD.,'' Company (Moscow), which was created in 1992 on the basis of the Central Machine Building Scientific Research Institute which studies space research, has developed a telecommunications and message processing system. The system uses effective, fairly inexpensive domestic technology which combines a personal computer with a packet switching network based on the MKKTT X.25 and X.32 recommendations. The system insures the confidentiality and safety of information being transmitted and processed by using special, certified software and hardware. At the present time, TEKOS is widely used in banking (clearing house) organizations for transmitting information. The RAZAN Radio Factory offers the R-173-1SV radio station, which provides two-way telephone radio communications that do not require fine-tuning or searching between stationary stations, nor between mobile objects on any of the six pre-established frequencies. The Nizhegorod ``Kvarts'' Scientific Research Instrument Building Institute has developed a BM-01 TMS pay phone which is designed for long-distance conversations between cities using a credit card distributed by the communications division. The pay phone automatically establishes payment for a conversation based on zone and time, independently establishes tariffs for the automatically established connections and makes the appropriate annotation on the credit card. The degree to which the monetary assets of the credit card are used during the conversation is displayed on the digital indicator. The pay phone is connected to the subscriber lines, which are equipped with a device for automatically determining the number. Access to the long distance telephone network is provided along the record operator's connecting lines. The ``YARZ'' Joint Stock Company (in Yaroslavl) with the St. Petersburg subsidiary of the RADIO Scientific Production Association have created ``Kompleks-MG'' equipment for digital radio relay lines, which provides communications along a narrow radio beam in the 10.7-11.7 GHz range at a distance of 15-45 kilometers. The series 300 modern equipment system for distribution television networks and cable television has been developed here, in conjunction with the Minsk ``Gorizont'' Production Association. This system includes a head station, linear, main line and home amplifiers, and television modulators. Thus, hundreds of enterprises of the defense complex are prepared to find peaceful uses for their resources, and they are ready to cooperate with the communications industry, with new commercial organizations and foreign business partners who need their potential.
