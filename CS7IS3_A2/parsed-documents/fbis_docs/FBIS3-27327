He made the remark here this afternoon at a news conference. "There are great potentials for cooperation between our two countries. The agreement on trade and economy signed by the two governments will provide a firm legal basis for our future cooperation," said Meciar. "China has a huge market as well as great economic potential, which is sure to expand in the future. We are glad to have opportunities to cooperate with China." Meciar emphasized:" the People's Republic of China is one of the first countries which recognized Slovakia's independence, and is also the first Asian country to set up an embassy in the capital of Slovakia." Meciar said Slovak people attach great importance to such an attitude by China to Slovakia. Replying to a question about Taiwan, Meciar said that the Government of People's Republic of China is the sole legal Government of China, and Slovakia does not support Taiwan's admission into the United Nations. "The trade and commercial relations between Slovakia and Taiwan will never grow to the stage or level of political recognition," Meciar said. He noted that the issue of Taiwan is China's internal affair, and it is only the Chinese people who can decide the arrangement concerning Taiwan. Meciar also answered questions about regional issues in Europe. Meciar and his party visited the Great Wall this morning and left for Shanghai, the biggest industrial city in China, this afternoon.
