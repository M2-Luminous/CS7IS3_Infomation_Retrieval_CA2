The decrees signed by Czechoslovak President Eduard Benes after the end of World War II were the legal basis for the expropriation and expulsion of many Sudeten Germans. Waigel, who addressed 660 members of the CSU working group "Union of Expellees" in Neusaess near Augsburg, dealt with the wish of East European states to become members of the European Union (EU). The CSU is "open to it." However, as Waigel further stressed, these states would also have to be prepared to accept the European legal system with the relevant law on ethnic groups and expellees. As spokesman of the Sudeten German ethnic group, Franz Neubauer stressed that the right to one's homeland includes the right to return. "It is not decisive how many will really make use of it."
