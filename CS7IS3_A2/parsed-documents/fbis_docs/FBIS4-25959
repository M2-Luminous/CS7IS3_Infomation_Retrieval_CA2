"Under the industrial policy, until the end of 1995, no projects domestic or foreign involving the making of whole cars will be approved," while restrictions on imports will continue, the vice minister of the State Planning Commission, Ye Qing, told reporters. Foreign companies will instead be encouraged to invest in factories producing components and spare parts to promote the backward sector's technological upgrading, Ye quoted the Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry, issued by the State Council, as stipulating. "We welcome extensive cooperation with foreign partners in the sphere of component parts," the official said, revealing that any companies involved in successful projects in this sphere would be given priority when China freed up restrictions on assembly plants after 1996. The extent of such liberalisation would depend on China's economic development and the market demand for family cars at that time, he said, defending the moves by saying the domestic industry remained in its "infant stage" despite 30 years of development. The new policy also outlines moves to rationalise and upgrade technological levels in the sector, while encouraging localisation of component purchasing by offering preferential treatment to factories buying more than 60 percent of their parts domestically within three years, Ye said. Rationalisation is to focus on restructuring the country's 120 scattered, small-scale car plants into bigger groups producing better quality vehicles, of which most are to be family cars, he said. The country's 1.18 billion people now own only 8.3 million cars, with family vehicles accounting for only small proportion of China's auto output of 1.18 million units last year. "By 1996, we will satisfy 90 percent of the domestic market demand and over half of auto output will be cars," he said. By 2000, basic restructuring of plants into "three big and three small" conglomerates would be complete, with the three major groups "accounting for the majority of sales on China's domestic market," he said. Ye said the three groups -- which reports say are to produce five million cars by 2000 -- would be centred around plants in northeastern Changchun, Shanghai and central Wuhan that have joint ventures with Germany's Volkswagen-Audi, Volkswagen and France's Citroen respectively. Although he did not explain how the restructuring would affect other existing foreign-funded car assembly projects in China, foreign carmakers here played down the implications of the policy paper. Most major international players are already manufacturing cars here, they said, adding they were now stepping up involvement in projects making components and establishing links with key members of the "big three" to ensure their position in China after 1996. Of greater concern to foreign manufacturers are the continuing restrictions on imports. Foreign cars now face import tariffs of 150 percent. The Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry was the first of a series of specific policy statement due to be issued under the Framework of National Industrial Policy for the 1990s, also released by the State Council recently. Other policy papers are to include such sectors as transportation, telecommunications, construction, electronics and machinery, petrochemical, foreign trade, foreign investment and technology, Ye said.
