FR941212-0-00024 FR941212-0-00012 33 CFR Part 165 [CGD01&hyph;94&hyph;155] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone; New Bedford First Night Fireworks Display, New Bedford Harbor, New Bedford, MA agency: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. summary: The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone in New Bedford main ship channel south of the New Bedford/Fairhaven Bridge in the vicinity of New Bedford Channel Lighted Bell Buoy 16 (LLNR 16895), during the New Bedford First Night fireworks display. This safety zone is needed to protect vessels in the vicinity of the display, as well as personnel onboard these vessels, from potential hazards associated with the fireworks display. effective dates: This regulation is effective between the hours of 11 p.m. December 31, 1994, and 1 a.m. on January 1, 1995, unless terminated sooner by the Captain of the Port Providence. There will be no rain date for this event. for further information contact: LT J.C. Wong of Marine Safety Field Office New Bedford at (508) 999&hyph;0072. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LT J.C. Wong, Project Manager, Captain of the Port Providence, and LCDR F.J. Kenney, Project Counsel, First Coast Guard District Legal Office. Regulatory History Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Due to the date the application was received, there was not sufficient time to publish proposed rules in advance of the event. If the event, which is centered around a national holiday, were required to be postponed by publishing an NPRM, the event would be cancelled. Publishing an NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to the public interest since the fireworks display is to celebrate the New Year's national holiday. Background and Purpose On December 31, 1994, the city of New Bedford is sponsoring a fireworks display in celebration of New Year's Eve. The fireworks will be launched from a barge anchored in New Bedford Channel in the vicinity of New Bedford Channel Lighted Bell Buoy 16 (LLNR 16895), beginning at 12 midnight December 31, 1994. This safety zone will be established within a 350 yard radius around the fireworks barge. The fireworks display will last for approximately one half hour. The purpose of this rulemaking is to establish a safety zone to prohibit vessels from transiting or anchoring in the area of New Bedford Harbor over which the fireworks will be launched, in order to protect these vessels and the persons onboard from potential damage, fire, or personal injury due to sparks and falling debris. The safety zone will be in effect between 11 p.m. on December 31, 1994, and 1 a.m. January 1, 1995, and will effectively close New Bedford Channel in the vicinity of New Bedford Channel Lighted Bell Buoy 16 (LLRN 16895) to all vessel traffic during the period. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The entities most likely to be effected are pleasure craft wishing to view the fireworks from the water as well as fishing vessels and other commercial vessel traffic wishing to transit the area. Spectator vessels will still be able to view the fireworks from the water but will be required to do so at a distance of more than 350 yards from the barge, which will not cause them undue hardship. Fishing vessels will be prohibited from transiting through the area while the zone is in effect. This will not have a significant economic impact on them because of the short duration of the zone and extensive advisories which will be made. Most of the fishermen who work out of New Bedford are aware that the fireworks and accompanying safety zone will be in place the evening of December 31, 1994. The commercial terminals in the harbor have been notified and any scheduled traffic will be aware of the safety zone. Thus, this safety zone should not cause undue hardship to any entity.
