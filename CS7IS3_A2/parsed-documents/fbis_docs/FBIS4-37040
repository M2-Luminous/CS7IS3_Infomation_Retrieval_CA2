His objective is to hold talks on regional and international developments and political and security matters between Iran and Turkey. In a statement after his meeting with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, 'Ali Besharati-Jahromi recalled the favorable relations between the two countries and stressed that neither a security nor a political problem exists between Iran and Turkey. He also described the cooperation between the two countries on the struggle against terrorism as a positive outcome of the uninterrupted contacts between the officials in Tehran and Ankara and outlined Iran's uneasiness over the activities of certain anti-Iran elements in Turkey. The situation in northern Iraq and the bearing it has on security in the region was a focus of the talks 'Ali Besharati-Jahromi had with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. Iran and Turkey have established strong relations because of their historic, religious, and cultural ties as two neighboring countries. The cooperation between the two countries within the framework of the Economic Cooperation Organization is a factor that enhances their relations. Meanwhile, the meetings of the Turkey-Iran Joint Security Committee in Tehran and Ankara constitute one of the results of the important agreements the two countries have reached to promote their cooperation on security matters. Iran's approach is based on the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of foreign countries. 'Ali Besharati-Jahromi stressed that the friendly relations between Iran and Turkey are motivated by the concept of good-neighborly relations and noted that Turkey's enemies have no place in Iran. He also stressed that Tehran is well aware of Turkey's problems and regards Turkey's foes as its own enemies. The Iranian and Turkish officials had discussed the question of peace and security on the common border between Iran and Turkey and the developments in northern Iraq several times in the past. Tehran and Ankara support the maintenance of Iraq's territorial integrity. In view of that, the two sides call for an urgent solution to the problems in northern Iraq. The continuation of the clashes will further complicate the situation and create instability in that region. A tripartite meeting will be held on the matter in Damascus between Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The outcome of the assessment of the developments in Iraq will be very important. Meanwhile, matters concerning relations between Iran and Turkey will be discussed once again when President Suleyman Demirel visits Tehran in July. The two countries are expected to draw up an effective plan to strengthen their bilateral cooperation in the near future.
