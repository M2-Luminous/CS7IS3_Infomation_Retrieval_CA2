The self-styled "general for peace" said that the Army "has opened the doors to pacification" in this country where an armed conflict has created hatred and violence. During a meeting with the Foreign Press Club, Enriquez reported that the 47,000-strong Army has begun to draft new objectives for itself in order to adjust to the national situation that will emerge once the armed struggle initiated 33 years ago concludes. Enriquez explained that the military reorganization process is considering disarming 17,000 members of the 400,000-strong paramilitary Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC] as well as redefining the Guatemalan State defense policy. He added: "Once a peace agreement is signed, the Armed Forces could be dedicated to defending the 3,000 archaeological sites that international bands of jewel-traffickers loot, protecting the borders, and preventing the indiscriminate felling of trees in Peten (in northern Guatemala), one of the areas considered to be a world lung. Regarding troop reduction, Enriquez said that the Guatemalan Army is small and should be increased to 100,000. However, he said that if the peace agreements call for a reduction, the institution will obey. The general said that "quality can substitute for quantity," which means making the Army, which has been accused of violating human rights, more professional. Right now, the Guatemalan military favors Refashioning the Military [Reconversion Military], which means tasking the Army with functions that up to now have been carried out by other institutions. These functions include natural disaster assistance, the eradication of drugs, and environmental protection. Guatemala is the only country in Central America in which a war is under way, and for this reason, according to Enriquez, the Army justifiably maintains its role as defender of the state and nationality in the face of an enemy inspired by a foreign ideology. The government and the rebel Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity are continuing a peace negotiation process, and it is expected that by August the discussions will be centered on the guerrilla demand for the "demilitarization" of the country. This means not only the reduction of the military force but also the elimination of its influence in society. The defense minister, one of the 11 Army generals on active duty and who has worked for the institution for 29 years, expressed his satisfaction with the way the peace negotiations with the guerrillas are progressing. He said he is pleased with the presence in the country of a UN Preliminary Mission. This mission is determining what technical and financial requirements must be met to establish an international verification program in Guatemala. Referring to the establishment of a truth commission similar to the one that operated in El Salvador, Enriquez said it would be "biased and would try to weaken the Army's morale." The military commander said that the military institution would accept resolutions on human rights violations only if the government of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio accepts a commission of this nature. He regretted that the guerrillas "will not share responsibilities for assassinations, kidnappings, war taxes, and other illegal actions against the interests of the nation." Enriquez said: "The president will decide whether or not such a commission is created. We do not want biased recommendations, though." Enriquez accused the guerrillas of violating the Global Human Rights Agreement signed on 29 March. According to Enriquez, the guerrillas carried out illegal actions in the combat zone of Ixcan, in the northwestern Department of Quiche, a zone known also as the "heart" of the Poor People's Guerrilla Army. Enriquez charged that some nongovernmental organizations are still giving economic assistance to the guerrillas for the purchasing of weapons. He noted that the current Guatemalan Administration is trying to secure evidence that these organizations are helping the rebels as well as trying to prevent them from entering the country.
