According to Kirsteins, Kozyrev's remarks are only partly related to the recent visit by U.S. President Clinton to Moscow, because statements made by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher during his recent visit to Latvia are already evidence of the existence of an agreement between the United States and Russia that Russia should maintain a military presence in Latvia. It has been clear for a long time that Russia will not leave Latvia of its own accord and that it does not wish to withdraw its troops from the Baltics, Kirsteins explained. He noted that Russia always interprets differently remarks made by its officials, and it is therefore necessary to receive from the Russian Government a more detailed explanation of Kozyrev's statement in the near future.
