The details follow: His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan has expressed his happiness with the near completion of the second phase of the reconstruction of the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, which demonstrates further interest in improving the Arab and Islamic image in Jerusalem. His highness said that the maintenance and reconstruction of the sacred Islamic places are aimed at supporting the Arab Islamic identity in the holy land because this is a sacred matter and an inevitable duty. His highness said that the completion of the maintenance and reconstruction work for the Islamic places in Jerusalem will have moral significance, especially during these days of the blessed month of Ramadan because good work is rated above all other considerations. Answering a question by the Saudi Press Agency correspondent in Amman on his highness' feelings regarding the initiative of the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, concerning the collection of popular donations from all Saudi regions for reconstructing and saving the Islamic shrines in Jerusalem, his highness said: The decision by the custodian of the two holy mosques to support the Islamic shrines in Jerusalem, which is the first of the two qiblahs [direction to which a Muslim turns during his prayers] and the third holiest shrine, is a good decision and a lofty tradition, especially when it comes during the blessed month of Ramadan. His highness added: The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, led by His Majesty King Husayn, views this decision by Saudi Arabia with respect and appreciation because it contributes to supporting and strengthening the Arab nature of Jerusalem and protecting the Islamic shrines in it, a policy which Jordan--king, government, and people--has always sought to continue and promote through coordination and cooperation with all the Arab brothers. He asserted that this step by the Saudi brothers clearly contributes to realizing Arab solidarity. It is a continuation of the previous steps and stands of the custodian of the two holy mosques and the Saudi brothers toward the Islamic shrines in holy Jerusalem. His highness said: Moreover, the Saudi steps can also be understood within the framework of promoting the Islamic appeal by His Majesty King Husayn concerning the religious authority [al-wilayah al-diniyah] in holy Jerusalem, an authority which recognizes only the moral sovereignty of God the Almighty, a sovereignty that takes into account the rights of the Muslims to express their historical and religious gains and to exercise their rights inside their city. He called on Arabs and Muslims to take the necessary measures to realize this religious authority and sovereignty over holy Jerusalem and the Islamic shrines. His highness expressed his thanks and appreciation for the initiative of the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, in this blessed month and said: I can see that this initiative demonstrates an absolute interest by Saudi Arabia--king, government, and people--in the human contribution for the good of holy Jerusalem.
