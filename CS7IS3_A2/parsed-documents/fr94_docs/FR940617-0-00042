During the Bidder's performance hereunder, the Bidder shall take out and maintain fully paid insurance providing not less than the minimum coverage required by 7 CFR part 1788, subpart C. The Owner shall have the right to require public liability insurance and property damage liability insurance in an amount greater than those required in 7 CFR part 1788, subpart C. If this requirement is included in the plans and specifications used for bidding, the added costs shall be included in the bid price. If the requirement is added after the Contract is approved, the additional premium or premiums payable solely as the result of such additional insurance shall be added to the Contract price, by Contract amendment. Upon request by the Administrator, the Bidder shall furnish to the Administrator a certificate in such form as the Administrator may prescribe evidencing compliance with the foregoing requirements. Section 4. Purchase of Materials. The Bidder shall purchase all materials and supplies except software outright and not subject to any conditional sales agreements, bailment lease or other agreement reserving unto the seller any right, title or interest therein. Materials and supplies other than software shall become the property of the Owner as the Owner makes payments therefor to the Bidder in accordance with Article III, Section 1(a). Section 5. Software License. The software licensing agreement, if required, covering the rights, terms and conditions of the use and assignability of all software integral to the operation of the Project(s), shall be in the form of Addendum 1 to this Contract. Section 6. Assignment of Guarantees. All guarantees of materials, equipment, workmanship and software running in favor of the Bidder shall be transferred and assigned to the Owner upon Completion of the Project and at such time as the Bidder receives final payment. Any such guarantees shall be in addition to the Bidder's warranty defined in Article II, section 7. This provision may be modified with respect to a particular warranty if the Bidder demonstrates to the satisfaction of REA and the Owner that a transfer is not possible. Section 7. Patent, Copyright, Trademark and Trade Secret Infringement. The Bidder shall hold harmless and indemnify the Owner from any and all claims, suits, and proceedings for the infringement of any patent, copyright, trademark or violation of trade secrets covering any equipment or software used in the work, except for items of the Owner's design or selection. If the Owner's use of equipment or software is enjoined, the Bidder shall promptly, at its own expense, modify or replace the infringing equipment or software so that it no longer infringes but remains functionally equivalent, or obtain for the Owner a license or other right to use. This shall be in addition to any other rights or claims which the Owner may have. The Bidder shall, at its own expense, (and the Owner agrees to permit Bidder to do so,) defend any suits which may be instituted by any party against the Owner for alleged infringement of patents, copyright, trademark or violation of trade secrets relative to the Bidder's performance hereunder. Either party shall notify the other promptly of any such claims, and the Owner shall give to the Bidder full authority and opportunity to settle such claims, and shall reasonably cooperate with the Bidder in obtaining information relative to such claims. Section 8. Compliance with Statutes and Regulations. The Bidder shall comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations. The Bidder acknowledges that it is familiar with the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 U.S.C. 901 et seq. ), the Anti-Kickback Acts, as amended (40 U.S.C. 276c; 41 U.S.C. 51 et seq. ), and any rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto, and 18 U.S.C. 201, 286, 287, 641, 666, 874, 1001, 1361 and 1366, as amended.
