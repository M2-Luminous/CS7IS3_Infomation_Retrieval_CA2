He added: What has been achieved there so far is considered a very great accomplishment which has rescued the Dome of the Rock. We can only express our thanks and gratitude to Jordan for what it has done in this field. In a press statement after meeting with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali at the Prime Ministry today, al-Husayni emphasized the importance of the Jordanian role and the support the Jordanian Government extends for the efforts of the religious establishments in Jerusalem in order to protect the holy shrines there. He said it was agreed that the Islamic Awqaf Establishment will shoulder full responsibility for restoration actions in the holy al-Aqsa Mosque and the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. He said the enormity of the events and the circumstances surrounding us require us to boost current coordination to reach the level expected from us during the next stage. He added that during his meeting with Dr. al-Majali, which was also attended by Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for cabinet affairs and information minister, and the Palestinian ambassador in Amman, he discussed several issues, including Jerusalem. Great emphasis was placed on this subject and on concentrating on bilateral coordination concerning this important subject. Answering a question by the Jordanian news agency on the Cairo agreement, which the PLO and Israel recently signed, al-Husayni said: Expediting Israeli withdrawal and starting to implement the agreement will undoubtedly be a step forward, and we hope that Israel will apply the agreement in a manner that serves the spirit of the agreement. On the international observers who will be deployed in Hebron, and whether their number is enough to protect the population of this city, al-Husayni said that what is enough to protect the population in Hebron is an Israeli withdrawal and the uprooting of the Israeli settlements in the area. He added the international presence is something new that will undoubtedly serve the Palestinian position, and that although it is not enough to protect the Palestinians, it will be an assisting factor. The meeting discussed in detail the situation in Jerusalem and the need to preserve its Arab character, as well as the restoration works on of the Dome of the Rock and the holy al-Aqsa Mosque. At the meeting, it was agreed that the subject of Jerusalem is one of the most important issues, therefore, the two sides emphasized the need to activate the Jerusalem Committee that Jordan and the PLO had agreed to set up within the framework of comprehensive coordination between Jordan and the PLO.
