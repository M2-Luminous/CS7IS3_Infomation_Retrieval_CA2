The ministry is to allow more freedom under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law on deposits, securities transactions, direct investment, lending and borrowing, and import-export accounts. For overseas nonyen deposits by residents, the amount which is free of ministry permission will be raised to up to 100 million yen from the current 30 million yen March 1. Referring to last year's statistics, a ministry official said overseas foreign currency deposits with between 30 to 100 million yen accounted for about half of the 130 deposits approved overall. The same measure will be taken for investment by residents on overseas securities and by nonresidents on domestic securities. The nonpermission amount for nonbank lending and borrowing between residents and nonresidents will be raised to up to 100 million yen from the current 10 million yen. On the current 10 million yen limit per case for trading houses and other firms using an accounting method of offsetting export and import payments between head offices and overseas branches, the ministry will allow an increase of up to 100 million yen from April 1. The period for leaving the payments on the accounting record for settlements through the offsetting method will be extended to six months from the current three months. The ministry will also abolish and ease March 1 various reporting obligations linked to the above regulation revisions. The move is intended to "improve convenience and further facilitate overseas dealings amid international financial transactions becoming increasingly active," ministry officials said. They said the measures are in line with an agreement late last year under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)-sponsored Uruguay Round of multilateral talks and also with an administrative reform outline decided by the government Tuesday.
