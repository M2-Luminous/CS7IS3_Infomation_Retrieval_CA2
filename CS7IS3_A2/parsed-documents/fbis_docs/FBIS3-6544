The blanket license to make test hi-vision broadcasting is currently granted to the Hi-Vision Promotion Association. The association is made up of 140 companies, including the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), commercial telecasting companies, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), major trading companies, electrical manufacturing companies and banks. The license is due to expire at the end of this year. Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Takenori Kanzaki is considering taking that occasion to switch to individual licensing -- granting licenses to individual broadcasting companies. Kanzaki asked the Radio Regulatory Council about his proposal, seeking a recommendation by about May. Kanzaki hopes to grant licenses to individual telecasting companies this summer. Experimental broadcasting hours will be divided between or among the companies that have won licenses. Kanzaki's proposal forms part of his ministry's policy of expanding and reinforcing hi-vision broadcasting. That represents part of the ministry's preparations for the start of regular hi-vision broadcasting, using the first of next-phase broadcasting satellites to be launched in the summer of 1997. Kanzaki's inquiry to the council drew applause from Mikio Kawaguchi, NHK president, who said, "I am very pleased by today's inquiry." Kawaguchi said the ministry has clearly articulated its policy on hi-vision broadcasts, and its commitment to hi-vision's future.
