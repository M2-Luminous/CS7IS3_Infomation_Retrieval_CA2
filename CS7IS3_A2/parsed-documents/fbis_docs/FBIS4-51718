The latest round of fighting is centred about two kilometres from the Thai border opposite Ta Phraya District. A few shells fired by 122 mm artillery pieces landed near border checkpoint No 26 at Ban Non Mak Mun in Ta Phraya District but caused no casualties. The checkpoint is manned by about 150 rangers of the 12th Ranger Regiment and Ta Phraya Task Force. At 10 a.m. about 200 Khmer Rouge soldiers of the 519th Division under Mit Sau launched an attack on Ban Yaeng Dangkum, a government position, which was protected by about 300 government soldiers under Gen Lai Veera. The stronghold was overrun by Khmer Rouge shortly afterwards. Thai military sources said 12 Cambodian government soldiers were killed and many others wounded. The Khmer Rouge soldiers set fire to the weapons and supply dumps at Ban Yeang Dangkum. Billowing columns of thick black smoke were clearly seen from the Thai border at checkpoint No 26. The sound of gunfire could also be clearly heard around the position, indicating heavy fighting in the area. Cambodian government gunners at Ban Nimit artillery base at kilometre 12 on Route 5 opened fire in support of their ground troops at about 1 p.m. More than 25 rounds landed on the Thai side of the border but caused no casualties or damage to property. A Thai L-19 reconnaissance aircraft and a helicopter of the Burapha Force flew over the border to observe the fighting but did not fire any warning shots.
