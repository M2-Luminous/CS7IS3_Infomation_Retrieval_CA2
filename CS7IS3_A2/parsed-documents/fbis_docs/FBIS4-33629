Do not impose your work pace on us. We are in a special situation, involved in a struggle, which was lost in advance, stated Minister of the Interior and National Defense Willio Nouailles, who was invited to appear on 6 June by a group of senators. He said he wished the senators would give the government time to act as needed at this juncture. Edner Jean filed a report: [Begin recording] [Jean] The first case discussed by the office of Senator Sansaricq was security, including cliches about corpses being devoured by pigs after having been murdered by armed civilians. Romel Manigat, president of the Interior and National Defense Commission, asked Minister Willio Nouailles about the executions committed by political and paramilitary formations as well as the overly brutal interventions by the agents of order, who are in some cases known to all. Another question raised by the commission was the measures the provisional government intends to take to force awareness of their responsibility on those who need it, in view of guaranteeing national sovereignty, which is being threatened. Regarding the boat people, the provisional government has just reactivated the decree repressing clandestine trips. Is this a test to make Washington yield, asked Romel Manigat, whose election has been contested. What are the duties of the Armed Forces in this case, he also asked. Regarding 1994 elections, the Interior and National Defense Commission considers that the provisional government is already late with its electoral agenda. Some arrangements should have been made before parliament reopened to proceed to an immediate start of the electoral process, according to the Senate led by Bernard Sansaricq. To all these questions, the minister of the interior responds that it is not a question of opening a box and coming out with a ready-made solution. Do not tell us what to do, just let us do it, he exclaimed. The minister of the interior of the ad hoc government further warned those legislators against any attempts to influence Judge Emile Jonassaint's policy. May each one work in the fields that he knows, he maintained. Moreover, Willio Nouailles added, and I quote: You have forced us into the ring, but please, let us act, let us have our own experiences. He offered a good political mathematics lesson to those legislators in terms of equations and tangents: [Nouailles] It is necessary to make an equation, with at least eight unknowns. It is necessary to calculate intensities. It is necessary to make charts of variables. It is necessary to draw some curves. You want a muscular policy, an epidermic policy, a pocket policy. I indeed notice this haste, this great haste. Your president is a patriarch of 82 years. The pace that you impose on him is the kind that can break his neck. Haste is a bad adviser in this type of ruse. In any case, after eight years of drift, I would not want to see you impose on the provisional government the burden, all the weight, the entire cross of this huge, [word indistinct], tragedy. You must understand that this ad hoc government that you have formed finds itself [word indistinct] on a creation mission. [Jean] Willio Nouailles thus demands more time to pursue his creative work. The government intends to create new democratic structures in the country and to take all the time necessary to prepare for future elections. Willio Nouailles stated before the Senate led by Bernard Sansaricq that the government is an ad hoc government, set up by an ad hoc senate for the national safeguard. The minister of the interior reminded them that the Senate was split in two and that the government did not have the recognition of the Chamber of Deputies. Regarding the threats of foreign intervention, the minister of the interior and national defense said history honors us to fight the whole world. He added, however, one can be Dessalines or Capois La-Mort, but Vertieres is no longer possible in 1994. To the office led by Bernard Sansaricq, the minister of the interior and national defense exclaimed in these terms, quote: You have entrusted me with a battle that was lost in advance. Unquote. And so as not to leave room for the enemy, Willio Nouailles thinks he can still use the arm of dialectic. [Nouailles] For a small country like Haiti, its struggle is dialectic, a philosophical struggle, a conceptualist struggle, a struggle at the level of methodology, at the analysis level. It is not a struggle in either open or closed fields. Even a guerrilla war is now impossible. [Jean] In general, Willio Nouailles pleaded at length for the undertaking of power by the middle classes. In this respect, he praised the exploits of Dumarsais Estime and Francois Duvalier. Modern history makes the middle class accountable for politics in Haiti. He criticized the traditional bourgeoisie for having, according to him, formed a parallel government for the purpose of ruining the efforts of the provisional government. He was here referring to the ad interim Prime Minister Robert Malval. The minister of the interior and national defense further pointed out that it is up to the Army to determine the social class qualified to take power in Haiti. [end recording]
