Following a series of meetings by party representatives, it was agreed to increase the number of seats in four constituencies and cut those in four others to achieve more balanced representation. One seat will be added each to constituencies in Kanagawa, Saitama, Miyagi and Gifu Prefectures, while Hokkaido will lose two and Hyogo and Fukuoka one each. The ruling and opposition parties excluding the Japan Communist Party plan to submit the reform bills in the current Diet session. Proposals to reduce the total number of seats by two from the current 252 and to introduce a vote-for-individual formula into the 100-seat proportional representation system were both scuttled. Members of the 252-seat upper house are elected either in multiseat constituencies or in a 100-seat proportional representation system, in which votes are cast for parties, not individuals. Because the parties failed to agree on any striking electoral reform, the upper house poll scheduled for summer will see little change from the current system. Diet passage of the proposed changes, however, is far from secured, with the end of the current session on June 29 approaching, political sources said.
