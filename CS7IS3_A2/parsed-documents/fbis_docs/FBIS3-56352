The minister told a meeting of Russian ambassadors in the CIS and the Baltics that raising the issue of a complete end to Russian military presence is an "extreme approach". According to Kozyrev, the solution lies in the middle between a complete withdrawal and full military presence. "We should not withdraw from those regions which have been the sphere of Russian interests for centuries and we should not fear these words about the military presence", the minister said. A "security vacuum" will emerge as soon as the Russian troops leave the region which will be "inevitable filled in by forces which are often not friendly, and in many cases even directly hostile to Russian interests", Kozyrev said, adding that the CIS and the Baltics comprise a region of "priority vital interests for Russia which also poses the major threats to the interests". The conflicts and problems in the former USSR directly affect Russian internal developments and everyday life, according to the minister who added that at the same time the region opens vast possibilities for better relations and friendly contacts, as well as for enhanced Russian influence. Kozyrev listed the protection of the rights of Russians in the former Soviet republics as a major strategic foreign policy task and added that the issue of dual citizenship is the key one in the policy. "A better mutual understanding has been reached in this aspect of late", he said. Other priority tasks include the creation and improvement of cooperation mechanisms, the drafting of a short-, medium- and long- term strategy of creating an economic union, according to Kozyrev. He said an "individual approach" is necessary in this aspect, especially in monetary unification. "An all-round assessment of the issues is necessary and such mechanisms should be created which would allow Russia to avoid unjustified expenses while the republics would not feel themselves pushed aside and would not look for new partners", the minister said. The CIS has already reached such a degree of maturity when it feels it desirable to "become a member of world processes". "It is developing from a regional into a global factor", Kozyrev said.
