Our legal correspondent Shlomo Arad reports that one of them, Yo'el Shem-Tov, was tried and sentenced to 14 days in military prison after refusing to serve in Hebron. His commanders, however, waived the sentence and stationed him at a post which does not conflict with his conscience. A spokesman for the Yesh Gvul [there is a limit] Movement said, however, that another reservist, Peter Weiner from Tel Aviv, was arrested last night at his home in Tel Aviv after he refused to report for duty with his unit which serves in the territories.
