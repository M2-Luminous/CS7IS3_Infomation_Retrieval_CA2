Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto confirms that an unofficial inquiry has been received from the United Nations and the matter is currently being studied. [Begin Haavisto recording] For the time being it is a very preliminary contact. It seems that the United States will be sending more peacekeepers than before to the territory of former Yugoslavia and apparently they would like to station them in FYROM. The question has been raised whether consideration could be given to the possibility that the post of the Nordic battalion there might be changed. [passage omitted] [end recording] Finland's current law on peacekeeping prevents Finnish soldiers from being sent to the warring Bosnia. Now people are waiting to see whether a debate will resume on amending the peacekeeping law. At least Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn is in favor of increasing the peacekeepers' right to self-defense that would make it possible to send them to Tuzla, for instance.
