ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council have agreed on a final rule to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) concerning Federal Supply Schedules and Federal Supply Schedule contracting. These changes are a result of GSA's efforts to streamline and revise the Multiple Award Schedule Program's ordering procedures to be guiding principles. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Linda Klein at (202) 501&hyph;3775 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAC 90&hyph;21, FAR case 93&hyph;613. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The efforts to streamline and revise Multiple Award Schedule ordering procedures in order to make them more susceptible to guiding principles will save the Government time, money, and improve the accessibility of commercial items to customers. With these changes, GSA will be able to foster a Government that works better and costs less. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The final rule does not constitute a significant FAR revision within the meaning of FAR 1.501 and Public Law 98&hyph;577, and publication for public comments is not required. Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply. However, comments from small entities concerning the affected subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAC 90&hyph;21, FAR case 93&hyph;613), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.
