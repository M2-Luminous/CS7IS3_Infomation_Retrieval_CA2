The tasks of reform include fully implementing the major reform measures enacted by the central authorities, undertaking careful organizational efforts, and providing specific guidance in accordance with the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to ensure smooth implementation of the reforms in question. Reform should be closely linked to economic construction to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. From 11-20 February, Li Tieying visited enterprises and rural areas in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Yangzhou, and Zhenjiang cities to assess the progress made by urban and rural areas in carrying out reforms in economic, cultural, and other fields. Li Tieying pointed out: The current economic situation and reform status are excellent, and we are faced with rare opportunities. The central authorities have enacted or will soon enact a set of plans to reform structures in the macroeconomic arena and other fields. Reform has moved into a new stage of full-scale intensification and overall coordination. The main task of reform for all localities is to seriously study, thoroughly understand, and fully implement the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, as well as the reform plans developed by the central authorities. This year, we should tackle key reform tasks, whose scale and scope are unparalleled, and whose arduousness and complexity we should fully recognize. All localities should formulate implementation plans, undertake careful organizational efforts, provide specific guidance, and improve upon the current favorable situation in light of their realities. The reform process will inevitably lead to new problems and circumstances, which we should study without delay to make timely adjustments and sum up our experiences in earnest. We should show a pragmatic spirit, ensure the smooth implementation of various reforms, and further promote development through reform. During the tour, Li Tieying invited the leaders of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou cities; the persons in charge of the planning and economic commissions and the economic restructuring commissions of those cities; and some entrepreneurs to an informal discussion to solicit their opinions on the "Plan on Establishing an Experimental Modern Enterprise System." Participants in the discussion noted: All localities are seriously studying ways to establish a modern enterprise system, which was considered the microeconomic basis of the socialist market economic system, an effective means for combining public ownership with the market economy, and vitally important for invigorating large and medium state-owned enterprises and for establishing a new socialist market economic system. Li Tieying noted: The proposal for instituting a modern enterprise system represents a review of our experience over the past 10-plus years in carrying out actual enterprise reforms and in conducting theoretical explorations; it points the way for reforming state- owned enterprises and signals a shift in our country's enterprise reform toward initiating a new enterprise system through the readjustment and development of our country's policy of delegating power and allowing enterprises to retain profits. Judging from the current situation, we are still in an experimental stage of establishing a modern enterprise system. The experiments the State Council plans to carry out in some 100 enterprises constitute explorations for a new enterprise system, and will provide experience in establishing a modern enterprise system. For the majority of enterprises, the prominent issue is to improve quality, strengthen management, and stress efficiency. They should conscientiously change their mechanisms in accordance with the "Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Enterprises." They should also establish a financial and accounting system that meets the demands of a market eocnomy in accordance with the "two sets of regulations," to create conditions and lay the groundwork for the next stage of reform. Li Tieying fully affirmed the achievements scored by the Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou regions in economic development, reform, and opening up. He said: The past 10-odd years have witnessed rapid economic development in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou cities, whose total output of goods and services exceeded 100 billion yuan in 1993, or half the provincial total, and whose industrial and agricultural output value surpassed 300 billion yuan, or three- fifths of the provincial total. These achievements were mainly born of reform. People in the three cities seized opportunities to conduct bold explorations in deepening reform and opening wider to the outside world, thereby gaining a wealth of useful experiences; these experiences deserve to be summed up earnestly. Li Tieying particularly noted: Although village and town enterprises are the dominant force in this area, they should further exploit their flexible mechanisms by deepening reform. Li Tieying and the leaders of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou cities jointly studied ways to increase regional cooperation, deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, and take advantage of the cities' proximity to Shanghai to promote development in the region during the new period. Li Tieying said: The State Economic Restructuring Commission and the provincial economic restructuring commission should lend full support to the region's reform experiments. By focusing on establishing a modern enterprise system, they should earnestly coordinate work between higher and lower levels and between departments in changing government functions, in nurturing markets, and in carrying out overall supplementary reforms of the social security, personnel, cadre, and income distribution systems with a view to creating an even better external environment for regional cooperation and overall advancement in development and reform in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou cities, and to providing the cities more experiences in promoting development and stability through reform.
