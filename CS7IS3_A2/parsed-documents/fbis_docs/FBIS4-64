Gen Viljoen questioned the manner in which Mr de Klerk had declared the state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu, saying he doubted denials that the African National Congress and National Party [NP] had not planned the emergency beforehand. He said he would consider inviting all parties, excluding the NP and ANC, to discuss whether the elections should be held in April. CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg also criticised the announcement. He said the intention was to overthrow the kwaZulu government and to compromise Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's authority. He said there could be no talk of a free and fair election under a state of emergency.
