Mitterrand, in an exclusive interview with AFP on the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit in Brussels, also reiterated his opposition to a resumption of nuclear testing by France and dismissed any possibility of his country rejoining the alliance's integrated military command. President Charles de Gaulle pulled France out of NATO's integrated military command in 1966. NATO's "first priority is to take into account Europe's identity" in terms of defense, Mitterrand said. "In the United States, the Clinton administration seems willing to take into account this progressive ability by the European Union."
