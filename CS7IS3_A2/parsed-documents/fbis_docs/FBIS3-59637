Two leading electronics firms, Bull and Sextant Avionique, bear witness to its advantages. Today, most industrial strategy advisers recommend that firms implement concurrent engineering. This is probably why there were so many TDM systems at the Productique 93 show, which was held from 22 to 26 November at Paris-Nord Villepinte. This software, supplied by Bull, IBM, Digital, and Win Technology, allows the various sections of a company (design, methods, production, sales) to communicate in real time and thus to be able to work in parallel, which is the basis of concurrent engineering. "TDM enables all those involved in the production process to ratify each new stage of a project. The result is that requests for technical modifications, particularly those from the production department (which cost from 100 to 100,000 times more than in the development phase) are far less numerous. The product therefore costs less and also comes onto the market faster," explained Francois Ulff of Sherpa, a company specializing in TDM, at a conference on the subject at Productique 93. Bull, which both supplies a TDM product (called Bull PDM) and uses such a product, estimates that the cost saving can be up to 50 percent and that time-to-market can be reduced by 75 percent. According to Sextant Avionique, which has also acquired a TDM system, improved traceability is another advantage of these systems: "To reduce our costs, we try, in moving from one application to another, to reuse modules, and TDM makes this easier as it allows us to store the entire history of each module," explained the company's representative. Although those present acknowledged that considerable investment is required and that implementation takes time because TDM involves all divisions of the company, they all asserted that there is a rapid return on the investment. "After around one year," they claim.
