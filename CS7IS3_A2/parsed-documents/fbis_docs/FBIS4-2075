China's sustained, fast and healthy economic growth and its grandiose development plan will create even more favorable trade and investment opportunities for U.S. enterprises, the minister told XINHUA in an exclusive interview barely a week before she starts her U.S. trip with a trade delegation. JCCT Session Important Wu said that the most important thing during her mission is to co-chair, with U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, the Eighth Session of the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade (JCCT), scheduled for April 13-14 in Washington, D.C.. The annual government-level meeting is a most important occasion for discussing bilateral economic and trade relations and other related issues, she said. It represents another major event following the Sino-U.S. summit meeting in Seattle and the talks between finance and foreign ministers of the two countries. She revealed that during the forthcoming session, the two sides will discuss trade and investment policies, and cooperation and issues concerning legal matters in such areas as information, energy, transportation, chemical industry and environmental cooperation. The Chinese delegation will hold trade and investment symposiums in Los Angeles and New York on April 11 and 19 respectively, she said. More Investment Projects China will offer about 800 investment projects for discussion at the symposiums to be jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the U.S. law firm Graham and James, and the U.S. Asian Association. It will be China's largest trade and investment promotion activity to be held in the United States so far. The Chinese trading group will be made up of senior officials, experts and business executives from eight ministries and commissions of the State Council, three national corporations and 26 provinces and municipalities. The projects to be offered include the construction of hydroelectric and thermal power stations, highways, railways, airports and wharfs and projects in industrial raw materials for the machine-building and electronic equipment, electronics, petrochemical and metallurgical industries as well as in agriculture, livestock breeding and forestry. The trading group also plans to buy U.S. goods worth hundreds of millions of U.S.dollars. Obstacles The minister said that bilateral trade and U.S. investment in China have grown continuously in recent years despite some problems that have cropped out from time to time. According to statistics from the General Administration of Customs of China, the bilateral trade jumped from 2.45 billion U.S. dollars in 1979 to 27.65 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, a rise of more than 11-fold. The number of U.S.-funded projects in China has topped 8,000 in the same period, involving a total investment agreed upon reaching 11 billion U.S. dollars, topping the list of all foreign investment. More than 50 of the top 500 U.S. firms have opened businesses in China. She said that a major reason for the rapid development of bilateral trade and cooperation is the fact that the two economies are highly supplementary to each other. If the bilateral trade and cooperation are to further develop, Wu Yi said, the U.S. side should take further steps to remove man-made obstacles. This includes the lifting of the control on U.S. technology export to China, the resumption of financing to feasibility studies for projects undertaken by the U.S. Trade Development Agency, the resumption of risk guarantee by the private U.S. Investment Co. for U.S. Investment in China, and the resumption of preferential loans by the American Import and Export Bank to relevant construction projects in China. "Such actions will help further tap the vast potential of China's imports from the U.S. and the U.S. investment in China," Wu said. MFN and GATT On the most-favored-nation (MFN) status, Wu said, as a purely trade issue, it should not be entangled up with issues with which it has nothing to do. A proper handling of MFN status is an important condition for the further development of the bilateral trade and economic cooperation, the minister stressed. China has long opposed the practice of linking MFN status to human rights issues, as views on human rights differ greatly from country to country, she added. China and the United States have differences of views on the human rights issue and they may discuss them through other channels on the basis of mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs and seeking common ground while preserving differences, the Chinese minister stressed. The two sides should in no way let this non-trade factor to stand in the way of furthering the bilateral trade and economic cooperation. On the issue of China's restoration of its contracting party status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Wu said that major progress was made in the 16th session of the GATT working party on China last month. During the session, most GATT members voiced their support for China's early re-entry into GATT, Wu said. The United States had promised to firmly support China's re-entry into GATT and China hopes that United States will "keep its promise and be as good as its word".
