According to Governor Fu Xishou, one of them is to improve the contract responsibility system for land utilization. "This is the key to stabilizing rural policies," he said. The provincial government has decided that after the 15-year contracts for land utilization expire this year, farmers may renew their contracts for 30 years more. During the contract period farmers are entitled to lease or mortgage the land or become share-holders. The period of contracting for barren mountains, land and water surface may extend up to 70 years. Anhui is one of China's major agricultural provinces. Although some five million rural laborers left the fields for urban areas to seek employment last year, the province still reaped a grain harvest of 25.96 million tons, an increase of 10.8 percent over the previous year and becoming the only province in southern China to record a grain increase. The past decade has seen this East China province not only become self-sufficient in grain but also sell more than two billion kg of grain a year to other parts of the country. "The establishment of a grain reserve system and a grain risk foundation is another measure," the governor noted. The provincial government plans to reserve 600 million kg of grain to ensure timely grain purchase from farmers and arouse their enthusiasm for farm production. In addition, Anhui will increase its input into agriculture. While continuously boosting its grain output, the provincial government is determined to pay attention to quality and efficiency in line with market needs. It will concentrate on the production of quality rice, cotton, oil-bearing crops, tea, livestock and poultry, silk, fruit, vegetables, aquatic products, traditional Chinese herbal medicines and edible fungus this year. According to the governor, the government will select 10 counties, 20 production bases and 50 administrative villages to try out an overall agricultural development project. Meanwhile, the government is determined to reform the census registration system to gradually transfer 10 million surplus rural laborers to urban areas. At present, the governor noted, Anhui is growing grain on six million ha of land, and is expected to produce 25 billion kg of grain this year, about the same as last year. Its summer crops are growing well. The governor disclosed that the province still has three million people, accounting for five percent of the provincial population, living below the poverty line. The provincial government has vowed to exert more efforts to help these people to rise above the poverty line within three to five years and live comfortable lives within eight years. To reduce farmers' financial burdens, the provincial government has already revoked 87 charges.
