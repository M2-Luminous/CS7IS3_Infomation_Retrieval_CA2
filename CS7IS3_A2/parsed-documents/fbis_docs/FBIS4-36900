FBIS4-36900 "drnes115_c_94005" FBIS-NES-94-115 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 Egypt Success in Containing Terrorism Noted Success in Containing Terrorism Noted NC1406123394 Cairo AL-AHRAM in Arabic 10 Jun 94 pp 1, 3 NC1406123394 Cairo AL-AHRAM Arabic BFN ["Calmly" column by Ibrahim Nafi'] [Excerpt] Based on highly trustworthy sources and confident of the accuracy of my information, I can say that Egyptian security has now succeeded in completely containing the terrorism phenomena and in accomplishing what has not been done by previous security efforts throughout the past years, that is, to fully penetrate the secret terrorist organizations that have tried to destabilize Egyptian society and distort the image of the Islamic religion in the eyes of the world. This penetration, which is long overdue and succeeded by virtue of the current wise security policy, has achieved tremendous results in the past few months in liquidating one terrorist ring after another and uncovering all their leaders, financial sources, and lines of communication. What remains are only sporadic pockets that will be liquidated one after the other and no day will pass without the arm of security and stability uncovering one of them. This does not mean that we should belittle the danger of the hidden fingers that are still moving terrorism from inside or outside our country. This also does not mean that we must relax the policy of firmly confronting terrorism, which is being pursued by all sectors of the state, until this destructive wave that has undermined our domestic life and affected our economy and the livelihood of large segments of our people has receded completely.
