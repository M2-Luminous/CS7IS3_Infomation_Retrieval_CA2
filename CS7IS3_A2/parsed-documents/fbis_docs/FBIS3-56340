Our correspondent Yelena Kuznetsova reports. [Kuznetsova] At the start of the news conference, Vladimir Shumeyko analyzed the difficult situation that developed on the second day of parliament, when they were just one vote short of electing him chairman, and the way this situation changed by the third of work of the chamber. [Begin Shumeyko recording] I would say this was a normal thing in a situation in which the chamber did not want confrontation of any kind among political groupings or factions. Nevertheless, there were people who hold pretty much polarized views over what is happening in the state right now. On the one hand you have the prevailing concept that we have to get parliament all working together. But many people think that in order to achieve this it is necessary to elect a leader who shares their political views. And gradually yesterday's voting showed this; it was natural that in the first instance everything should move apart. Subsequently, an analysis of the situation overnight showed that if they continued in that direction no single group would gain more votes and the split would continue. This would eventually lead to mutual insults and so on. The situation today showed that in fact common sense prevailed. [end recording] [Kuznetsova] In response to a question about what should be avoided in the chamber's work, the Federation Council chairman said he will try to avoid behind-the-scenes intrigues and he hopes that there will be no factional activity in parliament. Asked about possible cooperation with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy should the latter be elected speaker of the State Duma, Vladimir Shumeyko said quite unambiguously that he is obliged to cooperate since the law exists, regardless of one's attitude to one's partner. Speaking of the Federation Council's obligation to ratify major international agreements, Vladimir Shumeyko said: [Begin Shumeyko recording] If we are to speak about treaties, then we really are faced with complicated tasks. And here I would express solidarity first of all with the statement made by Foreign Minister Kozyrev, who said quite clearly that the West should stop moralizing and preaching at Russia. Russia is not a state that needs to be told what to do and so on. That is one thing. Another thing is that one of Russia's main priorities should be concern for the interests of what is referred to today as the Russian-speaking population. [end recording] [Kuznetsova] Replying to a question about the appearance of a tough Communist opposition within the Federation Council, Vladimir Shumeyko named 12 people from various communist parties and noted the existence of quite a large group who share this ideology. Much will depend on which deputies are elected by the chamber. It is precisely this question that will be the main focus of the Federation Council's work on 14 January.
