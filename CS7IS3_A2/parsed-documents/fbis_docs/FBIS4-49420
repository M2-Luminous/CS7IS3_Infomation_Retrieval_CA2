The company, which was founded in the 1950s, now has key production plants such as a blast furnace, a steel plant and a rolling mill, and auxiliary plants for making machinery, and providing electricity and water. It also has a construction team, as well as a hospital, schools and a food-processing factory. The production efficiency of the company has long been hindered to some degree by this complicated network of installations, and the per capita output of steel of the workers in the company is around 40 tons a year, equal to only one fifth of that of the Baoshan Iron and Steel Company based in Shanghai. Beginning in August 1992, the company has attached great importance to the improvement of its efficiency and worked out concrete measures to achieve this goal. The measures include reducing surplus labor from the production line and diverting it to other work, and separating steel production from other departments. Now, the company's team engaged in the production of iron and steel has been reduced from the former 120,000 to the present 50,000. The endeavor has begun to pay off. Last year, the company produced 5.234 million tons of steel, an increase of 5.35 percent compared with the previous year, and the per capita production of steel of the company rose to 100 tons. It also produced 5.4 million tons of pig iron last year, up 6.6 percent compared with the corresponding figure for 1992, according to company officials. In the first four months of this year the company turned out 1.7 million tons of steel and 1.8 million tons of pig iron, both showing sharp increases compared with the related figures for the same period of last year.
