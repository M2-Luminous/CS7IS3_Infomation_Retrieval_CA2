Mondale conveyed Inman's wish to Aichi when he visited the Japanese Defense Agency chief, officials said. Aichi also expressed the hope of meeting with Inman at an early stage, the officials said. On Aichi's hope for an early visit to the United States, the Defense Agency is now trying to arrange a trip but it could be delayed until March or later because of Japanese Diet affairs and the compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget, official sources said. Last December, President Bill Clinton named Inman, a former top Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official, to succeed Aspin as defense secretary.
