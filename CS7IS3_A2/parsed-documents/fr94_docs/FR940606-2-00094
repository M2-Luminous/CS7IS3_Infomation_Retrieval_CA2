FR940606-2-00094 FR940606-2-00061 The Index will be calculated using a capitalization-weighting methodology. The value of the Index was set to equal 200 on December 1, 1993. The formula for calculating the Index value is as follows: E:GRAPHICSEN06JN94.002 Where: Total Capitalization = Sum of Market Values (price x shares outstanding) for all component securities Divisor = The number which, when divided from the total capitalization when the Index was initially calculated (on December 1, 1993), yielded an Index value of 200 The Index divisor will be adjusted for changes in the capitalization of any of the component securities resulting from mergers, acquisitions, delistings, substitutions, and other like corporate events. The formula for adjusting the divisor is as follows: Adjustments in the value of the Index which are necessitated by the addition and/or deletion of an issue from the Index are made by adding and/or subtracting the market value (price x shares outstanding) of the relevant issues. The Index value will be updated dynamically and disseminated at least once every 15 seconds during the trading day. The Phlx has retained Bridge Data, Inc. to compute the value of the Index. Pursuant to Phlx Rule 1100A, updated Index values will be disseminated and displayed by means of primary market prints reported by the Consolidated Tape Association and over the facilities of the Options Price Reporting Authority. The Index value also will be available on broker/dealer interrogation devices to subscribers of the option information. E:GRAPHICSEN06JN94.003 In accordance with Phlx Rule 1009A, if any change in the nature of any stock in the Index occurs as a result of delisting, merger, acquisition, or otherwise, the Exchange will take appropriate steps to delete this stock from the Index and replace it with another stock which the Exchange believes would be compatible with the intended market character of the Index. Index options will be traded pursuant to the current Phlx rules governing the trading of index options, particularly Phlx Rules 1000A through 1103A, and generally, Phlx Rules 1000 through 1070. Index options will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' and will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month, and the last day for trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the expiration date. The Phlx proposes to employ position and exercise limits pursuant to Phlx Rule 1001A(b)(i) and 1002A, respectively. 2 Exercise price intervals will be set initially at five point intervals, and additional exercise prices will be added in accordance with Phlx Rule 1101A(a). 2 Because, as of March 11, 1994, AT&T represented 31.15 percent of the Index, the position and exercise limits applicable to options on the Index are 5,500 contracts, respectively. See Phlx Rules 1001A(b)(i) and 1002A.
