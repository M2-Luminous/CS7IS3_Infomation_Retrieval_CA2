According to Jin Renqing, Chinese vice minister of finance, the proceeds of this bond issue will be used to finance projects in sectors of energy, transportation and communications in China. The one billion U.S. dollar global bond was launched on February 2 and broad distribution, one of the key objectives of the Ministry of Finance, which represents China, has been achieved, Jin noted. "The success of the global debt offering is to set up a bench-mark for other Chinese financial institutions to tap international capital markets, in particular, the U.S. market in the future," said Jin at a press conference held today at Merrill Lynch's New York headquarters. The Chinese Ministry of Finance has worked for nearly a year in preparing for this global bond offering. Last year, U.S. credit-rating agencies were invited to China to reassess the sovereign credit rating on Chinese foreign debt. The U.S. firm Moody's raised China's sovereign foreign debt credit-rating from BAA1 to A3 while another agency Fitch assigned an A-rating for China, whose economy continues to thrive. Soon after, in the name of the People's Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance successfully issued a euro-yen bond in the eurobond markets and a U.S. dollar dragon bond in Asian market. Zhu Guangyao, division chief, World Bank Department of the ministry, told XINHUA that the offering of this one billion dollar global bond was the largest amount China has ever had. Before the launching of China's first global bond offering, a delegation of the Finance Ministry has visited 12 major cities in Asia, Europe and the United States for road show in the last two weeks. "International investors have given very strong response," Jin added, "through this offering, we have strongly felt that international investors have expressed keen interest while showing confidence in the future development of China." A registration statement relating to these securities, which has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, became effective today. According to Zhu, about 60 percent of the bonds were sold at the United States, and the rest sold at other global markets. Merrill Lynch and other international security firms have cooperated to form a strong syndicate group for this offering. Vice Minister Jin said that China will tap the international capital markets on a regular basis in the future in accordance with the funding requirements for China's economic construction and conditions of the international marketplace.
