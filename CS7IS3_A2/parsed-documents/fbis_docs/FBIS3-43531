National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces have shelled the northeast part of the city of Cuito, capital of Bie Province, causing 10 deaths and seriously wounding others. Our correspondent Abel Abreu reports from the area: The government forces -- firm and decided as always -- have repelled yet another attack by UNITA forces. The dead were buried in several cemeteries across the city, and silence, pain, hatred, and indignation were reflected in the faces of the mourning family and friends who accompanied the bodies in funeral processions.
