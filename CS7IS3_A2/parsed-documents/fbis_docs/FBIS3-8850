After being stripped of the post of ambassador, Filkus was expelled from the then ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and entered the Alliance of Slovak Democrats (ADSR), headed by the former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko. Professor Rudolf Filkus was born on September 2, 1927 in Bratislava. After graduating from the School of Economics he worked for 20 years in the Economy Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences, which he had to leave for political reasons. In 1972-1989 he worked in the Price Research Institute and the National Economy Central Institute. In 1990, after the fall of communism in the country, he returned to the Economy Institute. From January to June 1990, Filkus was a deputy to the House of the People of the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, elected for the Public Against Violence (VPN) movement. From August 1990 to May 1991 he held the post of minister for economic strategy. After the split of the VPN he joined the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), and between July 1991 and March 1993 he chaired the HZDS Council. From June to December 1992 he was an HZDS deputy to the Federal parliament's House of the People. From July to December 1992 he was the first vice-premier of the Czechoslovak Government, (proposed by the HZDS), and minister in charge of the management of the Federal Inspection Ministry. In March 1993 Filkus was appointed Slovak ambassador to Austria. On August 24 he was dismissed from the post at the initiative of then Premier Vladimir Meciar for what Meciar called "repeated unloyal behavior toward the executive body of state power". Filkus handed his resignation from the post to President Michal Kovac on September 13, saying he did not want to nourish the tension between Kovac and Meciar. On September 22, the authorized HZDS district body decided on Filkus's expulsion from the movement. In November 1993 Filkus entered the ADSR and soon became its deputy chairman.
