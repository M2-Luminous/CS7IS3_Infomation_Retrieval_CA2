The document, presented to the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in February, said the United States wanted to see participants in the multilateral Middle East peace talks "encourage individual and collective freedoms and pursue democracy and pluralism." It said relations between states in the region should be based on such concepts in the future. Foreign Ministry officials from GCC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman met in Riyadh Saturday to discuss the document. They had "reservations" about the proposals, the diplomats said. The ministry officials were to coordinate their positions on the document and review their participation in the multilateral talks, launched at the Madrid peace conference in 1991. Of the six GCC states only Kuwait has a freely elected parliament with various political groups represented. The other five have specially-appointed consultative assemblies. On Tuesday the multilateral working group on water resources -- one of five set up in Madrid -- ended talks in Oman with agreements on five projects to boost scarce water supplies and establish Israeli-Arab cooperation. The talks were attended by an Israeli delegation, visiting a Gulf Arab country for the first time ever. Qatar is due to host a meeting of the working group on disarmament from May 2 to 5. The other three groups deal with economic cooperation, refugees and the environment.
