Everything indicates that the withdrawal of U.S. radars in Andoas and Iquitos in March 1992 was an important setback. The U.S. radar in Yurimaguas, which was to be a key weapon in the antinarcotics air fight, never amounted to anything. Since its installation in February 1993 the radar had suffered several malfunctions, which put it out of operation on several occasions. Under optimum conditions the radar should have been able to detect up to six targets at once in a 200-mile radius. This radar never functioned properly, however. This radar is 32 years old. It dates back to 1962 and is of very inferior quality to the one the U.S. Government installed in Peru in 1991. The other two radars, installed in Andoas and Iquitos in November 1991, were withdrawn in March 1992. During this period 12 small planes with drug shipments were seized, and dozens detected. Originally it was thought that the same successful results that were obtained with the radars stationed in Andoas and Iquitos would be obtained with the Yurimaguas radar, but it was not so. The Peruvian Air Force [FAP] and the U.S. Embassy were also not unaware of the serious defects affecting the radar. The Yurimaguas radar merely served for dissuasive purposes. To avoid the radar's range, drug traffickers were forced to use longer but safer flight routes. At any rate, the U.S. Government has also dismantled the Yurimaguas radar. According to an FAP study, however, four radars in good working condition are needed to effectively control the air space in the region. The FAP, however, does not have sufficient means to conduct this type of air interdiction program. Commenting on the impact of the controversial U.S. Government decision, a high-ranking FAP officer, who was barely able to conceal his regret, states: "We were left virtually blind." These limitations are not new, however. In addition to the fact that the Yurimaguas radar was 50 percent inoperative because it was relatively outdated, the FAP has experienced equipment restrictions. Nevertheless, the FAP has used in full all the resources available to combat drug trafficking, in compliance with decree Law No. 25426. This decree entrusted the FAP with air surveillance of the jungle region, the neutralization of secret landing strips, and the control of air fields in coca producing areas. To fulfill its detection and interdiction operations the FAP resorted to the use of combat planes used for training cadets. To this effect the FAP permanently allocated four Tucano T-27 planes, while two Cessna A-37's were sporadically used for this purpose. Other means the FAP uses are the Y-12 and T-41 light planes, which are also insufficient for carrying out this work. These planes are in charge of granting logistics support, but this should really be carried out by larger planes. After more than three years in operation all of these planes have deteriorated and have lower performance than the planes used by drug traffickers. Unofficial sources state that a Tucano plane, for example, develops a speed of 200 knots and flies at 26,000 feet, while a small plane develops a speed of 300 knots and flies at 30,000 feet. Moreover, the navigation and communication equipment is notably inferior to what is found in the planes the drug traffickers use. An officer states: "At first the Tucanos were efficient, but now they have become obsolete." In addition to the Tucano and Cessna planes, the FAP has resorted to the use of helicopters for interdiction operations in the jungle. Only a couple of armed helicopters have been assigned to this task, however, because the majority of them are being employed in antisubversive operations. In view of this, U.S.-manufactured Bell-214 helicopters are used to intercept and seize small planes. In the beginning these helicopters did a good job, but they became ineffective when in turn drug traffickers increased their night flights. These helicopters lack adequate equipment for night operations. Instead, the planes used by drug traffickers are equipped with infrared systems, sophisticated communications equipment, and even radar detectors. The FAP has been able to acquire six night vision units--each worth $25,000--but because of their high cost their use is restricted. Like the Tucano planes, the helicopters have also deteriorated. In addition, there were never enough of them. FAP studies note that at least six helicopters are needed to effectively patrol the region. Since 1991 the FAP has been able to intercept, seize, and capture about 200 small planes. This figure includes those planes seized or intercepted through the Andoas and Iquitos radars, and through the Yurimaguas radar which was recently withdrawn. With obsolete planes, without radars, and without adequate technical assistance, the FAP continues to fight a better equipped enemy.
