Mitchell, in a statement released by the Government Information Service, said Peters, who has been in the United States since early December, will now be a minister without portfolio while Bernard Wyllie, formerly parliamentary secretary in the Communications and Works Ministry, takes over the Trade Ministry. Wyllie was sworn in midday Thursday as trade and consumer affairs minister. Mitchell said Peters had asked for an extension of time to conduct urgent personal business in the US after he had concluded official business there last October. Peters is said to be sorting out problems with the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service and Mitchell said although he was assured Peters would be returning home it was apparent he was not likely to return soon. "When his leave is up, I will address the matter further," Mitchell said. Peters, a former ambassador to the United Nations, was brought home to contest the 1989 general election and won the north central Windward seat for the ruling New Democratic Party, which took all 15 seats. Mitchell said he had asked the north central Windward parliamentary representative, Allan Cruickshank, and his north Windward colleague, Monty Roberts, to see after Peters' constituency "for the time being."
