Moroz, the leader of the Socialist Party, was elected speaker of the new parliament Wednesday [18 May]. He was also registered as a candidate for the presidency at the elections due 26 June. He assured journalists that his running for the presidential elections, "if they take place, will not have any bearing on his work in parliament." Moroz has repeatedly insisted that the elections be held on 26 June and on no other date. However, he told a May Day demonstration that the Ukrainian president could be elected by the parliament. Moroz believes that the supreme executive body in the republic ought to be the cabinet of ministers and that the president should be the head of state. He told deputies after being elected speaker that his main position was the "independence for Ukraine and the building of a Ukrainian state." "The one thing that unites us is Ukraine itself," he stated. In an interview with journalists, Moroz called for "order in relations governing ownership" to be imposed, complaining that those relations were currently "verging on the criminal." "I support the most radical measures in that respect," he said.
