Speaking afterwards, Ukrainian Vice Premier Valeriy Shmarov said that although the two sides had toiled in two shifts for three days, there was still some work to be done because a sharing out of the Fleet demanded great attention. He said the two delegations were close to agreement on Wednesday, but had to break off the talks to "clarify some technicalities". Shmarov said the two delegations were due to meet in about 10 or 12 days to sign an agreement on the first stage of sharing the Fleet. Russia's envoy Yuriy Dubinin has pointed to the constructive atmosphere prevailing at the talks. He was confident that all of the remaining technicalities would have been resolved to enable the prime ministers on both sides to sign the final agreement in 10 or 12 days from now.
