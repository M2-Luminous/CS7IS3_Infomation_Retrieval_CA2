The instructions were issued after the PLO leadership received reports that some armed Fatah cadres were planning massive reprisals in retaliation against the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Sources close to the Hamas Movement have said the Palestinian leadership hopes Hamas will not carry out any military operations at present, and that it will persist with the civil disobedience campaign, contending that military operations at present could undermine political gains. The sources said Hamas halfheartedly responded to this request, but said it cannot restrain its cadres inside the occupied territories due to the monstrosity of the [Hebron] massacre.
