FR940721-1-00052 FR940721-1-00013 As an addition to the regulatory framework governing state fisheries in which listed species of sea turtles are incidentally taken, NMFS is proposing a rule that would extend section 10 permit regulations to all threatened species of sea turtles. Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to permit under such terms and conditions as he or she may prescribe, any taking otherwise prohibited by section 9(a)(1)(B) of the ESA, if the taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity. NMFS implemented regulations for the application and issuance of incidental take permits, under section 10(a) of the ESA, which appear at 50 CFR parts 220 and 222, and allow the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (AA) to issue permits to incidentally take endangered marine species during otherwise lawful activities. While sections 9 and 10 and corresponding regulations apply to species listed as endangered, they may be applied to threatened species as well, pursuant to section 4(d) of the ESA. Section 4(d) provides that the Secretary issue such regulations as deemed necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of such species. For example, for those threatened species whose taking is prohibited by NMFS (such as salmon (50 CFR 227.21) and Guadalupe fur seal (50 CFR 227.11)), NMFS has promulgated special regulations that allow incidental takings of such species in compliance with a section 10 incidental take permit. Although NMFS has extended the section 9 takings prohibitions to threatened sea turtles (50 CFR 227.71(a)), the exceptions to the prohibitions contained in 50 CFR 227.72 do not provide for the issuance of an incidental take permit. This rule, as proposed, would make it possible to issue such permits for the taking of threatened sea turtles. The extension of the section 10 incidental take permit exception to threatened sea turtles would allow the same substantive protective measures that can be implemented, and the same fishing activities that can be carried out, as under the current regulatory framework, while eliminating the procedural shortcomings of the regulatory framework, such as the short duration of the rules and the length of time required to issue rules. Incidental take permits are not intended to undermine the TED-use requirement or the taking prohibition in general. Furthermore, the regulatory framework would remain in effect for any entity that has not been issued an incidental take permit. This proposed rule would provide an additional means whereby non-Federal entities can engage in commercial fishing practices while affording adequate protection to both endangered and threatened sea turtles. Through the implementation of this proposed rule, NMFS would accept and consider incidental take permit applications from non-Federal entities, such as individuals, businesses, municipalities, fishery organizations and state agencies. NMFS anticipates that it would invite state agencies, which are responsible for regulating state fisheries, to apply for general permits that would cover specific fisheries known or believed to incidentally take threatened or endangered sea turtles. This would be more efficient than requiring permits for individual vessels. It would also allow the states to assume management of fisheries through the permits, which are limited to activities within the territorial sea. The general permit procedures in 50 CFR part 220, as well as the endangered species permit requirements in 50 CFR part 222, would apply to the application, issuance, modification, revocation, suspension and amendment of an incidental take permit for threatened, as well as for endangered sea turtles.
