He expected progress in inter-Korean dialogue, exchange and cooperation this year, although it depends on what North Korea does to solve its nuclear problem, Yi told President Kim Yong-sam in a briefing on New Year's programs of the National Unification Board (NUB). Yi, who is also national unification minister, told Kim that the government will hold fast to its principles, including solution of the North Korean nuclear problem, before seeking practical progress in inter-Korean relations. The government will actively seek to solve the problem of separated families through international organizations such as the United Nations and to discuss with the North sending a unified team to the Hiroshima Asian Games. "If the government finds a breakthrough for solution of the North Korean nuclear problem, it will allow businessmen to visit North Korea and actively participate in North Korea's plan to develop the Najin-Sonbong region," he said. "It is inevitable for North Korea to change its policy toward openness because Pyongyang has to find a way out of the crisis caused by economic difficulties, diplomatic isolation and people's skepticism about the North Korean system. "North Korea will agree to inter-Korean dialogue in a bid to have access to the United States," he added. Yi said that the NUB will improve its organization to play its role fully in controling and adjusting unification policy as well as working out a measure in preparation for an exchange of special envoys. The board will give concrete shape to its three-stage unification plan this year, he said. In the first stage of the plan (reconciliation and cooperation), the two Koreas implement the basic agreements and joint declaration for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. In the second stage, they organize a South-North confederation. In the third stage, the nation is unified under a new constitution and general elections are held.
