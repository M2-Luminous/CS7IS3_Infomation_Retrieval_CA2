It really is possible to paraphrase here the words of the first man who stepped on the moon -- Neil Armstrong -- "this may be a small step for the United States, but it is an enormous one for Macedonia." No matter which positions we start from in assessing the act of recognition and establishment of full diplomatic relations between Macedonia and the United States, it certainly is true it is of greatest political importance after the proclamation of the independence of Macedonia and its admission to the United Nations. Therefore, the process of international integration of Macedonia has come full circle, and Macedonia has passed a thorny road full of obstacles in confirming its own position, its own policy, its model of organized state in the last few years, always starting from the positions of a small but peaceful country in the center of the Balkans. If Macedonia needed a final proof that the United States wants Macedonia to exist and survive, the proof is here. The Macedonian official foreign policy assessed the recognition as a logical ending of the efforts involved in the past period in persuading the world not only of the endurance, but also of the democratic orientation and peaceful policy of our country. The more emotional ones assess the great success of the Macedonian diplomacy as a jewel in the crown of the recognitions that Macedonia has experienced since the proclamation of its independence. It is an indisputable fact that the diplomatic strategy and tactics applied in the past period produced results and that the meticulous and cautious policy convinced all those who were skeptical. There is also the fact that the biggest and most influential economic, political, and military force in the world, by recognizing Macedonia, made it clear that Macedonia is in its interest, and that it will contribute to the promotion of stability in the region by this act. If we assess the activities of the Macedonian diplomacy, we must admit that the success is even greater because it was achieved without any preconditioning by the state which, to be honest, could have afforded that. Therefore, by recognizing Macedonia, the United States confirmed its policy of principles, which some had started to doubt. The United States started this confirmation with the sponsoring of our membership in the United Nations, with its support for our inclusion in international financial institutions, and with humanitarian and technical aid, getting now to a logical ending. By doing that, it made clear to everyone that the independence and stability of Macedonia is in its interest, too, and a factor and a condition for solving a part of the problems in the region. In that context we must speak of what postponed, and sometimes made uncertain the achievement of equality between the world's most powerful force and the small country in the Balkans -- the dispute with Greece. That was exactly the reason for blocking the recognition of peaceful Macedonia. All our pleas for cooperation, mutual respect for territorial integrity of neighbors, and respect for borders, remained in the shadow of that dispute. Resilience and honesty was shown by Macedonia in innumerable practical examples, and now the United States accepted it not as a verbal mimicry, but as an autochtonous policy with deep roots in the behavior and practice of our country. Therefore, the recognition of Macedonia by the United States is really multifaceted. If it is a message to Macedonia that its model of state organization is functional and applicable for the Balkans, that can also be a message to the other countries in this region and at large, that it is possible to endure and survive in merely impossible conditions via a sincere and good-neighborly and peaceful policy. The support of the United States for Macedonian policy is exceptionally important and it can contribute to a faster and more efficient settlement of the problems which emerged in the relations with Greece. With this act of recognition it was once again reaffirmed that an open and direct dialogue is the only possible and correct way of constructing good neighborliness and measures of mutual confidence. That is why good will is needed, which is the only possible way of solving the open questions in the mutual relations, through a constructive spirit and indispensable flexibility from both sides. Macedonia has practically been sending this message since the very beginning of the problems, which has been accepted by almost the whole international community. Undoubtedly, the act of the United States represents a certain closing of the circle of recognition of the Republic of Macedonia, initiated with the admission of our country into the United Nations. Macedonia has been now recognized by all five permanent member countries of the UN Security Council, and it is quite normal to expect the other members of the United Nations, like Canada, Australia, and others, of vital interest for Macedonia, to recognize it and establish full diplomatic relations with Macedonia. Besides the pleasure, there is also the obligation of Macedonia to continue on the same road which ensured its international identification and to be constantly open to all initiatives leading to peace, cooperation, and mutual confidence in the Balkans.
