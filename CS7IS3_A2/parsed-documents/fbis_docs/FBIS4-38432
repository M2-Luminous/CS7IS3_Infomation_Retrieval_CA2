Besides, "there are no special signs of recovery in sight that could indicate that this is a turning point," Mr. Glazyev stressed. He presented "State's Economic Policy Guidelines" developed by a group of economists. Their main idea is to bring order into all the sectors of the economy and in the system of its control, for which purpose specific measures are proposed. Remarkably, in the expression of Mr. Glazyev himself, measures which can indeed be implemented have been specially selected from a multitude of suggestions.
