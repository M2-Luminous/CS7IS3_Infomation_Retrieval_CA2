He confirmed that Russia and the United States "will give Ukraine the broadest possible guarantees of security as a nuclear-free power". "The main thing is that Ukraine has confirmed its nuclear-free power status and has agreed to hand over its nuclear warheads to the Russian side," Lobov stressed, noting, that "Russia will have to pay compensation, of course, by delivering nuclear fuel to Ukrainian atomic power plants". The secretary of the Russian Security Council described Ukraine's decision concerning nuclear weapons as "a very good step towards normalising relations with Russia", which must be developed on the basis of "partnership, trust, joint participation in the organisation of a European security system". Asked whether Ukraine could again sharply raise the question of the Black Sea Navy after having relinquished its nuclear weapons to Russia, Lobov said: "I think the two problems should not be linked. The existing Black Sea Navy problem must be examined separately. I think that there should be no 'bargaining' over it". Lobov admitted that Russia would have to make some financial spendings linked with the transfer of Ukrainian warheads to its territory and with deliveries of low-enriched uranium to Ukraine. Nevertheless, he noted that "Russia is getting in return highly enriched weapon Uranium and, in addition, it will no longer have to spend money on the servicing of warhead storages".
