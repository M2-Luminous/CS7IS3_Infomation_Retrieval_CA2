FR940819-0-00066 FR940819-0-00017 9. Appendix A to subpart F is revised to read as follows: Appendix A to Subpart F_Specifications for Fluorocarbon Refrigerants This appendix is based on Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute Standard 700&hyph;93: Section 1.␣Purpose 1.1␣ Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to evaluate and accept/reject refrigerants regardless of source (new, reclaimed and/or repackaged) for use in new and existing refrigeration and air-conditioning products. 1.1.1␣This standard is intended for the guidance of the industry including manufacturers, refrigerant reclaimers, repackagers, distributors, installers, servicemen, contractors and for consumers. 1.2␣ Review and Amendment. This standard is subject to review and amendment as the technology advances. The dynamics of this technology is advancing so rapidly that changes to this standard must be frequent. Section 2.␣Scope 2.1␣ Scope. This standard specifies acceptable levels of contaminants (purity requirements) for various fluorocarbon refrigerants regardless of source and lists acceptable test methods. These refrigerants are R11; R12; R13; R22; R113; R114; R123; R124; R500; R502 and R503 as referenced in the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard Number Designation and Safety Classification of Refrigerants (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, Inc., Standard 34 1992). Copies may be obtained from ASHRAE Publications Sales, 1791 Tullie Circle, NE., Atlanta, GA 30329. Copies may also be inspected at Public Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;01, Waterside Mall (Ground Floor) Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC in room M&hyph;1500. In addition the following blends are listed: R22/152a/124 (53/13/34); R22/152a/124 (61/11/28); R125/290/22 (60/2/38); R125/290/22 (38/2/60). Section 3.␣Definitions 3.1␣ ``Shall'', ``Should'', ``Recommended'', or ``It Is Recommended''. ``Shall'', ``should'', ``recommended'', or ``it is recommended'' shall be interpreted as follows: 3.1.1␣ Shall . Where ``shall'' or ``shall not'' is used for a provision specified, that provision is mandatory if compliance with the standard is claimed. 3.1.2␣ Should, Recommended , or It is Recommended . ``Should '', ``recommended'', or ``it is recommended'' is used to indicate provisions which are not mandatory but which are desirable as good practice. Section 4.␣Characterization of Refrigerants and Contaminants 4.1␣ Characterization . Characterization of refrigerants and contaminants addressed are listed in the following general classifications: 4.1.1␣ Characterization: a. Gas Chromatography b. Boiling point and boiling point range 4.1.2␣Contaminants a. Water b. Chloride c. Acidity d. High boiling residue e. Particulates/solids f. Non-condensables g. Impurities including other refrigerants Section 5.␣Sampling, Summary of Test Methods and Maximum Permissible Contaminant Levels 5.1␣Referee Test. The referee test methods for the various contaminants are summarized in the following paragraphs. Detailed test procedures are included in Parts 1 through 9, 12 through 15, and 19 through 23 of Appendix&hyph;93 to ARI Standard 700: Analytical Procedures of ARI Standard 700&hyph;93, 1994, the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute. These parts of Appendix&hyph;93 to ARI 700 are incorporated by reference. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute, 4301 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203. Copies may also be inspected at Public Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;01, Waterside Mall (Ground Floor) Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC in room M&hyph;1500 or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 700, Washington, DC. If alternate test methods are employed, the user must be able to demonstrate that they produce results equivalent to the specified referee method.
