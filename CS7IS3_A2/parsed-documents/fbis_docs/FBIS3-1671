"My answer is very clear: I want Japan to give us more technology," Zhu replied to a question during a press conference at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo. He said he was pleased that a rising number of Japanese corporations had began to give know-how to their Chinese partners while doing trade with them. Japan ranked first in the transfer of foreign technology to China last year, in which 28 percent of China's technology imports came from Japan, he noted. "It's great. It will eventually benefit Japan's economic development," he added. The advancement of Chinese technology will help upgrade the competitiveness of Japanese products on the international market since most of the transfer were done through Japan's joint ventures with China there, the vice premier explained. Zhu, who is in Tokyo on a nine-day visit, cited as a model of bilateral technology cooperation the start of videorecorder production in Beijing last year with full technology given by Matsushita, a Japanese electronics giant. He hoped that more Japanese makers will follow Matsushita in doing so. Zhu underlined the importance of Japanese support for China's reform and economic development and vowed to work hard to boost Beijing's ties with Tokyo. He said he felt satisfied over recent years' "marked progress" in bilateral trade, which totaled 39 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, an increase of 54 percent over the previous year. But he said this is still short of its potential in view of the present good relationship between the two countries. Japan overtook Hong Kong as China's biggest trading partner while China became Japan's second largest trading partner after the United States in 1993.
