Washington is considering the chances of bringing about a breakthrough on the Palestinian track, but real achievements in the near future are possible only in the talks with Syria. This week I met with some of the members of the Israeli Arabs delegation, led by Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, who had just returned from a visit to Syria. By the testimony of the delegation members, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' specified Damascus' position on the way in which a breakthrough in the negotiations with Israel can be achieved. Al-Shar' said that Syria adheres to the formula of full peace in return for a full withdrawal from the Golan, but is prepared to discuss with Israel all the conditions the latter will present on the road to implementing the formula, so as to reassure it on security issues. At the same time, Syria refuses to specify the components of peace now since it does not trust that Israel indeed wants true peace. Syria is offering Israel two options for the acceptance of the formula. The first option is an open, official declaration by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin that Israel is willing to withdraw from the Golan in return for full peace. If Rabin openly declares the acceptance of the Syrian proposal, the road will be open to a historic summit between al-Asad and Rabin. The second option, in case Rabin prefers not to declare Israel's readiness for a withdrawal openly, is for a secret Israeli commitment to be relayed to the Syrians. Itamar Rabinovich, the head of the Israeli delegation to the talks, can convey such a commitment to his Syrian counterpart, Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, together with Israel's position on the security arrangements. A secret commitment to withdraw from the Golan in return for full peace will complete the formulation of the joint Israeli-Syrian declaration of principles and will embark on the talks between the two countries on the road leading to peace. What interest does Syria have in establishing peace with Israel? The members of the Israeli delegation to the negotiations got the impression that Syria's economic situation is reasonable. Furthermore, Syria emerged from the economic crisis which had plagued it, and its citizens currently enjoy economic prosperity. In theory then, Syria's condition is good and it has no reason to want a change. This is also the message the Syrians tried to relay to the members of the Darawshah delegation: "We are in no rush; we are waiting patiently." The Syrians indeed have a feeling of self-confidence which enables them to pose maximal opening demands. At the same time, the decision by the Syrian leadership to prefer economic development obliges it, of necessity, to turn to a road of peace and to help the Israeli Government to promote a new Middle East based on econmy. The suspicious Syrians show great hostility toward the ideas of a new Middle East presented by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, claiming that Israel intends to take over the region economically. Still, when the two countries agree on the framework of bilateral peace and Syria joins the multilateral talks, many of its fears on this issue will surely dissipate. Syria boycotts the multilateral talks which discuss regional cooperation indeed, but it is still following, via France, all those details raised in the talks which concern it, such as the regional roads network in which Damascus is supposed to feature prominently. It is clearly understood in Syria that if the Israeli Government does not make real progress in the peace talks this year, then a right-wing government which may emerge from the ruins of the present process will bring the war tension back and this will result in new economic deterioration in Syria. The Syrians are also troubled by Israel's nuclear capability, and want to take advantage of the peace talks in order to safeguard themselves from this aspect of Israel's power. Syria's name has so far been linked with radical forces in the Middle East. Nevertheless, following its policy in Lebanon may point to new trends which can also influence its policy toward Israel and its position on the Palestinian question. The invitation extended to Darawshah's delegation too indicates that Syria is shifting the emphasis to those who represent the moderate mainstream. [passage omitted]
