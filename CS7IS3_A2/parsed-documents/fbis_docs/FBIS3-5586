Interviewed by reporters in Manila, Secretary Romulo said the trade war between Japan and the United States will likely push Washington to reconsider its focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Romulo believes that because of its trade rift with Japan, America might favor the other regions, like Europe. Last week Washington reinstated one of its toughest trade laws, the law Super 301 allows U.S. President Bill Clinton to impose punitive tariffs of up to 100 percent on a country that obstructs import of U.S. products, but Secretary Romulo said he does not believe Super 301 will be slapped against the Philippines. The Philippines had been placed under the priority watch list of trade violators in the past but was delisted after addressing U.S. concern.
