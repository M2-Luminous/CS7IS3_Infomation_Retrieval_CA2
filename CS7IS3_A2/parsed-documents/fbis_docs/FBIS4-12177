It has thus managed to scotch Israel's circuitous tactics and deny it the opportunity to take on the Arab countries one at a time. Syria is universally acknowledged to be pursuing sound policies. Syria's key role and objective outlook in peacemaking have been equally recognized. Israel's intransigence, the paper emphasizes, remains the real obstacle to the peace process. Unilateral deals have been shown to be unworkable. Arab coordination and consultations, AL-THAWRAH adds, are crucial to a successful common approach to Israel's attempts at dividing Arab ranks and deflecting the peace process from its set objective; namely a fair and comprehensive peace -- the peace of the brave, to quote President al-Asad at the Geneva summit. Coordination and consultations between Syria and Egypt about the peace process and how to counter Israel's less-than-straightforward ways will go a long way toward forging a united stand as the Arabs wage the battle for peace. Only by adherence to national and pan-Arab parameters will it be possible to establish a fair and comprehensive peace and regain all the occupied land, free of any Jewish settlements, concludes AL-THAWRAH.
