FBIS4-1411 "drafr082_c_94025" FBIS-AFR-94-082 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 28 April South African Press Review for 28 April MB2804145994 MB2804145994 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Call To Extend Voting Day if Necessary -- "The election is teetering in some areas," begins a page 10 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 22 April. The list of "unsupplied ballots, unopened stations and unstuck stickers is proving much too long for comfort." It "seems unlikely that by tonight" all people will have voted, and the Independent Electoral Commission's (IEC) response has "thus far displayed the smack of the high horse. The Commission should swallow its pride. Its staff -- and South Africa knows they are exhausted, and is grateful -- should stiffen the sinews for what could be a long laaste skof [last shift]. If tomorrow must be a fourth day, let it be so. Neither the letter of the law nor the drooping of eyelids should lead to doors being closed as long as any voters are left standing in the cold." Call for 'Firm Action' Against Bombers -- A second editorial on the same page says "nothing could have been more sickening for ordinary citizens making their way to voting stations yesterday than the news that another bomb had gone off, this time at Jan Smuts Airport." News of arrests "is a welcome indication that the police are pursuing their responsibilities with vigour." The perpetrators of these "cowardly" acts should be brought before the courts. "Only firm action will dissuade the similarly-minded from more of the same as the new order finds its feet." U.S. Interest in South Africa -- On the same page Peter Fabricius writes "In Washington" on the amount of U.S. media attention to South Africa. Fabricius says that according to THE WASHINGTON POST, "by many of the traditional definitions of national interest, the U.S. might appear to have little stake in the SA elections. There are no oil fields to protect, no U.S. troops or bases in the region, no Soviet surrogates to contain and no colonial guilt to assuage." Fabricius therefore believes part of the explanation for the U.S. interest in South Africa "seems to be enlightened self-interest. The Clinton Administration has identified South Africa as one of the world's 10 best emerging markets and is trying hard to buy in while the prices are low, so to speak." BUSINESS DAY IEC `Not Totally To Blame' for Electoral Arrangement Faults -- "Some of the failings of the R 700m [million rand] electoral machine have been inexcusable, but tempting as it is to accuse it, the Independent Electoral Commission is not totally to blame," declares the page 8 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 28 April. The IEC "was operating in a situation without precedent, necessitating guesswork and assumption about how many people would vote, and where." Inkatha's last-minute decision to participate in the election also "put a huge additional burden on an already pressed organisation." Therefore, "if an extra public holiday, additional polling hours, a few million more ballot papers and some careful negotiation about controversial ballot papers can overcome the problem, the nation will have come off lightly. The new South Africa was never going to be easy, but it is here." SOWETAN IEC Electoral Arrangements `Fine Job' -- "It would have been a miracle for yesterday's elections to have gone off without technical hitches," states a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 28 April. The paper notes that the IEC was blamed for "shoddy arrangements in various areas." "In the first place, such shortcomings are common to all elections. In the second place, this country undertook this gigantic exercise for the first time. Finally, the politicians should take much of the blame for hindering the process towards election day and making the work of the IEC difficult by the constant changing of deadlines. The IEC, in fact, must be congratulated for doing a fine job under difficult circumstances."
