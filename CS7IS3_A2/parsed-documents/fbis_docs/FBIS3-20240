Moreover, according to polling figures from Doxa, the League is holding its ground in the proportional quota, too, achieving 9 percent -- more than it achieved in the previous general election (8.9 percent). This is essentially a success for Bossi's strategy, based entirely on the bid to establish the League's identity in its internal conflict with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi. Bossi was also reassured by the result in Milan's constituency number one, for which he was elected. However, the result achieved by the League has not altered Bossi's basic stances and has not resolved its suspicions and problems. Essentially, there are two: accession to the government with the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and the prime ministership for Silvio Berlusconi. In his initial response Bossi confirmed this: "The pole for freedom has won, and a government must be formed comprising the pole for freedom." He then renewed his rejection of the MSI: "No accords with the reactionary right." And he barred Berlusconi's path to the premiership: "Berlusconi is an intelligent man; I do not think that he will ask again for the prime ministership, partly because he is someone that has economic vested interests, so it is better for him not to try." He repeated his charges against Forza Italia, his problematic ally: "They tried to eliminate us," he said, "and I must say that they did so intelligently, by recycling the old and finding a very representative entrepreneur." Then Bossi returned to his original forecasts: "The results are more or less as we imagined; now we must examine them in detail and try to understand them properly; we could govern with the pole for freedom, but it must be kept in mind that over the years the League has protected the democratic framework against a reactionary right." Bossi was irritated by the National Alliance's success in the north, too, and repeated, "reactionary right." He said: "We are in favor of a modern and liberal Italy, not a reactionary right." "Are you referring to the MSI?" he was asked. "Just consider the 12 percent granted to the MSI." Bossi was very cautious, however, and stressed the need to examine Berlusconi's and [MSI and National Alliance (AN) leader] Fini's programs, but repeated again: "With us, the reactionary right shall not pass." Reporters pressed Bossi on the subject of possible external backing from the National Alliance for a League-Forza Italia government. Bossi was evasive, and repeated: "We will have to examine the figures." By 2220 hours [2020 GMT] the atmosphere at League headquarters was more relaxed. The League had escaped the trap laid "by the old regime." But a little earlier, at 2000 hours [1800 GMT], the atmosphere was different, very different. It was tense. Maroni was bombarded by telephone calls: "Is it true that Bossi wants to break up the pole for freedom?" "What is happening within the League?" The calls were from journalists and politicians, all based on rumors from Rome. The lower house floor leader was the only important League politician at League headquarters, where he had been in charge since 1600 hours [1400 GMT], always humorous and courteous, but clearly tense. As he passed from one television channel to another, he reflected: "If the League loses proportionately with respect to the previous general election, then we must draw the conclusions and carry out a thorough political assessment that must embrace not only the League but the other forces too. If Berlusconi scores a major success, a spectacular success, the blame will lie partly with those who failed to realize what was happening in the country, those who mistook `Avanzi' viewers for the entire electorate. With those who failed to understand the League's role." In fact none of this happened. Sunday afternoon [27 March] Bossi said more simply: "Berlusconi was invented by those on the Left." "It is time for us to roll up our sleeves; the voters have decided to grant us a very responsible role, and we will not disappoint them." Roberto Maroni, the Northern League's great planner, the man who, on Bossi's behalf, has organized the complex web of the League's negotiations, did not want to exclude any possibility. Leaving aside the results as they emerged, he took his time: "Sunday 10 April in Pontida will see a crucial step in the history of the new Republic." More than that, Maroni, and Bossi too, would not say. They made it clear that there will be a strong defense of the League's "northernist" role, and repeated that the "negotiations for the new government will be carried out under the shadow of Milan cathedral." The problem that has been facing League leaders for some days is this: What kind of government? With Berlusconi? With Berlusconi and Fini? With Berlusconi and the center? Or an institutional -- or, rather, constitutional -- government? Though portrayed by the media recently as a quarrelsome and eccentric appendage to Berlusconi and snubbed in favor of the novelty of Fini in the new guise of a [French Rally for the Republic (RPR) Secretary General] Chirac, basically the League has never lost its central role in the political negotiations. Late Sunday afternoon [Mino] Martinazzoli [Italian Popular Party (PPI) secretary] tried to phone Bossi, and Monday morning MSI lower house floor leader Giuseppe Tatarella, Fini's strategist, tried to contact his opposite number, Maroni. Throughout the election campaign very private personal meetings have gone on between the PDS' [Democratic Party of the Left] Claudio Petruccioli and Bossi's deputy. On the basis of the election results as they appeared last night, the League faces two problems. The first is its relations with the MSI. After voting at Gemonio, near the Edoardo Curti junior school, Sunday afternoon, Bossi had no doubts: "I refuse to have anything to do with the fascists." With the appearance of a government minister, in his blue jacket and gray trousers -- undermined by a yellow necktie by Forattini on loan from his trusted Maroni -- Bossi did not seem desperate to form a government at any price: "We and Forza Italia will govern, but not with the MSI." The watchword for the League leaders is, "if the numbers permit." If the numbers permit the formation of a government with Forza Italia; if not, then if the numbers permit the formation of an institutional government; and so forth. "Of course," Bobo Maroni said yesterday at 1300 hours [1100 GMT], "how can we say `no' to the pole for freedom without having an alternative government to put forward? There must be an alternative; we cannot proceed toward political chaos...." The other major problem is the prime ministership, sought by Berlusconi but denied by Bossi. This is one of the topics of conflict within the pole. "The League does not give a damn about Berluskaiser," Bossi, in the guise of prime minister, said in the bar at Gemonio Sunday afternoon. But his aim seems to be not so much to gain the premiership for himself or another League member as to prevent Berlusconi from gaining it, opening the way, rather, to some technocrat approved by the League.
