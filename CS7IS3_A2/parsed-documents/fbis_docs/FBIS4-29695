The White Paper points out the importance of modifying each and every socioeconomic activity so that they have little destruction on the environment in order to build "a sustainable society" that can continue to develop eternally while receiving the blessings of the global environment. The EA is asking that private businesses and the public endeavor to change to environment preservation type activities and to switch to lifestyles that are environment-friendly. The first white paper, based on the Basic Environment Law, was submitted November 1993 and was subtitled. "Toward Socioeconomic Activities With Little Burden on the Environment." The 1994 white paper emphasizes that in creating "a society capable of sustained development," as indicated in the Basic Environment Law, the roles of private business and the public are especially great. The white paper analyzes that for private businesses, preservation of the environment and development of the economy can coexist with appropriate and aggressive investment in environmental activities. A shout of encouragement is being voiced to business to aggressively pursue enviornmental preservation, saying that "a new entrepreneurial spirit which combines the preservation of the environment and the continuation and development of business will activate society." In terms of the public, the white paper indicates that business activities which are environment-friendly are aided by consumer behavior such as the purchase of products that consider the environment." The white paper calls for introducing an Edo Period (1600-1868) living orientation, when personal effects were repaired and used, in an effort to change modern lifestyles of mass production, mass consumption, and waste. Furthermore, to aid private business and the public in taking actions regarding the environment, the white paper indicated support tasks that the administration should undertake: 1) strengthen the mechanism for accurately supplying environment-related information, 2) construct an economic system so that costs for preserving the enviornment are added to product prices, and 3) urge business to continue environmental investment regardless of good or bad economic times. In addition, the white paper states that the most necessary thing today is the definition of a guide to ensure that environment preservation actions which are taken by businesses, the public, and the administration will produce accompanying results, and that the "Basic Environment Plan" currently being established is suitable to be this guide.
