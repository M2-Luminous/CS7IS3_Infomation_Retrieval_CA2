He noted: This action is not linked politically with the Papoulias-Vance meeting; the wagons were in Greek territory before 16 February. Responding to a question, Mr. Venizelos said that this was not a relaxation of the Greek measures and noted it is a matter of 4,500 tons of oil, which is only sufficient for the Skopje refinery's operation for half a day.
