In line with one version (submitted by Marian Krzaklewski at a press conference), they are supposed to prepare proposals of legal changes that would be needed to implement the demands of "S." The team's decisions would then be approved by the Council of Ministers at its next session. In line with another version (a joint communique by the director of the Government Press Office and the "S" spokesman), they are supposed to "review the most important problems submitted by both parties and propose solutions to them within a week. (...) The results of the talks between the prime minister and the chairmen of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union `S' and other trade unions, just like the results of the work of experts, will be presented and discussed at the session of the Council of Ministers." "S" says that the failure or success of the talks will determine the staging of a mass protest. Until the decisions are implemented (that is, as the National Committee--KK--spokesman explained to us, until their results are approved by the parliament), the union will strike in line with the earlier schedule. What "S" Wants To Achieve "S" is striking to protest the lowering of the living standard of the Polish families. The union presented the following proposals (in line with the words of the "S" spokesman): --slowing down the rate of increase of the energy prices ("S" claims that it has been accepted by the World Bank) --increasing the real wages of the people --implementing the "Pact on Enterprise" --amending the Budget Law (more money for social aid) and amending the budget-related laws --collecting income taxes in families (distributing the income among all of the family members, including children); in families with the lowest incomes (on the border of the biological minimum), collecting no tax or lowering the limit --deducting from the tax the costs of commuting to work and the costs of educating the children --a five-day workweek and all Saturdays free (so that more people can be employed) --giving the national property to all citizens. Which Laws Need To Be Amended By the end of the week, the "S" experts, along with government representatives, want to come up with proposals of legal solutions that would make it possible to implement the demands. "S" KK Press Spokesman Piotr Zak was not able to tell us which laws "S" believes should be amended. "This is what the experts are going to discuss," he explained. An analysis of the demands suggests that their implementation will call for amending the following laws: --the Budget Law --the Law on Income Tax for Persons --the Labor Code and the adoption of a new law on giving the national property to all citizens. What Rivals Say to That "As far as I know, the purpose of the talks between the government and `S' is the selection of the place to which the problems of this trade union will be forwarded. It may be the Trilateral Committee or the teams negotiating the Charter of Social Guarantees," we learned from Waclaw Martyniuk, deputy chairman of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ]. Martyniuk informed us that, at the meeting with OPZZ, the prime minister stressed that he wants to hold joint negotiations with all of the trade unions.
