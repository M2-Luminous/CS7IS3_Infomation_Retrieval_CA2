He immediately ordered Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang to toe the line. This is what led to Yi's dismissal. Local newspapers and TV news all reported Yi's remarks, made through his secretary, pointing out the operational and technical problems of the Unification-security Policy Coordination Committee. President Kim had personally formed the committee to erase any images of dissent within the government on unification and security. But his prime minister, supposedly the No. 2 man, challenged the president by pointing out problems with the committee. How could a prime minister dare announce such opinions through a secretary, couldn't you wait until our regular meeting tomorrow, what did you hope to gain by having your words carried in the newspapers?, Kim probably yelled at Yi over the telephone. Such anger revived the president's memory: The violence at the Chogye temple broke out while I was away: I had to order a thorough investigation because the prime minister failed to take charge, Kim most likely muttered to himself. Kim's ire apparently hadn't died out Friday afternoon when the two men sat down for their regular briefing session. But instead of apologizing, the prime minister only said he had acted on behalf of the country and the president, behavior deemed consistent for a former judge nicknamed "Bamboo" for his strict adherence to the law. So, if we follow the law as you say, who should be responsible in case of a power vacuum? Isn't it the prime minister?, Kim probably said, clearly indicating that he planned to fire Yi. Yi got the message and handed in his resignation as soon as he returned to his office. Kim's aide said the president was surprised when Yi walked into his office Friday afternoon without a letter of resignation after what happened the previous evening. Although the move was certainly unexpected to many, insiders had actually been predicting it for a long time. Yi, they say, put the brakes on many of the orders that came from the presidential office. For instance, Kim said dismissing his Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-bae was inevitable because he revised South Korea's Uruguay Round country schedule despite promising the president he wouldn't. The prime minister challenged this thinking, insisting that the country schedule was not revised in any way but only "appeared" to have been changed. Yi asked the other cabinet ministers to emulate him and pay less attention to the presidential office, telling them he would take the responsibility when meeting with the press. On some occasions, he bluntly told Chief Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong not to meddle and issue orders to the cabinet, they say. Yi may wish to call it a resignation, but considering the prior series of events, "fired" is the correct term.
