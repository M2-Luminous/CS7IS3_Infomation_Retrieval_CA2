FBIS4-24199 "drafr123_c_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-123 Daily Report 26 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Police Promotions To Be Reviewed Police Promotions To Be Reviewed MB2606122894 Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English 26 Jun 94 p 4 MB2606122894 Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES English BFN [Report by political correspondent Edyth Bulbring] [Text] Promotions in the police over the past year are to be reviewed in the next few weeks following complaints about irregularities and dissatisfaction with standards. The discovery of irregularities would lead to the establishment of a commission of inquiry headed by a judge to assess, and if necessary, reverse promotions, according to the newly established police advisory team. One of the irregular incidents known to the advisory team was a case in which members of the Transkei police force forced their superiors to promote them at gunpoint shortly after the election. These promotions were suspended, but there were also allegations of irregular promotions in some of the other police forces. The 10-man advisory team, which met in Pretoria on Friday, must amalgamate the 11 police forces into one national police service. A key issue which arose at the meeting was the criteria used by the different police forces to promote their members, and the advancement of members during the year before the election. The advisory team will recommend to Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi that these issues be investigated over the next few weeks. A member of the team said one of the problems the team faced in rationalising the police forces was the different standards and criteria employed in promoting members. Following an investigation, the team would finalise new standards for promotion. These would include new criteria for affirmative action. Should the team discover gross irregularities, President Nelson Mandela was empowered by the constitution to establish a commission of inquiry to examine all promotions between April last year and September this year. The commission would have the power to confirm, reverse or amend these promotions.
