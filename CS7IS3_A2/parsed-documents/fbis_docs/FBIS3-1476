[Bruce] Good evening to you. [Morose] Let me say, from yesterday, there were reports that there was intimidation which was a build-up to the march. What did the police do? [Bruce] Well, you're quite correct. A number of incidents did take place from late last night right through the night until this morning. And consultations were again held with both political parties involved, that is to say the IFP and the ANC this morning. Our fears were obviously expressed to the leadership of the IFP regarding what could possibly take place. We asked for assurances, as we were given in the beginning, that's on Friday when application was made for the march to take place. And assurances were given that this march would be peaceful. [Morobe] Is this the time for assurances, taking the volatile situation. We saw the pictures from Ulundi where AK-47 gun-pointing people were running with. We know the volatile situation. Do we just need just assurance? [Bruce] No, you don't need just assurances, but I think one has to realize that the political leaders and the organizations of parties that wish to hold demonstrations and gatherings of this nature really have a tremendous responsibility to ensure that the assurances given to them which motivate the reason for the march are indeed kept, and obviously it is up to them to ensure that their followers do not come to these gatherings armed. [Morobe] Now today we saw what happened. Assurances did nothing. Now it's within the city where people are going to work, there's shopping, the normal day should go on amid the march, what precautions, measures, did you take as the police? [Bruce] Well, the South African Police [SAP] were there in great numbers, we had close on 700 policemen in the Johannesburg area to monitor this particular gathering. We expressed our problems regarding this particular march as well, we gave ... [Morobe, interrupting] What were your problems? [Bruce] Well, because of the problems that took place during the night, we felt that there was a possibility that violence could break out, and we had, specifically, talks with the African National Congress on this matter this morning, and assurances were given that we would police this particular march, but it must be understood that we could only ensure that public order is kept, we could not ensure that we're going to carry out the law to the letter of the law, because that would be futile. If I can put it very, very simply, it is just not possible for 700 policemen to disarm 10,000 persons of their weapons, it is absolutely impossible, and it's time that people took note of this. [Morobe] Was the route cordoned. Was the route to the Library cordoned with a wire fence? [Bruce] As far as possible, yes, it was certainly done. I can't tell you where each and every, or which each and every area was cordoned off and so on, but certainly the razor wire was used, the police were there, they cordoned off certain areas. I don't think that anybody can expect the South African Police to cordon off each and every street within the city. However, we maintained a very strong presence in that area. [Morobe] As strong as in Durban that we saw over the weekend? [Bruce] Oh, I couldn't tell you what happened in Durban, I couldn't tell you that. [Morobe] Because the contingent was far larger than in Johannesburg, and taking again the volatile situation from Soweto, intimidation was reported, and from early in the morning, gunshots were reported, couldn't police act swiftly, 700, did it do its job, is the police now having problems in terms of controlling (?violence)? [Bruce] Those are questions. And I must really state that it's very, very early in the day to answer questions of that nature. I can assure you that an investigation, and I mean an in-depth investigation is taking place, and I will not be surprised if there is actually an inquiry, a commission of inquiry, into today's happenings that will be conducted. And I can assure you, if the police were found wanting, or did not plan strategically, that will come out, but that is not the question that we should discuss tonight. What we should really be looking at is the fact that at least 18 persons, human beings, have died, and the fact of this particular aspect is that it was the IFP who asked to do a march, to hold a gathering, and it was their followers that were partly responsible for this. Also one must take into account that shots, automatic gunfire were fired from within the African National Congress' headquarters, which also resulted in deaths. These are the things that one has got to look at, and you know to apportion blame now, one way or the other is not going to solve this particular problem. [Morobe] On that note, the IFP, Themba Khoza, has just said, they actually gave a report that they were made aware that there will be an infiltration, if I should use the word, of the MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] within the group, and also on the security, to ensure that people are killed today. Did you get such a report? [Bruce] No, not from the IFP. Let me stress that had any reports of that nature been available to the South African Police before the march, obviously, then one could reconsider the decision to grant the march. However, I must point out of course the march was okayed by the chief magistrate on Friday already. These, as I pointed out, are aspects that have to be drawn to the attention of the persons investigating these occurrences, or the commission of inquiry which will result out of this particular happening. [Morobe] But it's reported Cyril Ramaphosa called you, the police, at 7:45 and it took only up to 10 o'clock for the arrival of the police. What takes so long in such a volatile situation? [Bruce] I cannot say what Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa reported. What I can tell you, that at the time that these shots took place from within the ANC headquarters, our regional commissioner General Calitz, was actually in Shell House himself, so I can assure you note has been taken of exactly what took place, but for anybody now to point fingers at the South African Police, I think at this very early stage it's astounding that anybody can come to a conclusion that one party or the other is at fault. This is what will emanate from an investigation. [Morobe] Now, at the court, the garden itself, it's reported a minibus came and showered bullets. I'd like to believe from what you say that the presence of police was there. How can such a thing happen, and what action are we going to see from the police? [Bruce] I think you have to realize that at the Library Gardens, that was an estimated 9,000 or 10,000 persons. And for anybody now at this stage, and I must state it again, at this early stage, to actually say what took place is impossible, we really can't, these are things that will receive attention, and will be investigated, and will be made known to the public. [Morobe] And finally, is the police, South African Police, able to maintain law and order? [Bruce] I think that the South African Police, and indeed, any policemen in the world is able to maintain law and order under reasonable circumstances. We are able to police marches and demonstrations, and so on, but when it degenerates into what we saw today, which essentially was an example of the political conflict which is taking place in South Africa, then it makes it very difficult for anybody to police that. I think South Africans should take note now that what we saw today is what has been taking place in the rural areas, and the inaccessible areas for quite some time. Perhaps it's coming as a bit of a shock to South Africa to see what reality is. [Morobe] On that note we leave it there as we have run out of time. Thank you for availing yourself to us? [Bruce] It's a pleasure.
