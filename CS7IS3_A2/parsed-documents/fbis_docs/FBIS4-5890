Problems Surrounding DRAM Industry 2. Increasing DRAM Standing as a Strategic Commodity 3. Demand for Improvements in Efficiency Introduction In the midst of an unprecedented slump, the industrial world is undergoing extensive restructuring through the elimination of unprofitable units, cutbacks in investments in plants and equipment, personnel reductions, plant closures, and other such measures. This downsizing has even touched what has been considered until now "sacred ground"--namely, research and development. In order for a country like Japan without any notable natural resources to continue its prosperity into the 21st century, however, there is no alternative but to give technology a central place in its industries. It is an undeniable fact that excessive restructuring will destroy its global competitiveness. A case in point is the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) industry, which is one of Japan's representative high-technology fields. As investment costs soar, outsiders and not a few industry insiders have begun to voice their concerns about its future. There is also concern about the narrowing gap between Korea and Japan. In the following sections, the authors have sorted through some of the problem points that face the industry while giving their projections about its future direction. 1. Current Problems Surrounding the DRAM Industry "Semiconductor integrated circuit" (IC) is really a collective term that covers a broad area. Roughly divided, it covers logic devices, such as the chips that perform the "logical decisions" of a computer, and memory devices, which store information. Microprocessor units (MPU's), which are the processing and control units in computers, are typical of the former; DRAM, the subject of this article, is typical of the latter. Since entering the DRAM market in the latter half of the 1960's, Japanese manufacturers, as part of a national effort, have steadily built up their strength by making full use of Japan's superior manufacturing technology and, in 1982, finally moved ahead of the United States to place first in the world in their field. However, when the supply-and-demand balance for 4-megabit DRAM memory (hereafter, 4M), collapsed after a better-than-expected start, problems such as those discussed below suddenly came to the surface, bringing with them serious concerns about the industry's future. A.. Soaring Investment Costs The first problem is rising investment costs. Generally, heavy investments in equipment are needed to manufacture integrated circuits, but the burden is even greater when it comes to DRAM and even heavier still for improvements in levels of integration. The reason is that, compared to MPUs, where the "soft" aspects of circuit design are of the greatest importance, in the case of dynamic random access memory, higher value-added is sought on the "hard" side--in other words, in finding ways to integrate more memory elements on a fixed surface--and production is always being carried out with investments in the latest processing technology and equipment. Every three to four years, the level of integration for DRAM chips increases fourfold, an improvement which requires a higher degree of precision and complexity in the manufacturing process. Capital investments for the standard DRAM plant[.sup]1[/], adequate at the 30 billion yen level for 1 megabit of DRAM memory, increased to 50 billion yen for 4 megabits and to 80 to 90 billion yen for 16 megabits and may even go as high as 100 billion yen for 64 megabits. It is unclear what the investment efficiency is for individual DRAM businesses, but certainly efficiency is getting poorer with these increasingly enormous amounts of capital outlay, and many in the business are concerned whether they can turn a profit. B. Korea's Rise to Prominence Second, there is Korea and the speed with which its enterprises are catching up with Japanese's DRAM industry. Although Korea entered the field only in the mid-1980's, its three zaibatsu-affiliated companies (Samsung Electronics, Gold Star and Hyundai Ltd.), backed by a wealth of funds, have been pouring their investment dollars into the DRAM field. As a result, in terms of today's leading 4-megabit DRAM chip, Korea is said to be "shoulder-to-shoulder with Japan in mass production technology." In terms of volume, Korea has caught up with the United States and is second only to Japan. An "export drive"--where Korean companies are exporting products to the United States at prices 10 percent or so cheaper than Japanese goods--seems to be an important factor here, and many people share the pessimistic view that Japan will be outdistanced by the Koreans some day in the same way that Japan earlier took the lead over the United States. With products like dynamic random-access memory, manufacturers are not only faced with the struggle to improve precision and use the latest technology but, since generations change every three to four years, their products very quickly become out-dated, and the existence of a low-cost player who can rapidly bring down prices represents a very big threat. C. Rising Investment Risk Investment risks have gotten higher primarily because of technological advances. The need for higher integration has always preceded the birth of DRAM chips. Before, if technology failed to keep pace with new needs, manufacturers could put money into developing new products without all that great a risk. With the coming of the "mega" age, however, that has changed. With a lot of experience and development know-how behind them, manufacturers have been able to shorten the time it takes to develop new products and to calculate when to make such investments. For DRAM, a product which uses the latest technology, experience brings with it a rapid improvement in yield during the initial period of production. This gives rise to the kind of phenomenon or pattern one always sees; namely, a temporary imbalance is effected between supply and demand, which in turn causes prices to drop sharply. It becomes quite significant, then, that it has become possible for manufacturers to manipulate their timing. It is commonly known that when it came time for 1-megabit DRAM, while the majority of companies were reluctant to invest during the recession, others, by investing aggressively, were able to enjoy large profits during the initial period when the market was still undersupplied. The opposite happened with 4-megabit DRAM. Not wanting to repeat the mistake they had made with 1M DRAM, companies all rushed ahead to invest. Unfortunately, this happened to be an "off-crop" season for new electronic products, and in addition to widening the supply-and-demand gap through their own making, they brought about a large drop in profits. This happened recently enough to still be fresh in the industry's memory. In a word, the fact that manufacturers could manipulate their investment timing worked against them, giving rise to a situation where they could easily be influenced by the moves of every other player. This in turn has raised investment risks in the DRAM industry. 2. Increasing DRAM Standing as a Strategic Commodity As these problems became clear, companies have adopt plans--for example, to expand their application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and MPU units--which are intended to "break [their] reliance on DRAM." In industrial circles, there is deep-rooted skepticism about the value of the DRAM industry itself, and one commonly hears criticisms that "DRAM is not a moneymaker" or "DRAM is low-level technology." However, one would have to say that too light a view of the DRAM industry is not only economically very dangerous but also strategically very dangerous. A. High-Growth in DRAM Demand Expected First of all, even compared to other semiconductors, DRAM will continue to be a high-growth product. That is because the demand for more bits (one bit, it will be remembered, is a single memory cell, or unit) is a demand for devices with larger memory capacity, which is essentially a demand for more DRAM, and this demand is expected to continue to show a high level of growth. Because they were disappointed in their expectations of the 4M during its initial period on the market, many manufacturers felt that "the need for higher integration might be on the decline." But, as mentioned earlier, the problem was mainly on the supply-side, and in fact, there have not been any signs since then of a slowdown in the growth in bit-demand. On the contrary, besides expecting to see more in the way of an information society in the future, one can expect to see "downsizing"--the shift toward smaller equipment--become the main current in computers. For example, if users shift from mainframes (which cost 500 million yen on average and have 8 gigabits of memory) to personal computers (costing 300,000 yen, with 32 megabits of memory), the total memory per unit price (bits/price) increases about sevenfold, clearly showing that the same investment dollar buys much more in the way of DRAM memory. In fact, if we compare the amount of DRAM required by these two types of equipment for the years 1987 and 1992, we see that personal computers have significantly boosted the demand for memory. It is projected that in the future the amount of memory required by computers will increase sharply as MPUs and software improve[.sup]2[/]. Certainly, it would not be an exaggeration to say the "age of large DRAM memory consumption" is coming. In fact, taking time trends over the past 10 years to estimate the growth rate over the next five years[.sup]3[/], the authors projected that demand will still continue to grow at around 46 percent on average. It seems that growth of 20-30 percent in the money base can also be anticipated. Of course, there will probably still be a sharp drop in production; this seems to be unavoidable when there is a changeover from one generation to the next one. Generally, the shift to a new generation occurs when users feel it is to their advance to use a next-generation product rather than an existing product. The pattern with DRAM chips, because of improvements in yield, shows that next-generation DRAM prices (i.e., the unit price per bit) will move sharply downward, falling below prices for existing generation DRAMs when the older and newer generations cross paths (bit-cross). But, besides expecting the price of both generation DRAM's to drop, one also expects to see production volume [as measured in dollars or yen] fall below levels attained during the heyday of the outgoing, previous-generation DRAM. The reason is that there will be less demand for the outgoing generation of DRAM chips as users shift to newer products having four times as much memory capacity; on the other hand, demand for newer products will not grow sufficiently to make up for this decline. It is the essential nature of the DRAM industry that this pattern of generational change will keep repeating itself, and around each changing of the guard this kind of dip will probably occur. However, looked at in medium and long-range terms, DRAM production [as measured in dollars or yen], sustained by a growth in bit-demand, can be expected to continue to show double-digit growth[.sup]4[/], and when considered in terms of semiconductors as a whole, can be expected to maintain a high level of growth, second only to that of MPU's. B. Spread Effects From DRAM Industry Another reason for aggressively developing Japan's DRAM industry can be seen when one considers the strategic importance of this industry and the beneficial spread effects its development will have on the semiconductor industry as a whole. As mentioned earlier, DRAM utilizes the latest semiconductor manufacturing processes, and by maintaining the field, Japanese manufacturers are sustaining the world's top manufacturing technology. It is not a matter simply of the technology being new. By putting to use manufacturing technology acquired during DRAM production or by utilizing manufacturing equipment that has already been paid off through DRAM production, they will make it possible to manufacture products other than DRAMs smoothly and at low cost. In that sense, DRAM continues to be the "foundation" of semiconductor production and Japan's "engine of technology." Another trend that has been attracting attention in particular these days is the increasing demand for more advanced manufacturing technology for high-growth microprocessing units. During these past several years, there have been remarkable improvements in MPU performance. But higher performance also means more complicated circuits and, inevitably, higher levels of integration and, thus, more investment dollars. According to estimates, total investments for the microprocessing giant Intel's next-generation MPU's, including the cost of manufacturing more units, will reach 500 billion yen, or 20 times the cost of its current MPU's. (Investment in the 4-megabit DRAM developed by Japan's top manufacturer totals about 200 billion yen.) On the other hand, more manufacturers are entering the MPU field. Thus, the price competition among them is heating up, and even in the case of MPU's, which are considered a typical high-value-added product, an important question that has started to be raised is how businesses can hold down plant and equipment investment costs and manufacture their products cheaply. In short, even in circuit design (the "soft" side of the coin), superior manufacturing technology is needed and without it, MPU businesses have become increasingly likely to fail. In fact, barring only a few exceptions, American manufacturers who have withdrawn from the DRAM business[.sup]5[/] are said to be having a very tough time making MPUs. This, then, may be an opportune time for Japanese semiconductor makers to give full play to the production technology they have built up and their proficiency in manufacturing products while achieving a good yield. Of course, even if Japan does try to enter the field, it is still behind in terms of the software that is necessary for MPU production and it will not immediately be competitive in the MPU field. But, clearly, it would be to Japan's advantage to build up its strength in those areas, such as microprocessors, where it is lagging behind the United States and, in the meantime, expand its efforts in "second source" enterprises to manufacture MPU's under license from American makers. While contributing its production know-how, it will also be gaining additional MPU know-how. Needless to say, aggressive investments in development are the best way to widen the gap between Japan and Korean competitors who are close on its heels. Certainly, Korean manufacturers have rapidly gained strength and, according to some analysts, will be bigger suppliers of the next-generation 16M than Japan. But it is also a fact that a gap still exists between the two countries, and if Japanese makers continue to invest as they have until now, it is fully possible that Japan will be able to maintain its present edge. One reason is that Korean manufacturers are still heavily dependent on Japanese and American technology. They are currently paying out over 10 percent of their sales for patent licenses, several percent points higher than what Japan is paying, and are said to be planning to continue aggressively importing new technology in the future. As can be seen, too, in the fact that Koreans are behind in circuit design technology, a point that will be touched on later in this report, Japan can still be considered ahead of Korea in terms of technology. Nor has Korea nurtured the growth of its semiconductor equipment manufacturing industry. Recently, joint development has been moving forward between Japanese and American semiconductor equipment makers, but just as the underdevelopment of the parts sector has become a weak point in Korea's consumer electronics industry, the lack of its own, domestic semiconductor equipment industry, the foundation for other related industries, is a major weakness. Thus, Korean manufacturers still have not shaken themselves free of their position as "trailers after Japan." What seems to be essential in order for Japan to maintain this lead are investments in the DRAM industry. Thus, the DRAM industry in Japan is faced with a number of problems. But as the competition among countries heats up, rather than losing its importance as a product that Japan has led the field with until now, dynamic random access memory is becoming even more important for Japan than ever before. The new turn taken in the direction of MPU's is definitely not a mistake. Given the fact that Japan is still not fully competitive in this area, its semiconductor industry cannot continue to develop and prosper without the development of enterprises where the DRAM remains the core product. 3. Demand for Improved Efficiency Future plans must then address the question of how the operations of the DRAM industry can be carried out more efficiently[.sup]6[/]. Steps already being taken by companies are described below. A. Keeping Investment Costs Down The first step is to hold investment costs down as much as possible. In order to achieve the kind of fast-paced, fourfold improvements that have occurred in integration every three to four years, it has become necessary for companies to invest aggressively in research and development, but with the "mega" age, the huge cost of development is climbing even higher. Companies are thus actively going into joint development projects--primarily with U.S. manufacturers--in an attempt to cut back even a little on their investment costs. Increasingly popular also is the move seen among manufacturing plants to use their equipment and facilities in common to the extent possible and to use the same equipment for two or more DRAM generations. Manufacturers have already been setting up [assembly] lines to introduce new, next-generation technology during the latter half of the preceding generation's lifetime and creating the flexibility to produce two generations of DRAM. Recently, they have also been trying to cut down on costs by designing their plants and equipment (with the exception of those used for precision processing) so they can be used from one generation to the next. They have also been trying to cut costs by eliminating whatever differences they can in the methods used by different plants, which have operated in the past in all but a disjointed, uncoordinated fashion. Moreover, in areas where manufacturers have been competitively near equals, there has even been a move to standardize equipment across companies. Thus, it is not an exaggeration to say that "economization" has now become a key word for every company. B. Controlling Supply Quantities; Seeds of Such a Technology Are Beginning To Sprout As mentioned earlier, when the balance between supply and demand is upset during the start-up period, it leads to a steep drop in prices which, in turn, has a negative effect on profits. To avoid such situations as much as possible, companies have aggressively been looking into technology to control supply in terms of quantity, or volume. Typical of such technology is the single-wafer processing method; here, in the manufacturing process, silicon wafers (on which circuits are to be etched) are processed one piece at a time. In the "batch method," the main method used at present, 50 to 150 pieces are processed in one lot, leading to rapid improvement in yield along with a greater supply [of silicon chips] than may have been expected. This is one of the major reasons that the gap between supply and demand widens. By contrast, with the introduction of the single-wafer method, it becomes possible to a greater extent than at present to control supply quantities while achieving higher yields. Understandably, companies are thus moving ahead with preparations to seriously introduce this method from the 64-megabit DRAM on. C. Making DRAM a High Value-Added Product Attempts are also being made to further establish a segregation of niche with Korea. DRAM is typical of a product that has a broad range of uses. And recently, as user needs have become more diversified, headway is being made in further diversifying DRAM's uses and turning it into an even higher value-added product: for example, as a "low-energy consumer," suitable for portable [computer] terminals; as a "high-speed" product, able to process voice and image data together in a single lump; and as a "special purpose DRAM," where memory sits on a single chip along with a logic circuit. In as much as such products differ from standard products in requiring circuit design and control technologies, it would seem that at present it would be hard for Korea to manufacture them on a large scale; for Japanese manufacturers, this may be an expedient way to avoid direct competition with Korean products. For low-grade products, manufacturers have already started to procure OEM [original equipment manufacturing] items from Korea and are moving into high value-added products while using Korean power to the extent possible for these low-grade items. This move toward creating separate niches will probably gather even more steam as time goes by. D. Overseas Development Until now, overseas development has referred primarily to 1) the opening up of markets in Europe and the United States in order to ease trade tensions, and 2) assembly production in Asian regions, where the aim has been to reduce the cost of labor-intensive processing. In only a few cases has large-scale production been carried out consistently in areas of high demand. But with the yen's appreciation to unprecedented levels, on the one hand, and with demand markets scattered randomly in different regions, on the other, it has become more important than ever for manufacturers to establish a global supply system. As products become more diversified, shortening the geographic distance between users and suppliers also takes on an important meaning from the viewpoint of accurately deciphering user needs and reducing the time for shipment and delivery. This disordered state is still evident in the overseas strategies of companies, but globalization is inescapable and will probably bring about a rapid overseas shift. Conclusion When the situation is viewed in this way, it becomes clear that recent perspectives on the DRAM industry often confuse its "essentially cyclical nature" with its "strategic significance." Certainly, the relative weight given to DRAM in Japan's semiconductor industry is becoming less significant, dropping from the 50 percent-and-above-level it has occupied thus far to the 30 percent-level today. With investments increasing yearly, it seems to some that DRAM is only becoming a heavier and heavier burden. However, as the authors have already mentioned, it is DRAM which continues to support Japan's semiconductor business, and recklessly weakening this support and curbing investments will not only lower the competitiveness of the semiconductor industry as a whole but also shake the very foundations of a country built on technology. In this sense, investment strategies developed from a long-term perspective can be seen as the very means by which to maintain a "high-tech Japan." While caution about ballooning investment costs is necessary, so too is a change of perspective necessary--a change where manufacturers will be seeing "a return on their DRAM investments through semiconductors." Footnotes 1. The example is for standard DRAM plants which process 200,000 silicon wafers per month; with the 4-megabit DRAM chip, currently the industry's main product, this is equivalent to a plant which produces 3 million units per month. 2. For example, the Pentium, which [Intel] hopes will become the main, next-generation microprocessing unit, requires about four times more DRAM for existing equipment (see following). 3. The method used to make this estimate was as follows: Y = 31.13701 + 233.1478x, where Y = average change in bit-demand over a three-year period, X = the reciprocal of the time trend, or 1/time trend, and R[.sup]2[/] = 0.8799, D.W. = -2.76. 4. Hypothesizing that the unit price per bit would show a consist drop due to technological innovations, the authors estimated unit price, using trends over the past 10 years; by multiplying this estimated unit price by bit-demand, they came out with a 28 percent or so growth rate in DRAM-demand over the next 5 years. More specifically, the unit price per bit was estimated as follows: Y = -0.003341714 + 0.09791906x + 0.01502765d where Y = unit price per bit and x = reciprocal of time trend, or 1/time trend, d = dummy variable (in 1984 and 1988, the years that 256K and 1M started to be mass produced in earnest and the unit price of bits rose, the value "1" was assigned to the dummy variable; "1" was not assigned in 1991 although that was the year mass production was started in earnest on the 4M. Because demand at the beginning lagged, the unit price of bits fell sharply). R[.sup]2[/] = 0.8799, D.W. = 2.76 5. With the coming of the "mega" age, American manufacturers have withdrawn one after the other and at present, only three companies, Texas Instruments, Motorola, and Micron Technology, are continuing in the business. The first two are engaged in joint development with Japanese manufacturers. In part, this [withdrawal of companies] may be an indication that an aggressive turn has been taken in the MPU field. The primary reason, however, is that there are many specialist manufacturers in the United States who have not been able to keep up with the heavy burden of investing in equipment and research and development. As a result, American manufacturers are behind Japan in technological innovations and their mass-production systems. 6. As mentioned earlier, investment efficiency for DRAM alone is not clear. However, recovery seems to be the underlying tone for the semiconductor industry as a whole. According to a leading manufacturer, DRAM profits are "still showing adequate improvement."
