Kuril District Administration Chief G. Dolin, assessing the results of two years of visa-exempt exchanges, said, "the fact that we islanders have stopped viewing Japan as an enemy is the most important change." Speaking at a press conference in Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaido, Dolin said friendships have developed between Russians and Japanese, while the views of the Russians on the territorial dispute have moved closer to those of the Japanese. The Russian delegation arrived in Sapporo on Sunday for a six-day stay in Hokkaido and Tokyo to coordinate a plan for visa-free group exchanges between neighboring regions of the two countries this year. South Kuril District Chief N.A. Pokidin pledged at the press conference that efforts would be made to expand access for former Japanese residents and their relatives to graves dating from before the Russian takeover of the disputed islands. The four islands -- Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai islets -- were seized by Soviet forces at the end of World War II and subsequently repopulated by Russians. Russian refers to them as the South Kurils, while Japan calls them its northern territories.
