As a result, the tax revenues of the province increased by a big margin. On the afternoon of 11 January, He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, went to the provincial tax bureau to extend greetings to the bureau and also stated that in the new year, the bureau should make consistent efforts to achieve the reform of the tax system, make efforts to promote production and increase revenues, and strive to make greater achievements. At the meeting hall of the provincial tax bureau, Comrade He Zhukang heard the work report made by the responsible comrade of the provincial tax bureau and also held talks with some tax cadres. In the past year, the tax organs at various levels and the broad masses of tax cadres across the province conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the sixth provincial party congress, persistently administered the tax affairs according to laws, strengthened the management of tax collection, vigorously organized tax collection, positively promoted production to increase revenues, realistically strengthened the construction of the cadres contingents, and better accomplished various tax revenue tasks. According to statistics, the provincial tax department collected and handed over to the state treasury 7.168 billion yuan of local-level industrial and commercial taxes, showing an increase of 43.4 percent over the previous year and overfulfilling the fiscal target of elevating the tax collection work to a new height. The growth rate had not been seen in the past few years. The tax management forms and the tax inspection methods were improved. The scale of experiment with the management of tax affairs on a commissioned basis was expanded. All this helped promote the setup of the pattern for collection and management of taxes suitable to the socialist market economic system. We made noticeable achievements in consolidating the tax revenue order. The overall front has further improved its practice and made achievements in especially eliminating the unhealthy trends. During the talks, the participants set forth opinions and suggestions on installing organs, collecting and managing tax revenues, and promoting production to increase revenues following the implementation of the new tax system and on the new problems that will possibly emerge. Comrade He Zhukang wrote down what he was told. After hearing their speeches, he pleasantly said: Our province's tax revenue work has been good. The tax revenues steadily increased. Particularly in 1993, the tax revenues increased by a big margin thanks to the efforts made by the broad masses of the tax affairs workers. On the one hand, the tax department has vigorously increased its revenues; and on the other, it has positively supported the local economic development. So, it has made great contributions. It also stands in the forefront of deepening reform and correcting the unhealthy trends within trades. It has made many successful explorations and accumulated many typical experiences. The provincial party committee and the provincial government have constantly been satisfied with the tax revenue work. On behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, I came here today in order to extend cordial regards and heartfelt thanks to you and also ask you to pass our regards and thanks to the broad masses of tax workers across the province. Comrade He Zhukang said: The 1994 reform and tax tasks are very heavy. First, we should grasp revenues. This is of extreme importance to ensure a sustained and fast economic development and the implementation of a series of new reform measures. Second, we should achieve the reform of the tax system and ensure the implementation of the new tax system. We should strengthen study and propaganda to have the tax workers, the personages of all social circles, and the broad masses of the people to accurately understand and support this reform. We have to do a lot of work to implement the new tax system and to exert great efforts to do our work well from the beginning of the year. The next-step work will easily be done when we achieve the work of the first year. Otherwise, there will be more difficulties. We should conscientiously conduct investigations and study when coming across with the problems in the course of implementing the new tax system and explore methods for solving the problems cropping up in the course of practice. Simultaneously, we should timely report to the higher levels and ask their instructions so as to reasonably solve problems. The reform of the tax system is a matter relating to not only the tax departments but also the party committees and governments at various levels. Therefore, the party committees and governments at various levels should go all out to support the reform of the tax system to ensure the smooth progress of this reform. Comrade He Zhukang stressed: As a key economic lever, the tax collection work plays a better role in macroeconomic regulation and control. Therefore, strengthening the macroeconomic regulation and control plays a proper role in setting up the socialist market economic system. Great changes will take place after implementing the new tax system. Some problems have not been expected. Particularly, we should urgently study methods to solve the problems relating to the existence and development of a large number of town and township enterprises and small-scale tax payers. Some of the existing macroeconomic regulation and control methods are not suitable any more. Thus, the tax departments are required to become a new actor as soon as possible, readjust its work ideology, boldly explore ways and methods for macroeconomic regulation and control under the new system, and strive to promote a sound development of the economy. Comrade He Zhukang said: After the reform of the tax system, the tax organ should be divided into two bureaus, such as state tax bureau and local tax bureau. However, their goal still remains unchanged. That is, they should better promote the development of reform and the economy. Both state and local tax bureaus are very important. We should foster the idea of "taking the whole country into account." We should consult and coordinate with one another if there are problems, proceed from the overall situation, and make concerted efforts to achieve the tax revenue work. Comrade He Zhukang concluded: Today, the participants set forth many good opinions and suggestions on the tax revenue work. From now on, we hope that you will be able to put forward, at any time, your own opinions and suggestions on the work of the provincial party committee and the provincial government and on the local economic development. The party committees and governments at various levels should pay high attention to your opinions and suggestions to ceaselessly improve their work. Present at the talks were responsible comrades of the relevant departments of the provincial party committee and the provincial government.
