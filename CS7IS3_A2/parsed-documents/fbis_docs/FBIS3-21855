Kaul] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The United Nations International Drug Control Program Agency has recently disclosed how the Pakistani drug lords were making fortunes through drug exports. Its report titled The Illicit Opiate Industry in Pakistan estimated that Pakistan's drug bosses earned roughly $2.7 billion annually. And the export earnings which are half this amount are as much as the country's legitimate commodity export trade. [sentence as heard] Heroin production, goes on the UN report, is most profitable in Pakistan with an approximate turnover of $2.5 billion. It is a quarter of its underground economy, the UN Drug Control Agency's deputy director, (Alexander Seggar), is reported to have said in Islamabad. He is cited to have said that domestic market itself is very large, estimated to be a flourishing business of $1.2 billion. Pakistan's most dreaded intelligence outfit, Inter Service Intelligence, is known to push drug traffickers into Kashmir for subversive activities after leading them up the garden path. [sentence as heard] India lies in the middle of what is known as the Golden Crescent, comprising Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. From India, the drugs find their routes to the U.S. and other Western countries and the enormous funds thus realized come handy to finance terrorism in Kashmir. Just a few months ago, the vigilant Indian security and paramilitary forces nabbed subversives from across the border carrying huge quantities of heroin and opium in the Jammu sector. The Border Security Force authorities were surprised to find 13 kg of heroin and 11 kg of opium in a single catch. The politician-drug mafia nexus is an open secret in Pakistan, a Central Intelligence Agency commission reports, which gave out the details of drug bosses' connections with the important politicians. [sentence as heard] The Pakistani newspapers vied with each other in flashing the news about the politician-drug lord nexuses. A crime boss of Lahore, who also headed a drug syndicate, had close connection with the family of a former prime minister as was traced by the U.S. intelligence agency report. Though the family of the former prime minister vociferously denied it, it did not carry much conviction even with the people in Pakistan. Since the report was leaked just a month ahead of the last Pakistani general election, it did its damage to the former prime minister as his political outfit lost rather cheaply in the poll.
