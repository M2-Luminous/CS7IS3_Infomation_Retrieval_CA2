However, PNP [Philippine National Police] ReCom [Regional Command] IV Chief Romeo Odi refused to disclose the names of the three. The three are now the subject of an extensive manhunt called Task Force Comrade Hector. The first gunman is 5 feet and 6 inches tall, weighs 135 pounds, slim-built, around 20 years old and of brown complexion. According to witnesses, the first gunman approached and shot Comrade Hector between the eyes. When he fell, the second gunman approached and shot Comrade Hector in the face and the body to make sure that he was dead. The second gunman is a mestizo, stands 5 feet and 7 inches, is between 28 and 33 years old, and is of medium-build. He is believed to be the leader of the group. The lookout, who also served as the back-up, is also of medium-build and is 5 feet 7 inches tall, of fair complexion, and 25 to 30 years old. Meantime, ReCom IV confirms that the murder of Comrade Hector was decided by the Southern Tagalog Regional Committee of the New People's Army [NPA]. According to Superintendent Victor Tiangco, five former followers of Comrade Hector descended the mountain to warn him of the assassination plan. [Begin Tiangco recording in English; monitored in progress] ...our investigation leads to Comrade Roger's group and we have witnesses and statements by reliable sources that this is the handiwork of Comrade Roger of the CPP (Communist Party of the Philippines)-NPA, because one week before the actual ambush of Comrade Hector, a group of NPA's loyal to Mabilangan went to his residence and warned him of the assassination to be carried out by expert assassins led by Comrade Rex and Comrade Carlo. [end recording] In a related development, the possible motive for murdering Mabilangan is alleged to be related to his livelihood projects. According to the NBI [National Bureau of Investigation], many rebels surrendered to join Comrade Hector's projects, which grossly reduced the ranks of the NPA, especially the Banahaw Command, formerly led by Comrade Hector. President Ramos assured the family of Comrade Hector that the government would do its best to arrest his assassins. The president likewise called Comrade Hector a hero because he risked his life when he surrendered and decided to help the government. The president likewise issued a directive to study the possibility of putting rebel surrenderees under the witness protection program or granting them security.
