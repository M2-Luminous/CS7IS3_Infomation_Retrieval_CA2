The government did this to promote market liberalization through deregulation plans which should be drawn up by the end of March. Specifically, the government wants to ease regulations which are stricter than those of other Group of Seven (G-7) member nations to the level of the G-7 by introducing a "ceiling method" to make uniform reductions, at a time when budget drafts are being compiled. To accomplish this, the government will study the possibility of easing safety regulations, which are considered a sacred area, and review various inspections -- including quality inspections on foreign cars and electric appliances, customs safety inspections on imported food and cosmetics, standards for construction work, and building codes for the floor space of buildings in relation to the size of the lots on which they stand. The government plans to specify the measures in the second stage of market liberalization to be announced in late June. The "ceiling method" will be introduced to break the deadlocked current situation in which deregulation is not being promoted due to resistance from ministries and agencies which have the right to issue licenses and permits. First, all regulations will be divided into government regulations, public and nonprofit foundations' regulations, and private sector regulations. Then they will be further classified into regulations which do not exist in other developed countries but only in Japan, regulations which exist in the United States and the European Union, and regulations which exist in all other developed countries. After that, all ministries and agencies will be asked to ease those regulations which are peculiar only to Japan and over which they were originally given the right to issue licenses and permits. Fundamentally, the government plans to take measures designed to ease the regulations which exist only in Japan to the level of regulations in Europe and the United States, or otherwise remove them completely. The government will review its regulations in different ways depending on their importance and the intensity of demands from Europe and the United States. However, the reviews will be made from the following viewpoints: 1) regulations, which exist only in Japan, will be removed or otherwise the government will clarify their contents if it is impossible to remove them; 2) the government will try to match the building codes and standards with those of other countries; and 3) data of inspections made in other countries will be used in lieu of customs inspections conducted by Japan when foreign goods are imported. In the case of European cars imported to Japan, for example, inspections during the manufacturing process and inspections upon completion are needed because the European Union requires inspections during the manufacturing stage, and Japan requires inspections on completed cars. Japan will now remove its mandatory requirements for inspections on completed cars. Moreover, Japan will accept North American construction material standards without any change in an attempt to expand imports of construction materials produced on the basis of North American standards. Japan restricts construction of special structure two-storied homes, saying the Building Standards Act is "not pertinent for such technical inspections." However, the government will study the possibility of easing or abolishing the regulations to make its systems match the current situations in Europe and the United States. Because of this, the government expects that housing constructions will gather momentum.
