Therefore, we ask the Zionists what they would describe as their law and regulations, considering what happened in the Ibrahimi Mosque today, when a Zionist opened fire on a group of worshipers praying piously to God. In moments, they were transferred into martyrs in the name of God. The ground of the Mosque was turned into a lake of the blood of scores of martyrs and hundreds of wounded, within sight of the army which was guarding the place and keeping the peace. Tomorrow, they will claim that a demented person committed the crime or that it is a revenge operation. They will pretend to condemn and denounce it. The PSP [Progressive Socialist Party] has sent a cable to the United Nations, the Socialist International, the Arab League, and all other international organizations condemning this ugly crime and demanding that a stance be taken regarding it. It would like to make the following remarks: 1. This crime committed by a Zionist settler is not an individual act. It represents a racist and extremist way of thinking and behaving opposed to everything that is Arab. This proves the racist nature of the Israeli culture, which they teach their children and citizens and present as an example to the region under the banner of the future Israeli peace. 2. What is the use of reaching agreements with the Israelis while Israel presents new evidence daily on its continuing policy to terrorize the Arabs in Palestine and kick them out of their land? We wonder about the usefulness of the Oslo agreement and the subsequent agreements, and about how serious the two cosponsors are about securing peace in the Middle East. 3. We ask the United States and International Security Council in particular about the usefulness of repealing the resolution equating Zionism with racism when Israel provides daily evidence of its extremist racism and deep-rooted fascism. 4. We ask PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat why he is in a hurry to skip stages. We ask him whether he is now convinced that unilateral solutions are no good for the Palestinian people, since they only allow Israeli infiltration into the Arab ranks and undermine Arab decisiveness. Such solutions do not constitute progress toward a just peace that secures for the Palestinian people their simplest rights. 5. We affirm to Israel that the blood which flowed at dawn today on this Ramadan morning will permeate the Arab spirit and teach each Arab that the Zionists are deadly enemies. The masses will avenge you, o martyrs of the mosque, o martyrs of Palestine and Arabism.
