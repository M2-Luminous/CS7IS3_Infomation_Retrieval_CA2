Authoritative Syrian sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Washington negotiations have so far inspired no hope of achieving success in the peace process. And that the Israeli delegation continues to avoid providing clear and frank answers with regard to the issue of complete withdrawal from the Golan and the occupied Arab territories, which is the basis for a just and comprehensive peace. The sources added that the round to be held between the Syrian and Israeli delegations will be crucial in determining the fate and future of the negotiation process, especially as the United States has decided to assume the task of imparting the necessary impetus to the political peace process on all tracks and renewed before the world in Geneva its commitment to achieving a just and comprehensive peace on all fronts. The sources went on: Thus Rabin and his government will be subjected to a test with regard to their willingness to respond to the will of the international community and Washington. The Syrian sources urged the international community to shoulder the responsibility for salvaging and implementing its legitimacy and putting an end to Israeli evasion. [passage omitted]
