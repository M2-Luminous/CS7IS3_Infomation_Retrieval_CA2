"I have not thought of resigning; I shall continue ahead. The people elected me for a four-year period," the Ecuadoran president said in a news conference in the Government Palace. On Wednesday various local media gave assurances that Duran-Ballen would leave office and Vice President Alberto Dahik would be appointed to replace him. Duran-Ballen said that on that day he received numerous calls at his home from reporters, officials, and friends to learn the truth. "The callers asked whether I had suffered a heart attack, if it was true that the members of the military were in the National Palace and that I had resigned. They all were rumors," the president assured. The 72-year-old president had a back operation a year ago and today he said that his health is good. He denied being depressed and affirmed that he is in good spirits to face the problems and responsibilities inherent to his post. Duran-Ballen, elected president in August 1992, said that rumors about coups and the situation of unrest that exist were created by "people interested in creating instability in the country." He did not identify any of these people. Regarding the plebiscite his government wants to convoke, the president said that the plebiscite, the date, and the issues it will cover are still being discussed. He said it would be more like "consulting the people." The Ecuadoran Armed Forces publicly reiterated Thursday their support for President Duran-Ballen and guaranteed the permanence of the democratic system and their support for constitutional order. According to the political opposition and experts, the Ecuadoran president is burdened by the country's political and economic problems. Right now the country is practically ungovernable. Vice President Alberto Dahik is constantly in conflict with the opposition, to the degree that legislators have warned that if Duran-Ballen were to resign, Congress would appoint a successor who would not be the official the Constitution envisages.
