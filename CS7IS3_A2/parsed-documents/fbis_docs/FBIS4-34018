This goal is contained in the Cartagena de Indias Declaration, a 19-page document, which will be signed tomorrow by the leaders, as they close the two-day meeting that opened today at the Convention Center of this city on the Colombian Caribbean coast, a city that was declared a historic heritage of humanity. The text, which was negotiated at initial meetings involving foreign ministers and technicians of 21 countries, promotes a reinforcement of economic relations and of the various integration processes. It followed the general topic of the meeting, "Trade and Integration as Factors for Ibero-American Development." The document calls for the "convergence" of existing integration mechanisms, for an American trade liberalization, for the expansion of economic relations with all countries and regions, even with the Pacific Rim, and for an expansion of trade and investment between Latin America and the EU. As for the latter, the declaration points out that Spain and Portugal constitute "privileged points of contact" between the two continents. This fourth summit was attended by 20 chiefs of state, and by Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, and Vice President Carlos Morales, who represented Dominican Republic President Joaquin Balaguer, 87, who was advised by his doctors to not travel due to his glaucoma problem. "It is expected that the liberalization process and the promotion of multilateral trade and investment will create new and necessary vigor for international economic activity that will bring about and higher employment levels," the final document states. The Ibero-American summit voices hope that GATT and its future transformation into the World Trade Organization, in keeping with an agreement signed in April, will be an instrument that will help strengthen the sector's multilateral system. The declaration states that the pact clearly regulates the commercial stands of the countries, strengthens mechanisms to settle controversies, and decreases the risk of applying unilateral measures to protect inefficient sectors of the economy. The spirit of open regionalism, which should rule the regional integration processes, is considered to be a complement of the main elements of development such as the strengthening of the democratic system, access to new technologies, macroeconomic stability, economic revival, social cohesion, and environmental policies. The Cartagena summit reviewed such Latin American sub-regional integration agreements as the Central American Integration System, the Free Trade Agreement of the Group of Three (Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia), the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom), the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), and the complementary economic pacts within the framework of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). The summit also mentioned the importance of the Brazilian proposal to create a South American Free Trade Area (ALCSA) based on Mercosur and pointed out that NAFTA, signed by the United States, Mexico, and Canada, will have reverberating effects throughout the American continent. The rulers are recommending the strengthening of Latin American-European relations in order to promote a balanced trade by means of identifying the adequate mechanisms to hold talks and to promote cooperation. In addition, the heads of state are advocating the modernization of state apparatuses through programs to modernize and minimize bureaucratic procedures, increases in the participation of the private sector in the construction of infrastructure, and the creation of a scientific community. In what constitutes a direct reference to the historic dispute between the United States and Cuba, the Cartagena de Indias Declaration advocates the elimination of "coercive" and unilateral economic and commercial measures that could affect free international trade movements and could "hamper" the Latin American peoples' living conditions. For the past 32 years, the United States has imposed an economic and commercial embargo on Cuba as a punishment, because leader Fidel Castro implemented a communist political system in 1959. The Fifth Ibero-American Summit will take place next year in Argentina, possibly at the tourist resort city of San Carlos de Bariloche, in southern Argentina.
