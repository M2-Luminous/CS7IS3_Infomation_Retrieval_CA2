During the inspection, Mr. Li said that the special economic zones (SEZ) should maintain their special characteristics and get rid of old ideas and seek more ways for economic development so as to set an example for China's inland areas. Mr. Li said that the SEZs should be clear about the distance between them and conventional international practice. The State Council planned to set up certain enterprises on a trial basis in the SEZs to spread their experience in the mainland and see how they can be run in line with conventional international practice. He also said that some reform experiments may proceed first in such zones as Zhuhai. For example 24-hour customs service with Macao and large-scale bonded zones set up in Zhuhai should be considered. Following his inspection of key projects in Zhuhai such as harbours, the airport and railways, Mr. Li said that Zhuhai had shown a fast speed of construction and he hoped for a better investment environment there to attract a high level of foreign capital.
