FR940906-0-00044 FR940906-0-00017 Today, many of these pollutants and contaminants persist, primarily bound in sediments. Apperson (1992) noted that detectable levels of aluminum, copper, lead, zinc, and strontium were found in sturgeon oocyte (egg) samples from the Kootenai River along with detectable levels of PCB's and pesticides. However, other than copper the detectable levels of these compounds (e.g., PCB's, organochlorines, zinc) were either (1) lower than levels found in other Columbia River basin sturgeon populations that successfully reproduce, or (2) not enough is known regarding the toxicity of these pollutants to sturgeon. Partridge (1983) expressed concerns that contaminants, primarily high concentrations of copper and zinc, may inhibit survival of white sturgeon eggs and larvae. Apperson (1992) believed that ``*␣*␣*concentrations of copper found in white sturgeon oocytes potentially present the most severe contaminant effect on reproductive success'' since some of the copper concentrations found in water samples taken in the Kootenai River were in the range of levels known to inhibit yolk uptake in larval white sturgeon. One of the initial objectives of the Kootenai Indian Tribe's experimental hatchery was to determine the relationship between water quality (including toxicants) and gamete viability. Initial culture efforts documented successful fertilization and incubation, and that sturgeon gametes (i.e. eggs and sperm) from wild sturgeon are generally viable (Apperson and Anders 1991). While this demonstrates that wild sturgeon eggs are viable when spawned under hatchery conditions, the effects of heavy metals, organochlorines, and other contaminants in Kootenai River waters and sediments on the reproductive success of wild sturgeon is unknown. Sturgeon eggs and embryos are sensitive to pollutants, with some heavy metals known to be toxic at very minute concentrations (Dettlaff et al. 1993). Georgi (1993) notes that the chronic effects of wild sturgeon spawning in ``chemically polluted'' water and rearing on contaminated sediments, in combination with bioaccumulation of contaminants in the food chain, is possibly impacting the successful reproduction and early age recruitment to the Kootenai River white sturgeon population. In summary, the degree to which poor water quality, sediment, and prey base contamination are factors threatening Kootenai River white sturgeon survival are not known, and remain potential threats to the species. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by the species in determining to issue this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon ( Acipenser transmontanus ) as endangered because the population has been declining since the mid-1960's. The remaining population in 1993 is estimated at 785 individuals (range 569 to 1,080) based on estimated annual mortality rates and recent zero recruitment, with most individual sturgeon older than 20 years of age. There has been almost no recruitment of juveniles into the population since 1974 and the population may be reaching a stage of reproductive senescence. The reduced river flows during the critical spring spawning and early rearing season as a result of the operation of Libby Dam has impacted recruitment since the mid-1970's, and threatens the continued existence of this population. The population also faces threats from reduced biological productivity, and possibly poor water quality and the effects of contaminants. Because this distinct population of white sturgeon is in danger of extinction throughout its range, it fits the Act's definition of an endangered species. For reasons discussed below, critical habitat is not being proposed at this time. Critical Habitat Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that critical habitat be designated to the maximum extent prudent and determinable concurrently with the determination that a species is endangered or threatened. Regulations implementing section 4 of the Act provide that a designation of critical habitat is not determinable when one or both of the following situations exists: (1) Information sufficient to perform required analyses of the impacts of the designation is lacking, or (2) the biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well known to permit identification of an area as critical habitat (50 CFR 424.12). The Service has completed its analysis of the biological status of the Kootenai River population of the white sturgeon, yet has not completed the analysis necessary for the designation of critical habitat. The Service has decided to proceed with the final listing determination now and to consider the designation of critical habitat in a separate rulemaking. Consequently, the Service has determined that critical habitat for the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon is not presently determinable because information sufficient to perform the required analyses of the impacts of such a designation is lacking. The Service will continue to gather and review information concerning habitat requirements of this sturgeon and has identified several activities that may adversely impact those habitats. For example, the Service has identified the lack of natural flows in the Kootenai River below Libby Dam as the primary threat to this white sturgeon population. Other than a need for basic understanding of streamflow conditions necessary for providing spawning and early rearing habitat during the normal May through July sturgeon spawning season, the life history requirements for other life stages of white sturgeon are not sufficiently well known to permit identification of an area in the Kootenai River basin as designated critical habitat. Additionally, many Kootenai River white sturgeon migrate freely throughout the Kootenai River system and spend part of their life in Kootenay Lake in British Columbia, Canada. Critical habitat designation is not allowed outside the United States since only Federal agencies are under the jurisdiction of section 7 of this Act.
