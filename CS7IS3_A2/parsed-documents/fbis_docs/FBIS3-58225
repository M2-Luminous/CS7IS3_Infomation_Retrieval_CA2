The meeting was held in camera. In a statement on her speech Ciller listed the main points of this assessment as follows: Turkey is pleased with the establishment of the European Union and of a European security and defense identity. However, this identity must include all the European NATO members; in other words, Turkey must be a full member of the European Union. The alliance remains inadequate before the clashes and human tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Whatever is necessary must be done to prevent new tragedies elsewhere. NATO must continue to be an intervening power in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and when an agreement is reached, it must make contributions, not only donations. We must either protect the innocent, or we must lift the arms embargo. The people of another country are not the children of another God. The attack on Azerbaijan must stop. We support the process of democracy and reform in Russia. Everyone must support the independence of the new republics established in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse. Turkey views positively the project of a united and common duty force that can be established to protect peace. The proliferation of mass destruction weapons constitutes an important threat, and is therefore an important source of danger in Turkey's region. This threat can be eliminated only through joint effort. Terrorism is a kind of war aimed against democracy and human rights, and no pretext can conceal this fact. Those who support terrorism end up being its victims. As in other fields, we must be in solidarity and cooperation regarding this issue as well. For Turkey, the territorial integrity and independence of every ally is sacred. We expect the same approach from our allies. We live in an uncertain world. Even though unity is more difficult in such situations, it is important. Those who want to foresee the future must be strong enough to form the future. [passage omitted]
