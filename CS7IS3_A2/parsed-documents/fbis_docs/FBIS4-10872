Presidential Candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares, of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, met with workers of the diplomatic corps and students on 13 April.

He added the ministry will have the important task of upholding the Panama Canal Treaty and "promoting our geographic position and our potential as a nation." In doing so, "we will attract the foreign investment we need to create jobs."

He strongly criticized the Endara administration for "being incapable of solving the country's social problems."

Early polarization among ruling parties has resulted in "paralyzation of the government's development plans."

Perez said "there is no way we can ask the workers to sacrifice what they have earned." Carles said, however, any changes "will depend on what would work and how it would work. We must speak to the workers first."

All candidates agreed there is a "moral crisis" in Panama. Quijano said the solution lies in giving the people "real alternatives, instead of false promises." Altamirano blamed the crisis on the "unemployment rate, extreme poverty, and unequal distribution of wealth." Ossa called for a "national concerted" effort to face the problem.
