Serra Puche stressed that the federal government does not plan to adjust the laws to NAFTA as the modifications needed to make the country more competitive "have already been made." In an exclusive interview for EL FINANCIERO, Serra Puche said the Mexican Government is studying the possibility of signing bilateral agreements to protect the investments of countries with the largest amount of foreign investment in our country; in other words, Europe and Japan. This does not mean that Mexico will not offer legal guarantees to countries other than the United States and Canada, with whom we signed a trade agreement, that wish to participate in the Mexican market. Proof of this is that in 1993 we received foreign capital totaling $15.6 billion, which means that among developing countries, Mexico receives the largest amount of foreign investment in the world. Even the sad incidents in southeastern Mexico have not reduced investors' confidence in Mexico. Foreign investment reached $2.370 billion in January, a sum equivalent to what the country received "for an entire year" six years ago. In other words, all indications are that Mexico is highly competitive and that investors view us as a nation with great possibilities for growth and stability. Serra Puche stressed that NAFTA represents a region open to trade, which is confirmed by the fact that Mexico proposed the clause giving other countries access to the treaty. He said the government is studying the possibility of signing bilateral agreements to protect foreign investment, giving priority to Europe and Japan, but a final decision has not been reached. European trade representatives have noted the importance of Mexico's signing bilateral agreements to protect investments, particularly the establishment of impartial judges who can guarantee the resolution of controversies between foreign companies and the Mexican Government as established in NAFTA. In that manner, other countries would have the same privileges as Canada and the United States when investing in the Mexican market. Serra Puche reiterated that "we are not planning to make additional changes" to Mexican laws, even though some exporters claim that national laws "fall short" of covering the scope of the trilateral agreement. In the specific case of the Intellectual Property Law, for which "changes are not being contemplated, either," Serra Puche stressed that Mexico's regulations to protect intellectual property are already internationally recognized as their legal and institutional framework has been modernized; therefore, no further adjustments are warranted. During the interview conducted near the Miguel Hidalgo Airport in Guadalajara, Serra Puche categorically said that Mexican exports "today are under conditions equal" to similar products in the United States and Canada, as great efforts have been made to improve quality to raise their competitive level. The export sector, however, has persistently demanded that the Mexican Government give specific support to Mexican enterprises so they can compensate for the existing differences between Mexico and its main commercial partners. In that regard, Serra Puche said that NAFTA "does not permit the application of subsidies to exports."
