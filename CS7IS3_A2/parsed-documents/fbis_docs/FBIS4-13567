A report. [Begin recording] [Correspondent] The program -- India Invesmart -- organized jointly by Industry Ministry and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization -- UNIDO -- is providing a forum for individual business negotiations between foreign investors and Indian project sponsors. The five priority sectors in this meet are food processing, leather and leather products, textiles and ready-made garments, chemicals, and metallurgy. Inaugurating the five-day Invesmart, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, called for an interdisciplinary approach to industrialization keeping in mind the variety of contemporary concerns like environment, employment, and resources. [Rao] The fact that most of the identified projects are in the small and medium enterprise sector, it is equally important. This sector has led the process of economic growth in a number of developing countries and moreover in India it is particularly important for its relatively greater employment potential. Thus it has been the effort of my government to strengthen industries in this sector through promotion of competition, efficiency, technology upgradation, and enhancement of the export capability. [Correspondent] The Secretary General of UNIDO, Mr. Mauricio de Mar'iay Campos, took note of India's industrial growth potential; some of the contributory factors being India's large market and skilled and diversified manpower and its wide industrial base. India's investment potential has attracted the foreign investors attending this meet, nearly half of them coming from major developed countries like France, Germany, Italy, UK, and USA. The proposals to be discussed amounted total investment of nearly $1,500 million mostly in the small and medium scale sector. An open house question hour session was held in the afternoon between investors and entrepreneurs on the one side and top (?prime) representatives of the government and apex industry organizations on the other. Headed by the chairman of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, Mr. A.N. Verma, the (?panelists) fielded questions ranging from pollution control laws to Land Ceiling Act, shareholding rules, and the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] regulations. It was clear at the end of the day that the government in collaboration with UNIDO intended to act as a promoting rather than a regulatory body. [end recording]
