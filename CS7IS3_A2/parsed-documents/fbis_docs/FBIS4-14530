General Zaikidze, an ally of President Eduard Shevardnadze, was sacked late Thursday, the ministry said. Hours earlier hundreds of police, many armed with automatic weapons, stormed the parliament building to protest the nomination of a new interior minister they charged was unfit for the job. Shevardnadze, who was present in the legislature at the time of the incident, persuaded Zaikidze to withdraw his men. The police chief then blockaded himself in his office at service headquarters, demanding the dismissal of new Interior Minister Shota Kviraya, whose nomination was confirmed Thursday. Zaikidze, whose dismissal was ordered by Georgia's military court and the Interior and Security Ministries, remained barricaded in his office Friday morning.
