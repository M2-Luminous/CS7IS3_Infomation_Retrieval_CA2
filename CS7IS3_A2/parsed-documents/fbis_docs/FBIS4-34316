Just hours before his departure, Fidel commented to journalists who were covering the summit on his impressions of the event. [Reporter] "Commander, Cuba has been present at the four summits. What has Cuba's contribution been in these summits and how have these summits benefited Cuba?" [Castro] "Well, I would say that Cuba has made a contribution with its very presence. Its presence there is something that is exceptional, new, and unprecedented. For the first time, there was no exclusion. Mexico had much to do with that as well as our other important Latin American friends. Therefore, Cuba's presence gives the summit more seriousness and dignity because the cowardly exclusion is no longer committed." Fidel's last hours in Cartagena were marked by an emotional encounter with Colombian solidarity groups, which motivated comments by the Cuban president on continental integration. [Castro] "I would also say that men and women like you around the world are going to destroy the walls of that gigantic Jericho that tries to defeat and crush Cuba and the Cuban Revolution, and that tries to crush the brotherhood and union among all our peoples."
