Yet, no signs have appeared of any Israeli or U.S. moves to reopen the road to peace, which the perpetrators of the massacre have blocked with blood and fire. Provided with U.S. political cover at the UN Security Council, the Israeli Government seems to be shirking its responsibility as an occupying force. According to the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel must protect civilians in wartime. However, the Israeli Government continues its terrorist policy, without showing the least respect for human rights. Instead of encouraging the Rabin government to assume its full responsibilities toward this terrible crime, the United States for two weeks has hampered any move by the UN Security Council to issue a resolution providing for the validity of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied Palestinian territory and securing protection for the Palestinian people. In view of this Israeli arrogance and the flagrant U.S. bias toward the Yitzhaq Rabin government, the Arab side looks like a weak, wounded body watching what is taking place at the UN Security Council, unable to move or even to express pain as a result of the ceaseless knifing of his flesh. Having seen the odious massacre in Hebron and the subsequent killings of scores of youths, children, and women in the occupied territories, we are still both panicked and unable to respond to the challenge that has been posed by the spilled blood. Two weeks after the massacre, we see an Arab and Islamic world full of signs that call for regret, sadness, and pity. Vis-a-vis all that, it is not ruled out that this Arab-Islamic submissiveness and the spiteful U.S. bias toward Israel will encourage the ultra-Zionist extremists to commit something more horrible than the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, so long as murderers and criminals can avoid accountability, not to mention punishment.
