According to a statement issued by the Army General Staff [YES], the warehouse guard noticed last Thursday night that the door had been forced open. Following investigations it was established that 7,000 detonators were missing. The chief of YES instructed the ASDEN [Higher Military Command for the Interior and Islands] commander to visit the island. An extensive search is already in progress. [Paris AFP in English at 1142 GMT on 24 April carries a related Athens-datelined report that adds that "investigators have not ruled out the possibility of a `terrorist' link, police said." The AFP report continues: "Defense Mnister Yerasimos Arsenis, confirming local police reports of the theft Frriday night, said Sunday authorities were examining all hypotheses. "Up to now he believed the thieves were `people who use dynamite for fishing,' or who wanted the detonators to make firecrackers for use during the Greek Orthodox Easter celebrations on May 1. "However Greek police said they had not ruled out the possibility the detonators may have been stolen by people `planning a terrorist attack,' but added that this theory was `not favoured for the moment.'"]
