FR940119-0-00007 FR940119-0-00002 One State and one local agency felt that the retention rates should be restored to their former levels. The commenters indicated that the higher retention rates in effect prior to October 1, 1990 were a significant incentive for States to pursue the collection of Food Stamp Program claims and felt that the new lower retention rates could result in a loss of State or local support for collection and fraud control activity. The local agency stated that it used the money to help administer the fraud control program and that the cutback would hamper the county's effort to locate and prosecute food stamp fraud. The new retention rates were mandated in the Act and do not involve Departmental discretion. Since the retention rates are mandated by law, the final regulation retains the new retention rates as specified in the proposed rule. Two State agencies commented on the procedure in the proposed rule of claiming only the new retention rates on the FNS&hyph;209 and filing an adjustment request for any additional retention amount due the State agency. The proposed rule provided that a one-time request to claim the higher rates for transactions occurring on or after October 1, 1990 but involving collections received prior to October 1, 1990, may be filed with the Department after Fiscal Year 1991 but no later than November 30, 1991. One State agency believed that States should be given the option of using the old, higher retention rates on the FNS&hyph;209 if they can identify those collections, or the lower retention rates if it is in the State's best interest. The commenter felt that States should not be burdened with requesting and justifying higher retention rates in a special request if their systems are able to identify those collections that qualify. Another State agency recommended that there be no time limitation to filing a request and that States should continue to receive the higher retention amount due under the higher rates in effect prior to October 1, 1990 if all other conditions are met. The Department is not adopting the suggestion to allow State agencies to claim higher retention rates for collections received prior to October 1990 on the FNS&hyph;209 rather than requiring submission of an adjustment request. The FNS&hyph;209 and the FNS automated system which supports State reporting are structured to recognize one retention percentage for each type of claim. Edit checks are designed to detect mathematical errors and inadvertent under- or over-retention for each claims category prior to the Department accepting the report. Instead of redesigning the FNS&hyph;209 and the automated system, the Department is permitting State agencies to claim for the additional retention by submitting an adjustment request after the end of the fiscal year. The Department is also not adopting the suggestion to eliminate the time limitation for filing a request for retention adjustment, but has decided to allow State agencies an additional year to claim any additional retention. The proposed rule allowed a one-time request for retention adjustment and specified a deadline of November 30, 1991 for filing the request. In October 1992, the Department advised State agencies that it would allow a second round of adjustment requests after Fiscal Year 1992 which must be filed no later than November 30, 1992. Accordingly, the final rule allows State agencies to submit a first time request (if they have not previously done so), or second request for additional retention which must be filed no later than November 30, 1992. The Department believes the additional year should be sufficient time for any adjustments, transfers, and refunds of collections received in Fiscal Year 1990 or earlier to be adjusted and claimed by State agencies at the old, higher retention rates. The Department is also using this opportunity to update the reference in the proposed rule concerning amending the States' letter of credit for FNS&hyph;209 payments to reflect current practice. The proposed rule restated current policy in that it provided that FNS would collect amounts due FNS or pay State agencies by amending the States' letter of credit. Although in most cases the State agency owes FNS for FNS' share of collections, FNS may owe the State agency in situations where the retention amount due the State agency exceeds the cash collection. This occurs when the State agency experiences a preponderance of non-cash rather than cash collections.
