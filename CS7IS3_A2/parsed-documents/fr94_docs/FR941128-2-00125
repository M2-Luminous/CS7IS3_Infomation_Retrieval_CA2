FR941128-2-00125 FR941128-2-00073 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,196] First Image Management Company, Houston, Texas; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration By an application dated October 2, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance, TAA. The denial notice will soon be published in the Federal Register . Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: (1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous; (2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously considered; or (3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration of the decision. Investigation findings show that the workers produce microfilm. Although the Department's denial was erroneously based on the fact that the workers did not produce an article, the workers still do not meet the ``contributed importantly'' test of the worker group eligibility requirements of the Trade Act of 1974. The ``contributed importantly'' test is generally demonstrated through a survey of the firm's major customers. The Department's survey of the subject firm major declining customers shows that none of the respondents imported microfilming services. Technological unemployment as in the rapid development of PCs and new disk technology for storing data would not provide a basis for a worker group certification. Conclusion After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly, the application is denied. Signed at Washington, DC, this 9th day of November 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29227 Filed 11&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
