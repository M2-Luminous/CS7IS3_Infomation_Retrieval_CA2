The reason is that all technical issues have been resolved through pest control and disinfectant inspections. After public hearings are held with the concerned parties, the import ban may be lifted as early as this autumn. After the ban is lifted, tens of thousand tons of apples, which are cheaper than Japanese-produced ones, may enter the market each year, and Japanese farmers will be forced to compete. In connection with apple imports, the United States is strongly critical of the closed nature of the Japanese market. This issue was included in the list of foreign trade barriers published in late March and has been a political issue between Japan and the United States. In view of the continuous Japanese refusal to allow the import of U.S. apples, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy last year sent several letters to the Japanese Government asking for an early lifting of the import ban. Certain quarters in the United States have even demanded the imposition of sanctions under Section 301 of the Omnibus Trade Act (on sanctions against unfair trade practices). In response to the U.S. demand, Japan has asserted: "The possibility of new pests being brought into Japan exists. We cannot permit the ban on imports to be lifted without quarantine procedures being enacted." With regard to the remaining problem of fire blight, coddling moths, and other pests and diseases found on U.S. apples, the United States provided all the required extermination data last year. The MAFF has concluded that "we found no problems with the data." It has sent inspectors to the United States for on-the-spot inspections and is now in the process of a final verification. The inspection involves a check on the pest-control procedures in the United States. A senior MAFF official says that "unless we find something really serious, there seems to be no reason to deny imports." The MAFF is scheduled to finish all public hearings for local apple farmers, academicians, and other concerned parties by the summer. After this, the formal decision on lifting the ban will be made. The ministry plans to finish all the required domestic procedures before the harvest season starts in the United States in September.
