He told this on Tuesday to ITAR-TASS on a basis of the results of the Monday meeting with Moldovan President Mircea Snegur with whom problems of settlement of the Gagauz problems were, specifically, discussed. Topal said Snegur had shortly promissed to submit to the Moldovan parliament a draft law on granting a special status to districts predominantly peopled by Gagauz. "We have proposed a draft law on creating the autonomous region Gagauzeri, which largely coincides with Kishinev's proposals and does not run counter to the principles of preserving Moldova's territorial intergity," Topal said. "Their essence is to grant broad powers to local government bodies." It is of essential importance for Gagauz that the draft keeps the provision of the right of the Gagauz people to self-determination in case Moldova's political status changes, Topal said. "Gagauz wish to have basic guarantees that Moldova keeps on independence track and that we shall not wake up in a different country one fine morning," Topal said.
