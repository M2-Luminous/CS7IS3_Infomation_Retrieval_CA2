Paroy and V.I. Kuleshov; UDC 621.865.14] [Text] In today's field of robotic systems, the outlook is good for developing the facilities and methods of adaptive control which make it possible to expand the functional capabilities of industrial robots (PR)[.sup][1][/]. One of the promising robotic information facilities characterizing the parameters of the perturbing factors are sensor systems which are used for sensing computer-aided and robotized special-purpose facilities for loading and unloading explosive substances and munitions, charging systems, etc. In order to move the manipulated entities with a specific force and spatial orientation, it is necessary to measure the force vector and torque vector operating between the gripper and the gripped entity with the help of a force/torque sensor of the sensory system. By equipping a robotic facility with a sensory system, one can plot the force control loop and utilize the principles of positional-force control which expands the functional capabilities of the robotic systems. Traditional force measurement methods involve determining force through elastic deformation[.sup][2][/]. This principle underlines the operation of an overwhelming majority of facilities used for this purpose. It is expedient to employ sensory grippers in addressing the issues of force measurement in industrial robots specialized in precision operations. In known sensory industrial robot systems, the sensing (force measurement) function is performed by a resistance strain gauge matched with an elastic element. These devices contain the following components: a modulator-demodulator (MDM) amplifier, a direct current amplifier with a low-pass filter, a regulated power supply source, an analog-to-digital converter (ATsP), and an interface with a communication line[.sup][3][/]. Yet these devices have a number of shortcomings: the complexity of structural implementation which does not make it possible to integrate the industrial robot's analog-to-digital converter and the data transmission device in the gripper and the placement of a preamplifier inside the industrial robot sensor. Data on the force in the gripper picked up from the resistance strain gauges is transmitted in the form of voltage or current to a remote analog-to-digital converter which performs the functions of converting the analog signal into a digital form and processing data on a computer. Such devices are characterized by one significant shortcoming of analog technology--their low noise immunity and accuracy. The gripper sensing device is executed as a fluidic instrument element located on the housing between the jaws while the output channel of this element is connected to elastic chambers through a comparison element whereby each chamber is linked to one of the fluidic elements. The chambers, in turn, are connected to the power supply through a regulator. Yet even this device has many drawbacks; a large number of pneumatic channels with local drag; and partial sensing (at the part and chamber gripping location). Fig. 1. Gripper The industrial robot sensory gripper (Fig. 1) contains housing 1 with jaws 2, elastic elements 3 with resistance strain gauges 4, and interface module 5 with an n-channel line. A total of n resistance-to-time-interval converters whose inputs are connected to strain gauge resistance whereby the outputs of the resistance-to-time-interval converters are linked to an interface with an n-channel communication line is added to the gripper which contains jaws, elastic elements closely tied to the jaws, resistance strain gauges attached to elastic elements, and interfaces with the n-channel communication line. The addition of n converters whose inputs are connected to resistors makes it possible to increase the fullness of the information content value and noise immunity in transmitting data on the value of the forces and torques developing in the gripper and structurally to integrate in the gripper the analog-to-digital converter and the data transmission device by increasing the gauge factor of the strain gauge and current coupling between data transmitting and receiving devices. It was possible to simplify the design and increase the gripper reliability due to the fact that the sensory device is executed as elastic elements with resistance strain gauges attached to them and an interface module with an n-channel communication line and n resistance-to-time-interval converters whose inputs are connected to the outputs of resistance strain gauges whereby the converter outputs are connected to the n-channel communication line of the module. Fig. 2. Expansion of Force and Torque A rectangular system of coordinates which demonstrates the expansion of the vector of force and torque applied to the gripper jaw is shown in Fig. 2. Any unit force or torque applied to the gripper may be represented as follows with respect to any point on the jaw extremity: Equation F = (F[.sup]x[/], F[.sub]y[/], F[.sup]z[/], M[.sub]x[/], M[.sub]y[/], M[.sub]z[/]). During the gripper operation, the external force and moment may be applied to the jaws in any direction. Elastic element 3 (see Fig. 1) is sensitive in the bending direction and is stable in all other directions, so that the resistance of each other resistance strain gauges changes insignificantly. Fig. 3. Block Diagram of the A block diagram of stress conversion from the force and moment components executed with the help of the gripper is shown in Fig. 3, while a circuit diagram of one of the conversion and data transmission channels from one of the force or moment components is shown in Fig. 4 where 1 is the resistance-to-time-interval converter, 2 is the resistance strain gauge, 3 is a capacitor, 4 is a univibrator, 5 is the converter input, and 6 is the interface circuit with the communication line. The resistance strain gauge is an integral part of the resistance-to-time-interval converter. It is a primary conversion element which transform a mechanical quantity into an electric signal in the form of resistance R[.sup]FM[/]. Fig. 4. Circuit Diagram of the Data Semiconductor KDT-2B silicon resistance strain gauges which meet the specifications of AO.336235 TU and have a 220 O resistance and a length of 2 or 7 mm are used as primary transducers. The resistance strain gauges are glued to the measuring surface of the elastic element with a VL-931 lacquer (GOST 10402-75). Slices of the FDM-1 material with a 0.2-mm thickness (TU 16-503.084-71) are glued to the measuring spots of the elastic element. The terminal wires are glued to the slices in order to protect the resistance strain gauge from possible ruptures. The resistance strain gauges, soldering spots, and the wires are covered with the VL-931 lacquer (GOST 10462-75). Together with resistance strain gauge 2, capacitor 3 with a capacitance of C forms a controlled RC-circuit with a time constant of _t_ = R[.sup]FM[/]C. The time constant value _t_ determines the length of the T-pulse generated by the univibrator. The device operates in the following fashion. A force is applied to the jaws in any direction when the part is being gripped. In this case, the elastic element is deformed under the effect of this force. The stresses developing in it are picked up by resistance strain gauges whose resistance is proportionate to the elastic element tension at the place of its installation. After converting the mechanical quantity into electric in the form of resistance R[.sup]FM[/], the capacitor in the interface module of resistance strain gauge 2 converts resistance to the time constant _t_ which determines the duration of the T-pulse generated by univibrator 4. The duration of the voltage pulse at the univibrator output as well as the current pulse in the communication line contain data on the force or moment which are expressed by the following formula: Equation T = K_t_ = KR[.sup]FM[/]C = KC(A + BF), where K is the conversion ratio of univibrator 4 and A and B are the coefficients determined by the physical parameters of resistance strain gauge 2. The current magnitude in the communication line is important only for the data transmission noise immunity indicators and does not affect the contents of this information. Compared to the sensors described in [2,3] which perform the force measurement function, the proposed device has the following advantages. Foil-type resistance strain gauges are used as primary transducers which greatly limits the maximum attainable output signal magnitude (the gauge factor of the foil-resistance strain gauges is K = (_D_ R/R)/(_D_ 1/1)=2-3 whereas the same figure for semiconductor devices is K = 100-200). The advantages of the force/torque systems described in [3] are realized provided that high-quality amplifiers are used. Furthermore, the output voltage after primary conversion is very low, so its transmission and processing may be very complicated in the presence of electromagnetic interference. This factor often calls for placing a preamplifier inside the sensor. Due to the use of semiconductor resistance as primary transducers in the aforementioned device, the output signal level is measured in units of volts (1-5 V) whereby it is not necessary to use amplifiers or preamplifiers. The semiconductor resistance strain gauges' high sensitivity and the use of resistance-to-time-interval converters ensure small overall dimensions of the sensor and electronic module structure. This, in turn, makes it possible to install them directly on the gripper jaws or integrate them as a single device with the jaws. Given a pulse data representation and transmission in a pulse form, the noise immunity indicators, compared to those of continuous representation, are much higher. The current feedback between the data transmission and reception devices also ensures a more stable noise immunity compared to voltage feedback since based on experimental data, the current feedback even after attaining a 100-200 mA current becomes a source of noise (in this case, the output signal values reach 3-20 mA). An increase in noise immunity is the determining factor of reliable industrial robot performance under extreme operating conditions; moreover, data transmission accuracy increases too.
