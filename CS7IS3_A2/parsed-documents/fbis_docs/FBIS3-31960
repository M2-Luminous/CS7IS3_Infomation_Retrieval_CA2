In a message broadcast via a radio and television network, Ecuadoran Finance Minister Cesar Robalino has detailed the decreed increase according to each type of fuel. The measure will specifically modify gasoline prices, which remained the same since September 1992. The minister said premium gasoline, the type which most Ecuadoreans use, will increase from $.80 per gallon (3.78 liters) to $1.35, while unleaded gasoline will increase by 50 percent. Concurrently, regular gasoline and aviation gasoline will increase by 40 percent. Robalino said the measure was necessary, because the reduction in the price of hydrocarbons on the international market has caused a financial imbalance of $700 million for Ecuador in terms of crude exports. This situation was complicated even further as a result of Congress' refusal to approve an 18-percent increase in the value-added tax (VAT), the minister added. The fuel price system is geared toward deregulating the domestic market for crude oil byproducts and to ensure an adequate increase in tax revenues. The government has also included several decrees establishing public spending controls and measures aimed at cutting tax evasion and modernizing customs systems. Robalino added that "the fall in fiscal revenues for 1994 is very important. It is no government fabrication and requires the implementation of corrective measures." The minister said the government does not intend to increase the price of other crude oil byproducts such as diesel and household gas, and he reiterated that urban transportation fares will remain the same as a result of a government subsidy. Nevertheless, union sources have announced they will coordinate general actions to protest the government's economic measures, which they believe will only result in the speculation of basic commodities.
