Dear Suvorov and Nakhimov students, dear cadets! Dear veterans, servicemen of the Russian Army and teachers! Dear friends! You have chosen for your profession serving Russia, protecting Russia's people and its peaceful life. Please accept my warm congratulations on the Day of Defenders of the Motherland. From all my heart I wish you good health and happiness, as well as success in your noble career. The military profession, the profession which defends the motherland has been respected and honored in Russia since ancient times. It has been the destiny of the Russian people to have to fight for its freedom and independence for centuries. The valiant defenders of our native soil were always the first to rise up in the path of the foe. Their heroic battle deeds have forever become part of Russian history and have left a deep imprint on the whole of our culture. Many events of epoch-making importance for Russia resound with their glory. Today we pay a tribute of respect to our veterans and to everyone who with their blood and by their heroism and incredible exertions gained victory and earned peace and our enormous gratitude. The other day we marked the fifth anniversary of the withdrawal of our troops from Afghanistan. That war remains forever in our history, which, however much one might try, cannot be rewritten afresh. In one way or another that war affected each of our hearts, and the pain still remains painful and the bitterness still remains bitter. One should cast no doubts upon the true valor and heroism, and loyalty to the military oath and to their homeland which our soldiers and officers displayed during that undeclared war. The state is indebted to these people. And we will do everything possible for the social protection of the Afghantsi, the families of the deceased, those who are missing, and the disabled. There is no purpose in speaking about the past, about the great victories and accomplishments, about defeats and setbacks, without a firm belief in the future. In its most difficult periods three things have helped Russia to stand the tests and to take heart in its great, indestructible foundations: spiritual might and the creative genius of the people, immense natural resources and the valor of its defenders. Our generation has enormous responsibility to treat with care the legacy we have inherited and, no matter how difficult it might be, to multiply it and to pass the baton with dignity to future generations. The defenders of Russia always had only one goal -- to protect the country and to establish the people's sacred rights without which a peace and stable development of civic life is not possible. Soon, you, who bear the honorable name of Suvorov and Nakhimov cadets, will have to fulfill the honorary goal. You are successors to the best combat traditions in the Russian army and fleet. You, future officers, are to carry and multiply the glory of Russian armor. Aleksandr Vasilyevich Suvorov used to say that a good name of a man lies in the glory and well-being of his Fatherland. May those voluminous words -- duty, honor and the Fatherland -- be your motto in life. Such is the sacred precept of many generations of defenders of the Russian state. So long as this behest is alive, so will the state remain, so will the people live. Profound changes are taking place today in the army and throughout the country. It would be simply impossible otherwise. Our army has not been renewed throughout two decades. It hardly needs saying what this means to the state's defense capability, and to you, the people of the military. That is why the country's armed forces have been given the task to step up the military reforms. They began in 1992, but, clearly, what has been done so far is insufficient. There is now an opportunity to act more resolutely and consistently. The new Russian Constitution has been adopted. The legal basis of the work of the armed forces has been sealed in the recently adopted military doctrine. I would like to stress that this doctrine is of a defensive nature. In other words, Russia does not wittingly treat any one state as its enemy. Of course, the main points of the doctrine are not dogma. They will be amplified as the situation unfolds. But the country has designated clear objectives in the sphere of security and the means to achieve them. And the armed forces have received clear guidelines for their development. They are, as follows: -- flexible organization; -- compactness; -- mobility; -- being equipped with the latest technology and weaponry; -- being staffed with highly professional personnel. Of course, it will take time and a lot of effort to achieve these guidelines. It is even more so since the country received an extremely deranged military legacy. Russia bears on its shoulders the heavy burden of providing accommodation and amenities for the formations and units that are being withdrawn from abroad. There are problems with financing the troops' vital activities and their supplies. The social protection of servicemen, the providing of accommodation for them, etc. are becoming very acute issues. More important is the role of a meticulous and lucid Russian defense policy. As one knows, with the withdrawal of troops from East European countries, the first defense echelon of the former Soviet Union has disappeared. The troops of the second echelon have now come under the jurisdiction of Ukraine and Belarus. Their withdrawal from the Baltics is under way. As a result, the Moscow, Leningrad and North Caucasian military districts, which were previously internal ones, have now become border military districts. The Urals and Volga military districts are becoming a base for the preparation of mobilization resources and the basis for the creation of a new operational strategic formation. To all intents and purposes, the groupings of conventional armed forces in the territory of the Russian Federation will have been created afresh before 1995. The overall number of groupings and formations is to be sharply reduced. At the same time they will be provided with the most up-to-date and efficient armaments and military equipment. The military will have reliable weapons in their possession. The groupings being created will be capable of rebuffing aggression in local and regional wars and military conflicts. If a large-scale war is unleashed, they will ensure the strategic deployment of the armed forces. In line with this, a whole defense infrastructure on Russian territory will be essentially changed (and to a considerable degree created anew). It is particularly important to resolutely renounce the residual principle with regard to the officers' corps and all the personnel which has already become a tradition. The armed forces are experiencing a chronic lack of attention from the state and the entire society to its needs. This is an unwholesome practice. It demoralizes people and makes them doubt the importance of their military service to the state. Therefore, the vital goals of the reform's present stage include the following: -- creating and consolidating legally a system of social guarantees for the servicemen, members of their families, servicemen transferred to the reserve and retired military (including those who took early retirement); -- switching over to a combined system of enlistment for the Army and Navy; -- introducing alternative forms of service. One of the priority tasks for the coming year is to create mobile forces, capable of rapid deployment, redeployment, and carrying out combat operations in any areas and regions where a threat to Russia's military security may arise. It was necessary to transfer the battalion to the area of Sarajevo, and in accordance with the Minister's order, after negotiating six passes in 24 hours, it was at the appointed spot and carried out a crucial task which the whole of the world is applauding. Today many of our soldiers have to serve outside Russia -- in the border states and in Yugoslavia, where the flames are raging of an interethnic, fratricidal war. The mission of these Russian sub-units is a noble and peacekeeping one: to stop the bloodshed and restore peace and stability in these regions. They are serving Russia, and its security is being guarded on its distant approaches. There our soldiers are having a more difficult time of it than inside Russia where no fires of interethnic conflict are blazing. Speaking of which, I cannot help mentioning the event which in the past few days became especially important for the world community. I mean the Bosnian crisis. It has tested the strength of our course by demonstrating to the world the true potential of the Russian foreign policy. First of all, our ability to firmly defend the national and state interests of the country. Russia, as member of the UN Security Council and an equal member of the democratic world community, demonstrated its right to participate in adoption of the key world policy decisions, especially, if these involve its legitimate interests and international obligations. And the world listened to our voice. The mechanism of partnership with the West has been tested. It did work, albeit not immediately, and with some interruptions. The fundamental principle of the Russian foreign policy -- dialogue and cooperation with the leading states -- has proved right. The Sarajevo crisis also revealed that our course aimed at the strengthening of the United Nations in every possible way as the principal international organization for maintaining peace was right. The result of these efforts is a cease-fire in Sarajevo without a new escalation of the military conflict in Bosnia. The events around Sarajevo is a call for common sense to all those involved in the conflict. The logic of peace should, at long last, gain victory over nationalist emotions which have led the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the limit of human suffering. I hope all the parties in the conflict will fulfill their obligations to the United Nations, ensure a reliable cease-fire and not allow provocations against the international peacemaking forces, inter alia against the Russian contingent currently deployed in the Sarajevo. We shall increase the peaceful attack in close cooperation with the United Nation and our partners. The aim is to make the cease-fire in Sarajevo a turning point to peace in the whole Bosnia. The power of the army is in its high moral spirit which is based on the continuous ties with the society, the strict discipline, and the subordination to the law, the high battle training, and the psychological readiness. This is a well-known fact to the elderly people, our veterans, who all their lives served their country and their people faithfully and truly. Let us bow low to them for this. The new generation of defenders of the homeland has an example to follow. You, the young servicemen, are the hope of the Russian Army and Navy. Be worthy of your forebears' glory, study well, prepare yourselves morally and physically to defend our Motherland. You have good conditions for all this, though I agree that you need some help now and then -- all the more so that your school will soon celebrate its 50th anniversary. I congratulate everyone present on today's holiday -- the Day of Defenders of the Motherland. I wish good health, happiness and success to all of you, your teachers and your families!
