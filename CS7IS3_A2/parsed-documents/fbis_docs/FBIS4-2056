The Navy document presented to lawmakers envisions a seven-year plan to modernize the Navy by building new ships in Taiwan and buying more advanced vessels from abroad. The document says Mainland China now has 2,640 ships and is planning to build aircraft carriers. The naval document says three Taiwan-made 4,200-ton anti-submarine missile frigates built with U.S. technologies have been launched and five more will go into service by 2001. They are to replace some of the 24 destroyers bought from the United States some 40 years ago. In 1991, Taiwan signed a contract to buy six 1,200-ton Lafayette frigates from France and to build 10 similar vessels on its own with French technologies. In addition, the Navy plans to build 12 500-ton petrol boats to strengthen Taiwan's coast guard.
