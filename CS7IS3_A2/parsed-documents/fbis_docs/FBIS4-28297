Branding it as a plan for the provocation of a war, the author of the article says: "Alluring the U.S." (miin) being the same with "a belle" in pronunciation, one may misinterpret it as a "beauty operation" for bewitching men by using beautiful women. But it means a plan to allure the United States into "sanctions" and war against the DPRK by leading the situation of the Korean peninsula to the highest pitch of strain. After the closet consultation dangerous war exercises against the North have been staged more openly on the ground and in the sky and sea. This shows that the `operational plan' is being carried into practice. Holding such military confabs as "meeting of security-related ministers" one after another, the "civilian" warmaniacs let out a torrent of bellicose words such as "a prompt reaction" and "a tough response." Some time ago, "Kim Yong-sam the traitor called to "Chongwadae" [presidential offices] the puppet minister of defence, the puppet chairman of the joint chiefs of Staff, the chiefs of staff of the puppet Army, Navy and Airforce for a war confab and ordered them to put the puppet Armed Forces on "a stand-by alert," vociferating about "perfection" of preparations for a war against the North with "a coopertion system" with the United States. The puppets are even trumpeting "unification by invading the North." Having placed the entire puppet Armed Forces on "a stand-by alert" the Kim Yong-sam group is discussing "UN sanctions" or "multinational sanctions" with the masters,' while bringing forward its own anti-national "policy of sanctions against the North". This shows well what a reckless stage its frenzy of northward invasion has reached. The Kim Yong-sam group must ponder over the matter, mindful that confrontation and war will precipitate its self-destruction.
