I think the term is appropriate, and I agree with EL TIEMPO on the need for the presidential candidates to take a stand on this issue, which, in the coming years, will have an impact on the Colombian economy exceeded by few other issues. In my case it is easy, because when I prepared the economic program that I have submitted to Colombians for their consideration, I examined the matter carefully, from the point of view of its implications for the balance of payments and the budget, and of course its social ramifications. Since I have decided not to make any promises I am not capable of fulfilling for the country, in preparing the social investment and infrastructure programs we were especially careful to incorporate a realistic projection of tax revenues, which would not have been possible without expressly considering the strategy for managing Cusiana revenues. This is a complex issue, and it would be absurd to try to cover all of it in a commentary of reasonable length. But Colombians know that in this, as in all matters, the crux is that the person who aspires to set the course of the country in the future must have mental clarity and the ability to put together top-flight technical teams. There are a few points that I would like to emphasize regarding Cusiana at this initial juncture. Above all, Colombia's economy is already of a size that the additional revenues that can be expected from an oil boom like Cusiana are shocking only to those whose natural tendency is to see a problem behind every solution. The total net foreign-exchange income from Cusiana will depend a great deal on the volatile price of petroleum, but it is unlikely that the figure will exceed $3.5 billion a year in 1997. By that time, if Colombians decide in 1994 to stay the course set by President Gaviria's government, we will have a country with an annual production of about $75 billion, and with annual two-way trade amounting to some $25 billion per year. Although in that case Cusiana will not be too big for the country, the income from the exploitation of our subsoil will provide us with a magnificent opportunity to accelerate our growth even further and to make the final leap toward development, toward a much more just society than the one we have now. Obviously, that will require careful management, especially in terms of the quantity and quality of public spending by the nation and by the territorial entities. There are examples of many countries that regressed and even collapsed because of a mismanaged oil boom. I know that many Colombians are concerned about the possibility that, as a result of the abundance of dollars flowing in from the sale of Cusiana oil, there will be a huge revaluation of the peso that will make the situation intolerable for exporters and for those who compete with imports. Few people, however, are yet aware that this unfortunate outcome would be almost certain in an economy more closed than the current one, which is what some candidates are still dreaming of. To be sure, Cusiana will increase our supply of dollars, but the schemes some have put forth to "safeguard" or freeze the funds would make sense only as very temporary mechanisms. A country like Colombia that has so many needs and so many great possibilities should aspire to have a president who will take the lead and make sure that these additional resources will be used properly in his administration; not a president who, like the negligent and wicked slave in Matthew's parable, would merely bury in a vault the talents that the Lord gave him. Naturally, the economy has a limited absorptive capacity in the short term, and any spending beyond that level would only lead to inflation or wasted resources. For this reason, it is not enough to try to invest these resources well; the great challenge lies in modernizing the entities that are to carry out the investments, developing efficient mechanisms such as concessions for construction projects, and fighting corruption head-on. The only way that these resources can be used properly without requiring us to give up other Colombian exports, out of fear of a foreign-exchange bottleneck, is to implement a broad program to stimulate private investment for agricultural and industrial modernization, complemented by a realistic infrastructure investment plan. This, of course, would include the social infrastructure, represented by the great education and potable water program that I have proposed to the country. Andres Pastrana Arango Bogota
