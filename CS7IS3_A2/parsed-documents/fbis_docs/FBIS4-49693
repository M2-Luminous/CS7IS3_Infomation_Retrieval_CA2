No matter how we write our history and how we plan our future, we will not forget that everyone, ranging from leaders of the republic to ordinary functionaries, and every unit, ranging from senior government and Army organs to placement departments at all levels in various localities and Army units, have devoted their enthusiasm and energies to enabling millions of officers, who have fulfilled the glorious task of defending our motherland, to "transfer their battleground" smoothly, so that each of them is properly provided for and lives and works in peace and contentment. In this account, we, as witnesses of the work, set down a true record of the key activities and relevant historical facts over the past few years showing how our party and government were concerned about and set store by the work of placement of demobilized officers. 1. As long as you pay a little attention, you will find that from 1990 on, senior party and government leaders were present and delivered speeches at almost every important activity on the work of placement of demobilized Army officers. Officers must retire after a certain number of years of service, as is the case in every country of the world. In both developed and developing countries, the issue of placement of retired officers occupies an important place in state affairs. In our country, proper placement of Army officers transferred to civilian work is an important system of our party and government. The first officer demobilization order following the PRC's founding was signed by Chairman Mao Zedong. The first director of the central committee for changing jobs and construction was Premier Zhou Enlai. The founders of the republic were circumspect and farsighted, they devised good strategies, elaborated the key principles of placement of demobilized Army officers, and drew up a series of placement policies and measures so that the work, which affects a great deal of the social fabric, was done in an orderly way and step by step with a good beginning and solid foundations. Full-scale reconstruction was to be carried out after the Cultural Revolution. Comrade Deng Xiaoping, nucleus of the second-generation leadership, made historic contributions to the resumption and development of the system of placement of demobilized Army officers, which had been suspended for a decade. Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, he brought order out of chaos and decisively rectified the problem by which 410,000 Army officers were mistakenly handled and demobilized from 1969 to 1975. Times change but we are carrying forward the cause pioneered by our predecessors and forging ahead into the future. The third-generation leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, while bearing the great cause of national reform in mind, is often concerned about the current situation and the future of the work of placement of demobilized Army officers and constantly carries forward under the new situation the fine tradition of veteran proletarian revolutionaries attaching importance to the work of placement of demobilized Army officers. As long as you pay a little attention, you will find that from April 1990 on, senior party and government leaders were present and delivered speeches at almost every important activity on the work of placement of demobilized Army officers. The written instructions given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng on documents related to placement of demobilized officers, which were conscientious and to the point, were clearly seen. Last year alone, General Secretary Jiang four times gave important instructions on the work of placement of demobilized Army officers. In particular, the two scenes in which General Secretary Jiang requested local party committees and governments to do well the work of placement of demobilized Army officers are unforgettable, moving, and inspiring. The first occasion was on 10 April 1990. The international situation then was turbulent and volatile, while our country was confronted with many new domestic conditions. Comrades in the Army and those in various localities worried about whether or not proper arrangements could be made for over 30,000 officers transferred to civilian work that year and whether or not the work could be done on time. That day, at 1500, General Secretary Jiang, who wore a Chinese tunic suit, and other central leading comrades came to the assembly hall where the National Work Meeting on Placement of Demobilized Army Officers was being held. General Secretary Jiang said with deep feeling: With so many years of trials, our Army officers are of good quality and have a fine tradition of engaging in ideological and political work, and such talents are needed to fill various local posts. On the other hand, there are still many specialized talents in the People's Liberation Army [PLA], and we should try our best to make proper arrangements for this group of demobilized officers so that they can become the backbone of various trades and professions. I request all of you to make concerted efforts to accomplish this work. His voice was so sonorous and forceful that it struck deep in every comrade's heart like drumbeats. In consequence, the work of placement of demobilized officers proceeded very smoothly that year. The second occasion was on 19 May 1993. That year, the Army implemented the CPC Central Committee and the CPC Central Military Commission's strategic policy decision of restructuring and streamlining the establishment, and nearly 6,000 officers were transferred to local civilian work. Likewise, efforts were made to start implementing the restructuring of local party and government organs and arrangements had to be made for a number of redundant personnel. It can be understood how difficult the work of placement of demobilized Army officers was. Bearing in mind that Army restructuring and streamlining is a major and very onerous task which the Army itself must make great efforts in and which the party and the state must extend vigorous support to, General Secretary Jiang Zemin came to the conference hall again and delivered a speech full of enthusiasm at a time when the annual National Work Meeting on Placement of Demobilized Army Officers was being held: From the day they enlist in the Army, our Army officers work very hard for our national defense and defense construction. When these comrades are transferred to civilian work, the state must make appropriate arrangements for them in a responsible manner. Hence, we must further mobilize everyone to support the work, because whether or not good arrangements are made for these officers will have a great bearing on the stability of our society and our Army as well as on our country's overall economic construction. Therefore, to put it in a nutshell, I request you accomplish the work! Moreover, when you return to your units, please report to your party committees the message that we request your local party committees at all levels to make good arrangements for demobilized Army officers. The audience burst into prolonged thunderous applause, which conveyed to General Secretary Jiang the determination and confidence of those engaging in the work of transferring Army officers to civilian work and which conveyed to the CPC Central Committee, the state Council, and the Central Military Commission the most sincere tribute and gratitude of officers and men. The general secretary's request was transmitted to all quarters, just like great waves radiating from a rock. Various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities took action, as did various prefectures, cities, and counties. By the end of 1993, 60,000 demobilized officers, along with over 17,000 family members, were assigned to their respective posts around our motherland. 2. Our party and government always remember the sacrifices and contributions made by demobilized Army officers for the cause of socialist construction. Nearly 3 million Army officers have been successively transferred to localities since our country was founded more than 40 years ago. They are still carrying forward our Army's honorable tradition and fighting to their last breath on all fronts in our motherland, thus adding a glorious chapter to their undisputed contributions to our party and our people. Zhao Dongwan, former minister of personnel, once enumerated demobilized Army officers' illustrious achievements in the cause of socialist construction: During the period of national economic restoration, over 300,000 Army officers took off their uniforms and turned themselves into a large contingent engaging in railway construction, irrigation works, forestry, and the petroleum industry in our motherland. They also turned themselves into building units and troops stationed to open up wasteland. In the spring of 1958, 100,000 demobilized officers and men trod ice and snow and moved into the great northern wilderness. After over 30 years of arduous efforts in pioneering work, they built up our country's key commodity grain-producing base on land with no sign of human habitation. In the early sixties, another group of 130,000 selected outstanding grass-roots Army officers were transferred to the commercial front and made important contributions to economic development and the guarantee of supply. From 1985 to the present, 100,000 demobilized officers have been assigned to public security, judicial, and procuratorial departments and to courts; 180,000 have been assigned to industrial and commercial, taxation, and financial departments; 85,000 have been assigned to key state construction projects and newly established and expanded units; and 90,000 have been assigned to education, scientific research, cultural, and public health departments. Among them, 75,000 have been elected model and advanced workers by units at and above the county level; 5,200 have been elected outstanding entrepreneurs; 158,000 have been elected outstanding ideological and political workers; and 154,000 have assumed posts at and above the county and department levels or the equivalent. We can say that the footprints of demobilized Army officers' struggles have been left everywhere in our motherland's history of starting undertakings and that their painstaking efforts are reflected in the achievements scored by various trades and professions. Our party and government always remember the sacrifices and contributions made by demobilized Army officers for the cause of socialist construction. In October 1991, the National Meeting on Commending Model Demobilized Army Officers was solemnly called with the approval of the State Council and the Central Military Commission, and 213 national model demobilized Army officers happily gathered in Beijing and were commended by the state and the people. This was another grand gathering held since our motherland's founding wherein a large number of model demobilized Army officers was commended. During the commendation meeting, State Council Premier Li Peng spared time to meet model workers. On the afternoon of 22 October, it was close to 1700 after Comrade Li Peng had completed his meeting with the last group of foreign visitors, but he did not care about his tiredness and hurried to the conference hall. As he walked, he kept saying: "I am sorry to make you all wait a long time." He said cordially: First of all, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, I convey to you our heartfelt congratulations on the outstanding achievements scored at your respective posts. In his speech, which was full of enthusiasm and commendation, Premier Li stressed: "Due to the good training they received in the Army, demobilized Army officers have a higher political quality. They have also mastered a good many skills while undergoing the dual-purpose talent training in the Army. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council always hold that demobilized Army officers are an important force in socialist modernization. As proved by practice, demobilized Army officers have been playing a very good role on every socialist front." He sincerely wished everybody to continue carrying forward our fine tradition, to maintain our honor, and to make further new contributions. The successful convening of the commendation meeting evoked strong repercussions in the Army and in various localities and played a very good role in bringing about good practice in society of understanding and showing respect for demobilized Army officers and extending support to the work of placement of demobilized Army officers. Now, on the land of the republic, no matter where they are, demobilized Army officers are developing eye-catching undertakings; and no matter which profession they are in, demobilized Army officers are creating glories of revitalizing our motherland. 3. Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy, should we or should we not uphold the guiding ideology of "two services" in the work of placement of demobilized Army officers? the central leadership "put it in this way." The guiding ideology of the work of placement of demobilized Army officers, which was established by Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai and which we have upheld for several decades, is to "be subordinate to the needs of state economic construction and defense construction and to merge the two into an integrated whole. Should we or should we not uphold it under the condition of developing a socialist market economy? On 13 November 1993, after listening to the report made by Yu Yongbo, director of the PLA's General Political Department, Hu Jintao, standing committee member of the central CPC Political Bureau and member of the central CPC Secretariat, said to Lu Feng, head of the Organization Department under the CPC Central Committee, and Minister of Personnel Song Defu, who were present: Should the guiding ideology of the work of placement of demobilized Army officers be through "one service" or through "two services"? In my view, "two services" is still better. The work of placement of demobilized Army officers must serve economic construction and reform and opening up, but, at the same time, it must help consolidate the stability of the Army, since without a reliable guarantee of security, we cannot achieve success in economic construction. Leading comrades at the central level "put it in this way." A comrade engaging in the work of placement of demobilized Army officers said with deep feeling: "As far as the work of placement of demobilized Army officers is concerned, it is as if we are shouldering two burdens at the same time, with one end tied to the state and the other tied to the Army, and consideration must be given to both!" As far as the task of serving defense construction is concerned, making arrangements for demobilized Army officers and straightening out the channel for "exporting" Army officers is essential to realizing the supersession of old officers by new ones, improving the quality of our Army, and enhancing our Army's combat strength, because over 90 percent of Army officers are faced with the problem of transference to civilian work. Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, once said that good placement of demobilized Army officers has extremely important significance. It is beneficial to make arrangements for demobilized Army officers because they also possess a number of favorable conditions. Most of them once studied in military academies and have a high level of education. Officers holding posts in divisions and regiments, who once tempered themselves at the grass-roots level, have rich working experience and good political quality. After their transfer to various localities, some of the Army officers originally holding posts in divisions and regiments are still young compared with some local cadres, and it is precisely the time to bring their abilities into play. Hence, it is really a matter of vital and lasting importance to make good arrangements for and to make good use of them. As far as the task of serving state economic construction is concerned, demobilized Army officers are an important source of local cadres and an important force in socialist construction of the "two civilizations." The fact that group after group of Army officers are being transferred to various localities not only invigorates the contingent of local cadres but is also beneficial to our country's reform, development, and stability. As General Secretary Jiang commented, it will not work if none of the local cadres has any military knowledge. Some of the outstanding Army officers may be overage in the Army, but certain arrangements can be made to transfer them to various localities. A review of the history of the work of placement of demobilized officers can show that our party and government always uphold the guiding ideology of making the work of placement of demobilized officers serve defense and economic construction. It has become the foundation for reaching a common understanding between various sectors, the basis for formulating policies and stipulations, and the yardstick for measuring the results of the placement work. No matter what changes the objective situation undergoes, we will steadfastly uphold the guiding ideology. 4. Our party and government have been, as always, making appropriate arrangements for demobilized officers and bear responsibility for them to the end, and the state and local governments at all levels have invested a great deal of manpower, materiel, and financial resources in this respect. There are so many things to consider regarding the work of placement of demobilized Army officers, but the ultimate aim is to make appropriate arrangements for demobilized Army officers. On the morning of 26 March 1990, General Secretary Jiang visited the PLA delegation present at the Third Session of the Seventh National People's Congress [NPC] and took part in the discussion. Wang Aiwu, deputy from the frontier guards in Heilongjiang, reported on the situation of making arrangements for demobilized officers, and his remarks attracted the attention of General Secretary Jiang, who jotted down notes while listening to Wang's speech. During a break in the meeting, he asked leaders of the Central Military Commission on the spot about the situation concerned. On 10 April, he thought about this matter again when receiving delegates to the National Work Meeting on the Placement of Demobilized Army Officers. He said: Not long ago, I took part in the meeting of the PLA delegation present at the NPC session and heard a report on the placement of demobilized servicemen, and I do have some ideas. Since our country's economy is, after all, not very strong, therefore, certain difficulties still remain in defense construction and in placement of demobilized servicemen. We must conduct some surveys to see how the work can be improved under the existing economic strength and conditions. After General Secretary Jiang had made the remarks, the CPC Central Committee's Organization Department, the State Council's Ministry of Personnel, and the General Political Department immediately studied ways to solve the job arrangement problem of demobilized officers. In a short span of two months, they formulated and issued to lower levels the "Circular on Accomplishing the Work of Assigning Demobilized Regimental Officers to New Posts," that is, the "Document No. 3" well-known to Army officers. The document laid down concrete stipulations on jobs assigned to Army officers transferred to various localities in light of the duration of their active service and the extent of their contributions. That year, a number of measures were taken by various localities, including assigning Army officers still in active service to civilian posts, allowing them to work in localities before they had been formally demobilized, and reserving civilian posts for them in advance. As a result, 95 percent of over 2,000 officers with regimental duties satisfying the job-arrangement conditions were assigned to corresponding posts; while the situation of arranging jobs for other regimental officers was also markedly improved, since the percentage for which corresponding posts were arranged increased by 35.8 percent. Leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and of the Central Military Commission also set much store by the situation in implementing the policy on placement of demobilized Army officers. Last year, due to the large number of demobilized officers or for other reasons, a small number of localities did not implement the policy of arranging jobs for demobilized regimental officers. After learning of this situation, General Secretary Jiang Zemin instructed leaders of the General Political Department to make a report directly to Comrade Hu Jintao. On 27 November 1993, Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, wrote comments on materials reflecting the problem and instructed relevant departments to immediately study ways to solve it. With joint efforts by the Army and local authorities, the problem was solved step by step. Our party and government leaders are very much concerned about the difficulties faced by officers and men stationed for a long time in areas where conditions are hardest, such as the border, islands, highlands, and deserts, as well as the placement problem after their transfer to civilian posts. The leaders have repeatedly instructed departments concerned to study and solve the problem by working out relevant policies which show the solicitude of our party and government for them. The stipulations introduced in April 1990, which concerned recruiting and taking care of demobilized officers serving in the Army for a long time, occupying senior posts, and making great contributions to the Army, were precisely the outcome of the guiding ideology. The implementation of these stipulations fully embodies our party's principles of appointing people on their merits with the focus on concrete achievements in the work of placement of demobilized officers, which is a very great inspiration to demobilized officers as well as comrades still serving in the Army. In recent years, our party and government have been, as always, making appropriate arrangements for demobilized officers and bearing responsibility for them to the end, and the state and local governments at all levels have invested a great deal of manpower, materiel, and financial resources in this respect. Taking housing as an example, the state, under a tight financial situation, has successively increased subsidies for building houses three times. Incomplete statistics show that a total of 1.3 billion yuan of state subsidies have been granted to various localities for building houses for demobilized officers. We cannot calculate, in detail, how much labor our society has expended on the placement of demobilized officers. We can only acclaim the work as a grand social project with Chinese characteristics. 5. The time for restructuring the work of placement of demobilized Army officers is becoming ripe, and the pace of reform is gaining momentum. The times are forging ahead and our society is undergoing changes. Centering on the goal of establishing a socialist market economic system set by the 14th CPC Congress, all trades and professions are making more efforts in implementing their reforms and accelerating the pace of reform. People are particularly concerned about how to adjust the work of placement of demobilized Army officers to the reform of the whole country and how to introduce new measures of placement. Departments concerned cannot, so far, furnish conclusive answers to these questions, but we can see from a series of instructions issued by leading comrades at the central level that the train of thought in reforming the work of placement of demobilized Army officers is very clear. As far as the method of assignment is concerned, leading comrades at the central level unequivocally point out: Mandatory planning must undergo some changes and adapt itself to the situation of market economy, but for some of the officers who still fail to be assigned to new posts even after two-way choices, the state must make arrangements for them. Never can the state leave them out and make them fell abandoned by merely laying stress on the market economy. As far as work arrangement and living conditions are concerned, leading comrades at the central level emphasize: No matter how far our reform goes, our ultimate aim is to help demobilized officers settle in their proper places and to ensure that they can be assigned work commensurate with their qualifications and competence. Their pay and fringe benefits must be guaranteed. As far as improvement of the quality of demobilized officers is concerned, leaders of the Central Military Commission point out time and again that we must conscientiously implement a series of important instructions on training talents capable of serving in the Army and in localities issued by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Early last year, Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed when inspecting the troops stationed in Fujian: We must strengthen officers' on-the-job training and let them learn more scientific and cultural knowledge and master certain economic and management know-how so that they can adapt themselves to the requirements of Army construction and can also meet the needs of socialist modernization and have a certain level of competitive power after transferring to civilian posts. As far as legal construction is concerned, Vice Chairmen Liu and Zhang of the Central Military Commission repeatedly point out that we must begin with further establishing and perfecting rules and regulations to dispel officers' worries in retirement and placement and to gradually perfect the mechanism of protection, thus enabling the work of placement of demobilized Army officers to develop in a form involving law and system in a standardized way. At present, the time for restructuring the work of placement of demobilized Army officers is becoming ripe, and the pace of reform is gaining momentum. Let us look at the following pieces of heartening news: The State Council Work Group for Placement of Demobilized Army Officers called a meeting on 2 March 1994, which decided that we must pay great attention to drafting the "Interim Regulations on the Work of Placement of Demobilized Army Officers" and strive to complete it within this year. This year, in order to meet the needs of making state talents mobile, restrictions on demobilized officers transferred to civilian work will be relaxed. Demobilized officers stationed in medium-sized and small cities along with their spouses are allowed to be assigned to the same areas or nearby localities; while some demobilized officers having specialized knowledge are allowed to be assigned to other provinces and regions. This year, we will further broaden placement channels and perfect assignment methods to better serve personnel units and create conditions for demobilized officers' voluntary job selection. This year, in order to adapt ourselves to the new situation of reforming the Army and local pay system, we will draw up new regulations on the method of transforming the pay scale of demobilized officers on the principle of not allowing their pay and fringe benefits to be lower than those enjoyed by local cadres in corresponding grades. Appropriate consideration will be given to demobilized officers joining the contingent of state civil servants. For demobilized officers at the regimental grade who join the contingent of state civil servants, the method of selection and transfer will be adopted; whereas for demobilized officers below the battalion grade who enter party and government organs and take up nonleadership posts below the director grade, only the method of recruitment through examination will be tried among officers transferred to civilian work within that year. In order to gradually take the path of solving the housing problems of demobilized officers through multiple channels and forms, the State Council Work Group for the Placement of Demobilized Army Officers and other departments concerned have resorted to a number of methods on a trial basis in localities with adequate conditions, including raising funds for building houses in a coordinated manner, assigning them to civilian jobs with housing allowances, encouraging them to build their own houses while providing government assistance, and selling houses to them on preferential terms. All these situations show that as far as the work of placement of demobilized Army officers is concerned, the policy will become more and more perfect and the path will become broader and broader. Our dear comrade-in-arms, the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, is concerned about demobilized officers, who are welcomed by local party committees and governments at all levels and the masses and needed by the undertaking of socialist construction. There is no need for us to worry about their "way out." On the contrary, we must fully understand our state's problems, conscientiously submit ourselves to the overall situation, and attach importance to our people's interests. As long as we live up to our party's and our people's ardent expectations, we must definitely be given new fields to fully exhibit our talents and strengths on all fronts of reform and opening up once we have fulfilled our task of defense. As far as the work of placement of demobilized Army officers is concerned, an extraordinary decades-long course has been traversed, with a good deal of effort made and great achievements scored. We may be confronted with many new situations and many new problems and have to shoulder heavy responsibilities in the days to come. However, we firmly believe that the work of placement of demobilized Army officers will definitely have a brighter future.
