"We neither want nor can impose our ideas on Mexican civil society through the use of force, as does the current government when it imposes its programs on the country by force," he added. Presidential, legislative, and municipal elections are scheduled for 21 August. In this pronouncement, Sub-Commander Marcos stated that "when a political and military force (such as the Mexican Federal Government) asks another political and military force (such as the EZLN) to hand over its weapons, that means in political and military terms that it is asking for an unconditional surrender. In exchange for unconditional surrender, the federal government is promising what it always does: an internal settling of accounts, a package of statements, promises, and more bureaucratic entities," he regretted. The guerrilla leader added that the call to lay down their weapons "prompts the most suspicions. The historical lesson in Mexico and Latin America is that those who surrender their weapons trusting in the `pardon' of their pursuers winds up shot dead somewhere by the weapons of any death squad of any political or ruling faction." In another communique, the EZLN command called on Mexicans "to rally" around "the cause of a national revolutionary movement where there is room for the broadest trends, the most varied thinking, and different forms of struggle, yet there is only one aspiration and goal: freedom, democracy, and justice." "The EZLN calls on Mexicans to take up this cause, not the EZLN cause, not the cause of an armed struggle, but the cause of what is the right of every thinking being, the reason of our nation and understanding of our people: freedom democracy, and justice," it added. In its analysis of the current situation, the EZLN command attributes to civilian society more than to its own actions that the possibility of dialogue on the problems in Chiapas State has been achieved with the government. Military actions have not "been as decisive for this shift in the conflict as have been the different public demonstrations in the streets, the mountains, and the news media by the most varied organizations and honest and independent people who are part of what is called civilian Mexican society." The guerrillas affirmed that the uprising was the only path "left to us," but admitted that "other modes of struggle exist and are of great value," adding that the steps of all who are marching with the truth must follow a single path: the one that leads to freedom, democracy, and justice."
