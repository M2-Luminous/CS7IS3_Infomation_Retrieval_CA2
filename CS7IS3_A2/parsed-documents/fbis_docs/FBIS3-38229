For Mr. Cotti, head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs [DFAE], the talks focused on relations between Switzerland and the European Union [EU]. Meanwhile, Mr. Delamuraz was involved in discussions on the implementation of the GATT agreements. Concluded in mid-December after seven years of negotiations, the Uruguay Round agreements ought to take effect as from 1 January 1996. "That is the majority opinion emerging in Davos," commented Mr. Delamuraz on Sunday [30 January], at the end of his attendance at the World Economic Forum (WEF). In Switzerland, this deadline for ratification is "tight," the federal councillor said during an interview with the ATSA database. "The package of around 30 agreements that I will be signing on behalf of Switzerland in Marrakesh in April will only be available in French, Spanish, and English," explained the head of the Federal Department of Public Economy [DFEP]. Now, the Federal Council will wait until the official German version of the EU is available before it launches the consultation procedure. "I was struck by the extremely lucid discussions that took place this year among the Forum's participants," the head of the DFEP pointed out, summing up his visit. Mr. Delamuraz mainly discussed the future of GATT with the 20 or so leading world figures whom he met there. Promising Development Before leaving Davos, Mr. Delamuraz particularly stressed the Swiss interest in those zones undergoing rapid economic development. On Friday, the Federal Council member had given a dinner for several members and heads of governments of Southeast Asia. "The ASEAN zone is one of the most promising areas for the Swiss economy," he said. On Saturday, Mr. Delamuraz also hosted a dinner in honor of an Argentine delegation led by Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo. The head of the DFEP also made the most of the presence in Davos of his Spanish, French, and Egyptian counterparts to exchange views with them bilaterally. Nor did Mr. Delamuraz neglect the countries of East Europe. In particular, he met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, and head of the Russian Government Viktor Chernomyrdin. Swiss-EU Relations On Friday and Saturday, Federal Council member Flavio Cotti was in Davos, where he discussed relations between Switzerland and the EU. He met with the heads of the German, Belgian, and Finnish Governments to discuss this topic, as well as with the Danish foreign minister. Both Belgium's Jean-Luc Dehaene and Denmark's Niels Petersen welcomed the Swiss strategic objective -- to join the EU in the medium term -- as a measure of confidence. On Friday, Mr. Cotti held talks on the Middle East with his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts, Shim'on Peres and 'Amr Musa, respectively. The Federal Council member expressed the hope that the meeting between Mr. Peres and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat would relaunch the peace process. Mr. Cotti was due to meet with the Palestinian leader in Bern on Monday, accompanied by President of the Swiss Confederation Otto Stich. The chief of Swiss diplomacy took advantage of his presence in Davos to meet the South African delegation, during which the situation in that country before the first general elections, scheduled for 27 April was discussed. Switzerland feels committed to work side by side with countries undergoing an historical development, Mr. Cotti emphasized. The elimination of racial problems in South Africa is one of the main preoccupations of the DFAE.
