In response to this, China's prisons have found many extremely characteristic corrective methods in the course of practice. Qigong Corrective Therapy Every morning and evening, at the gate of Shanghai Municipal Prison, one can find several lines of female prisoners attentively practicing qigong to soft and relaxing music. After practicing qigong for three years or more, many female prisoners find that their health has obviously improved and their willpower has strengthened. Several years ago, Shanghai Municipal Prison and the Municipal Qigong Scientific Research Institute were already cooperating in exploring the practical corrective effect of qigong in the reform of criminals, and their qigong training topics on violent criminals and sex offenders have recently been included as research subjects for this year by the China Medical Association. Violent criminals have an irritable and bellicose character. They are ready to fight at the slightest provocation. The prison authorities insist on having them practice slow "calming" qigong. After several months, their irritable temper can be effectively corrected. As for sex offenders, qigong training is of particular significance in stabilizing their emotions, creates a fine psychological environment, and optimizes their psychological mechanisms. By practicing qigong, senile prisoners can have their symptoms of senility improved or completely eliminated. Moreover, their minds can be broadened and their self-control increased. Embroidery Corrective Therapy Early this year, Sun Chenggong had his prison term reduced. He had been sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for theft, robbery, and harming and hindering the execution of public affairs. He was dissatisfied with the sentence when he was sent to Shandong Beishu Prison and made an attempt to escape. A small embroidery needle has changed his life. He told this reporter that after he had been caught again in an escape attempt, instructing cadres had him learn embroidery. He said that he was not used to it at the beginning and felt uncomfortable sitting just for a short while, but that later he slowly mastered embroidery and his temper changed a lot. Having bellicose and energetic violent criminals learn embroidery, training their characters, and correcting their behavior is a new method found by Beishu Prison in the practice of reforming criminals. At an embroidery workshop, dozens of male criminals quietly do embroidery work with their needles and thread. They are not inferior to females in speed. A young criminal said: This is also labor. Except for using the eyes, it is lighter than other jobs. Moreover, I am energetic by nature. I hated sitting, but embroidery can help reform me. Psychological Corrective Therapy In-prison psychological counseling was initiated in Western countries as early as in the twenties and thirties. Although exploration of the feasibility of in-prison psychological counseling has been carried out for only three to five years in China, it is now being extensively adopted in prisons across China. According to a survey by Shanghai Municipal Prison, a criminal entering a strange prison from the familiarity of society will often be psychologically unbalanced and depressed and feel at a loss or even tired of life. The incidence of the psychology [as published] and cognitive retardation among criminals is obviously higher than that among ordinary people. The psychological problems of criminals not only hinder their admission of guilt and observance of law and their reform, but also bring difficulties to prison management. In addition to offering special out-patient psychological counseling services, Shanghai Municipal Prison also demands that instructing cadres have some mastery of the knowledge of psychology. It has also achieved good results in organizing a series of studies on knowledge of psychology among prisoners so that they can come to understand themselves and judge people and things around them from a rational angle and so that they can use psychology to explain the inexplicable phenomena and feelings that once affected them and thus enhance the awareness of reform.
