The European Union (EU) is reacting sensitively to Korea's fast advancement into its market, a Foreign Ministry official said Monday. The ACEA (Association of European Automobile Manufacturers) recently submitted a recommendation to the European commission urging it to lift GSP privileges for Korean car imports. The ACEA, joined by such major European automakers as Fiat of Italy, Renault of France and Rover of Britain, also asked for an anti-dumping investigation of Korean car exporters in the recommendation. Korea exported 90,000 cars to Europe last year while importing 500 units. The European Union has repeatedly called on Seoul to rectify the trade imbalance.
