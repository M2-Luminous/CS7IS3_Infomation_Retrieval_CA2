Journalists report that the public hearing, now in its fifth day, has significantly overrun the 72 hours originally alotted for it because of lengthy debates between the prosecution and Hai's lawyers. According to judicial sources, a verdict is now not expected before Wednesday afternoon. Observers claim such delays are rare in the Vietnamese legal process. The circumstances leading up to charges being brought against Hai after two years of investigation are particularly complicated and politically sensitive. Prime minister Vo Van Kiet even declared the affair a matter of priority. The trial, which calls a former government official into question for the first time since 1975, is considered a test of the goverment's will to stamp out corruption which has worsened since Vietnam moved to a market economy. The former energy minister is accused of "abuse of power" in the delivery of 4,000 tonnes of steel intended for the construction of the first 500 kilovolt electric powerline from the north to the south of Vietnam. He allegedly ordered the steel from a small intermediary company run by one of his relatives instead of going through Vinametal, the main state firm responsible for metal trading. The prosecution alleged that by-passing the state company cost Vinametal 3.1 billion dongs (about 300,000 US dollars). Hai is appearing in court together with his former deputy minister Le Liem and seven other co-accused who are directors of other companies implicated in the scandal. The prosecution has asked for a fixed three-year jail sentence for the former minister and a two-year suspended sentence for his deputy. It requested three to seven-year sentences for their associates. The defence lawyers have called for outright acquittals for the two main defendants because of the "complexity" of the case and the "lack of precision" of the charges. The case is highly sensitive since the prime minister, who has vowed to make the fight against corruption one of the priorities of his government in 1994, personally committed himself to the construction of the 500 kilovolt powerline, which should alleviate the energy shortage in the country's southern provinces. The development project, which is one of the most important in Vietnam, has been plagued by bribery and by theft of materials since it began in 1992. It has been delayed and its cost, originally estimated at 300 million US dollars by the authorities, has almost doubled. Three days before the start of the trial Kiet fired Hai from his job as "prime minister's special supervisor for the 500 kilovolt powerline". He was sacked from the government last year and was last month expelled from the Central Committee of the Communist Party. However neither he nor his deputy has been arrested. Foreign journalists have been present at the trial and the proceedings have been relayed to several dozen onlookers through loudspeakers in the courtyard of the central law courts.
