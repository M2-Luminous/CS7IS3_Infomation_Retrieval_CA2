Chen Gongyan, vice-president of the Beijing Commodities Exchange, one of the country's major futures exchanges, said the adjustment will eliminate some regional and small futures exchanges that don't meet the government's standards. Member companies of these exchanges will then seek to secure positions on big exchanges, he said. Meanwhile, Chen said, since futures brokerages are prohibited from doing business on exchanges outside the mainland, more investment will flow into domestic trading centres. In addition, the rectification is also spurring big exchanges to intensify efforts to standardize their management and operations, he said. "The aim of the rectification is not to nip the young industry in the bud, but to ensure a healthy and stable development and a clear market for the industry," Chen said. With futures companies and exchanges sprouting up across the country, China began rectifying futures companies last year and exchanges this year. Before being allowed to resume business, companies and exchanges must pass government examinations on topics such as assets and transaction volume. Chen said the Beijing Commodities Exchange is benefiting from heavy business resulting from the rectification. Since the end of May, its daily transaction value has averaged 1.3 billion yuan ($149 million), compared with about 300 million ($34.5 million) in March and 200 million ($23 million) in April, Chen said. "We are taking all possible measures to support the correction," he said. However, since many exchanges are at a loss without detailed guidelines, Chen hopes the government will publicly clarify its policies. "We should rely more on laws and regulations, instead of administrative policies, to supervise the market," he said. Sources said China is speeding up the drafting of its first futures trading law, which would provide a legal framework for governing the new industry.
