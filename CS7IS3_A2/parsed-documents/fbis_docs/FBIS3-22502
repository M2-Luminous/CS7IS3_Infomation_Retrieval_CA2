He said that at the meeting of those involved with AIDS from the Ministry of Public Health, the National Committee for AIDS Prevention, the National Assembly, and experts in AIDS it was learned that the actual figure for those with the AIDS virus throughout the country was about 600,000 people. Areas with a high incidence were the North and Bangkok. Little was found in the Northeast, the South and the East. If one person in 100 had AIDS, it would be considered very serious. Dr. Wichai also said that in 5 to 6 years there would be 300,000 people with the complete AIDS symptoms. At present the Ministry of Public Health and private institutions had 90,000 beds for patients. How would these patients be cared for? The Ministry of Public Health would have to find new ways to care for both AIDS patients and ordinary patients. How could they both be dealt with? What he was worried about was how to get the Thai people throughout the country to refrain from spreading the disease, especially in regard to the use of prostitutes. Prostitutes were the most serious cause of the spread of AIDS, accounting for 90 percent of the cases. Children contracting the virus from their mothers accounted for 5 percent of the cases. The rest involved drug addiction and hypodermic needles, but the percentage was small. [passage omitted] He said that the statistics for those dying from AIDS now was one and one-half per day. The situation was considered to be very serious especially in some provinces of the North such as Chiang Mai Province, Chiang Rai Province and Lampang Province where one person per day was dying. He wanted those who did not have the AIDS virus to see people suffering from AIDS. Then they would know how bad it was for these patients just to lay down and wait to die, and how much the patients suffered in the 3 to 4 years it took to die. Government units in every ministry, bureau, department; University students; secondary students; and primary students would have to help in the battle to make the people realize the danger of AIDS and stop thinking that it was not important.
