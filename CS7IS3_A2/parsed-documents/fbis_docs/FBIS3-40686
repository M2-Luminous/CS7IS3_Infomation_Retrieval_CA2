In Karnataka, the Dunkel Draft Text (DDT) was being debated and aggressively opposed even as awareness of this important issue was just beginning to grow in other parts of the country. As early as March 1992, nearly 700 scientists from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India's premier research institution, signed a letter addressed to the Prime Minister, expressing their opposition to the DDT which they felt would compromise India's self-reliance in science and technology. The credit for highlighting the impact a Dunkel Draft-based agreement would have on Indian agriculture--from the question of seed/gene patenting and the rights of cultivators, to the likely effects of multinationals' entry into the crucial food sector--goes to the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRSS), a farmers' organisation led by M.D. Nanjundaswamy. KRSS members carried out a daring attack on the Bangalore office of Cargill India Ltd, a subsidiary of the U.S. multinational Cargill Inc., in January 1993, followed by another attack on the Cargill factory in Bellary. These may have drawn a great deal of media flak for their "adventurism," but these actions were primarily responsible for opening the Dunkel debate to the public and indeed forcing the Government--which till then had chosen to conceal the import of the GATT negotiations--to come clean and explain its negotiating stance to a large and concerned constituency. "It is a total surrender of the country's sovereignty by the Government of India at a time when the issue was under debate in Parliament, and also under examination by the Standing Committee on Agriculture headed by Nitish Kumar, which has not yet submitted its recommendations. The Government never bothered to refer the matter to the State legislatures though many subjects covered by the Dunkel Draft come under the State List, such as agriculture," says Nanjundaswamy, who dismisses the Government's claims of having gained concessions, particularly in the textile sector, as empty talk. "The so-called concessions are all at the level of oral assurances. There is nothing committed to in black and white--including in textiles," he says. He is equally dismissive of the Government's promises of protecting the farmers' right to retain seeds. "The accused must prove his innocence, under the reversal of the burden of proof. The farmer will have to prove that he has used his own seed, and not the patented seed." The KRSS has filed a writ petition in the Karnataka High Court questioning the constitutional validity of the Union Government's action in signing the Draft Final Treaty of GATT which, it says, affects the basic federal structure of the Constitution and damages the citizens' fundamental rights. It has pleaded for a writ of mandamus to the Union Government directing it: 1. to get the consent of the State legislatures before signing the final treaty; 2. to hold a referendum before signing the final treaty; and 3. to make a comprehensive statement concerning the contents of the final treaty. It has also sought a similar writ of mandamus to be issued to the President to exercise his power under Article 143 of the Constitution (to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for its opinion). Nanjundaswamy, who attended an anti-Dunkel meeting of representatives of farmers, ecologists and consumer groups in Geneva on December 4, says, "Our stand is that India should remain a member of GATT, but should have demanded drastic amendments in the agreement. India had the opportunity to build up a Third World lobby that would have given us stronger bargaining power." This is a view shared by others. "My charge against the Government is that there was no attempt to take the lead in organising Third World countries to take a harder bargaining position," says H.D. Deve Gowda, Janata Dal MP and a member of the parliamentary committee headed by I.K. Gujral set up to examine the Dunkel Draft. "At one stage two years ago, the Government actually issued instructions to its negotiators in the talks not to mobilise the support of other countries. They can't mortgage our independence like this. After all, we are a nation of 90 crore people, and can't be bullied by Clinton." Referring to an article by former Foreign Secretary Muchkund Dubey, S. Chatterji, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, says: "In his article Dubey makes clear how suggestions that India call a meeting of non-aligned countries to forge common ground on the Dunkel issue was met with hostility from the Government. To me, the question of whether or not we should have signed it is hypothetical. We never tried to find an alternative. We could have stood firm on the question of intellectual property rights and could have got the support of countries like Argentina and Brazil. They cannot impose a so-called uniform multilateral trading order, when the global world order is not uniform." There is widespread concern about GATT's adverse impact on different sectors of the economy--agriculture, textiles, services, and a large, uncharted area where intellectual property rights will unfairly restrict growth--but most persons admit to not being clear about the exact ramifications of the various clauses in the text. Most of the scientists whom FRONTLINE spoke to, for example, while careful not to overreact on an issue which they all claimed they did not know enough about, expressed their reservations about the scope of the agreement, particularly its implications for the future of Indian science and technology. D. Balasubramaniam, Director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, drew attention to the lack of "public documentation" and the Government's failure to ascertain public opinion on such an important issue. But his main concern is about India's self-reliance in the field of science and technology. "Are we closing our gates to ourselves?" This is really what is worrying me. Any nation for its well-being must be self-reliant. This doesn't mean that it must be self-sufficient in everything, although self-sufficiency is a good goal for important areas, like food. People seem to forget that technology moves fast, it leaps across boundaries. To restrict technological growth is to impose an economic burden on an otherwise radiating field. We in India are concerned about health care, the use of genes, particularly gene therapy. Patents can restrict our access to technology. Any nation's long term goal in scientific research is that it will lead to a greater amount of awareness and prosperity. In an economic crisis, 'luxuries' such as science, education and health are hit first. Under GATT it may become easier and/or more cost effective to import products from outside. But this will certainly lead to the scientific and technological aspects of Indian economic development taking a back seat." The problem is not merely the use of patents as an instrument of unfair leverage. The prohibitive costs of international patents will also deter even those individuals/research establishments that may wish to get into the business of patenting, according to H. Sharad Chandra, Professor, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science. "Knowledge of patents in India is woefully lacking," he observed. "It has never really been a part of our culture--remember the great Mughal artists who would not even sign their creations. An American patent costs around Rs. 20 lakh--out of the question for the ordinary scientist. And one in a hundred patents may be accepted. Take the Indian Institute of Science. We as an institution may not be able to spend on more than two such patents a year. With this reality staring us in the face, if the Government wants us to get more competitive, it must provide professional investment/patent advice. My feeling is that, in the short run, the GATT agreement will make the rich richer and the poor poorer." With the monopoly status a patent confers on its holder, plus the opening up of markets, we will be "moving backwards," according to A.V. Rama Rao, Director, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad. "Once you open up, the Government has no control. Multinationals have huge marketing capabilities. All right, we have signed because all nations have done so. But the Government must consider what safeguards it can give local producers. We have both manpower and technical capabilities." It is in the area of health that the new intellectual property regime will perhaps make the most palpable impact. Drug prices are predicted to rise steeply. "Yesterday was the saddest day in my life," Dr. Y.K. Hameid, managing director of Cipla, an Indian owned pharmaceutical company, told FRONTLINE. "By accepting the TRIPS part of the Dunkel Draft, we have compromised on two crucial areas of the country's well-being--food and health. What we have done is to put ourselves at the mercy of multinationals. The impact on drug prices will be felt in the next five to 10 years. Ultimately our companies will be forced to sell out." Cipla is the fourth largest pharmaceutical company in India, with an expected turnover of Rs. 250 crore in 1994. It exports bulk drugs and formulations to Europe, America and other countries. "Articles 27 and 28 of the Dunkel Text will allow the patent holder both to produce and import. MNCs prefer to import rather than produce locally, and they do not allow their local units to export to overseas markets. What guarantees have we obtained against such practices?" asks B.K. Chandrashekhar, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, and co-editor of the book, The Dunkel Draft: Design for Disaster (Navakarnataka Publications, Bangalore). The contradictory statements made by the Government and its attempt to obfuscate an already confusing document, which, as Balasubrananiam says, "binds our national endeavours not in terms of global trade but in terms of global restrictions," has been criticised sharply. Chandrashekhar says: "First Pranab Mukherjee says farmers' interests will be protected. The next minute he says farmers must pay a one-time royalty for seeds. It is not clear whether exchange of seeds will be a part of the sui generis form of protection for seeds as required by GATT. And what are the actual provisions in the sui generis system that will be offered as an alternative to patents?" But, despite the pessimism the GATT agreement has generated, there is the stated confidence that a nation of India's size and capabilities cannot be browbeaten. As one commentator observed, "After all, the GATT agreement is not the Indian Constitution, and if its implementability becomes a serious problem, there will be a demand for changes in the agreement by political and economic forces in the country."
