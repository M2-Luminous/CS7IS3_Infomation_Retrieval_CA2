And this is natural, inasmuch as the authorities of Azerbaijan who successively replaced each other, given the outward dissimilarity of their political form, differed very little in their attitude toward the Karabakh problem, adhering to one logic--war. True, a revealing metamorphosis has taken place: Ayaz Mutalibov, who did not consider it possible to create his own combat-capable army in a short time, stressed resources at hand--the remainder of the Soviet troops in Azerbaijan. Abulfaz Elchibey was a follower of the national idea and, consequently, a supporter of the creation of a national army. He organized an offensive, after promising in one of his interviews to resolve the problem in a year--and Geydar Aliyev repeated the very same words in January of this year. He returned to the use of the idea that it was impossible to gain a victory in war with one's own forces. But as a more flexible politician in the line of his predecessors, he actively used peaceful rhetoric. Although the first negotiations by his representatives on the dispatch of mujahidin to Azerbaijan were going on at the end of the summer and the beginning of September, when Aliyev still claimed that he should become president first and then engage in peaceful negotiations. The present offensive was being readied since July, but it started in December, when Azerbaijan considered that it was already prepared for them. A large amount of ammunition was received from Russia, all produced in 1993--Aliyev took advantage of his contacts with brass hats and the generally indefinite situation in Russia. Negotiations were held about the mercenaries--both Afghan and Russian--and time was needed for all of this. Turkish instructors arrived in Azerbaijan, and today Karabakh soldiers are finding Turkish-produced cartridges on the battlefield. While the Russian plan for settlement and the CSCE plan were being actively worked on, Azerbaijan, while participating in the negotiations, maneuvered, and when it was necessary ignored them in order to avoid a determinant and far-reaching decision. It needed a victory more than it needed negotiations, inasmuch as the initial position for the start of political bargaining was less than advantageous. Therefore, a declared armistice was broken more than once. The concept arose in Russian diplomatic circles of "limited military victories" that were necessary to Azerbaijan--incentives that could incline it to accept the Russian settlement plan (up until now, Baku in one or another form reported its objection to it). Azerbaijan tried to use the potential support of Iran, Turkey, and Russia, showing that it was acting in their contradictory, however, interests. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has already written about the facts of the participation of Afghan mujahidin in combat operations on its side. Documents, whose originals were transferred to the editorial office, were found on dead Afghans on the battlefield. In particular, a list of personnel of one of the subunits of the training center in Gyandzh consists only of mujahidin. Here are names: Abdurrazak Mukhamatrasul, Zakhedulla Muminkhan, Abdulvakil Mukhamadkarim, Gulzada Sardar, Alikhaydar Shakhmukhamat, Gulakhmat Mirrakhman, Khanshirin, [preceding names as transliterated] and others. As follows from the September information report on the military-political situation in the region by the commander of military unit No. 160, Lieutenant Colonel Lyatifov, in which Afghans are fighting, "the military unit is deployed on the territory of Yevlakhskiy Rayon. The closest populated centers are the Geran Station, Geranboyskiy Rayon, the city of Mingechaur... A special contingent is located in our unit, they are combat motivated, and they maintain good relations with us and with the local population. They drive out to the cities of Mingechaur, Geranboy, and Gyandzha escorted by interpreters who are called up for periods of training. Questions that arise with the command element of the special contingent are resolved successfully. Although it can be noted that the leadership of the neighboring rayons does not maintain close contacts with the command element of the special contingent in order to furnish its assistance at the necessary moment. I would like in the future to improve relations with the leadership of the neighboring rayons and the command element of the unit. These meetings and contacts will have a positive influence on the mood of the personnel and will support their combat spirit. No effort was seen to plant leaflets and propaganda against the leadership of the republic..." The mujahidin, as the Karabakh people acknowledge, fight stubbornly, although the motive for their participation in this conflict is not religious convictions, but strictly pragmatic considerations. According to unconfirmed reports, the Afghans began to be actively used after the son-in-law of Prime Minister Hekmatyar, together with a representative of his current ally--General Dostam--visited Baku in the middle of December. This problem was commented on for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA by Feliks Mamikoyan, the permanent representative of Armenia in Russia: "According to the protocol to the treaty on collective security, to join it requires the consent of all of the country participants. Azerbaijan expressed a desire to sign the treaty, but juridically its entry has not yet been ratified in the prescribed procedures. Several questions arise in this connection--in particular concerning the Iran-Azerbaijan border. Inasmuch as individual borders of the CIS, in contrast to the `transparent' internal borders, must be protected, then the Iranian border also cannot be outwardly open--otherwise a threat emerges for all states, particularly for Armenia. The threat is associated with the participation of third-country servicemen in a local conflict on the territory of Azerbaijan--which is one of the members of the CIS. "Considering the complicated situation on the Afghan-Tajik border, on whose different sides a combined CIS contingent and those mujahidin are deployed, this fact looks even more ambiguous and requires clarification. As does Aliyev's persistent reluctance to protect his outer border with Iran. If an agreement should be written that the Russian border troops of the combined CIS contingent is to take control of the border, the Karabakh authorities are prepared to release these territories--they have repeatedly declared that they do not plan to retain these lands. In the context of peaceful negotiations, the question of stationing Russian border troops along this line can become one of the most important. "We have information that makes it possible to reach conclusions, in particular, about the fact that the Iranian border was used for operations of the Azerbaijan army. In the first stage, the success of the operation on the southern front is explained by the fact that the troops got into the rear of the Karabakh armed formations through the Iranian border. This once again confirms the need for common border troops that control the borders of the Commonwealth--then it would be possible to avoid reproaches of this kind."
