The total length of the highways in the province has reached 32,000 kilometers and there are more than 3,200 highway bridges. Among the highways are five high-grade ones, including the Guiyang- Huangguoshu highway. Construction of some other high-grade highways, such as the Guiyang-Zunyi highway and the Anshun-Zhijin highway, is well ahead. There was no highway in Guizhou until 1927, when Zhou Xicheng, the then governor of Guizhou, bought a "Chevrolet" car. It was the first automobile to get to the province, and had to be taken apart, making eight pieces, to be carried by manpower to the center of Guiyang, capital of the province. Since the founding of New China in 1949, the central government has consistently implemented favourable policies to encourage Guizhou to build highways. In the past decade, the central government has given large subsidies for the purpose. Last year alone, a total of 256 million yuan (nearly 30 million U.S. dollars) was invested in construction of highways in the province. Under the national development program, Guizhou Province will concentrate on building three express highways in the next ten years. The first starts from Guizhou's border with Hunan Province and runs westward to end at the border of Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces via Kaili, Guiyang and Anshun. It is a 760-kilometer section of a national arterial highway, the Shanghai-Kunming-Wanding highway. The other two both begin at the border of Guizhou and Sichuan Provinces and run southward to enter Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, respectively via Zunyi, Guiyang and Duyun and via Dafang and Anlong. Mo Shiren, vice-governor of Guizhou Province, said that to speed up construction of highways was an important part of the province's overall strategy for economic development. Only by accelerating the development of communications and transport can the province further exploit its rich mineral resources and develop its production and processing of farm produce. He noted that among all the provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in the country, Guizhou is top in top-grade phosphate deposits and second in the reserves of bauxite. It is also in the top five in reserves of 25 other minerals. The province also produces fine-quality apples, walnuts and peanuts.
