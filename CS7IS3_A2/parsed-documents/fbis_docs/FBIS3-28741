I would like also to convey my friendly greetings to our foreign friends who are celebrating the lunar new year in our country. During the past few years, despite swift and complicated changes in the international situation and despite the heavy war consequences and prolonged U.S. embargo against us, we have scored important achievements. Our economy has consistently developed, our people's spiritual and material life improved, our political situation stabilized, and our diplomatic activities expanded. These initial achievements have enhanced our people's confidence and enthusiasm and have won admiration from our friends around the world. This success has once again testified to our people's great creativity, vigorous energy to surge forward, and profound sentiments toward our friends both near and far. It can be said that today we have sufficient internal factors to ensure firm and long-lasting political security. We also have a firm base to maintain peace on a long-term basis and many prerequisites to lead our nation toward a new stage -- the stage of national industrialization and modernization. In the years ahead, our party, state, people, and the armed forces must strengthen their unity to enhance experiences, uphold the spirit of national independence and sovereignty, expand international cooperation, seriously practice diligence, thrift, honesty, and righteousness; develop creativity, and accelerate the renovation process. With great efforts to carry out these tasks, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and ordeals and score new, ever greater achievements on the path of building socialism to attain the goals of making our people prosperous, our nation powerful, and our society just and civilized, thereby step by step building our country more beautiful and prosperous as wished by our esteemed beloved President Ho Chi Minh. I wish all countrymen, comrades, combatants, and families throughout the country good health, happiness, and prosperity in the new year.
