A Karenni spokesman who requested anonymity said four battalions of the Burmese Army -- the 421th, 250th, 261st light infantry battalions, and 102nd ordinary battalion -- launched a lightning attack against about 100 Karenni fighters around midnight on 26 January near Danai Khong San village, which is about 10 miles north of Loikaw, the capital of the Karenni state. Four Burmese troops were killed and three others wounded; the Karenni lost arms and ammunition during the one-night assault, but suffered no casualties, he said. The spokesman expected the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) would continue its offensive and said fighting could last until the onset of the wet season in April or May. He said the attack on the Karenni took place 10 days after the second round of bilateral talks failed to make any progress. Karenni and Slorc representatives met on 12 and 16 January about 40 miles from Loikaw. Deputy Army Chief Major Aung Mya led the three-member Karenni team, which also included Karenni officials Paulu and Shan Reh, to meet the four-person Burmese delegation led by Colonel Kyaw Win, deputy director of the Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence (DDSI), and Lieutenant Colonel Kyaw Thein, a DDSI officer in charge of peace negotiations and drugs suppression. The Karenni spokesman said Slorc rejected their four-point proposal, while the Karenni could not accept Rangoon's demand that they drop political claims for independence. The Karenni proposal calls for Slorc to withdraw its troops from the eastern side of the Salween River, allowing Karenni forces to move freely in Karenni State, an end to collecting taxes and conscripting civilians as porters, and to stop using Karenni territory as a base to attack other armed ethnic forces. Despite the breakdown of the talks, the Slorc delegation told the meeting that they would meet again in the future, according to the Karenni spokesman. No date had been fixed.
