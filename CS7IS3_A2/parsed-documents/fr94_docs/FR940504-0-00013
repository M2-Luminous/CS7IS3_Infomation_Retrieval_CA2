FR940504-0-00013 FR940504-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AWP&hyph;1] Establishment of Class D Airspace; El Toro, CA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class D airspace at El Toro, CA, designated as an extension to a Class C surface area. The floor was inadvertently lowered from a base of 2,500 feet mean sea level (MSL) down to the surface. This modification raises the floor between the 10 and 15 mile radius of the Class D airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet MSL. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Scott Speer, System Management Branch, AWP&hyph;530, Air Traffic Division, Western-Pacific Region, Federal Aviation Administration, 15000 Aviation Boulevard, Lawndale, California 90261; telephone (310) 297&hyph;0697. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On January 31, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class D airspace at El Toro, CA (59 FR 8565). The Class D airspace was inadvertenly changed during Airspace Reclassification. This change restricted aircraft transiting along the shoreline. This action will raise the floor of a portion of the Class D airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet MSL to allow aircraft to transit along the shoreline. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA and there were no objections to the proposal. Class D airspace designations for airspace designated as extensions to class C airspace are published in Paragraph 5000b of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulation modifies Class D airspace at El Toro, CA, to establish Class D airspace from 2,500 fee MSL to 4,400 feet MSL for aircraft transiting between the 10 and 15 mile radius of MCAS El Toro, CA. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body by technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regularly Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
