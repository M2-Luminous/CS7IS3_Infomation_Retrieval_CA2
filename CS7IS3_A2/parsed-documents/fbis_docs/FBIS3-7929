The pilot, who wished to remain anonymous, said three of the Serbs were killed and the fourth ejected to safety. He named the dead men as Lieutenants Sisarica, Zoric and Zvezdan Pesic. Pesic was based at Podgorica with the Air Force of the rump Yugoslavia until January when he quit and went as a volunteer to Krajina, flying from the air base at Udbina, near Knin. French military officials said in Paris Tuesday that it was "very probable" that four of the six Galeb ground attack aircraft intercepted by U.S. F-16s came from Ubdina, while the others took off from another Serb base at Banja Luka, northwest Bosnia. In London and Zagreb, British and UN officials said Tuesday it was probable that the aircraft had taken off from Serb-controlled bases in Croatia. On Monday, French officials said the first reports suggested that all six aircraft had come from Banja Luka. The two aircraft which escaped the attack left "due west" and landed probably at the base at Udbina, the officials said Tuesday. "The U.S. pilots saw explosions on the ground when they intercepted the Serb planes," one said. "A munitions depot was attacked," but "nobody can say exactly what were the Serb pilots' intentions." "The Serbian pilots could have dropped their bombs to make themselves more manoeuvrable and able to escape from the US planes, or to really bomb a site." In London, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told the House of Commons that the aircraft probably came from Serb-controlled bases in Croatia. "It's not yet clear where the six Galeb planes came from though it seems at least probable that they came from airports under the control of Serbs in Croatia but that is not yet certain," he said. In Zagreb, a spokesman for the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was more cautious, saying the aircraft could have come from a Serb-controlled area of Croatia. "That couldn't be ruled out," said Michael Williams, spokesman for Yasushi Akashi, the special representative of the UN Secretary General in the former Yugoslavia. "We do not have a confirmation as to which side or on whose behalf these planes were engaged over Bosnia-Herzegovina," he added. Also in Zagreb, Jean Marcotte, spokesman for UNPROFOR commander General Jean Cot said the six Serb planes had just carried out an airstrike against an ammunition factory at Novi Travnik and an ammunition compound in Bugojno, both in central Bosnia, when they were intercepted around dawn Monday. The UN had no military observers in Udbina and those at Banja Luka had been "detained, confined in their quarters for the whole day" Monday, Marcotte said. "There has been restriction of movement in different ways by all the factions since we arrived here," he added. In Belgrade, Zoran Lilic, the president of the rump Yugoslavia, said the planes shot down by NATO were not Yugoslav. He condemned "all actions likely to lead to an escalation of the conflict and all recourse to force on whatever side."
