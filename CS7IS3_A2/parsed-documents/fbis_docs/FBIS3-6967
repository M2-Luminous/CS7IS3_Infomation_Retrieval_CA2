Yi told the National Assembly's National Defense Committee that the exercise may begin in late April, mid-May or sometime after that. He said, "as North Korea failed to fulfill the two preconditions for suspension of Team Spirit, resumption of the exercise has become inevitable. The maximum number of U.S. Forces possible will take part in the exercise for maximum effect." He explained that Team Spirit will include command post exercises and such practical maneuvers as river crossings and emergency landings. North Korea walked out of the latest inter-Korean working-level contact on Saturday, rupturing the dialogue on exchanging special envoys, and warned Monday that it would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if Team Spirit was resumed this year. In response to threats by Pyongyang, South Korea and the United States plan to deploy Patriot missiles near Seoul soon in preparation for an emergency. The Patriots are expected to arrive here next month in time for Team Spirit. Yi said, "Patriot anti-missile missiles will also be part of the exercise. One Patriot battalion can fight 55 incoming aircraft simultaneously and has the incidental capability of intercepting Scud missiles." The government will decide the date for resumption of Team Spirit after considering the effect on farmers and likely outcome of the joint exercise. "Once the government officially announces the resumption of Team Spirit, it will be difficult to suspend the exercise again," he said. He did not rule out the possibility of North Korean provocation after the United Nations discusses possible economic sanctions. "The government is working out countermeasures of two kinds -- one before the U.N. Security Council decides on sanctions against North Korea and the other after the decision," he said. Yi said Seoul and Washington will hold consultations after the Security Council makes a decision on sanctions. If sanctions are imposed, he said North Korea may try to endure the pressure but would eventually be compelled to accede to the council's demands. "But if Pyongyang judges the United Nations' deterrent power is not enough to defeat it, you cannot rule out that possibility and it may choose military provocation," he said.
