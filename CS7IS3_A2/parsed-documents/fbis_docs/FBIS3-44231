The four protesters were wounded when about 15 fighters of the former rebel movement, the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), fired into a crowd of protesters near their barracks, the witnesses said. Rwandan authorities said they were investigating accusations that RPF fighters, many of whom are to join the army under peace accords signed with the government in August, had killed two people on Sunday night. Local residents said they wounded two others on Tuesday night. After nearly three years of civil war, the RPF agreed in August to join a transitional coalition government which has still to be sworn in. Six hundred of its former fighters, mainly from the minority Tutsi tribe, have been billetted in the capital to protect former RPF leaders who are to assume government posts. But the already strained relations between the Tutsis, Rwanda's feudal rulers, and the majority Hutus have soured further since the RPF fighters arrived last month, political analysts said.
