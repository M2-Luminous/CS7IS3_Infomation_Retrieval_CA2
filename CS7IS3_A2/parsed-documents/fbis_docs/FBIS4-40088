Interparliamentary exchanges promote precisely the establishment of closer political relations between the two countries," Russian Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists here on Monday, informing them of some aspects of talks with Alexander Iordanov, chairman of the People's Assembly. The development of economic cooperation was one of the main subjects during the exchange of views, Shumeyko said. Much attention during the dialogue was devoted to legislative support for the development of economic cooperation, Yuriy Algunov, press secretary of the Federation Council speaker, told ITAR-TASS. The Bulgarian side showed great interest in the experience which is being gained within the framework of the interparliamentary assembly of CIS countries, Algunov said. This was also confirmed by the Bulgarian parliament chief who at the same time expressed an opinion that the time apparently comes to change over "from official visits to the level of working contacts between individual commissions of the two parliaments." Participants in the meeting positively assessed the establishment of permanent exchanges of information on the activities of Russia's Federal Assembly and Bulgaria's People's Assembly. The fact that Shumeyko invited Iordanov to visit Moscow at a date of his convenience is an earnest of future constructive contacts between them. A similar invitation to Iordanov was also extended earlier by State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin who visited here at the beginning of the year. At the close of the meeting in the Bulgarian parliament, the Russian delegation was received by Professor Lyuben Berov, chairman of the Council of Ministers. On the same day, the guests laid a wreath at the unknown soldier's tomb -- a memorial complex in downtown Sofia in commemoration of Bulgarians who had perished on the battlefields.
