Now the physicians still have the situation under control, but cholera ``import'' from the Asian countries has been recorded; it was brought as one of the items acquired by shopping trip participants. We even have our ``own'' cholera. In Kaspiysk, Dagestan, a patient could not be saved. A three-month-old infant with the diagnosis is being treated today in a local hospital in Makhachkala. A bum, also with cholera, was brought in the infectious disease hospital on Sokolinaya gora on in Moscow. Typhoid fever was recorded in Rostov oblast and anthrax--in the Altay.
