FBIS4-42417 "drweu107aa_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-107 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Russian Airplane Manufacturer To Invest in Belgium Russian Airplane Manufacturer To Invest in Belgium BR0206132494 Brussels DE MORGEN in Dutch 1 Jun 94 p 4 BR0206132494 Brussels DE MORGEN Dutch BFN [Article signed FDS: "Airplane Manufacturer Wants To Build Factory in Brustem; Investment Worth 7 Billion Francs and 300 Jobs"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] At last year end, a businessman from Limburg contacted Flemish Minister Johan Sauwens (The People's Union) with the good news that his customer, a "naturalized Dutchman," according to official sources, while other sources refer to two rather questionable Germans from Dsseldorf, would like to invest some $200 million in Limburg. The purpose is to service Russian-built helicopters and to assemble small Russian airplanes in the new plant. Since the fall of the Berlin wall and the elimination of the Iron Curtain, the Russian aviation industry is trying to acquire a share of the Western market through dumping prices. Giant Russian helicopters are frequently used in the West because they have a bigger lifting capacity than their Western counterparts, so it makes perfect sense that their servicing also take place in the West. The Russian airplanes are allegedly worthy equivalents of U.S.-built Cessnas or German-Dutch Fokkers, and are said to be interesting on account of their price-quality ratio and their cargo capacity. An aid organization such as Doctors Without Frontiers, for instance, could easily convert them into ambulance airplanes, a tempting argument that the potential investors eagerly put forward. In addition, the investors also have Russian exclusive contracts for the servicing of helicopters and for the delivery of the necessary spare parts. [passage omitted]
