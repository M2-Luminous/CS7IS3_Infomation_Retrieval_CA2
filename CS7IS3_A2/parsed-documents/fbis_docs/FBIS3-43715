THE HERALD is the African country's biggest daily newspaper and often reflects the thinking of President Robert Mugabe's government. An editorial in the paper warns that other African states may follow Tanzania's lead. Tanzania this week barred the PAC from using its Dar es Salaam headquarters as a launching pad for violent attacks against South Africa. PAC official Gora Ebrahim says the report is part of a continuing campaign to discredit the organization. [Begin Ebrahim recording] This is totally unfounded. The relationship between the government and the Pan-Africanist Congress, the government and ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African National Union -- Patriotic Front] remain as solid as ever. We have received no written letter or indication whatsoever. In fact, recently our deputy president led a delegation to the Frontline States meeting where the position of the PAC on various issues was clearly put before the chairman of the Frontline States, who is His Excellency President Robert Mugabe. [end recording] Ebrahim also says that the PAC is not surprised that the South African Police [SAP] is refusing to conduct a joint investigation into the Gugulethu shooting. A 13-year-old boy was shot dead when police raided a PAC meeting in the Cape township last week. The PAC had called for a joint inquiry but the SAP says no legal provision exists for it to conduct a joint investigation. Ebrahim says police are scared of being exposed. [Begin Ebrahim recording] On each occasion that the PAC has been asking for a thorough investigation into these attempts, none of these have been taken up by the regime. It means that it is guilty of the crime and it is refusing to be accountable for it. [end recording] That's PAC official Gora Ebrahim. Cape Town police, meanwhile, have suspended the officer who allegedly shot the teenage boy, pending an investigation. The inquiry is being headed by Colonel Johan Kleyn.
