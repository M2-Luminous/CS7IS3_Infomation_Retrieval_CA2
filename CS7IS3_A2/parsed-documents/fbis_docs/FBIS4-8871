Georgievski, "Rating Issue One -- 1994: Popularity Among People"] [Editorial Report] The 18 March edition of the Skopje weekly PULS reports the results of a popularity poll conducted during 11-15 March in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) by the Data Press Agency exclusively for PULS. The survey provides the first indication of public response to leadership changes in the largest Albanian party and is the first poll reported since Greece imposed a blockade on Macedonia's southern border. Methodology The survey was conducted by telephone, using a sample of 300 names chosen from the telephone book, a method which virtually eliminated respondents from rural areas (less than 4 percent of the sample). According to the polling organization Data Press, the respondents are representative of the population in terms of sex, age, and educational background. Seventy-five percent of the respondents are Macedonian, 19 percent are Albanian, 3.33 percent are Serbian, 0.33 percent are Turkish, and 2.33 percent are from other ethnic groups. While three-fourths of the respondents claimed no political affiliation, the rest were members of or were sympathetic to a range of political parties: 12 percent for the Party for Democratic Prosperity and People's Democratic Party (two ethnic Albanian parties that are part of the governing coalition), 4.67 percent for the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (the main party in the governing coalition), 2.67 percent for the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (or VMRO-DPMNE, an opposition party with the largest number of seats in the country's parliament), another 2 percent for the Liberal Party (a member of the governing coalition), and the remaining four percent distributed among the 55 other parties in Macedonia. Data Press's sample includes: 20.67 percent unemployed, 42 percent employed in the state sector, 10.33 percent working in the private sector, 2.33 percent students over age 18, and 24.67 percent retired. The margin of error for this survey was not given. Highlights Only five politicians received 50 percent or better approval ratings: President Kiro Gligorov (85.63 percent), Assembly Chairman Stojan Andov (62 percent), Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski (about 60 percent), Interior Minister Ljubomir Frckovski (51.67 percent), and Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski (about 51 percent). Gligorov and the two Crvenkovskis have maintained their popularity relatively unchanged since a similar poll published by PULS in December 1993. Among the more notable changes for other politicians were: --the continuing decline in popularity of Democratic Party leader Petar Gosev, whose ratings were 52 percent in September 1993, 49.53 percent in December 1993, and 41.67 percent in the most recent poll; --Minister of Defense Vlado Popovski's growing popularity from 18 percent in March 1993 to 35 percent in December 1993 and 48 percent in March. --the increasing prominence of Todor Petrov, an independent parliamentarian and notable critic of the government, who was not even mentioned in the December 1993 poll but who is now viewed favorably by almost half of the survey sample. [See FBIS Foreign Media Note 94-028, 25 February, for details of the earlier PULS polls and an earlier poll conducted by the "BriMa" polling organization, apparently using dissimilar methods.] PULS also noted that, despite the VMRO-DPMNE's negative appraisal of the government's foreign policy, 75 percent of VMRO-DPMNE supporters still viewed Foreign Minister Crvenkovski favorably. The Ethnic Factor In a popularity ranking of political leaders, ethnicity proved to be the most salient factor. Albanian leaders scored high among Albanian respondents and low among non-Albanians, as for example happened to Djeladin [Xheladin] Murati, the leader of one faction of the Albanian Party for Democratic Prosperity, who received 94.74 percent approval from Albanian respondents, but only a 10.22 percent positive rating from non-Albanians. The ethnic factor is also significant in the case of the Macedonian nationalist VMRO-DPMNE representatives. For example, the approval/disapproval ratings for VMRO-DPMNE leader Ljupco Georgievski by ethnicity of the respondents are: Macedonians 20.89/66.67; Albanians 3.51/91.23; Serbs 20/70; Turks 0/100; and other ethnic groups 28.57/57.14. The poll also points to ethnicity as a factor in the ratings of Macedonia's president. Only 42.11 percent of Albanians surveyed gave Gligorov a positive rating, compared to 96 percent of the Macedonians, and nearly 100 percent of the Serbs, Turks, and other ethnic groups. Similarly, Stojan Andov received approval/disapproval ratings of 22.81/54.39 among Albanians. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Approval |Disapproval |No Opinion |Not Recognized| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kiro Gligorov |86 |6 |8 |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Stojan Andov |62 |23 |15 |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Stevo Crvenko-|60 |21 |18 |1 | |vski | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ljubomir Frck-|52 |31 |16 |1 | |ovski | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Branko Crvenk-|51[.sup]1[/]|26[.sup]1[/]|22[.sup]1[/]|1 | |ovs | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vlado Popovski|48[.sup]1[/]|2[.sup]1[/] |17[.sup]1[/]|15[.sup]1[/]| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Todor Petrov |47[.sup]1[/]|4[.sup]1[/] |16[.sup]1[/]|13[.sup]1[/]| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Petar Gosev |42 |42 |16 |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jovan Andonov,|36[.sup]1[/]|14[.sup]1[/]|35[.sup]1[/]|15[.sup]1[/]| | former deput-| | | | | |y prime minis-| | | | | |ter, now mini-| | | | | |ster-coordina-| | | | | |tor | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kiro Popovski,|35 |33 |17[.sup]1[/]|15[.sup]1[/]| | deputy chair-| | | | | |man, parliame-| | | | | |nt | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bekir Zuta, d-|32[.sup]1[/]|31 |20[.sup]1[/]|17[.sup]1[/]| |eputy prime m-| | | | | |inister | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ante Popovski,|30 |28 |22[.sup]1[/]|20[.sup]1[/]| | leader of MA-| | | | | |AK [Movement | | | | | |for All-Maced-| | | | | |onian Action] | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jane Miljovsk-|29 |21 |26 |24 | |i, minister w-| | | | | |ithout portfo-| | | | | |lio; architec-| | | | | |t of privatiz-| | | | | |ation policy | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Djeladin Mura-|27[.sup]1[/]|47 |21[.sup]1[/]|5[.sup]1[/] | |ti | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vladimir Golu-|27 |56 |16 |1 | |bovski, leade-| | | | | |r of VMRO-DP [| | | | | |VMRO-Democrat-| | | | | |ic Party] | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Risto Ivanov, |25 |27 |22 |26 | |former deputy | | | | | |prime minister| | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ljupco Georgi-|18 |71 |11 |-- | |evski | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dosta Dimovsk-|12 |76 |11 |1 | |a, deputy VMR-| | | | | |O-DPMNE leader| | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |[.sup]1[/]The numbers above have been rounded to whole integers. | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |These approximate results were extracted from an imprecisely displayed ba-| |r graph in PULS. | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
