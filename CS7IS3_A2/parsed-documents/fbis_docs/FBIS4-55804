Under the agreement, due to come into force at 6:00 p.m. (1600 GMT) Sunday, the armed Serbs will pull back from a UN-declared three kilometre (two mile) exclusion zone around central Gorazde, UNPROFOR spokesman Major Rob Annink said here. "The Bosnian Serb forces have pledged to redeploy all armed personnel outside the exclusion zone," Annink said. The Serbs also agreed to "cease all hostilities around Gorazde" and guaranteed UNPROFOR "complete freedom of movement" in the zone, he said. UNPROFOR said 150 armed Serbs had remained in Gorazde after the expiry of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ultimatum at the end of April. Serb sources said the men had remained as "policemen" to protect the town's Serb population. Moslem sources said they were soldiers who had changed uniform.
