FBIS4-52409 "dreas090_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-090 Daily Report 7 May 1994 North Korea Kim Yong-sam Remarks on Peace Proposal Denounced Kim Yong-sam Remarks on Peace Proposal Denounced SK0705052094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0506 GMT 7 May 94 SK0705052094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Shameless Utterances Reversing Black and White" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam at "Chongwadae" [presidential offices] on May 4 blared that the North was "engaged in nuclear development" targeted against South Korea and that the North was "violating the truce agreement, not abandoning its ambition for communization of the South". He also slandered the North's recent negotiation proposal vis-a-vis the United States to replace the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement and establish a new peace arrangement. Branding them as shameless remarks reversing black and white, motivated by an intention to slander and harm the North, a news analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says: They who are hell bent on moves to plunge the nation into a holocaust of nuclear war, acting as a shock brigade of outside forces in their "nuclear racket" to isolate and stifle the DPRK, are slandering the North over its "nuclear development" and "attempt at communizing the South". This is the height of folly. Although more than 40 years have passed since the conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the United States is still keeping up its military occupation of South Korea, far from withdrawing from there, and has reinforced its aggression forces in South Korea and ceaselessly staged new war provocation moves against the North together with the South Korean puppets. This itself is a flagrant violation of the Armistice Agreement. It is ridiculous and impudent of the traitor Kim Yong-sam, a colonial puppet without even the military prerogative, to slander and meddle in the North's just negotiation proposal to establish a new peace arrangement which will replace the present armistice body. In slandering the North, the traitor Kim Yong-sam sought to calm down sentiments of the people who turn out in anti-American, anti-"government" struggle and thus defuse his ever worsening ruling crisis. But the truth cannot be concealed and the miserable end of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is inevitable.
