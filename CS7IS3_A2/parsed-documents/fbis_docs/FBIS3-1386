We have on the line a resident from Soweto, Chris Mabuye. Good morning, Mr. Mabuye. What exactly was the problem? [Mabuye] The streets are barricaded, you know, and exits towards the city. [Trudgeon] All the exits? [Mabuye] Most exits. I mean, we have got one, the Main Reef Road, which is from the Potchefstroom highway, which is completely sealed. People have to use the Eldorado Park-Kliptown road to come into town. [Trudgeon] What are they barricaded with, Chris? [Mabuye] Stones, cars, you know, wrecked cars that are broken, and all that. [Trudgeon] What is the reason for this? [Mabuye] The reason is the march for Zulus, marching today. [Trudgeon] And have there been any signs of any tension or trouble or... [Mabuye] Well, a lot of people have been injured. I believe there are two deaths already on the road. [Trudgeon] How did that happen? [Mabuye] One was shot, the other one was hit by a stone. [Trudgeon] So are most commuters then trapped in Soweto at the moment? [Mabuye] Yes. Some are not even able to come out. [Trudgeon] Is there a police presence? [Mabuye] Yes, they have just come in now. [Trudgeon] And what is happing now as I am talking to you? [Mabuye] The people are afraid because of the barricades. They cannot maneuver through the barricades. And another thing is that the Carlton Center, it's like almost what happened in Mafikeng. There's a lot of shooting there, and people are running for their lives. [Trudgeon] Has this just happened this morning? [Mabuye] This morning. [Trudgeon] So it's a surprise to all the residents? [Mabuye] Yes, and we have two buses from Alberton which were -- how do I put it -- were stoned, their windscreens were smashed out. [Trudgeon] And you've no idea who is responsible for this? [Mabuye] It's the youth, black youths that were running amok. [Trudgeon] Thank you, Chris. That's Chris Mabuye, a resident of Soweto. And when contacted, the police confirmed that there were problems in the township, but that details were sketchy at this stage.
