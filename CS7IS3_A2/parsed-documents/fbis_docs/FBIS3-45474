To date, some 1,300 of the 5,000-plus state-owned enterprises in the province have been incorporated into limited liability company or joint stock companies. Over the past year, the number of enterprises which adopted the corporate system has been increasing rapidly. By the end of last year, the province had approved 126 enterprises to become joint stock companies which met the prescribed standards, with a registered capital of more than 8.1 billion yuan. Of the enterprises, six have been listed on the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen and another five will be listed soon. Two of them have floated stocks, which will be listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. At present, there are 1,064 limited liability companies in the province, 40 of which were converted from former state-owned enterprises. In addition, 262 state-owned enterprises have been merged, 310 auctioned and 11 declared bankrupt over the past few years. The aim of defining the property rights is to enable enterprises to meet the requirements of the modern enterprise system instead of to privatize them, an official of the system restructuring commission said. He said that township enterprises, which produce 60 percent of the province's total output, will try the joint stock companies this year.
