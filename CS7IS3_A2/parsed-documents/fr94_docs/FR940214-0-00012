Section 1924.13(e)(1)(iii)(B)( 3 ) and 1924.13(e)(2)(i)(D) Comment: A number of persons suggested that more training be provided to FmHA field staff in analyzing the financial statement to determine whether there is sufficient ``financial strength to carry out all phases of construction.'' Another suggestion was that FmHA require a performance and payment bond from all contractors, in which case the credit worthiness will have been determined by a surety company. Several persons pointed out the fact that credit reports do not reflect the financial strength of the contractor. FmHA response: FmHA has completed phase one of a two phase training program in the proper analysis of financial reports. The training is being conducted by an outside accounting firm and involves State, District, and National Office personnel. We recognize that requiring a payment and performance bond from all contractors would probably eliminate the small yet qualified contractor from participating in the 515 program. Based on the comments that a credit report is not the vehicle through which financial strength can be determined, FmHA will require that each contractor provide a financial statement of its operations. The financial statement will be analyzed to determine if the contractor has the financial strength to pay construction bills prior to obtaining draws from the lender. Language relating to the submission of a financial statement has been added to this section. A credit report will still be required from all contractors. 4. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(iv) and 1924.13(e)(2)(i)(G) Comment: There was some opposition to eliminating the price of cost certifications from the contract. FmHA response: FmHA deleted this cost from this section because it intended to contract for cost certifications itself. This would have eliminated the need for including the cost in the construction contract since they would be paid from Agency funds. It has now been determined that the Agency will be unable to contract for all cost certifications, so the previous language pertaining to cost certification expenses has been restored to this section to cover those situations where the borrower will be required by FmHA to obtain the certification. 5. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v) and 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(E) Comment: Several persons agreed with the proposal that FmHA contract directly for cost certifications. The most consistently expressed concern was about the delay in the Government contracting process, resulting in increased interim interest expense. There was also some concern about the burden this proposal would place on FmHA. There was a suggestion to have FmHA contract with a CPA to review and/or audit a certain percentage of the cost certifications within the State each year. Also, one person suggested that FmHA allow contracts between the CPA and the contractor when the CPA can certify that he/she has no other relationship with the contractor except for the cost certification. Comments from other persons stated that the ongoing working relationship between the borrower and the CPA is a definite advantage since the CPA is familiar with the accounting system and procedures of the borrower. They felt that having full-time access to the CPA who is responsible for monitoring the construction cost recording process would allow for timely maintenance of records. An FmHA-contracted auditor would not have this familiarity with the borrower's books. One respondent suggested that FmHA publish a guide to tell CPA's how FmHA wants the cost certifications performed and reported. One suggestion is that instead of contracting for cost certifications directly, FmHA should strengthen its ability to debar an incompetent CPA. Another respondent suggested that FmHA establish a list of CPA's who have been designated as acceptable for cost certification. One suggestion was that FmHA make a judgment of whether the borrower's cost certification is satisfactory instead of hiring the CPA directly. FmHA response: FmHA has worked with the Office of Inspector General to develop an audit program which CPA's will follow in performing cost certification audits. During recent OIG audits of cost certifications prepared on FmHA-financed rental housing projects, it was discovered that many CPA's were not maintaining the independence required by generally accepted auditing standards. It is obvious from some of the comments that some CPA's who are cost certifying construction costs have also been involved in the maintenance of the borrowers' construction records. FmHA will not have sufficient contracting funds to cover the cost of all certifications; therefore, it anticipates contracting for all certifications on loans of $1.5 million and over and a random sampling of all other loans. Details will have to be worked out in the contracting process to prevent undue delay in closing loans. In the event FmHA does contract for a cost certification, the borrower will not be responsible for providing a certification since that would duplicate energies and expenses. Any funds earmarked in the loan for cost certification but which are not needed because of an FmHA-contracted certification will be returned on the loan and may not be used for any other purpose. 6. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(A) Comment: There was some confusion about whether FmHA would be contracting with the CPA who examines the borrower's accounting system or just with the CPA who performs the cost certification. A suggestion was offered that the borrower provide a written assertion that it has an accounting system which complies with the regulations. The cost certification CPA would then report on the validity of the assertion.
