"We were not able to obtain from Azerbaijan official recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is a partner to the conflict side, but attempts in this direction will continue", said a senior officials of the Russian Parliament in his conversation with a TURAN correspondent. The same source notes that Moscow will do its best to achieve this purpose and "will use means not only of a diplomatic character." According to information made available to TURAN's correspondent in Moscow by Russian Parliament sources, in Bishkek's document a cease fire from midnight on 8 May is provided for, whence after the fighting sides will cease military actions in the region. A de-blockading of energy-transportation communications together with the separation of troops is also included in the provisions. In the Bishkek document, the term "fighting sides" means only Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. In the protocol there lacks a concrete definition of the mechanism which provides for the return of hundreds of thousands of Azeri refugees to their homes. In the document there is also an appeal to the CIS about sending peace making forces of the CIS to the conflict area. According to TURAN, Azerbaijan refused to sign the Bishkek document because the Bishkek document does not consider the total withdrawal by Armenian units from Azeri-occupied territories. Rather is only the separation of sides along the frontline. Another reason for Azerbaijan's non-signing is because the protocol envisages the stationing of supervisory posts of Russian army in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan thinks that the location of separation forces can be achieved only after the liberation of all occupied territories. The protocol also calls for the creation of a security zone, which in fact spans the territory of western Azerbaijan from the Kura River to the Araks River. Azerbaijan will have less control over this territory, thereby forcing Baku to reconcile its loss of control over this part of the territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh. Another main point raised during this meeting was the refusal to permit the Azeri representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh to be a separate participant in the negotiations surrounding the Bishkek document. Neither the Russians, nor the Armenians want to allow the Azeri representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh to participate in the negotiations as a separate entity. "If the right to sign the document is conceded to Armenian community of Nagorno-Karabakh, then the same right should be given to the Azerbaijan community of Nagorno-Karabakh whose leader is Shusha's Mayor Nizami Bakhmanov," said Afiaddin Dzhalilov, the vice-speaker of the Azerbaijani Parliament. The Azerbaijani delegation also stated that the proposed document does not reflect the fact that Azeri territory is "occupied." There is only mention that these territories have been "captured." According to Dzhalilov, such an interpretation is a misrepresentation of the political and legal nature of the conflict. The next meeting for the regulation of the conflict will be held in St Petersburg.
