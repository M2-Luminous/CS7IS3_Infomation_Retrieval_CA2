He told parliament on Tuesday that the decree, allowing the free sale and purchase of land, among other things, meets all key provisions in the legislation on land, for instance limiting the term of private land tenure to 49 years. Akayev denied "rumors being spread in the press and society" that the decree allows land to be sold to foreigners. It gives the right to buy land to citizens of Kyrgyzstan only, he said. At a government meeting on Tuesday, he reaffirmed that more radical economic reforms were his government's main task. He also urged stronger government at all levels. As one of the measures to achieve that purpose, the president, according to his spokesman Iman Rysaliyev, proposed strengthening akimat, the system of local government bodies headed by akims (governors). Akayev denied that there is any connection between the falling production and the crisis of the political system in Kyrgyzstan. He said that, despite all the difficulties the economic reforms had brought about, some achievements had been made, primarily in monetary policy. Thus, last month the inflation rate went down to 5 percent and the prices stabilized. Akayev said the main economic goal was to produce within Kyrgyzstan at least 90 percent of the raw materials the country's industry needs. He also called for an end to political speculations about Kyrgyzstan's gold industry. He insisted that the government take urgent measures to ensure that foreign companies, notably Canadian and American, at last start developing the country's gold fields. IF Note: The Kyrgyz Government, on Akayev's instructions, recently approved a gold industry program spanning a period until the year 2010. The program, called The Gold of Kyrgyzstan, gives technical and economic information on more than 60 gold deposits, 16 of which are ready to be developed. Development of more than 60 percent of deposits is to be funded by investment made by joint ventures to be formed with companies both from former Soviet and other countries.
