However, the economic situation is terrible. Is your experiment doomed to fail? [Barzani] We cannot enjoy our freedom without a functioning economy. I am afraid that the Kurds will soon flee again to other countries in masses. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Do you want to threaten the friendly allies, who protect you, with this? [Barzani] No. But if the misery here increases, the people will again move to Iran or to Turkey -- or perhaps even to the south. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] To Saddam Husayn's Iraq? [Barzani] If the people are starving.... [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] The UN economic embargo against Iraq also hits you, because, despite its autonomy, Kurdistan continues to be Iraqi territory. [Barzani] Yes. I have asked the United States several times to lift the embargo against us. The answer always was: We know that you are not involved in Saddam's criminal acts, we will continue to talk about that. But nothing has happened. There is a lot of Iraqi money abroad. We have demanded that some of this frozen money is given to us -- in vain. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Are you in favor of lifting the embargo against Iraq in general? [Barzani] It is of no advantage to us that the Iraqi people suffer. If the embargo were lifted under UN control, and if the sale of Iraqi oil benefited the people in the country and not the regime, we would be in favor of it. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Iraqi Kurdistan is protected against Saddam Husayn's attacks by the Allies. Every six months, the question of the protection zone is decided anew. Does this not create uncertainty? [Barzani] Our situation is like that of a person sentenced to death waiting for execution in his cell. The period of protection is again and again extended, of course. However, the uncertain wait has fatal psychological effects on the population. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Until 1992 you negotiated with Saddam Husayn. Then the talks were suspended. Can you envisage a resumption? [Barzani] Actually, we only want to negotiate with a democratic government. But if the Kurdish people are threatened with destruction..., then negotiations with Baghdad will perhaps be necessary. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Do you really believe that Saddam Husayn will be overthrown? [Barzani] This is not so simple. Thirty states were unable to overthrow Saddam. But I believe that he is suffering from the international isolation. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] A colorful Iraqi opposition front, which is mainly active in exile, presents itself as an alternative to dictatorship. Your party is part of it. Is this opposition mature enough to take over the government if Saddam is toppled? [Barzani] No matter how I assess the opposition's political maturity -- we do not have anything else.
