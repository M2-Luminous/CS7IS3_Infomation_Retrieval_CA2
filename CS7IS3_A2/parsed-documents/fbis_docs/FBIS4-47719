FBIS4-47719 "drafr084_cs94003" FBIS-AFR-94-084-S Daily Report 1 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Early Results Reviewed Early Results Reviewed MB0205053594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 2243 GMT 1 May 94 MB0205053594 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- The African National Congress was on Monday [2 May] morning headed for victory in South Africa's first all-race election, but conceded it had lost to the National Party in the Western Cape. Based on provisional results received form the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] by 12.30AM on Monday , when more than five million votes had been counted, it also appeared unlikely the ANC would capture the two-thirds majority which the party's opponents say it requires to write its own constitution. The ANC led the National Assembly vote count with 2,816,816 or 55 per cent, followed by the NP [National Party] with 1,584,367 or 30.9 per cent. In another development the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] appeared headed for elegibility for inclusion in the Government of National Unity, having captured over five per cent of the vote for the National Assembly. ANC Information Secretary Dr Pallo Jordan told a Johannesburg news conference on Sunday evening his party expected to win at least 58 per cent of the national vote. The results up to Sunday evening showed three patterns: majority support for the ANC nationally and in seven of the nine provinces, majority support for the NP in the Western Cape, and a strong showing by the Inkatha Freedom Party in Natal/KwaZulu. In the National Assembly vote, the IFP edged into third place with 260,357 or 5.1 per cent, overtaking both the Freedom Front [FF] of Gen Constand Viljoen during the course of the day's counting and the Democratic Party [DP ]. The FF had 3.5 per cent with 180,146 votes and the DP 2.6 per cent or 131,284 votes. They were followed by the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] with 1.2 per cent and the African Christian Democratic Party with 0.6 per cent. All the other parties had less than 0.5 per cent of the total votes counted. In the Western Cape, where political parties vied for the support of the majority coloured population, NP premiership candidate Hernus Kriel looked set to become the first NP leader to secure a top position under the interim constitution. The NP had 57.6 per cent and the ANC 25.1 per cent. In KwaZulu/Natal the IFP was leading with 47.3 per cent. The ANC followed with 33.8 per cent. In the other seven provinces, the ANC took the lead with generally large majorities. The coloured vote appeared not to come to the rescue of the NP in the Northern Cape, where the ANC had 49.8 per cent followed by the NP with 38.4 per cent. In other provinces, the ANC's lead was even bigger. The NP failed to realise earlier hopes of a strong showing in the Orange Free State where the ANC had 67.8 per cent and the NP 13.1 per cent. In North West Province, which includes much of the former Bophuthatswana homeland, the ANC had 72.6 per cent, the NP had 15.3 per cent and the FF 9.2 per cent. In the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], said to be an ANC stronghold, the NP was making a strong showing with 24.8 per cent of the vote, holding the ANC down to 51.5 per cent. The FF was third with 7.1 per cent and the DP fourth also with 7.1 per cent. In the Eastern Transvaal, the ANC had a majority of 74.5 per cent. In the Eastern Cape, the ANC 65.7 per cent of the votes counted, followed by the NP with 22.7 per cent. In the Northern Transvaal, the ANC led with 79.3 per cent followed by the NP with 8.9 per cent. The showing of the FF could see it offered a cabinet position in a new Government of National Unity. The DP's position looked less secure. Reports of electoral irregularities mounted. They included the discovery of hundreds of thousands of unused ballot papers hidden in warehouses on the East and West Rand and the use of "pirate voting stations" in the Durban area. In a statement later on Sunday, the IEC said the investigation into missing ballot papers and distribution mechanisms in the PWV would soon be completed and the results would be made public. An IEC investigation team, led by attorneys, was working with the SA Police, after IEC Monitoring Directorate Chief Director Peter Harris ordered the probe on Wednesday April 27 when it was discovered thousands of papers were missing. Search warrants had been issued and a number of people would be questioned, the IEC statement said. In spite of irregularities, which NP leader Mr F W de Klerk described as "widespread," counting went ahead slowly in hundreds of counting stations across the country. IEC officials said they hoped to be in a position to issue full provisional results on monday night. The IEC estimated South Africa's electoral population at 22.5 million, which meant about 17 million votes had yet to be considered. Four major counting centres, Umtata, Durban, Pretoria and Nasrec (Johannesburg) -- representing the largest slice of the election results -- all reported massive backlogs and were running way behind schedule. At Durban counting was retarded or was not proceeding at 32 of 60 counting centres. A crisis team had been sent to deal with the problem. In the entire KwaZulu/Natal Province, only 10 of the 106 stations had completed counting. At Umtata only six of the 61 stations had completed counting, 50 were counting and two were still reconciling ballots votes. In Eastern Cape province, of which Transkei and Ciskei are a part, 28 of 107 stations had finished counting. At Pretoria counting only started late on Sunday night and at Nasrec counting officers were still unsure of procedure and monitors were assisting with the process. vereeniging reported nine per cent complete, the West Rand 52 per cent, East Rand 47 per cent and Johannesburg 15 per cent. All told, 24.6 per cent of the counting at the PWV's 141 stations had been completed. In the Northern Transvaal, where counting started late, only 11 of 38 centres had completed their work. Progress at other regions was better: in the Western Cape 48 centres out of 58 had completed counting; in the Orange Free State 49 of the 75 centres were complete; the North West 37 out of 49; Eastern Transvaal 36 of 47; and the Northern Cape, 20 out of 32. Foreign voting at the DHL warehouse at Isando was reported as still proceeding very slowly.
