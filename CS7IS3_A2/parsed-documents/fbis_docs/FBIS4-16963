The article deals with the allegedly worked out plans of landing Ukrainian troops in Kuban and the Don [river]. Other so-called instances of the production of various kinds of weapons here [in Ukraine] are provided in the article. Tarasyuk referred to this article as an outright provocative lie by the Moscow-based newspaper. According to him, this refers, in particular, to information about the production of tactical missiles at PivdenMash [southern machine-building plant in Dnepropetrovsk] and work on manufacturing binary, chemical, and bacteriological weapons allegedly under way here in Ukraine. The deputy foreign minister reminded in this connection that our state is a signatory of the convention banning the above weapons and it strictly abides by its provisions. In Tarasyuk's opinion, such publications prove that KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA probably takes an active part in fanning up anti-Ukrainian sentiments in Russian society and tries to undermine the process of normalizing relations between the two neighboring states.
