Berlusconi is entering the arena -- now that [Pact for Italy leader] Segni has eaten humble pie and returned to [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli -- and acting as a link between [National Alliance leader] Fini and [League Secretary] Bossi, to bring under the same banner the troops of the National Alliance deployed in the South and the army of the League that commands the North. The plan -- which also embraces the members of D'Onofrio's and Casini's "Christian Democratic Renaissance" is, as expected, about to acquire a "post-fascist" black tinge imparted by Gianfranco Fini. In fact an electoral agreement is apparently ready, though the people concerned are officially denying it. "The situation is fluid and in flux," according to Maurizio Gaspari, co-editor of IL SECOLO D'ITALIA, "but there is a willingness to come to an agreement, even though the League is dominated by Bossi...." Roberto Maroni, the League's lower house floor leader, was cautious on the subject of portioning agreements in a statement issued by the press bureau. However, there were rumors in parliament that "technical" negotiations have already reached an advanced stage, that there is a pact to divide electoral Italy between the forces under Berlusconi's umbrella. The Social Movement [MSI] -- or, rather, the National Alliance [AN] -- which does not command huge support in the North, would stand aside: According to these rumors, the MSI candidates would not contest the northern constituencies. So all Fini's votes would go to the League, the Berlusconi Alliance's tank regiment in the Po Valley and the surrounding area, which will not relinquish its own symbol. What would the MSI receive in return? A free hand in central and southern Italy. Here the League is virtually nonexistent, but the AN would receive a shot in the arm from Berlusconi's supporters. This, through agreements in individual constituencies whereby backing would be granted either to the MSI candidate or to the Forza Italia candidate. Fini would be left with the traditionally strongest areas -- Naples and other southern cities, for instance. Elsewhere, the lists would be headed by Berlusconi and in some instances by Mastella's CCD [Democratic Christian Center]. In these places the postfascists, Forza Italia, and the CCD might share the same symbol -- a new one created for the occasion. As for the proportional quota, however, there would be no constraints, and each one would compete under their own symbol. But this "four-way" contest will be won and lost in the first-past-the-post poll. Technical agreements may change and the elaborate arrangements for the constituencies could be modified, but it is Berlusconi who is the alignment's political guarantor. Gianfranco Fini is pleased with Berlusconi's self-investiture speech: "I agree with what he says and also with his direct involvement in politics." On the eve of his party's congress, the MSI secretary expressed the hope that "his entry into the front that commands a majority in the country and that stands in opposition to the left will not cause further splits among the moderates, because if so, it would certainly please [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto." So everyone is united. Yesterday Fini drew closer to the refugees from the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the "extremists" of the CCD, in talks lasting an hour at the MSI's offices at Montecitorio [lower house] with Pierferdinando Casini, Clemente Mastella, and Francesco D'Onofrio. The AN was also represented by Giuseppe Tatarella, the MSI's floor leader. "We are watching the evolution of the AN with great interest," Casini said. "We have urged a more rapid process of revision and, at the same time, have reaffirmed our desire for a constitutionalization of the right." Berlusconi had already reached an agreement with the MSI leader in the local elections, having publicly declared that he would be voting for him. And this fellow-feeling, despite some ups and downs, has continued, through the convention, the MSI's change of course, and Fini's tribute at the Fosse Ardeatine. What about the League? Bossi's solemn and unyielding rejection of the right could prove to be worth as much as his insults to Segni, which were followed by a handshake, which has itself now given way to further threats against Segni. In other words, yesterday's enemies could become today's traveling companions on the road to 27 March. Then there is Berlusconi, the heart of the entire operation, who is opening up to Fini. As pointed out by Valerio Zanone, the former Liberal secretary now a member of Segni's alignment, who considers mistaken "the confidence placed in the AN, it is necessary to set our sights on the center, not on extreme positions." Yes, there is a new political factor, as ACLI [Christian Associations of Italian Workers] Chairman Giovanni Bianchi said: "Berlusconi is introducing into the political scene his ability to bring Bossi and Fini together, to act as a bridge between the armies of the League in the North and those of the AN in the South...."
