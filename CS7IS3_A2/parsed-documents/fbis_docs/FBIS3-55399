He told INTERFAX that "these documents enable Moldova and Transdniestria to do business with former Soviet republics." Marakutsa emphasized that "Transdniestria wants Moldova to sign the collective security treaty, which it refused to do." In his view, the Transdniestrian conflict cannot be resolved unless Moldova, Transdniestria and Gagauzia make a federation or confederation within the framework of the former Moldovan SSR. "Everybody, notably Ukraine and Russia, wants the existing borders of Moldova to be preserved while its internal structure is the republic's internal affair," he said. Marakutsa ruled out the possibility of handing over the Ilascu group convicted by the Tiraspol court to Moldova. In early December 1993, the TMR Supreme Court sentenced Ilie Ilascu, the leader of the Tiraspol branch of the Moldovan Christian Democratic Popular Front, to death on charges of terrorism while his five comrades were sentenced to different prison terms. "In Kishinev, Ilascu and his men are regarded as patriots, not terrorists," Marakutsa said. "For this reason we are not sure that a new trial will take place there." He said that Transdniestria would welcome a retrial by an independent court with Russian or Ukrainian judges. Marakutsa denied reports that he pressed for resignation of Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th Russian Army. "We have different political views on numerous problems but this does not imply that one of us should resign," he said.
