FBIS4-48754 "drafr102_c_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-102 Daily Report 25 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Senate Members Discuss Mandela Address Senate Members Discuss Mandela Address MB2505172894 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1621 GMT 25 May 94 MB2505172894 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Senate May 25 SAPA -- The first sitting of the Senate on Wednesday was marked by parties united in their praise for the president's opening address to Parliament, but also sober reminders of the task at hand. First on the speaker's list was Senator Arulsivanathan Naidoo (NP [National Party]), who praised President Mr Nelson Mandela as a remarkable man while saying his predecessor, Mr F W de Klerk, deserved the nation's gratitude for his vision and courage. The NP was committed to the government of national unity and would co-operate with all parties. The first ANC speaker, Mr Simon Makana, said he had been given "a great opportunity to break the ice on our side". Mr Mandela had outlined the enormous task of social emancipation, one which could only be brought about by economic growth based in a politically stable society. A first priority was a national campaign, harnessing both the armed security forces and the public, to stop the bloodshed. [Orange] Free-Stater Mrs Isabella Direko (ANC) smilingly remarked that she and the president of the Senate, Mr Kobie Coetsee, shared the same provincial roots. She said children deserved the right to nutrition for full physical and mental development. Youth development had to be made a national priority. "An empty stomach results in an empty and unreasonable mind." The 2.5 million marginalised African children had to be reincorporated into society. "We dare not give them up as the lost generation. I am sure they have ambitions and desires." Mr Stephanus Grove (ANC) said the courts were prohibitively expensive and out of reach to people who most needed them to exercise their new rights. The government of national unity should appoint a commission of inquiry to investigate rights' matters being heard by magistrates, lawyers' rights of appearance in supreme courts, a review of the legal aid mean's test and setting up a legal fund similar to medical aid. Mrs R Rabinowitz (IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]) appealed for openness in the government of national unity, with "no more deals, unilateral decisions and domination from the centre". Devolution of powers should be encouraged, with people being empowered to understand the costs of population growth, as well as take pride in education and work in a culture of equal opportunity. Dr Siyabonga Cwele (ANC) said nutritional education and breastfeeding were necessary. Mr Mohamed Surty (ANC) said Parliament should be stripped of symbols of oppression. Mr David Malatsi (NP) said people should be encouraged to pay for services like electrification and be discouraged from persisting with a boycott culture. Water conservation also had to be encouraged. Mr Holoma Lebona (ANC) said the dual exchange system was creating great economic harm and as long as it existed there would not be economic recovery. He also called for an inquiry into the origins of the reserve bank. Mrs Yolanda Botha (ANC) said the state should contract work to small businesses, encourage co-operatives and the use of modern technology to stimulate job-creation. Maj-Gen Tienie Groenewald (Freedom Front [FF]) said the past few days had been a "fantastic experience". "What impressed most was the spirit of how senators and parliamentarians approached their jobs." The FF had listened to Mr Mandela's speech with great expectation. His party would not play a negative role or embark on political boycotts. "We will make a very positive contribution to the new South Africa in which the different nations can live in peace..." The government did, however, have to ask if the RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program] did not create unreasonable expectations.
