Reports even say that Portuguese police are preparing to compete with Spanish in the training of personnel and, if possible, to reequip the MPLA-PT's Riot Police. The Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel learned from reliable sources today that a Portuguese National Republican Guard, GNR, team made up of two senior officers visited Luanda earlier this month to discuss concrete cooperation proposals. This source also disclosed that (?10) MPLA-PT policemen left for the Portuguese capital soon afterward and are currently undergoing training at the GNR Training Center. Observers believe that Portugal and Spain are already involved in a war of influence over the Angolan police force. One thing is certain: In the midst of all this, the Angolan people do not have food, but they can now count on a beefed-up police corps, which should ensure intensified intimidation and repression.
