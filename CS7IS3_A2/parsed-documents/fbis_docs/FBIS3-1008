"Not so. A strong Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] gives the White Right a vehicle for presenting its volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] aspirations. If that vehicle breaks down, the Rights cause is harmed, and that can spell trouble, since a frustrated people will turn to violence as the only means of achieving their objectives. Besides, General Viljoen [leader of the Freedom Front], though he blew hot and cold over armed resistance, was able to keep the extreme Right in check, and this is no longer possible." Call for Freedom Front To Outline Party Platform -- Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 16 March in its page-6 editorial notes that the Freedom Front is "gearing itself for the election." But, "other than being against the National Party [NP] and against the ANC [African National Congress], for a volkstaat but against violence, except as a last resort, to achieve one, for taking part in the election and against sitting on the sidelines, Gen Viljoen has not expressed one political idea that could be regarded as the basis of a party platform." "The sooner the front outlines its platform, the better it will fare at the polls." THE STAR TEC Must Address Civil Servants Concerns -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 17 March in a page-18 editorial commends the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) for the speed with which they moved "to allay the fears and concerns of civil servants, especially those employed by the various homeland administrations." The TEC has resolved to establish a task force "to defuse the crisis which is building up in the homelands." The TEC must ensure that its task force "does not become a forum for political point-scoring, and that it works speedily to address the concerns of all civil servants, including those working in the rest of South Africa. There is a real threat of widespread civil service turmoil, which could harm the transition process and even the election itself." SOWETAN Complications in Planned Mandela-Zwelithini Meeting -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 17 March in a page-8 editorial refers to the meeting between Nelson Mandela and Zulu King Zwelithini scheduled for 18 March, saying two things complicate it: "the imbizo, that is the call to the king's subjects to accompany him to the meeting, as well as the venue, the grounds of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly. When the king met State President F.W. de Klerk in Durban recently, he was accompanied by an estimated 60,000 subjects. More can be expected in the heart of KwaZulu." "The wrong word or the wrong gesture could cost this country dearly." CAPE TIMES SACP Influential Role in Power-Sharing Government Unlikely -- On page 6 of Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 14 March, Colin Legum comments in his "Election Notebook" column on the National Party's "relentless warning that a future ANC government will, in fact, be masterminded by communists." But Legum believes that the South African Communist Party (SACP) "is unlikely to play an influential role in a power-sharing government between itself, the ANC, NP and one or two smaller parties." "For the foreseeable future, it is the ANC that will wag its communist appendage rather than the other way around. The differences between the ANC and SACP are likely to increase, not to diminish. The ANC's future preoccupation in retaining the support of the black youth is going to be with the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) which has a history of hostility to the communists. Sadly, a more sophisticated analysis of the relationship between the ANC and SACP finds no place in the emotional climate engendered by the NP's `red scare' propaganda." BEELD Bophuthatswana Unrest Brought Necessary Change -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 14 March argues in a page-8 editorial: "A shocking event is sometimes necessary to bring necessary change. A few dramatic days in Bophuthatswana made sure of that. Many things changed irrevocably. First, the rule of Lucas Mangope came to an end. South Africa is again in control of this teritory, which at one stage was the leading light among the national states. Bophuthatswana is part of South Africa again, but it could have happened with less trauma and loss of life..." "Second, it was demonstrated clearly that the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] cannot be anyone's knight in shining armor. The organization carried its racism and indiscipline into an explosive situation and made matters worse. If their members believed they were going to be received as heroes, they suffered a rude awakening when they saw how unwelcome they were. Eventually they had to leave in disgrace. We can only hope that the AWB invasion represents the final kicks of the era of mercenaries and white armed interference in black affairs." "The events in Bophuthatswana also served as an election catalyst. The on-going row in the Conservative Party [CP] and the Afrikaner National Front has suddenly been resolved: General Constand Viljoen and a group of moderates decided participation is a much more constructive option than boycotts and armed protest." "The position of Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg is on the line. Since he became leader of the CP, he has led his party deeper into the desert. He and the AWB leader are the ones who started the war talk. Does he realize, after the events in Bophuthatswana, just what war is? Surely the right wing cannot have such a death wish that they prefer war above honorable negotiation. The people in the CP and other organizations must urgently reconsider and decide whether they need a change of leaders and policies. We have not the slightest doubt what the answer ought to be."
