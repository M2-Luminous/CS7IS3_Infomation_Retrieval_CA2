FBIS4-11440 "drlat082_c_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-082 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 MEXICO Salinas Creates Public Security Coordinating Board Salinas Creates Public Security Coordinating Board PA2704121694 Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 26 Apr 94 PA2704121694 Mexico City XEW Television Network Spanish BFN [From the "24 Hours" newscast] [Text] On 25 April, Mexican President Carlos Salinas created the Coordinating Board for the Nation's Public Security [Coordinacion de Seguridad Publica de la Nacion] to improve efficiency in the operations of institutions involved in national public security, to carry out preventive actions, and to pursue crimes. Its coordinator will be Arsenio Farell Cubillas, who until today was the secretary of labor and social welfare. The coordinating board will be under the Presidency of the republic. The board will coordinate national public security matters determined by the executive, and it will establish coordination mechanisms with the Attorney General's Office of the republic and the Attorney General's Office of the Federal District to increase their efficiency. This coordinating board will propose the establishment of efficient and timely channels of communication among the Secretariats of Government, National Defense, and the Navy, as well as the Federal District Department to safeguard public security. This board will propose and reach coordination agreements with the states' attorney general's offices for the same purpose. This decision by the chief executive, which was revealed hours ago, states that the situation facing Mexico underscores the need to coordinate the actions of the national public security corps and the need to improve their prevention and pursuance of crimes. It adds that society in general demands that the government redouble actions against impunity and the violation of public order, while respecting human rights. This board will start operating tomorrow. The National Security Cabinet met at the Los Pinos Presidential Residence. The meeting was attended by the secretaries of government and national defense, chief of the Federal District Department, the republic's attorney general, the district's attorney general, director general of the Center for National Research and Security, and the chief of the presidential office. This information is contained in a bulletin issued on the evening of 25 April. We think it is evident that the work done by existing institutions is insufficient in view of the magnitude of the challenge posed by the criminals. The institution that was born today is a sort of super-attorney general's office with the size demanded by society as a result of the growing problems posed by crime and violence. President Salinas thus reacted to a public demand, a demand from society to fight vigorously against impunity, organized crime, and the proliferation of weapons because everyone bears pistols here. The presence of Arsenio Farell as coordinator is a guarantee. He was born in Mexico City in 1921. He earned a Bachelor and Doctorates Degree at the National University's Law School. He is a litigant lawyer, professor, public official, and author. Farell is qualified for this new post. He has what one expects of a coordinator: firmness and vigor, respect for the law, and respect for its enforcement. We expect him to comply with and to ensure compliance with the law.
