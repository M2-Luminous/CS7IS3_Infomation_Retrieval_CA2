Moscow Keeps Calm"] [Text] Vice Premier C. Purebdorj said that NATO "is not an aggressive alliance" today. In the vice premier's opinion, most speedy rapprochement with NATO "would have a positive impact on strengthening Mongolia's national security as it makes the transition to a democratic society." C. Purebdorj told correspondents that a large group of NATO experts is due to come to Ulaanbaatar this summer for the first time "to establish contacts and hold consultations on national security questions." In the opinion of Russian Foreign Ministry experts, the Mongolians' view of the North Atlantic bloc is by and large the result of a positive attitude to the decisions adopted at the last NATO session, in particular, the "Partnership for Peace" program. IZVESTIYA was told that diplomats in Moscow have not got a complex over this. The European Parliament Commission recently heard a report on the situation in Mongolia advocating an exchange of representatives and the organization of dialogue with the Great Hural. The Europeans decided on the advisability of granting most-favored-nation status for imports of Mongolian goods to the West and also of concluding a partnership treaty. We learned from diplomatic sources in Moscow that Mongolian banks have already received 8 million European Currency Units from Europe within the framework of the so-called "TACIS" economic aid program.
