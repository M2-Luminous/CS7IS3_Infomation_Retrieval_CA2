How did the "labor market" change into a "market for the work force"? Is there any difference between the two? A market for work force is a new employment mechanism. Instead of adopting administrative means to directly control the distribution and flow of the work force, the state will allow enterprises to independently employ workers and the workers to chose their employers. The biggest difference between a market for the work force and a labor market is that the former is a new type of employment mechanism while the latter is merely a labor or information exchange. Zhejiang's Wenzhou, one of the cities in China which took the lead in developing a market economy, also marched ahead of others in developing a market for the work force. Wenzhou implemented an "enterprise staff system" in 1992, regarding all employed laborers in the city as enterprise workers. The ownership of the enterprises where they worked could be different, but the workers enjoyed the same status, irrespective of their positions. All kinds of enterprises could issue rules for employment in the market for the work force. When the workers are employed, they only have to go through the procedures of signing the contract and insurance. Workers could also flow between enterprises of different ownership, with the approval of both sides. They only had to transfer their insurance at the social insurance office. The administrative departments here no longer exercised direct control over distribution of laborers or restricted their identity. The workers enterprises wanted and the jobs the workers looked for were all realized through market competition. This is the basic characteristic of employment in a market for the work force. In the market for the work force, the flow of workers is not conditioned by ownership. Instead, it is guided by wages (influenced by the price of laborers). Beginning from 1992, a "reverse flow" of laborers appeared for the first time in Wenzhou since the founding of the PRC. In two years, more than 3,000 workers from state and collective enterprises resigned and found jobs in township, individual, and private enterprises. One of the reasons is that they were "better paid there." Some people were not willing to go to individual and private enterprises because "these enterprises merely took care of the young but not the old." Retirement pensions were an essential condition related to social insurance for developing a market for the work force. In view of this, Wenzhou implemented an integrated social insurance system commencing in 1991. Laborers employed in Wenzhou, whether they belonged to state, collective, neighborhood, township, private, individual, or foreign-funded enterprises or were self-employed workers, all joined the social insurance and employment insurance plan. By paying the same amount of premium, they enjoyed the same retirement pension. Because of this, some 200,000 salesmen from Wenzhou went to other parts of the country while around 400,000 people came to Wenzhou to look for jobs. The development of a market for the work force will exert a great influence on labor reform and economic structural reform as a whole. It will also have an impact on people's sense of employment and value. The formulation of a market for the work force will exert a significant and far-reaching influence on China's labor reform. The conference of heads of the labor departments and bureaus, a high level meeting on the country's labor work, held in December 1993, proposed for the first time that reform of the labor system as a whole should focus on nurturing and developing a market for the work force. In the reform of the labor system in the past, the development of a labor market constituted only part of the work. China's largest special economic zone, Hainan, enjoys a high degree of freedom in employment, and was once a "popular place" for employment. The Hainan Provincial Government promulgated a document in 1992, which clearly stipulated: Competent government departments will no longer assign quotas of cadre employment, staff recruitment, technical title assessment, and wages and promotion. These problems will be resolved by the employer and the employee at the labor exchange. To develop a market for the work force, an official of the Labor Ministry said, competent government departments must change their functions and reform their organs and working methods. Hainan has taken a lead in this regard. The development of a market for the work force is required for deepening enterprise reform. In turn, it also promotes deepened reform and a change in enterprise operation mechanisms. To let enterprises enter the market, it is necessary for them to independently recruit staff and implement a unified social insurance system. To practice a new employment mechanism, it is also necessary for enterprises to accelerate reform of the labor system, such as implementing the all-personnel labor contract system, optimizing labor combinations, removing the demarcation line that separates cadres from workers, introducing distribution reform, and letting society absorb redundant personnel. To develop a market for the work force, an increasing number of people will have to get their jobs through competition and very few will be able to find jobs through mandatory orders. Naturally the mentality of urban people having a secure job and the sense of instinctive superiority of state enterprises should change gradually. In employment, the principle of distribution has been replaced by the principle of competition and the phenomenon of "sharing secure jobs" has been changed to "vying for a secure job." People's sense of employment and value will change along with the development of a market for the work force, and the earlier they adapt themselves to the new employment mechanism, the earlier they can gain the initiative. An economist said: A foreign businessman asked him about Chinese officials, who are called servants while the workers, masters. But the officials sit in cars while the workers drive. How come the master drives for the servant? The economist replied: The status of master refers to the working class as a whole, not a specific individual. This story tells us that foreign people do not understand China's national conditions. However, it reminds us that the problems which crop up in reform should be resolved by more work and fewer disputes rather than arguing first about the truth. The formulation of a market for the work force will exert influence on concepts at the deeper layer. We need the spirit of doing more work. A market for the work force is complicated system engineering. The Labor Ministry predicts that the embryonic form of a modern market for the work force will need seven years to take shape. The development of a market for the work force can breakthrough the demarcation line between urban and rural areas and allow free flow of laborers. It is a piece of good news for surplus laborers in rural areas because they can enter the cities. Nevertheless, such a situation will not likely appear within the near future. This is because the the work force market has just started and it is still at the initial stage. Moreover, it is impossible for China's urban areas to absorb large numbers of surplus rural laborers at present. Hence, it is a relatively long-term objective. Development of a the work force market is complicated system engineering which includes the whole course of laborers seeking jobs, introduction, signing contracts, employment, terminating contracts, reemployment, and retirement. The establishment of a new employment mechanism of free selection of staff and employers involves reform of government functions, and social insurance, distribution, personnel, and household registration systems. However, the deepening and completion of these reforms cannot be done overnight. There are difficulties at least in the following five respects for the development of the market for the work force at present: While selecting a job, laborers are still restricted by status and ownership, state enterprises still cannot independently employ workers, the main redundant personnel are not brought into line with social settlement, and a certain number of personnel are placed by the state; in income distribution and wages, total payroll of a considerable number of state enterprises is still under administrative control and a new enterprise wage increase mechanism has not yet taken shape; in social insurance, there is a lack of a unified management system and the coverage and its extent of socialization are limited, which cannot meet the needs of enterprises entering the market and flow of the work force; market regulations are still imperfect and there is a lack of means for maintaining market order; and in macroeconomic control and regulation, methods of control and regulation that can meet the needs of a market for the work force have not yet taken shape. The extent of the comprehensive and corresponding reforms determine the development of a market for the work force. Labor Minister Li Boyong had the following views on the prospects for a market for the work force: We will use seven years, that is, by the end of the century, to coordinate the reforms of various fields, further push them in depth, and basically establish an embryonic form of a modern work force market. By then, a new employment mechanism will spread from a small number of localities to the whole country.
