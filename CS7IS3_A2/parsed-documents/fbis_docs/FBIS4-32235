Milisavljevic: "Shortcuts in Transformation of Social Ownership: Labor Unions Fighting for Property"] [Text] Labor union organizations are stockholders at "Univerzal," "Metalservis," the "Institute for Foreign Languages," "IPM," "David Pajic," "Belgrade" Shoe Industry, and "Jugostroj"; comments on 57 articles of the republic's law on transformation. The labor union organizations at seven major Belgrade enterprises have become stockholders. They have been helped in this by an expert team from the Council of the Federation of Independent Labor Unions [VSSS] of Belgrade, which in anticipation of a new law in the republic is actively monitoring the transformation taking place at 75 percent of the city's enterprises and insisting that all employees enjoy equal rights in purchasing stock. The unions at "Univerzal" DD, "Metalservis" DD, the "Institute for Foreign Languages," "IPM," "David Pajic," "Belgrade" Shoe Industry, and "Jugostroj" have become holders of stock shares. Fight for Equal Rights for Employees "At our firm, 100 percent of the capital is the property of workers, while a small part is held by the union itself. Like all the other stockholders, the union too received 0.025 percent of the capital," says Toma Stanic, president of the "Univerzal" union. According to him, this is the first union organization in Serbia to become a stockholder. At "Belgrade" Shoe Industry, 30 percent of the capital that has been sold thus far is owned by that enterprise's labor union. The transformation of ownership is complete at 2,468 enterprises in Serbia. Employees at another 900 firms are awaiting confirmation that they have conducted transformation correctly. There are a total of 1,800 enterprises in Belgrade, while the process of changing ownership is taking place at 1,350 firms. However, transformation is not proceeding smoothly at all firms. At the initiative of labor unions, this process has been halted over the past year at "Posavina" in Obrenovac, at the "Dunav" transport enterprise in Belgrade, at "Metalservis," at "Dzi-ti" in Zemun, and at "Projeks" (part of the former "Prosveta"). "In August 1992, we demanded changes in the Serbian law on transformation. Among other things, we asked that 51 percent of the stock be at a discount (so-called workers shares) as well as vouchers (free shares) for all employees," explains economist Tanja Nikolic of the Belgrade union. "Since not one of the demands was adopted, we advocated that the law be implemented consistently and that the equal rights of all employees at the enterprise be respected, because the aim of certain--most often managerial--groups was to gain a controlling interest over the stock," says Tanja Nikolic. Rest Homes for Labor Unions According to Bogoljub Mitrovic, vice chairman of the Council of the Federation of Independent Labor Unions of Belgrade, the city's labor union has taken the transformation problem seriously and formed a team of experts that is qualified and educated in the type of transformation that is most suitable to employees. "There is a federal law that allows transformation on the basis of the bookkeeping value of the property and payment over 10 years, and a republican one based on an estimate of the social capital. We are not satisfied with either one of these two laws and are aware that transformation based on them does not increase the capital of the enterprises, but that transformation of social ownership with changes in administrative roles increases the efficiency of decisionmaking and business on the one hand, while on the other hand inhibiting the sale of the social capital that has been built up over five decades." A new law on transformation is being prepared in Serbia. The VSSS has submitted its own proposals and opinions. "We provided comments on 57 articles of the existing law. The extent to which they are considered by the legislature does not depend on us very much, because we do not have our own representatives in parliament, not even a so-called `free seat,'" says Mitrovic. One of the proposals by the Belgrade labor union is that worker rest homes and communal dining facilities be omitted from the estimate of the total value of an enterprise's capital and that they be turned over to the union organizations for their use and administration. The belief at the city's labor union is that no one should be allowed to turn these facilities, which were built with employee contributions, into private bars.
