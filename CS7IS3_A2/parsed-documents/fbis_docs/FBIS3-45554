He emphasized that as long as both sides strictly abide by the principles guiding the establishment of diplomatic relations and relevant principles underscored in the Sino-French joint communique, Sino-French relations will be gradually improved and grow. Wu Jianmin made these remarks in response to a question at a news conference this afternoon. A reporter asked: The governments of China and France issued a joint communique on 12 January. Please comment on the prospects for developing Sino-French relations. Wu Jianmin said: "In most of the past 30 years since the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations, fruitful cooperation has been conducted in the political, economic and other fields. However, in recent years, the authorization by the previous French Government of the sale of arms to Taiwan seriously undermined bilateral relations. We believe that as long as both sides strictly abide by the principles guiding the establishment of diplomatic relations and relevant principles underscored in the Sino-French joint communique, Sino-French relations will be gradually improved and grow."
