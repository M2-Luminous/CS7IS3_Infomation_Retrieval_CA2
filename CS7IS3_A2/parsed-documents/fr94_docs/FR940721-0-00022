FR940721-0-00022 FR940721-0-00010 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 74&hyph;09; Notice 38] RIN 2127&hyph;AE39 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Child Restraint Systems AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends Standard No. 213, Child Restraint Systems, to facilitate the manufacture of ``belt-positioning'' child seats (i.e., booster seats designed to be used with the vehicle's lap/shoulder belts). The amendment adopts performance and labeling requirements and test criteria for belt-positioning booster seats that are more appropriate than Standard 213's current criteria for these child seats. This document also specifies that child booster seats must be labeled as being suitable for children weighing not less than 30 pounds. This rule responds to the NHTSA Authorization Act of 1991 (sections 2500&hyph;2509 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (``ISTEA'')), which directed the agency to initiate rulemaking on child booster seat safety and other issues. DATES: This rule is effective on August 22, 1994. The incorporation by reference of the material listed in this document is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 22, 1994. Petitions for reconsideration of the rule must be received by August 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Petitions for reconsideration should refer to the docket and number of this document and be submitted to: Administrator, Room 5220, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C., 20590.
