A relevant official in charge of the State Economic Restructuring Commission said: The enactment of these provisions was necessitated by the absence of unified provisions regarding the time when fixed amounts of shares sold to employees by companies that raise funds from society can be listed and transferred after the companies offer their shares to the public. Most provinces and municipalities now have listed companies. The formulation of unified national provisions are essential for strengthening the management of stock markets according to prescribed norms. It has been disclosed that the "Opinions on Standardizing Joint Stock Limited Companies" promulgated by the State Economic Restructuring Commission in 1992 and the "Interim Regulations on the Management of Stock Issuance and Trading" promulgated by the State Council in 1993 contain clauses regarding the sale of fixed amounts of shares to employees by joint stock limited companies that raise funds from society. Because of the continuous development and improvement of stock markets, these clauses have become incompatible with the new situation. For this reason, the two commissions formulated the supplementary provisions. According to the provisions, joint stock limited companies that raise funds from society may sell less than 10 percent of their shares to their employees without exceeding the stock volume approved by the state for issuance. The prices of shares offered to their employees should be the same as those of shares offered to the public. They should obtain the consent of state securities administrative departments regarding their issuance methods. Principal organizations tasked with issuing shares should do so within the issuing period in accordance with relevant agreements. Shares sold to employees may be listed and transferred within six months after the companies have issued their shares to the public and listed them on stock exchanges. If a company and a stock exchange have entered into an agreement that specifies a period longer than six months, the shares sold to employees should be listed and transferred according to the agreement. During a recent interview by this reporter with regard to the supplementary provisions, a relevant official in charge of the State Economic Restructuring Commission's Production Structure Department said emphatically: Companies that raise funds from society may issue less than 10 percent of their shares to employees without exceeding the stock volume approved by the state for issuance. While company employees may buy fixed amounts of shares, individuals in society can only buy shares through lot-drawing after purchasing subscription forms or depositing money. These two types of subscribers are permitted to list their shares at different times because their chances for buying shares vary. The official said emphatically: Employees allowed to buy shares are largely those stipulated in the "Provisions on the Management of Share-holdings by Employees in Joint Stock Limited Companies That Raise Funds from Specific Sources" promulgated by the State Economic Restructuring Commission on 3 July 1993. However, we should take account of the fact that only some assets held in stock by some long-established, state-owned enterprises and some of their employees become part of the joint stock limited companies reorganized from those enterprises. To inspire the enthusiasm of employees in state-owned enterprises and to facilitate smooth progress in reorganization, companies may include employees hired by the original enterprises among those allowed to buy shares with the approval of departments in charge of examining and approving companies. The official said: Prior to the enactment of new provisions by the state, a joint stock limited company that shifts from funding by specific sources to funding by the public may convert its employees' shares into public shares without exceeding 10 percent of the stock volume approved by the state for issuance. These shares may only be listed and transferred three years after they were sold to employees. Shares exceeding 10 percent of the state-approved volume should be regarded as shares sold to employees; they may not be transferred or traded and will only allow holders to share in dividends.
