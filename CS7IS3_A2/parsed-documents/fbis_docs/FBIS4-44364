First, John Major's veto was neither as unexpected nor as isolated as his opponents suggest. Secondly, the Prime Minister may not hesitate to cast that veto again if pushed into the same corner. Helmut Kohl, in particular, must quickly learn the lesson of Corfu. His creature, Jean Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, still insists he is not out of the race. German officials are already behaving as though they can use the weight of their presidency to quash British objections. They have not absorbed the truth of what has happened: that the eventual choice must be truly unanimous. When Helmut Kohl pronounced his own anathema, against Ruud Lubbers, Britain did not dispute his right to do so. In the same way Mr Major found Mr Dehaene's conception of the European Union outdated and unacceptable. He too was within his right to veto -- and rightly did so. The Germans are sticking with Mr Dehaene to mitigate the damage of their clumsy attempt, with France, to agree the succession in secret conclave. It is too much to expect that they should drop their preferred candidate the very next day. But Bonn may be underestimating Mr Major's determination. The Dehaene supporters seem to believe that the British veto is as easily overturned as the last time a stand on principle was attempted: over the blocking minority vote it collapsed after only a week. The prime minister has learned his lesson. He coordinated his tactics properly and is arguing on much stronger ground. He must not back down at the second offering of a candidate previously declared unacceptable. The Franco-German tactic will be to cause Mr Major the maximum embarrassment by ostentatiously consulting all parties beforehand -- thereby removing British objections over the way Mr Dehaene emerged -- and then pushing a candidate as federalist as Mr Dehaene. One obvious choice would be Wilfried Martens, a former Belgian prime minister, who would be an even worse outcome for Mr Major: not only does he share Mr Dehaene's views on Europe but he has a proven anti- British record too. Mr Major should not hesistate to use his veto again, if so pressured. In the present envenomed atmosphere, Dehaene supporters are likely, out of pique, to veto Peter Sutherland, the Irish secretary- general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. His sin is that he is both anglophone and a liberal free-trader. To pick him would appear to reward Mr Major for his obstinacy. The dark horse is Viscount Etienne Davignon, a former commissioner, a free-trader and a pragmatist, but also conveniently a Belgian. Whitehall has hinted that it could live with him. Britain is ill-placed to propose a candidate. Several countries, however, owe a political debt to Mr Major. They too did not want Mr Dehaene but were reluctant to speak out. Mrs Thatcher may be gone, but the tradition of hiding behind the British veto remains. Italy, The Netherlands and even Denmark took opportunistic shelter there at Corfu. They must now persuade Germany to look elsewhere. This search should not be limited to former prime ministers and commissioners. The focus must be on the qualities needed to manage the Commission nowadays. These could be the skills of a head of a large corporation. Europe needs a man who knows how to keep costs down, streamline bureaucracy, limit empire-building and, above all, listen to the shareholders, in this case the Council of Ministers. Those qualities may be found in industry, far beyond the tight-knit Christian Democratic nexus in Benelux. Europe needs a new vision, Herr Kohl has a duty to extend his horizon.
