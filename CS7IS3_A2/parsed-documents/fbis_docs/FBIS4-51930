There is a danger that great ambiguity might lead to a military collision based on misunderstanding. [Nogami] The suspicion over North Korea's nuclear weapons development has continued since 1985 when the country joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). After its participation in the NPT, it took seven years for North Korea to accept inspections of its nuclear-related facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). After the issue arose concerning its failure to report two nuclear-related facilities, the country played games, making good use of facilities which it already reported. North Korea has not suddenly gone to extremes, but instead is playing a long-sustained game. It is difficult for us to try not to lose our patience with the game. However, because the operating of the second plutonium production line at the radio-chemistry laboratory (located in Yongbyon north of Pyongyang) is a problem, we have to think about the time limit.... [Munekata] If those in the substructure who support the Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il administration become a monolithic party, there is a possibility they will usurp power from Kim and his son. For this reason, the Kim administration has kept the substructures separate and has adopted a system which places them under mutual surveillance. Such people in the substructure brought about the Rangoon incident and the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner in a bid to please their "boss." We cannot say such an incident will not happen again. The current situation on the Korean peninsula is the most strained since 1953 when the Korean war ended. If something happens, Japan will fall into a panic, but will be unable to do anything. If a second Korean war breaks out, the loser will not be North or South Korea but Japan, for Tokyo will become a loser in the eyes of the international community since it did nothing. How will the international community view a country that is "unable to provide water and fuel" to the Australian Navy conducting warlike actions and patrols in the Sea of Japan? [Nogami] We should seriously consider the pending issue of "acquisition and cross-servicing agreements" (ACSA) that provide logistical support to allied nations since the enforcement of ACSA is possible through administrative measures. I do not say this only for the sake of dealing with the situation on the Korean peninsula. It is unusual that although the security treaty has been concluded, Japan has not yet signed such an agreement. Moreover, in view of domestic laws, how should we view the connection between the Road Traffic Act and transportation of the Self-Defense Forces [SDF]? Current laws ban the shipping and discharging of explosives and ammunition at night. Does this apply to emergency cases? There is no legal conformity. It is the same with the issue of using SDF airplanes to rescue overseas Japanese. The related bill was killed at the previous Diet session. [Munekata] There is a possibility the Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF] may be ordered to establish watch points along the coast in view of the possibility of refugees coming to Japan. However, it is not a security order nor a defense order. Places with a view of the coast are generally used as parks. Even if GSDF units try to enter a park for such activities, they cannot enter due to park regulations. It is out of the question. [Kawauchi] Some believe North Korea's nuclear weapons development will lead to competition in development of nuclear weapons among northeast Asian nations. Moreover, an increasing number of people are doubtful of the efficiency of the U.S. nuclear umbrella in the post-Cold War era. [Nishihara] It is inappropriate to deal with the PRC and DPRK nuclear issues in the same manner. The PRC is a superpower, and its nuclear program is relatively transparent. However, suspicion over North Korea's nuclear weapons development has triggered a U.S. concern that "Japan may also be armed with nuclear weapons." Although Japan has maintained it "will not become a nuclear power because it has the three nonnuclear principles [of not introducing, not producing, and not possessing nuclear weapons]," this is not persuasive. Japan needs to raise a clear argument that "nuclear armaments do not benefit its national interest." What Japan should say is that it may become a nuclear power if the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is scrapped or Japan becomes isolated as a result of hostility with neighboring nations, but that in the current situation there is no possibility of it deciding to become a nuclear power. [Nogami] During Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to the United States in February, he said: "The option of possessing nuclear weapons would be against Japan's national interest." He added: "The possibility of Japan becoming a nuclear power is quite an insensible argument which ignores the sentiments of the Japanese people." I am sure the United States understood this view. So far we have been able to coexist with the nuclear weapons of the PRC and Russia because of the U.S. commitment to a nuclear deterrent. There are now arguments in the United States about whether it should abide by its security promise to the Far East. It can be said that the view of Japan becoming a nuclear power has been entangled in these arguments. [Munekata] As Nishihara says, if Japan clearly states "it will arm itself with nuclear weapons under certain situations," then Japan will win the trust of foreign nations. Although Japan possesses a military strength of 270,000 soldiers, it does not call it a "military force." However, people in Southeast Asia do not trust this change in the wording. They are concerned Japan may maintain that "it does not possess nuclear bombs, only special bombs for self-defense." Japan's emotional nonnuclear policy is meaningless to such concerns. Without consistency in its logic, we cannot dispel foreign apprehension about Japan becoming a nuclear power. [Nogami] However, I want to emphasize that Southeast Asia has deepened its understanding of Japan's "defense-only" principle. Security dialogues with those nations have been promoted. What is regrettable is that security dialogues with South Korea have not. Since Japan has just begun a dialogue with the PRC, its future task is to promote dialogue with South Korea. [Kawauchi] I am concerned that, in the long run, Western nations will fail to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons. They will not stop nuclear proliferation, but will try to prevent the use of nuclear weapons which have already been developed. What can we do? It has been stated in the United States that the preemptive use of conventional weapons is the only way to prevent the use of nuclear weapons. [Nishihara] Certainly there are arguments that we have to deal with the nuclear installations of middle powers by using conventional weapons. [Nogami] The prevention of North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons is not an issue that concerns only nuclear nonproliferation. In negotiations to normalize diplomatic relations, will Japan talk with a North Korea that possesses nuclear weapons? Or will Japan negotiate with a North Korea that gives up its possession of nuclear weapons? These are totally different. There is a possibility North Korea's economy will collapse while it possesses nuclear weapons. North Korea's major concern is the reconstruction of its economy. Their task is how to deal with foreign nations by using the nuclear card. [Nishihara] While playing its nuclear card, North Korea will advance along the road of isolation, and its economy will collapse. On the other hand, while helping North Korea become isolated, Japan is trying to prevent the situation from developing into military action. While playing for time, both sides are waiting for the situation to turn to their advantage. [Kawauchi] However, do you not think we will have to pay dearly for the sudden collapse of the North Korean structure? [Nishihara] That will present a serious situation to South Korea. [Nogami] North Korea wants to deal with its economy. In recent cases, senior government officials have been removed to take responsibility for their failure to deal with economic issues. [Munekata] In North Korea, the people feel "all or nothing." There is a view that North Korea will choose between two courses: one is that the situation will develop into a second Korean war, and another is that North Korea will adopt a Chinese-style policy of opening up to foreign nations. [Nogami] The North Korean people, who have been gradually obtaining external information, are feeling a sense of isolation, though no one says that. They think Russia and the PRC will be unreliable in their time of need. The PRC has maintained it has no influence on North Korea. I think we need to seek a way of dispelling this sense of isolation by North Korea.
