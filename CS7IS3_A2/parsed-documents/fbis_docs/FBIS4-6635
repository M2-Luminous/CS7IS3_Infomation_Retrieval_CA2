Distinguishing Features of Central Asia Litmus Test for Japanese Diplomacy With the collapse of the USSR, Central Asia is experiencing changes in all political, social, and economic areas. Moreover, the changes are qualitative changes which may be regarded as revolutionary. Central Asia has shifted from being a "colony" of the USSR to a glorious independent state. The incident should be celebrated wholeheartedly. Besides, in the long run the area has full potentiality for development with its rich resources such as gold, raw cotton, petroleum, gas, and others as background. However, this area has to first undergo hardship. The hardship is so serious it might be the most serious experienced in the life of individual citizens. Said an Uzbek citizen who holds a responsible position: "Compared to this confusion, the USSR socialist structure is considered better. People's hearts are growing wild with economic difficulties. At least we used to enjoy visiting and receiving friends. Today, it is even difficult to do that. I cannot but feel anxious about the future of our children." While attaining independence, why should they become so anxious today? If such anxiety really does exist, what should the Japanese do about it? Roughly speaking, there are two courses for us to take. Since the area is not closely related to us, one course is to assume the attitude of an onlooker. This by itself is a fully justifiable choice. Over the past several decades, there have been few exchanges between Central Asia, which was under USSR control, and Japan. The only Japanese citizens who are regularly stationed in Tashkent, which has a population of over 2 million, are our four staff members at the embassy, two representatives from business firms, a Japanese language teacher (there is a Japanese language course at a local university where over 50 students are studying Japanese without Japan's aid; a Japanese lady has been teaching at the university for a monthly salary of only a bit more than $10), a student visiting the country to study archaeology, and the representative (a Japanese) of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. This shows how scarce the relationship between Japan and this area is. Therefore, it can be justifiable to flatly say: "It is not our concern no matter what may happen in this area." Another course is to seek ways to positively help the area. It is true that, while under USSR control, there had been no close relations between this area and Japan. However, with the collapse of the USSR, 23 million people in Uzbekistan alone are experiencing hardship. Should they fail to overcome the present situation, it is possible that serious political and economic confusion may occur. Japan and other countries can help the situation by offering economic and intellectual assistance to these areas. When Japan is being criticized at home and abroad about "lacking its own diplomacy," Japan can offer positive assistance and nip the causes of future confusion in the bud one by one. When Japan's attitude in making international contribution is at issue, we should realize that to shed blood is not the only way to make contributions. Japan should seek the most effective ways of making contributions. Perhaps a most effective way for Japan is to help the area stabilize its political, social, and economic situation through economic contributions. Japan can best contribute in the field where it is most superior. It seems natural for Japan to do so, and in the long run Japan may be appreciated for so doing. Besides, such a way of assisting is most welcome to countries such as those in Central Asia and others which are experiencing confusion following the end of the Cold War. Central Asia is an area unknown to us, for we do not have a direct relationship with this area. Yet, the area is in need of Japan's help. Japan's way of dealing with these areas may be regarded as a litmus test for Japanese diplomacy in the future. [passage omitted on historical background] II. Political and Social Changes [passage omitted on historical background] The Role of Parliamentary Democracy Is Limited For the purpose of instituting religious activities, a large amount of funds are flowing into this area from Iran and other countries. Let me offer a concrete example. In October 1993, I traveled the Fergana area by automobile. To my surprise, mosques were being constructed on first-class lots in almost all villages, including small villages. In larger towns and cities, Islamic theological schools were under construction, with the school abutting the main street for 150 meters. Mosques were emerging throughout a land which was about to be totally evacuated following the withdrawal of Russian culture. Except for Tashkent, where reinforced concrete buildings were constructed one after another under the USSR, mosques are being constructed in every district of Uzbekistan. Presently, buildings are under construction, and little noticeable religious activity is being carried out. Therefore, voices of anxiety are seldom heard. However, two or three years from now, when construction comes to a halt, religious activities are expected to begin full-scale. It is highly possible that religious activities will bear a strong Iranian color. Such a possibility derives from Iranian history and the existing racial structure of the country. We may say that, from the pre-Christian era until about the eighth century, Central Asia was included in the Persian cultural sphere. Uzbeks and other Turkish descendents came to the region during this period. The strategy of the Turkish descendents was not to attempt to conquer all areas, but to gradually invade the area where Persian descendents were weak. As a result, a local community was formed where Persian and Turkish descendents were intermixed. The Persian descendents are living in the urban areas of historically famous Samarkand and Bukhara, and the Turkish descendents are living in the surrounding areas. Under the USSR, both the Persian and Turkish descendents were equally regarded as second-class citizens. However, with Uzbekistan becoming an independent state, and by virtue of the "National Language Law," Uzbeks of Turkish descent constitute the leading stratum, with those of Persian descent forming a subordinate class (though there are many Persian descendents who speak Uzbek fluently). Shi'a Muslims, which have strong influence over Iran, also have strong infiltrating power among the oppressed. In addition, the Tajikistan people who maintain a considerable influence in Uzbekistan are of Persian ancestry. Moreover, they have strong financial support from religious sectors. Though today educational funds for Islam are also being offered mainly by Saudi Arabia, their role is simply to contribute money no matter how much funds are offered. The funds offered by Saudi Arabia will bear fruit in the form of increased Iranian influence in strengthening human, historical, and cultural ties. (Note: There is an opinion that, since Sunni Muslims are conducting Islamic education in Central Asia, it will be difficult for Iranian Shi'a Muslims to infiltrate the area. However, oppressed under the USSR, the teachings of Islam have not infiltrated into the area that deeply, and its influence is not strong enough to prevent a particular religious sector from coming into the area.) As I mentioned earlier, restoration of the mura [premodern] community will bring about the restoration of Islam. As we have seen so far, we can understand that this area is experiencing a violently changing period. New political and social orders are about to be created. The scale of change is almost revolutionary. Naturally, there will emerge a group to resist the changes. Racial and cultural tensions are being created in this area, and tensions are expected to increase further. There are confrontations between those of Russian (European) descent and the local people; between those of Turkish and Persian descent; between "unification of politics and religion" and "separation of politics and religion"; and between the modern and premodern community. Under such circumstances, the government is exerting itself to avoid confusion, and is trying to prevent the country from returning to a primitive Islamic community. Different from other areas of the former USSR where confusion has surfaced, this area alone has been able to maintain its political stability mostly owing to the leaders. How should the West deal with this community? One of the requirements which qualifies this country to receive aid from the West is "to what extent has parliamentary democracy been introduced?" An international financial group came up with this idea. However, parliamentary democracy is based on a generally accepted idea that "the minority group is ready to accede to the majority group so long as the minority group is given the opportunity to express its opinions." However, while the great revolution is taking place, with the USSR regime shifting to an Uzbek regime, the role of a parliamentary democracy becomes very limited. The Russian people who have become second-class citizens cannot resume their reign no matter how much they may shout at parliament. It is not parliament that decides the role of religion. In a community where there is confrontation between "unity of politics and religion" and "separation of politics and religion," the role of a parliamentary democracy is narrow. The confrontation cannot be settled within the parliamentary framework. When we think about ways of appraising and assisting such a community, it is not necessarily appropriate to place a great burden on "to what degree has a parliamentary democracy been introduced". III. Changes in the Economic Field Favorable Economic Environment During the Russian regime, which lasted 120 years, the economic structure of this area was formed from the viewpoint of colonial management. In order to prevent this area from becoming politically independent, its economy had been totally linked with the economy of Moscow and others so that the area could never become economically independent. Though Uzbekistan was a world-famous place for raw cotton production, raw cotton was not processed here; raw cotton was sent to Russia to be made into fiber. Though there were industries in Uzbekistan, parts and raw material were mostly imported from other areas of Russia. Just like meshes, the Uzbek economy was incorporated into an inter-dependent framework involving all areas of Russia. Moreover, the Uzbek economy had been influenced by the Cold War. Afraid of U.S. attacks during the Cold War, the USSR dispersed its munitions industries to various districts. Unimaginably large factories are located in local districts. Tashkent is no exception. On the outskirts of Tashkent there are the only two assembly plants (with tens of thousands of employees) in the USSR for transport aircraft (including military aircraft). Reportedly, there is a uranium factory in Uzbekistan which is one of the largest in the USSR. What will become of this economy after the collapse of the USSR? Transport aircraft can be assembled only when the necessary parts are procured. A factory cannot be operated without parts, even if it has excellent engineers and excellent assembly lines and runways. Under such circumstances, Uzbekistan employed a clear strategy. Supposedly, the strategy was formed from the following concepts: 1. The economy promises a long-range view. The balance of international payments will be improved by increasing the production of gold, by elevating the degree of processing of raw cotton, and by providing petroleum products for itself. The economic environment is favorable in a long-range view. However, it will take at least four or five years to realize these objectives. 2. For the time being, as a transitional measure an economic structure dependent on the Russian economy may be maintained until a self-supporting economic structure is established. This strategy is considered reasonable. So far, Uzbekistan has been producing gold in large volumes, ranking between sixth and eighth in the world. Foreign investments began to be introduced. Newmont [as published] Company of the United States has established a joint venture, and an English enterprise has also concluded a contract to extend its business in this area. Japanese enterprises are also waiting for a chance to do business here. The country produces high-quality raw cotton in large quantities. Japanese enterprises which have closed their domestic spinning mills because of the high labor cost are also studying the possibility of operating mills in this country. The country is abundant in deposits of petroleum and gas, and has enough deposits to export after supplying its domestic demand. In these three fields alone, the country has good prospects for success. Its potentiality is by far greater than many other developing countries. Why Did the Plan Fail? However, their plan did not work. The plan described in point 2 above failed. For the USSR, the colonies (republics) were expensive propositions. Russia aims to cut off the republics, proposing to them conditions to remain within the Russian economic sphere. Judging that "these requests are too severe compared with the former conditions," the newly independent countries intend to become economically independent by introducing their own currencies. However, for a country which had been able to maintain its economy through its connection with Russia, in the short-term it means economic collapse in attempt to become economically independent. The bill is to be totally shouldered by the citizens. The ruble which citizens have saved will become as good as wastepaper. Inflation will be accelerated. Citizens have lost their trust in the currency and do not want to save money. They do not sell but rather accumulate goods. Distrust prevents the economy from functioning smoothly. In Central Asia (and maybe in Russia), there are presently two factors creating economic difficulties. -- Problems created by the collapse of socialism, and by the shifting to a market economy. -- Problems created by the collapse of the USSR economic sphere. While many intellectuals point out the former as a cause of difficulties, in the short-term serious confusion has been caused mostly by the latter. There is no way of solving the problems without taking the latter's influence into account. Central Asia, including Uzbekistan, is seriously in need of advice concerning economic operations. However, the advice given by IMF and other institutions is: "It is necessary to completely shift to a market economy." This advice may be adequate if the present hardship was attributable to the contradictions of socialism alone. However, the most serious hardship was created by the collapse of the USSR economic sphere. What is necessary is to deal with the problem, taking the situation of Central Asia into account, and not to try to apply textbook rules to economics. The other day I met one of the advisory members of the IMF who said: "Honestly speaking, we are at a loss. We are not sure if it is of any use to give advice aimed at partial improvement of a structure totally different from our own. It is like a mental specialist trying to cure a fractured leg." IV. What Can Japan Do? Japan Can Be the Best Model First, what is the president of Uzbekistan expecting from Japan? If I arbitrarily compose a statement based on his speeches, what he wants is as follows: "We do not want to receive charity from foreign countries. However, we want foreign countries to help us out of our economic difficulties following independence. If we successfully operate the economy today, there will be a bright future for us. We have resources such as gold, petroleum, and raw cotton. Basically, we have diligent workers. These factors will prove fully helpful to us in making rapid progress in the future. Yet, just as I do not need Islamic fundamentalism, I do not need either `democratic fundamentalism' or `market economy fundamentalism'. It does not bring about any solutions to be forced to accept principles without taking individual situations into account. Under a different environment, we should engage in different approaches. To restore the economy is a task of the utmost priority for us. We want to shift to a market economy step by step. Of course, in view of social security, we should also place importance on welfare. It is impossible to try to completely shift to a market economy all at once. We want to carry out the project with the central government taking control. Japan seems to be the best model for us in operating our economy. Asians have their own approaches. When I talked to West European leaders, I related my idea to that effect. We want to learn from Japan. We also want Japan to help us in laying the foundation for development. If Japan could assist us now, in the long run we will also be able to help Japan. However, to my regret, Japanese Government officials and the private sector are late in taking action." The president, who is accustomed to delivering speeches in the USSR-style, will speak for hours fluently and with dignity. Yet the essence of his speech will be as I described above. The core of the problem is whether or "not" Japan can judge that "from a broad point of view, it conforms with Japan's interests to help those Central Asian countries which are suffering hardship." Does Japan consider it right to exert itself in solving problems directly related to its interests? Or does Japan consider it will benefit the country in the long run to exert itself in solving problems, even though the problems are not urgent ones for Japan? Or when its qualifications as a UN Security Council member are being discussed, does Japan consider it its responsibility to do so? Japan's way of dealing with the problem will differ largely depending on what choice it makes. If Japan's choice is the latter, we can form a number of projects. -- Offer advice: Japan can give advice in economic operations based on its experience in overcoming the postwar confusion. -- Assist key industries, and assist the region in improving the social infrastructure. (In order to improve the balance of international payments, the assistance should focus on such industrial fields as mining, oil development, textiles, and tourism.) -- Offer humanitarian assistance. -- Offer cultural assistance. (With its rich tradition, the Central Asian culture possesses a high quality beyond our imagination. However, in the community where the people barely make a living, some of the traditional cultures are in the process of destruction.) Western countries, including Germany but excluding the United States, are taking steady action in assisting the region. Fortunately, the Japanese are gradually beginning to feel Japan should help Central Asia. However, I am afraid that to feel that way may be excessive wishful thinking by the writer who has almost no point of contact with Japan.
