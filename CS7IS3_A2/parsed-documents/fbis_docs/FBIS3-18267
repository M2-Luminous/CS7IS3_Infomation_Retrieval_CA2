At a meeting in Saxony, leading members of two banned neo-Nazi parties, the German Alternative and the National Offensive, decided to establish an electors' initiative for the Republikaner together with the Hamburg National List, which is facing a possible ban by the Federal Constitutional Court. According to Christian Worch, leader of the National List, the neo-Nazis are "grimly determined" to "make important impacts" on the election campaign. The Republikaner, who are careful to disassociate themselves from the neo-Nazi scene in the public's eye, have threatened to take legal action against the unwanted neo-Nazi helpers. This does not trouble Worch: "Legally, Schoenhuber is completely powerless against demonstrations of sympathy."
