The Czech side is thus being offered a wide range of promising opportunities, and we have naturally pledged our support to the accepted projects in every way." That is what the deputy finance minister of the Russian Federation, who had dealings in Prague regarding the repayment of the Russian debt to the Czech Republic, said yesterday in an exclusive interview for HOSPODARSKE NOVINY and Russian Television. "The Russian side has kept all of its promises. I have been empowered to sign the treaty in Prague. However, the treaty still has to undergo a certain approval procedure," he added. When asked what portion of the liabilities could be capitalized, A. Vavilov replied that a large part of the debt qualifies for this solution, such as balance in transferable rubles and a part of other types of debt. "We assume that mainly the part of the debt that arose during trade exchange could be resolved in this form, but there is nothing on our side to prevent us from compensating the debt we have in free [volny] currencies in this way, too." We were interested in whether there was already a list of appropriate enterprises. On this subject, Vavilov said that the State Property Committee of the Russian Federation (Goskomimushchestvo) was engaged in great activity in cooperation with Czech partners. "Works continue, but we would like to see them progress faster," he said. In connection with the planned capitalization of claims, he pointed to Russia's efforts to create more favorable conditions for foreign investments. He mentioned the set of President Yeltsin's decrees on profit taxing in enterprises with foreign property participation. If the foreign capital share exceeds 30 percent and the overall investment exceeds 200 million rubles, the enterprise does not have to pay taxes for two years and pays only 25 percent of taxes in the third year and one-half in the fourth; only in the fifth year does it pay a full federal rate. According to the deputy minister, it is possible to expect that regional authorities, too, will adopt similar conditions to attract foreign capital. When asked by Russian television for which side the initialed treaty was more advantageous, Vavilov replied that "if it is initialed, it is anticipated that it is mutually beneficial; however, in case of debts, the situation is complicated." He admitted that, in any case, both the creditor and the debtor will get a clearer idea from the schedule of installments. "All of the agreements on restructuring its debt signed by the Russian Federation in the two most recent years are being precisely met. Debts of the former USSR are an exception and are the subject of regular discussion with the Paris Club, the London Club, and other creditors." Russia is also an important creditor of a number of developing countries. The overall sum of its claims is difficult to determine precisely (estimate runs over $100 billion) and realizing these assets is very difficult," Deputy Minister Vavilov said. "Specifically, in the agreement (with the Czech Republic), we are counting on the possibility of barter operations--that is, with swapping Russian assets in certain countries for the debt in the Czech Republic, which is currently negotiating its claims with, for instance, Asian debtor countries. Here, too, it is likely that we will find mutually acceptable alternative solutions," the Russian representative said.
