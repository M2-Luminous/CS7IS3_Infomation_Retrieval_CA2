FBIS4-11274 "drlat080_a_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Group Leaves Canadian Embassy Group Leaves Canadian Embassy PA2604024494 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0139 GMT 26 Apr 94 PA2604024494 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Four Cuban adults and a three-and-one-half-year-old who entered the Canadian Embassy in Cuba today to request asylum, have left the building on their own accord after occupying it for eight hours, according to embassy sources. "We told them there was no possibility of their being granted political asylum under Canada's international policy," David Morrison, secretary of the diplomatic mission, stated today. He said the five entered the Canadian Embassy, which is located in the Miramar residential neighborhood of Havana, at 1000 (1400 GMT) in a peaceful manner and left at 1810 (2210 GMT). "After thinking it over," the occupants left the building on their own and without incident," the diplomat said. Morrison said those who requested asylum said they were doing so because "life is very difficult" in Cuba. Morrison said he personally spoke to the occupants, one of whom was the father of the minor, who entered the Canadian Embassy by taking advantage of a change of personnel. NOTIMEX was able to confirm that the situation in and around the embassy building is normal tonight. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told newsmen this afternoon that "these issues are connected to the extremely difficult period the country is enduring and that in difficult times some people begin to make rash decisions." Cuba opposes all attempts to leave illegally, even by those "who resort to requesting political asylum, which is the best way to get some other country to receive them," the Cuban foreign minister noted. Robaina said this phenomenon is encouraged "from abroad," and he noted that "situations of this type will continue to occur." He added, "I believe the news in this country is no longer that 10 people defected or 50 people defected; the news continues to be the millions who are resisting." Seven Cubans entered the Belgian Embassy last February demanding permission to leave Cuba, but they left the embassy on their accord a month later, after receiving confirmation that the Cuban Government refused to grant them permission to leave.
