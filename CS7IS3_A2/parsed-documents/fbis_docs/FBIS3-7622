After a news conference in Bangkok, Yi To-sop, Pyongyang's ambassador to Thailand, told ORF that Kim Il-song is the president of North Korea, but the ambassador called the president's son, Kim Chong-il, who has been declared dear leader by the North Korean propagandists, our supreme leader [previous three words in English]. In answer to several questions about an explanation of that title, Yi said that the supreme leader determines the guidelines, not only of defense, but also of domestic and foreign policy. He is not only responsible for the military, but for all civilians in North Korea. The diplomat did not want to explain in detail the role that President Kim Il-song is playing. [passage omitted on background information] The regime might have used the present nuclear crisis, which North Korea is interpreting as a mere U.S. pretext for preparations for a war, to complete the change of power. Ambassador Yi To-sop claimed again today that North Korea holds the United States alone responsible for this crisis and he threatened North Korea's definite withdrawal from the Nonproliferation Treaty if U.S. Patriot antimissile systems were deployed in South Korea, the U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers were held, and the UN Security Council were to adopt sanctions against Pyongyang. We are prepared both for war and peace, Ambassador Yi said.
