The newspaper said the three were "terrorist leaders" who had infiltrated into Libya, but did not give details of their arrest. They were handed over at the al-Sallum border post and then transferred to Cairo, where they were due to be interrogated by the Egyptian security services, AL-AKHBAR said. Meanwhile, the AL-AHRAM newspaper reported that Egyptian security forces had arrested 350 suspected Islamic militants, mostly in Upper Egypt, during operations in the past two weeks. They seized nearly 700 firearms and more than 440 kilogrammes (968 pounds) of explosives, the daily said. Suspected Islamic militants shot dead a police officer and his bodyguard in Asyut in southern Egypt on Monday. It was the first killing of policemen this year, bringing to 97 the number of policemen killed since Islamic militants launched a violent anti-government campaign in March 1992. In a speech broadcast on state television on Monday Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi branded Islamic militants as "traitors" working for the West. Al-Qadhdhafi, who has taken a hard line against the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, said militants were "anti-Islamic, and working for the enemy, backed by Western intelligence ... and carrying out a dangerous plot against the Arab and Islamic nation." Among other groups, the Libyan leader singled out the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiah and Tala'i' al-Fath, which are at the forefront of the campaign to oust the government of Egyptian President Husni Mubarak.
