But Minister of Information Jawad al-'Anani said Jordan would welcome a decision to sign the accord in Amman "if our brothers in Yemen have decided so." The sources said, however, that Jordan would not sponsor the signing of the reconciliation accord unless it is clear that the agreement would succeed in ending the conflict between Yemeni President 'Ali Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. News agencies Friday quoted the spokesman of the Yemeni dialogue committee, Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, as saying that the committee had agreed "with our Jordanian brethren" to have the accord signed in Amman on Feb. 20. Agence France-Presse quoted a Yemeni official it did not name as saying that leaders of the three parties in the governing coalition would attend the signing ceremony to which Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat would be invited. An official source did not specifically say whether Mr. 'Arafat would attend the signing ceremony if it takes place in Amman. But this source said that Sultan Qabus of Oman, who mediated between the Yemeni parties, would be invited. Diplomatic sources in Amman said that Yemeni parties are divided on which Arab leaders should be invited to the signing ceremony, adding that some prefer that only Yemeni officials attend it. The sources refused to give any details about arrangements for signing the accord, which was reached on Jan. 18. Sources said that some Arab parties are not happy with plans for having the reconciliation agreement signed in Jordan, which played a major role in mediation efforts between Mr. Salih and Mr. al-Bid. "This could be one major reason why the plans are not materialising as soon as we would like," one source said. His Majesty King Husayn said last week that Jordan was very concerned with the situation in Yemen and "would do everything possible" to help solve the conflict, which threatended the merger of the formerly socialist South and conservative North. The agreement was supposed to be signed in Amman early this month but the date was scuttled after new differences emerged between Mr. Salih and Mr. al-Bid. The Yemeni crisis developed when Mr. al-Bid left the Yemeni capital Sanaa for South Yemen's capital Aden on Aug 19 where he remains until now. The crisis resulted from differences of opinion on the pace of the union as well as economic and social reform. In elections held last April, Mr. Salih's General People's Congress (GPC) and Mr. al-Bid's Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) emerged as the two dominant parties and agreed to form a coalition government headed by Mr. Salih as president and Mr. al-Bid as vice- president. The Islamic al-Islah [Islamic Reform] party was later invited to the coalition. But political differences emerged thereafter, with Mr. al-Bid accusing Mr. Salih and his GPC of trying to dominate the country and running an elimination campaign against southern leaders. The reconciliation accord drawn up last week envisages political and economic reforms demanded by Mr. al-Bid and accepted by Mr. Salih.
