In a traditional agricultural country such as China, rural people used to consider farmland as their lifeblood. Such a concept has been gradually changing. Many rural families, whose laborers are working in rural industrial enterprises, have willingly transferred their farmland-use rights to their fellow-villagers or even to people from other villages, townships, counties or provinces. Wang Jinbao, a 66-year-old peasant in Wuxi County, east China's Jiangsu Province, said that he has tilled the land all his life and loves the land very much. However, he added, he has now transferred his land-use rights to others because all his children have found jobs in cities or in rural industrial enterprises and no longer make their living by farming. The practice originated in the mid-1980s in the area of Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou in southern Jiangsu Province, where rural industrial enterprises are well developed. At present, over 60 percent of the rural laborers in the area have turned from farming to working in industrial or service-trade enterprises. As a result, some of the rural families are willing to transfer their farmland- use rights to skilled farmers who want to expand their scale of production. Such a practice was soon approved by the top leadership of the country. A decision on some issues concerning the establishment of a socialist market economic system adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of the CPC on November 14, 1993 says that on the premise of adhering to collective land ownership, the compensated transfer of land-use right according to law will be allowed and that operations adaptable to economies of scale may be developed in a few economically developed areas through various forms such as the transfer of contracts and the purchase of shares on a voluntary basis. In order to solve the problem of some farmers being reluctant to continue farming and to avoid leaving the land waste [as received], the Chinese central government has selected the Pearl River Delta, Chang Jiang Delta and the outskirts of Beijing as the pilot areas to carry out the commercialization of land-use right. The official in charge of the experiment in the Chang Jiang Delta, focussing on Jiangsu Province, said that the experiment is aimed at gradually transferring the land-use right to those farmers who are more skilled and willing to engage in farming and finally realize economies of scale in farming. In carrying out the experiment, it is important to separate the land ownership from the land-contracting right and the land-use right. All the farmland is owned by the village. But the land- contracting right and the land-use right belong to individual households. Every household is allowed to transfer its contract and land-use right to others. The experiment started in the three counties of Wuxi, Changshu and Wuxian in the Chang Jiang Delta in 1987. So far, the practice has spread to 26 counties in the prefectural cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. The per-capita farmland in the area was less than 0.07 ha [hectares]. However, there are now 8,200 units engaging in farming on a total of 31,600 ha of land, each of which has more than one ha of farmland. Located in Zhangjing town in Jiangsu Province's Wuxi County, the richest county in China, the Xinhu farm has 13.3 ha of land. The land-use rights belonged to the local residents in the past, but have now been transferred. The farm is at present contracted by Li Songfan, a farmer from Changxing County in Zhejiang Province. Moreover, Li has transferred the contract to Shi Ziliang, another farmer from Changxing County. So, the actual persons who are cultivating the land of the farm are Shi and his wife as well as four of their relatives. There are 1,501 such farms operating economies of scale like the Xinhu farm in Wuxi County, according to county magistrate Lu Rongde. These farms have a total of 7,800 ha of farmland, which accounts for 53.6 percent of the county's total contracted farmland. Farming based on economies of scale has helped raise agricultural productivity and promoted the development of rural industry and the service trades. Statistics from the Jiangsu Provincial Office of Agricultural Modernization show that the per-ha and per-laborer grain output of such farms is generally 200 kg more than and 20.3 times that of small plots cultivated by farmers who have concurrent jobs in rural industrial enterprises. Over 93 percent of the grain produced by such farms is marketable grain. The percentage is 60 percentage points more than that of small farms. Many skilled farmers are willing to engage in farming of this type. Tang Hongquan, head of the Guangming farm in southern Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, contracted to cultivate the farm, which has 35 ha of land. His wife resigned from her post as head of a workshop in a rural industrial enterprise to manage the farm together with him. Last year the farm made a net income of 185,000 yuan. The per-capita annual income of the 20 laborers on the farm surpassed 4,000 yuan, which was about 30 percent more than their fellow-villagers who worked concurrently in rural industrial enterprises. Experts noted that the rebudding of commercialization of land-use rights in China indicates a new trend in the country's reform of the land-use system under the new circumstances of the nationwide efforts to build a socialist market economy.
