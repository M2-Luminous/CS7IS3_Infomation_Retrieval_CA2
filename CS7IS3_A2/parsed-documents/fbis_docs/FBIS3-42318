[Ucar] The operation was the most comprehensive air attack against us. Contrary to claims by the Turkish Government, Zhalah plays no role in "training and sending guerrillas to Turkey." The reason for exaggerating the importance of the Zhalah camp, which has a role of its own, is the impasse in the war. The aim is to create the impression that our struggle does not come from inside Turkey, but from abroad. [passage omitted] [Avsar] Is it true that the leaders' headquarters and communications room were destroyed? [Ucar] Our radio broadcasts and wireless communications are continuing uninterrupted. As for the destruction of leading cadres: The PKK's [Kurdish Workers Party] leading cadres never stay together in the same region or spot. They are in areas were fighting is taking place. Besides, the PKK's leading cadres exist in every locality where we are active. [passage omitted] [Avsar] Why was Zhalah selected for the raid? Did Zhalah take the place of al-Biqa'? [Ucar] [passage omitted] Recently, they tried to divert attention from the struggle inside the country by stepping up the propaganda about the Zhalah camp. By claiming to have destroyed Zhalah, which they asserted has supplanted al-Biqa', they actually aimed to shore up their image before the elections. Zhalah camp can never supplant Mahsum Korkmaz Academy [the PKK's camp in the al-Biqa' valley]. It has assumed no such function. [passage omitted] [Avsar] Will you respond to this operation? [Ucar] Our war, with all the attacks launched so far, has given the necessary reply. We have no intention of making a special reply. We will respond by perpetuating, developing, and intensifying our war. [passage omitted] [Avsar] Reportedly, other operations are also taking place near Kanimasi and troops have been brought to Dahuk. [Ucar] We have some information in this regard. We have received reports that tanks and troops have been massed in Kanimasi and that the Democratic Party of Kurdistan will participate in these operations. We have made preparations to retaliate.
