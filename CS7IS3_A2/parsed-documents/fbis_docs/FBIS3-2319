Japanese Ambassador to China Junihiro Michihiko was present as a representative of the Japanese emperor and empress, who sent a wreath. Born in Beijing on 16 April 1907, Pu Jie, of the Man [Manchu] nationality, was a younger brother of Aisin Giorro Pu Yi, the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty. When he was young he studied at Prince Chun's residence in Beijing and served as a study mate of Pu Yi. After 1929, Pu Jie was sent to study at Gakushuin University in Tokyo and at the Japanese Military Academy. After returning to northeastern China in 1935, he served as a military officer with the puppet state of Manchukuo, which was supported by the Japanese Army. In 1937, he married Hiro Saga, the daughter of the Japanese Marquis Saneto Saga. After the Japanese Army surrendered in 1945, he and Pu Yi were captured by the Soviet Red Army. In August 1950, they were handed over to the Chinese Government to be detained for reform. In November 1960, they were pardoned and freed. After being released, the party and the government showed great concern for and took very good care of Mr. Pu Jie. During the sixties, he was cordially received by Premier Zhou Enlai. Because of the concern shown by Premier Zhou Enlai, he was able to be reunited with his wife and daughter, who had lived in Japan and were parted from Pu Jie for many years, and to live together with them in China. From May 1962, Mr. Pu Jie served as a special member of the CPPCC Cultural and Historical Data Research Committee and as a member of the Beijing Municipal CPPCC Committee. After 1978, he was elected a deputy to the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC's; a member of the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC Standing Committees; and a vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities Committee. The fact that Mr. Pu Jie transformed himself from being a brother of a feudal emperor into a citizen of New China and then advanced to become a member of the highest legislative organ of the people's political power demonstrates the CPC's great vision and brilliant policy regarding the transformation of society and classes and also demonstrates Mr. Pu Jie's high quality of seeking truth and a bright future. Mr. Pu Jie supported the CPC and loved the socialist motherland. As a vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities Committee, he conscientiously carried out his duties as a representative of the people, put forward many valuable suggestions for further improving nationality affairs work, and made active contributions to safeguarding the unification of the motherland and strengthening the unity of various nationalities. For a long time, Mr. Pu Jie dedicated his life to promoting peace and friendship between China and Japan. He visited Japan many times and enthusiastically received visiting Japanese friends from various circles. He actively introduced the great achievements of China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. He made painstaking efforts to promote friendship between China and Japan. In 1991 he was awarded an honorary doctor of law degree by Japan's Ritsumeikan University. Mr. Pu Jie was a world-renowned calligrapher. His openhearted and graceful poems were full of sincere sentiments. He authored the "Selected Poems of Pu Jie." According to Mr. Pu Jie's will, his ashes will be spread over the vast land of China. In appreciation for the concern shown to Mr. Pu Jie by the party and the state over a long period, his daughter Kosei Fukunaga asked the CPPCC National Committee to present a portion of her share of her inheritance to the state.
