What he was involved in was criminal activity of spying and stealing state secrets. The Beijing Intermediate People's Court has handed down the second-instance judgment according to law and given Xi Yang a sentence of 12 years, with deprivation of political rights for two years. Because Xi Yang had admitted his guilt and showed repentance, the court handed down a light sentence according to the law when considering the penalty. The relevant authorities noted: During the period June and July 1993, Xi Yang repeatedly spied and stole state financial and economic secrets through bank clerk Tian Ye, the other defendant in the case; and passed all this secret material and information to MING PAO in Hong Kong for publication, causing serious economic losses to the state. The court was convinced that Xi Yang had committed the crime of spying and stealing state secrets, and his case was extremely serious. According to the "Supplementary Stipulations Concerning Punishment of the Crime of Disclosing State Secrets" as well as Clause 1, Article 51 of the "Criminal Law of the PRC," criminals like Xi Yang who steal state secrets can be given a jail term of 10 years or more, life imprisonment, or even the death penalty, with deprivation of political rights. In consideration of the fact that Xi Yang had already admitted his guilt and showed repentance, the court gave him a light sentence of 12 years with deprivation of political rights for two years. According to relevant stipulations, if he refuses to accept the court's judgment, a defendant can appeal within 10 days after receiving the court's verdict. It is learned that Xi Yang has appealed. According to the "Law on Criminal Cases," cases involving state secrets will not be open to the public. Since the Xi Yang case involves state secrets, there will not be a public trial. The relevant authorities in Beijing rejected suggestions that Xi Yang "mistakenly entered the forbidden zone," for Xi Yang was simply not engaged in normal news-gathering. The fact that Xi Yang is the only one to get into trouble among thousands of Hong Kong reporters who have been to Mainland China on reporting assignments since last year demonstrates that the line between normal reporting and criminal activities of spying and stealing state secrets is clearly drawn. Hong Kong reporters' normal reporting activities are fully protected.
