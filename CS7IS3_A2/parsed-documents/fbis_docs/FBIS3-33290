The U.S. Congress has just approved, and President Clinton has sanctioned, a new law granting subsidies to private shipyards. For the next 10 years, 70 of the 151 ships that comprise the U.S. merchant fleet will receive $2.1 million per year to finance their operations. This law is the most important piece of maritime legislation to be approved since the United States approved the first subsidy for the sector in 1936 (now they subsidize the salaries of the sector employees). The law was sponsored by Deputy Gerry E. Studds of the Democratic Party, Massachusetts. It was approved in Congress by 347 votes to 65. It seeks to stimulate naval construction in the country and to strengthen the U.S. merchant fleet which was reduced from 620 ships 28 years ago to 151. The subsidy will be granted to all merchant ships sailing under U.S. flag that are suitable for military use. The subsidy will help U.S. shipyards to make their shipbuilding prices competitive on the international market. If U.S. shipyard prices are higher than those of another country, the U.S. Government can also grant subsidies to shipowners who choose to have ships built abroad. Sergio Salomao, president of the National Union of Maritime Navigation Enterprises (Syndarma), has said this new subsidy enables U.S. shipowners to make new investment, increase the level of their services, and reduce still further their freight prices which are already about 30 percent less than those of Brazilian companies.
