Gridasova: "The Poison Needle and Children: Petersburg Is One of the Leaders in Number of Juvenile Addicts"] [Text] On 14 April our newspaper published the letter "A Poison Needle," written by a mother whose son had died of drugs. This tragic story confirmed yet again that drug mania is firmly taking hold in our homes. St. Petersburg has probably the greatest number of identified juvenile drug addicts in Russia. And the average age of this juvenile drug addition in our seaport city keeps declining; the percentage of children hooked on the opium group of drugs is growing at an incredible rate: Last year 89 percent of all juvenile drug addicts used opiates. Over the first quarter of this year this figure had already risen to 93 percent! Are we prepared for this disaster? Judging by the fact that the city has just one juvenile department for... 15(!) beds operating as part of the city drug treatment clinic, our preparedness is below average, to put it mildly. But even this one department is being rent by problems. Juvenile department chief Tatyana Slavina and psychologist Olga Koltsova describe them. "Our department was set up in March 1991 and originally was intended to accommodate 25 beds for patients between 15 and 18 years of age. Of course, these age boundaries were frequently violated in accepting patients, but within reasonable bounds. The problem was different--the real number of juveniles undergoing treatment at any given time. Fifteen was a sort of critical level, after which the department began to literally "split at the seams," which made it very difficult for medical personnel to keep a handle on the process and the children under control. "Treating drug addicts is not an easy job. People suffering from drug addiction are very aggressive: Their will is destroyed but at the same time they are very inventive and are capable of conceiving many sophisticated methods of deceiving a doctor or a nurse in order to get hold of the drug they crave. "To these traits that are common for all drug addicts, the juvenile environment adds its own age-related peculiarities. "First, a juvenile is mostly peer-oriented in his behavior, and if the sociopsychological microclimate in the department is conducive to giving up drugs, the chances for success in treating the children increase dramatically. And vice versa, if the work with the collective is not successful, treating each individual juvenile becomes nearly meaningless. "Second, a specialist working with children knows that multiple-substance addiction is most common among them: These kids are going through a stage of so-called drug experimenting--they are looking for a drug that "suits" them most, or use whatever they can get their hands on. Therefore, it is very difficult for the medics to find an appropriate form of treatment in these conditions. "Next, unlike adult drug addicts, who are capable of understanding the need (perhaps a last-chance one) for treatment, children completely lack the sense of danger inherent in drug use. The motivation to undergo treatment as a rule does not stem from this factor: A juvenile is brought in either by the militia or parents, but he will never come on his own. Which means he may run away at the slightest real opportunity. "Finally, strange as it may sound, adults are more careful and neat: A veteran drug addict will rarely use a dirty syringe or an unpurified opiate (or other drug) solution. A juvenile may mix into the opium solution an inexpensive medicine--he usually has a money problem; a `dirty' drug costs less but will deliver the same kind of `high' as the pure one. "So this work is not easy, and the department has gone through difficult experiences: We tried different methodologies for treating children--from complete freedom and democracy in relations with juveniles to strict compulsory measures. We read books and magazines, attended seminars held by foreign psychologists, until we understood that a child suffering from drug addiction needs first of all medical help (any psychotherapy is secondary) provided in a well designed environment. And the important part in this is the small number of children undergoing treatment in the department and the cyclical nature of accepting new patients, when a group is accepted at the same time and remains together until they are discharged four weeks later. "A new patient coming into the treatment program has a ruinous effect on the others, and all our efforts, all the agreements we enter into with the juveniles when they are accepted, go down the drain. It is not the children's fault, since drug intoxication is a `psychological infection' of sorts and can be easily `transmitted' from a new patient to those who have just shaken off the burden of drug addiction. "And we have already mentioned a strictly limited number of patients. "Without adhering to these conditions, our work essentially turns into Sisyphean toil: The doctors want to help the children, but the existing overcrowding does not allow them to do what is best for successful treatment. The result is failure; the staff disappointed and dissatisfied with their work. So if the city truly wants to help juvenile addicts, they have to give us real help." The opinion of professionals: St. Petersburg should have not one department for juvenile drug addicts but several clinics, where different methods of treatment will be offered. Let us note that so far this is not universally accepted. Moreover, sometimes there is talk about closing the only "unprofitable" clinic. It is ineffective, they say. But what is meant by effectiveness in this case is the number of patients "treated" per certain number of beds, while the quality of treatment apparently does not bother anyone. Meanwhile juvenile drug addiction in St. Petersburg is growing. Over the past three years it has doubled. And this is if we are to believe official statistics.
