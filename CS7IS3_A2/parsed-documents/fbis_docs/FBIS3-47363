It should be recalled that after the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] organized elections, the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and the entente have staged a closed-door coup d'etat setting up this current two-headed government. In the meantime, in August 1993, the Vietnamese communists and the U.S. entente have mustered up their forces and launched attack against the Phnum Prah hill and Phnum Chhat in northern Sisophon, against Stoung in Kompong Thom, destroying everything, burning down houses, killing people indiscriminately, and plundering all sorts of property. The population fled their houses, farms, and rice fields while women were raped savagely. What is the true nature of this act? Firstly, it is actually the continuation of the Vietnamese aggression war against Cambodia. Secondly, it is an act of flaming the war by the U.S. entente through the two-headed government set up by them. They have mustered up their destructive forces in order to fight against Democratic Kampuchea. Therefore, who started the war at the end of 1978 and who continued to fan the flames of war by launching attacks against Phnum Chhat and Stoung last August? And who mapped out the so-called largest military operation ever against Anlung Veng in last September? Presently, overexcited by their criminal feats in Phnum Chhat and Stoung, the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and the entente hurriedly mounted a largest operation aimed at capturing Anlung Veng. In this regard, the puppet Hun Sen has shouted: "Fight, fight, fight. Fight against and totally exterminate the Khmer Rouge!." While in New York, he went so far as to declare that he would mobilize up to hundred thousand men and spend thousand lives to take over the Anlung Veng for Vietnam. Who is then responsible for the continuation of the current Vietnamese war of aggression? However, their large-scale military operation against Phnum Chhat in September 1993 met with crushing defeat. II. Since November and December 1993, the two-headed government, Hun Sen, and others, have talked only about fight, fight, fight. They have called for launching military campaigns and making war against the Khmer Rouge. All these are Vietnamese communist slogans who have used them for a long time against the nation and people of Cambodia. They have not said a word about national reconciliation. They have overlooked and failed to notice the fact that Democratic Kampuchea has succeeded in defending and safeguarding the Cambodian nation and people because it forms part and parcel of the whole nation and people. In other words, because the nation and people have always been with Democratic Kampuchea in its struggle against the Vietnamese aggressors. Specifically, since the end of October 1993, the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and the U.S. entente have mapped out and prepared their military campaigns of the 16th dry season against Anlung Veng, Stoung, Malai, and Pailin. This is a large mobilization of forces of the Vietnamese communists and of the U.S.-financed forces. The U.S. and France are the financial backers. They, together with Australia, have also been responsible for the propaganda and psychological warfare campaign. They have done all this with the aim of destroying the Khmer Rouge, making it impossible to be part of a national army and in the government. Their goal is to force the Khmer Rouge, through military means, to accept their three-point conditions, namely laying down their arms, handing over the Democratic Kampuchea-held areas, and dissolving the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK]. They have propagandized repeatedly about those conditions. They have opposed the king's five-point guideline for national reconciliation. The whole nation and people of Cambodia have welcomed and supported the king's five points. Still, they are adamantly oppose to them. In so doing, they aim at putting aside the king's five-point guideline, preventing the roundtable meeting or talks on national reconciliation and unity. III. What are the concrete results of these military campaigns? They have launched these large-scale operations since November 1993 but they met with crushing defeats in December last and this early January. What are the causes of their failure? Firstly, they lack fighting forces. The people are strongly against them. They are against the war. Some who have been enlisted by force have deserted for lack of money, salaries, rice, salt, et cetera. The people need to care about their own lives. They refuse to be killed for the two-headed government, the Vietnamese communists, and the entente. They don't want to die and they don't want to see the nation and people disappear. Secondly, they lack ammunition. So far, no one has agreed to sell them ammunition. Everybody wants peace and national reconciliation in Cambodia. Thirdly, they have no economy, no food. In the course of the 13th, 14th, and 15th years of the Vietnamese war of aggression, everything has been plundered. The country has been devastated. The people's land, water, and cattle have been destroyed. Moreover, the two-headed government has conscripted them into the army. As a result, the economy is in a shambles. In such a situation, they have been forced to put off their military campaigns again and again. They have postponed their initial 17 December 1993 plan to early January 1994. Their activities and failure can be summed up as follows: 1. Malai battlefield. They launched a three-pronged military attack on the 1 January 1994: the first prong along the Mongkolborei river; the second from Route 5 to Dong Aranh; and the third from Poipet into Thailand at Nang E, aimed at attacking from the rear. They deployed infantry along Route 5 backed by several pieces of heavy artillery, multiple rocket launchers, and armored vehicles. The forces in this campaign were the 12th Division at Nimit in charge of the Banteay Meanchey region; the 6th Division stationed along the Stoeng Mongkolborei river; and the 7th and 8th divisions, respectively stationed along Route 69 and at Phnum Srok. All together, four divisions from the Vietnamese communist puppets, ANKI [National Army of Independent Cambodia], and Dien Del [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] forces. The NADK and the people in the Malai region were aware of this scheme beforehand. Together, they foiled this so-called large-scale military campaign by displaying their high spirit of strong determination and responsibility toward the nation and people, preventing the enemy from carrying out their strategy and tactics to destroy the national forces and the people and to swallow up Cambodia. In the course of fighting which lasted for three days from 1-3 January 1994, the NADK and people successfully held the military campaign in check using mines, booby traps, and attacking from the front, the rear, and the flanks. This was combined with some heavy artillery along with political and economic activities. During this campaign, Pol Saroeun, the puppet military commander in Phnom Penh; Hul Savoan from Battambang and Prum Moranak, the zone military commander, were shamefully beaten back. These Vietnamese puppets were defeated but their masters continued stubbornly to desperately carry out their strategy. The Cambodian nation and people and the NADK living in the Malai region remain vigilant and prepare to struggle against the enemy. The latter must clearly realize that Democratic Kampuchea enjoys the support of the whole nation and people. Thus an attack against Democratic Kampuchea would amount to an attack against the whole nation and people. In the past, they have mounted countless attacks--large or medium or small--against Democratic Kampuchea. But they all failed. If they pursue their venture, the result would surely be the same, as in the case of the Vietnamese aggressors in the last 13 years. 2. Anlung Veng battlefield: They have prepared their military campaign against Anlung Veng and the Dangrek zone since November 1993. But they have failed to carry it out for lack of fighting forces, ammunition, and food. At the end of December, they tried again by dividing their forces in three prongs: the first from Route 68, particularly from Samraong eastward; the second from Varin and Sre Noy in Siem Reap Province; and the third from Kulen in Preah Vihear Province. Their combined forces deployed in that campaign include those of the Vietnamese communist puppets, ANKI, and Dien Del under the command of many so-called generals based on Route 68. Among them were Pol Saroeun, (Chuon Sovantha), (Uy Sopheap), Long Sopheap, Keo Pisit, (Prak Sovanna), and Nhoek Bunchhai. All of them were in desperate straits. Thus, their forces were decimated by mines everyday, armored vehicles were destroyed, and corpses were left on the ground. It is to be recalled that during their large-scale operations last September, their forces suffered a heavy loss by mines, malaria, and starvation. Besides, in order to attack Anlung Veng, they mobilized their forces in Ampil, Ku, Romchong, Thmar Puok, Kouk Mon, Kouk Khpos, Boeng Trakuon, and Banteay Chhma before sending them to Route 68 and Anlung Veng. But the NADK and the population have attacked their bases both on the east and west of Route 68 making them flee in disarray. As a result, the Route 68 battlefield and the enemy forces were divided in two parts, causing serious harm to the Vietnamese puppet forces' Divisions 286, 179, and 3 at O Smach, the 9th Division on Route 68, the 8th at Phnum Srok, and the 7th on Route 69. The present fighting causes panic among the two-headed government's forces. They desert daily in large numbers. Field commanders dare not show up in the field. Only the rank and file do so. But the latter refuse to die for their commanders, for the two-headed government, the Vietnamese communists, and the entente whose only objective is to exterminate the Cambodian nation and people. In summary, one can say that the military campaign against Anlung Veng was transformed into the battlefields east and west of Route 68, that of Varin-Siem Reap and Kulen-Preah Vihear, which form a large and active fighting area directly affecting the Vietnamese puppet forces, the U.S.-supported forces, and the entente who are responsible for the continuation of the war in Cambodia. It should be noted that in this battlefield, the people who have been angry since last September 1993 were actively participating in making the two-headed government's military campaign a failure. The enemy forces can be compared to people entering a bush fire which engulfs them from all sides. 3. Stoung battlefield in Kompong Thom Province. They have launched operations on the Stoung battlefield and Route 12 for quite some time. Their puppet commanders have been mobilized for that purpose. They began to seriously prepare their campaign in November and December 1993. However, they were successively checked by the NADK and the local population. All people in Kompong Thom, soldiers, policemen, even foreigners, were fully aware of who attacked whom. The population and the NADK in Stoung, exercising their right to self-defense, fought back and put them to rout. The main causes for their defeat are: A. The nation and people of Cambodia, as well as the peace-loving countries the world over, are opposed to the continuation of the Vietnamese war of aggression. B. The people want national reconciliation and peace while they flame the war. C. The enemy forces have committed mass killing destroying everything. As a result, people have fled their homes and villages and taken refuge in forests. These people have then become a people's force of hundreds of thousands of men and women fighting back both militarily and economically. They cut off the enemy's supply routes, laid mines and booby traps, and encouraged and called on their children to desert. Therefore, the NADK has closely identified with hundreds of thousands of people and together fought against enemy forces everywhere like sparrows landing in a ricefield. Democratic Kampuchea should not be looked (?alone) as a litter. It is closely linked and united with the people and all the national forces, making it an enormous force fighting for the defense and security of the Cambodian nation and people to this day. One may ask whether the aggressors fighting against the whole Cambodian nation and people have lost or won their war. They cannot escape defeat before the nation and people of Cambodia, who are so oppressed by anger that they would fight [word indistinct] to the end. IV. How to resolve the Cambodia conflict The only way is to achieve national reconciliation based on the five-point guideline of Samdech Euv, His Majesty the King. This five-point guideline represents the profound aspiration of the nation and people of Cambodia and that of peace-loving countries in the world. Whoever challenges these five points is against the Cambodian nation and people and against peace-loving countries in the world, in particular those in the region. Therefore, the trend of the Cambodian nation and people is leading toward national reconciliation in order to restore peace and provide opportunity for the rebuilding of the country and raising the people's standard of living. This would contribute to stability in the region as well. Hence, the beginning of 1994 is the last occasion for the thorough assessment of the situation. The fighting has lasted for already 13, 14, and 15 years. It must end. What has happened to the Vietnamese aggressors who have been well-known for their fighting skills? All the people have already learned this lesson. They have to see clearly who is with Democratic Kampuchea, that is, the whole nation and people of Cambodia. The five-point guideline of Samdech Euv is of paramount importance. Democratic Kampuchea has been now acclaimed as the one who holds the banner of national reconciliation and fights for that purpose. This is to say that the people and Democratic Kampuchea are one. Whoever opposes national reconciliation and continues the war would be doomed to fade away. [Dated] 10 January 1994 [Signed] The spokesman of the NADK.
