I. Danilov-Danilyan, minister of environmental protection of the RF as No. 37-2-7/435, dated 25 May 1993, and by Ye. N. Belyayev, chairman of the State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight as No. 01-19/22-22, dated 25 May 1993; registered with the RF Ministry of Justice, registry No. 279, on 18 July 1993] [Text] General Statutes 1.1. These instructions were prepared to implement Decree No. 869 of the Russian Federation, dated 12 November 1992, ``On State Registration of Potentially Hazardous Chemical and Biological Substances'' and in accordance with the Statute on State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances, which was adopted in the said Decree. 1.2. State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances (hereafter referred to as State registration) is performed to implement the requirements in articles 12, 13, and 14 of the Russian Federation Law on Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare of the Public, and articles 51 items 2 and 3 of the Russian Federation Law ``On Environmental Protection.'' 1.3. State registration is implemented in a Russian Register of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances (hereafter referred to as Register) for detection, accumulation of physicochemical, toxicological, ecotoxicological and other information, record-keeping and regulation of said substances in order to prevent their deleterious effects on human health and the environment. 1.4. An individual naturally occurring or synthetic substance (compound) that can have a deleterious effect on human health and the environment, when produced, used, transported, processed, as well as in household use, is considered a potentially hazardous chemical and/or biological substance. 1.5. All individual chemical and biological substances (compounds), including those contained in mixtures, produced and/or used on the territory of the Russian Federation, as well as imported substances, are subject to State registration. Substances containing impurities formed in the production process or when used are registered as individual substances. 1.6. Compound commercial chemicals, which must undergo hygienic certification in accordance with Decree No. 1, dated 5 January 1993, of the Goskomsanepidnadzor [Russian State committee for sanitary and epidemiological oversight], are not subject to State registration. 1.7. The procedure for State registration established in these Instructions does not extend to chemical and biological agents used to protect plants, farm crop and tree plantation growth regulators, pharmaceutical preparations, as well as radioactive substances, which are recorded or registered following previously established procedure by pertinent organizations. 1.8. Chemical and biological substances intended for production and use after 31 March 1993 (``new substances'') are subject to registration prior to production and use. Substances produced, used and processed on the territory of the Russian Federation, as well as imported, prior to 31 March 1993 (``old substances''), are subject to mandatory State registration within three years from the time of publication of these instructions. Specific registration dates must be coordinated with agencies of State sanitary oversight before 1 July 1993. 2. Procedure for State Registration 2.1. Chemical and biological substances (compounds) are registered when submitted by ministries, agencies, enterprises, organizations, institutions, other juridical entities, as well as individuals responsible for production and import of a given substance (compound), regardless of forms of ownership. 2.2. The registration process includes receiving applications, examining them and making the decision to register, and issuing a registration certificate. 2.3. The ``List of information needed for State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances,'' which is filled out by the applicant who is responsible for accuracy of furnished data, is the basis for registration. 2.4. Substances for which complete information could not be submitted at the time of registration, but the properties and area of application of which warrant belief that its hazard to man and the environment is immaterial, are subject to registration for a term of 3 years with assignment of a State registration number and issuance of registration certificated with annotation of the 3-year validity. Fullness (or lack of necessity to submit data for some parameter or other) of submitted information is determined in each specific instance by the Register in accordance with existing standard-setting and methodological documentation. If an applicant does not submit the necessary information within 3 years, as stipulated in the certificate, the registration certificate is no longer valid. 2.5. In the Register, there is a permanent group of experts, which is confirmed following established procedure, representing institutions of the Goskomsanepidnadzor of the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection examines the most difficult cases related to making decisions on State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances. 2.6. Assignment to a chemical and biological substance of a State registration number and issuance of a registration certificate confirm the adequacy and quality of ecotoxicological and other parameters, and serve as grounds to enter them in standards and specifications documentation (NTD, such as GOST, TU and others) in the sections ``Safety requirements'' and ``Environmental protection.'' 2.7. The finding as to conformity of specific production and use conditions for a substance with a State registration number to environmental protective and sanitary rules, adequacy of methods of assaying substances and conformity to NTD (GOST, TU, and others), as well as hygienic certification, are implemented by agencies of State sanitary and epidemiological oversight and Ministry Environmental Protection of the Russian Federation in accordance with sanitary and environment protective legislation. 2.8. Assignment of a State registration number and issuance of registration certificate are implemented on the basis of the expert finding of the Register's specialists and its approval by the director of the Register. 2.9. When registering a substance, the applicant remits payment in advance to the Register in accordance with the Statute approved by Decree No. 552 of the Russian Federation Government dated 5 Aug 92, as well as for upgrading performance and material-technical support of the system of State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances. 2.10. Applications for State registration are addressed in the name of the Register's director at 101479 Moscow, Vadkovskiy Lane, 18-20. 2.11. Documentation for registration must include: 2.11.1. a referral (cover letter) signed by an enterprise administrator or individual entrepreneur; 2.11.2. filled out ``List of information needed for State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances'' (Appendix 1); 2.11.3. materials, on the basis which the ``List of information....'' was filled out; 2.11.4. payment authorization to pay for the registration fee; 2.11.5. official conclusion of the applicant as to possible publication of State registration materials in the free press. 2.12. Registration materials are to be examined within 30 days. After assignment of a registration number, the Register issues a certificate of State registration of the established specimen (Appendix 2) and information form (Appendix 3) to the applicant, and publishes information about registration in the Register's information bulletin. 2.13. Validity of a registration certificate can be suspended by the Register if new data are received concerning previously unknown hazardous properties of a substance. The Register notifies the applicant of suspension of the registration certificate and/or ban on the substance within 10 days of making this decision, and publishes this information in the Register's information bulletin. 2.14. The Register guarantees confidentiality of information about a substance that is an industrial secret unless it poses a threat to human health and environmental safety. 2.15. The Register may, under specific conditions, rightfully refuse to issue a registration certificate. 2.16. An appeal of the Register's decision must be filed, no. later than 30 days after it is made, with the chairman of the Russian Goskomsanepidnadzor. The appeal is examined within 30 days. The decision of the chairman of the Russian Goskomsanepidnadzor may be appealed in Arbitration Court. 2.17. Enterprises and other business entities, regardless of the agency to which they pertain and form of ownership, organizations and institutions situated on the territory of the Russian Federation, individuals carrying out development, production and use, export and import of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances bear responsibility in accordance with the ``Statute on State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances,'' approved by Decree No. 869 of the Russian Federation Government dated 12 November 1992.
