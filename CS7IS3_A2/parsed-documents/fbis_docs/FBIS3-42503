Georgian troops opened artillery fire on positions of the Abkhazian armed forces. This was reported by the press service of the plenipotentiary of the Republic of Abkhazia in the Russian Federation. At the same time bands from Georgian formations stepped up their activities in Galskiy Rayon. In the meantime the press center of the Republic of Georgia's Ministry of Defense has issued its own assessment of the events. According to the Georgian side, under the pretext of combatting bands from the formations, Abkhazian formations numbering up to 2,500 men are engaged in actions against the civilian population in the region, continuing their ethnic cleansing in the territory under their control. According to the same source, Georgia's government troops have not yet taken action in response. The latest exacerbation of the situation has demonstrated once again that the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict cannot be resolved without a political settlement. Nor can one fail to consider the possibility that the events of 6 February could have been undertaken by forces on both sides of the Inguri which do not like the idea of establishing normal bilateral relations between Georgia and Russia.
