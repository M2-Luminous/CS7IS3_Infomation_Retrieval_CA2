What he is known for: As minister for information in the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Government he announced expulsion of journalists back on 13 June of last year ("Is it not illogical for so many falsehoods about the FRY to go out into the world, when credentials have not been taken away from a single journalist") and he recently decided to prohibit some 14 foreign journalists from working because of "satanization of the FRY and the Serbian people," which divided the domestic public and embittered the world public. What they reproach him for in the SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia]: He is a member of the most hard-line current among the incumbent members of the government and an unwavering advocate of the motto: Whoever is not with us must go. Ratomir Vico, newly appointed information minister in the Serbian Government, recently explained to him on a television program (there is a question of how serious he was) that Radio-TV Serbia must also broadcast the relevant views of opposition parties and groupings. Ignjatovic thanked him for having supplemented and spelled out his previously expressed thought that government television must exclusively represent the interests of the state. What the opposition has against him: As director of Radio-TV Serbia he did not allow coverage of the Saint Vitus' Day Rally. He explained his decision this way: "There is no reason for TV Belgrade to cover the rally when this is already being done by Independent TV Studio B and TV Politika" (BORBA, 3 July 1992). Some 17 deputies of DEPOS [Democratic Movement of Serbia], New Democracy, the Democratic Party, the People's Party of Montenegro, and the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro in the Citizens Chamber of the Assembly demanded that Ignjatovic be dismissed because of the expulsion of the foreign journalists, because that decision "placed the FRY and its citizens in still greater isolation from the world." How he got into politics: When KOMUNIST was shut down, where he restated in his own words the speeches of party bigwigs and said that there was no salvation for us without self-management of the working class, he went over to POLITIKA EKSPRES as an expert on the economy, but because he was not good at writing commentary, he thought about opening a grocery store. In the end, he gave that up and was elected a member of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which soon fell apart. Consistent with the policy of his party, he joined the management team of POLITIKA EKSPRES: editor in chief Slobodan Jovanovic, former executive secretary of the city committee of the League of Communists, and Dragoljub Milanovic, also a former executive secretary of the League of Communists of Serbia. How he won political points: His rating on the list of personnel jumped up sharply when with his perspicacity and comprehensive analysis he discovered and published that "fascistoid Ante Markovic is driving the people into beggary" and "intends to destroy Serbia and Yugoslavia." He announced to the public that "it was during the term of A. Markovic that inflation reached the highest level in the history of this country" (POLITIKA EKSPRES, 11 November 1990). What he has against certain periodicals: In an article entitled "The Independent Are Sullying the People" (VECERNJE NOVOSTI, 6 December 1993), in speaking about some of the media, Ignjatovic said that they "usually say that the present government is fascist." What he promised: Announcing the "offensive and preventive strategy of the ministry which he heads" (POLITIKA, 7 May 1993), Ignjatovic made the public announcement: "We have formed an intersector group which will take the offensive in supplying information in the FRY. We are studying the moves of all our media `friends' and we will be ready and waiting with everything cooked up in advance so that we can take appropriate steps in good time" (VECERNJE NOVOSTI, 13 June 1993). The results of that group are not evident, at least for the present. What his qualifications are: He graduated from the School of Philosophy at Belgrade University and took a master's degree in the School of Economics. What he should be afraid of: Those who put him in the post of minister. What inspires him: The investigative journalism of his young colleagues, of which he was an example at EKSPRES. In this style: "A full barrel of Serbian eyes from which the ustashi were making burek was discovered in Mirkovci," "Ante Markovic stole 28 kg of prosciutta from Uzice," "Even a little fellow is stronger than the embargo," "The wolf is lunching with Franjo," "Some 60 passengers were removed from the train and slaughtered in cornfields. The bodies still have not been found...."
