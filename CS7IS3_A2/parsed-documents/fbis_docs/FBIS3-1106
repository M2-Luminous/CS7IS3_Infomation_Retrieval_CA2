The following is the text of the statement: The 10th session of the OAU's South African Committee of heads of states and governments met in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, on 19 March 1994 to review the developments in South Africa on the eve of the first democratic and nonracial elections in that country. Participating in the meeting were Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, the current chairman of OAU; President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, president of the host country and head of the front-line states; Botswana's President Ketumile Masire, Cape Verde's President Antonio Mascarenhas, Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi, Mozambique's President Chissano, Namibian President Dr. Sam Nujoma, Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, and Zambian President Frederick Chiluba. Also present at the meeting were Angolan Prime Minister Marcolino Moco; Lieutenant General D. O. Diya, Nigerian Chief of the General Staff and vice-chairman of the Federal Executive Council; Benjamin Bounkoulou, Congolese minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation; Ahmed Djebbar, Algerian minister of national education; Osman Kamaza, Senegalese ambassador to Zimbabwe [name and title as received]; OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim; Johnson Mlambo, chairman of the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] of Azania; Alfred Nzo, member of the African National Congress [ANC] Executive Council [name and title as received]; and in the capacity of observer, Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the UN secretary general's representative in South Africa. The committee examined a report prepared by the OAU secretary general following his visit to South Africa and his extensive discussions with all concerned leaders there. The committee listened to reports on the current situation in South Africa presented by the leaders of the PAC and ANC delegations. The committee referred to the Harare Declaration, which it adopted on 21 August 1989 during its third regular session and which included the principles and directions for the negotiating process, and the program for ending apartheid and establishing a united, democratic, and nonracial state in South Africa. The committee welcomed the considerable progress achieved since its last meeting and the splendid success achieved by the multilateral negotiations, which produced historic agreements providing for democratic elections in South Africa on 26, 27, and 28 April 1994 and the establishment of transitional structures to hold those elections. The committee praised the spirit of tolerance shown by all parties involved in the peace process and the flexible attitudes which made the above achievement possible. The committee voiced regret at the escalating violence in the country and grave concern at recent reports about the involvement of senior officers in South Africa's security forces in the continuing violence. The committee urged all parties in South Africa to show tolerance and sincerely seek reconciliation to put an end to the reckless massacres and prepare a suitable climate to hold peaceful elections. The committee welcomed the PAC's decision to halt armed struggle unilaterally as of 16 April 1994. The committee termed this decision a contribution toward free and honest elections. The committee applauded South Africa's Transitional Executive Council and Government for their prompt efforts to contain the explosive situation in Bophuthatswana and urged them to continue their task of maintaining order, security, and law and guaranteeing free political action throughout the country so that the April elections can be held in an atmosphere free from violence and threats. The committee voiced support for the efforts to bring about national accord within the framework of an all-embracing process. Thanking all the leaders and parties involved in the electoral process, including those who joined it recently, for their sense of responsibility and perseverance, the committee regrets the decision by some parties to boycott the upcoming elections. The committee commended the Transitional Executive Council, which took firm measures to involve Bophuthatswana in the electoral process. The committee welcomed the meeting held recently between ANC Chairman Nelson Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and urged both leaders to continue the course of dialogue and cooperation, not just between themselves, but also with all the other political figures to end the devastating wave of violence and to pave the way for elections in a secure and peaceful atmosphere to build a new, democratic South Africa. The committee categorically rejected and candidly condemned recent threats and acts of violence by those who deliberately wish to wear down the people and prevent the majority of South Africans from exercising their lawful right to choose their leaders and turn the page on the tragic chapters of the past for the first time. It appealed to the patriotic spirit of party leaders boycotting the elections and threatening to obstruct and dismantle the electoral process to reconsider their position and refrain from depriving their people of the right to partake of the biggest and most serious change in the history of South Africa. It also appealed to them to do their utmost to guarantee freedom of political activity all over the country and to hold the elections in a safe, peaceful atmosphere. In this context, the committee expressed its deep concern over recent statements by kwaZulu leaders, statements that seek to destroy the country's unity. The OAU had rejected all attempts to partition the country, since they dramatically threaten peace and stability in the southern part of the continent and the entire region, and viewed these attempts as absolutely unacceptable. The committee invited the South African Government and all political leaders in South Africa to take the necessary measures to protect and guarantee South African territorial integrity. The OAU called on the international community to maintain its support for the democratic process in South Africa and to reject any attempt to divide the country. The committee reiterated its firm support for the democratic process in and the unity of South Africa, the process that serves and protects the greater interests of those living in the country, regardless of ethnic, cultural, or religious considerations. The committee is eager to see a new, democratic South Africa join the OAU house to enhance the organization and play its natural role in the greater international community. It welcomed the participation of the international community, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the British Commonwealth, in monitoring the elections. It urged all South African parties to cooperate fully with the international observers in their mission. In this context, the committee expressed its appreciation of the OAU member states that pledged to send observers to monitor the elections and urged those that have not done so to do the same. On behalf of all OAU member states, the heads of states and the heads of delegations taking part in the 10th ordinary session of the Southern African Committee welcome the new South Africa as a member of the OAU after the April 1994 elections and the establishment of a democratic government. The heads of states and governments and delegation chairmen expressed their deep appreciation and gratitude for His Excellency President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and the government and people of Zimbabwe for their hospitality and the excellent facilities they have provided to them during their meeting.
