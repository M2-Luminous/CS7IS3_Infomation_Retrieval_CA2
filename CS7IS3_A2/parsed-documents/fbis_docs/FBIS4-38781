"In any case, our delegation must spare no efforts in order to put an end to all the current negative processes in the Crimea. We will do our best to settle all the problems in a civilized manner," delegation head Vladimir Butkevich told TASS before departure. According to the lawmaker, the delegation has received "broad powers to conduct negotiations on the whole range of disputed problems, including economic and juridical ones, as well as problems of security." Butkevich stressed that the delegation will act in compliance with a parliamentary resolution stipulating that the Crimea's decision to reinstate the 1992 constitution was illegal and contradicted the laws of Ukraine. The parliament asked President Kravchuk to draw up before 6 June a list of measures which state power bodies could use against the Crimea in case the republic violate's the country's Constitution.
