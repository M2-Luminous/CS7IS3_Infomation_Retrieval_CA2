Between one-fourth and one-third of former CDA voters find Brinkman an unapproachable figure, or are of the opinion that he is not a good successor to Lubbers. This finding, to the detriment, of the CDA emerges from an election poll commissioned by DE VOLKSKRANT and carried out by the NIPO [National Institute for Polling Public Opinion], in conjunction with the University of Amsterdam. According to the poll, as things stand at present, the CDA stands to lose 16 seats in the Lower Chamber. The two-day CDA party election conference starts in Rotterdam today. Brinkman's poor standing is apparent from the fact that one-fifth of faithful CDA voters regard him as the weak link in the party. Twenty-one percent of those asked cited the fact that Brinkman is not a good successor to Lubbers as a reason not to vote for the CDA. The CDA's supporters rank as the third most dissatisfied with their party leader: However, the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] are more unhappy with their leader Bolkstein, and the Center Democrats [extreme right-wing party] rate their leader, Janmaat, even less. On average, there is even greater dissatisfaction with Brinkman among the former CDA voters than among the electorate as a whole. Especially older voters (aged 55 and over) cite Brinkman decidedly more often as a reason not to vote for the CDA. As the intended prime minister, too, Brinkman scores lower among CDA voters than some other politicians. For instance, the CDA voters have considerably greater confidence in ex-VVD leader Wiegel as prime minister than they have in Brinkman. [passage omitted] Among the doubting CDA voters, D66 [Democrats 66] top candidate Van Mierlo enjoys just as much, if not greater, support than Brinkman. Van Mierlo emerges from the poll as the party leader commanding the greatest confidence among the electorate. His popularity is a major reason for the major gains made by the D66. Only Lubbers and Wiegel command greater confidence as prime minister than the D66 leader. According to the poll, PvdA [Labor Party] leader Kok also commands considerably greater confidence as prime minister than Brinkman. The newly appointed foreign minister, Van Thijn, ranks as virtually neck-and-neck with Kok. The voters judged him to be much better than the current number two within the PvdA, Secretary of State Wallage. Of all the leading politicians, VVD leader Bolkestein commands the least confidence as prime minister among the voters. Bolkestein even rates poorly in liberal circles. One-fifth of VVD supporters consider Bolkestein as a potential reason not to vote for the VVD. Nearly 90 percent of VVD voters have confidence in Wiegel as prime minister. In Bolkestein's case, this figure is less than 60 percent. The electorate has a rather low opinion of Elco Brinkman. Forty-seven percent of all voters consider the adjective "sly" to be fitting in describing him. Only 30 percent of them consider him to be a "true leader," and only 28 percent claim to find him "likable." The CDA voters are slightly less damning. Forty-five percent of them consider Brinkman to be "sly," 65 percent of them regard him as a "true leader," and 57 percent claim to find him "likable." [passage omitted]
