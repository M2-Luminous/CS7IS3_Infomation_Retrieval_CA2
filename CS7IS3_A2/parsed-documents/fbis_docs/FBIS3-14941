As the president of the Soviet parliament until 1991, for many years he was the most powerful man in the USSR, after Gorbachev. Arrested and imprisoned as one of the promoters of the failed coup against perestroyka, he suddenly seemed a finished man, destined to end his days in jail. However, after having been released on parole, last December he was elected deputy for the Smolensk uninominal constituency ("supported by 102,000 voters," he emphasized proudly), in the most democratic elections in Russia's history. He represents a unique case worldwide, worthy of the Guinness book of records: a defendant who, in his capacity as deputy, voted in favor of his own amnesty, and thus pardoned himself. In this interview with LA REPUBBLICA, this resilient "great old man" explained the Duma's sensational decision. [Franceschini] Was the amnesty a way of challenging the president? [Lukyanov] No. It was a legitimate step, a proposal aiming at peaceful coexistence, so that we stop treating each other like enemies. [Franceschini] But an amnesty is a "pardon": By accepting it, are you not in fact acknowledging your guilt as regards involvement in the 1991 coup? [Lukyanov] Not at all. The amnesty provides for the suspension of the proceedings. It does not bring in a verdict of guilt. I never admitted being guilty, and I certainly will not do so now. [Franceschini] You are known as an eminent jurist. Is this amnesty -- which pardons at the same time those who were persecuted for ideological offenses and those who fired their weapons and killed people during last October's insurrection -- not abhorrent to you? [Lukyanov] If, among the rebel parliament's defenders, those who fired should be prosecuted, then those who fired on parliament should also be prosecuted -- those who opened fire first, and those who ordered the White House to be shelled. The authors of that attack were never prosecuted, so it is only natural that those who were on the other side should also be pardoned. [Franceschini] Has the Duma permanently given up conducting an enquiry into last October's violent incidents, in exchange for the amnesty? Will you no longer attempt to prosecute Yeltsin? [Lukyanov] We would have been forced to give up sooner or later, anyway, because the government was not providing us with any of the necessary evidence for an enquiry. However, even without our contribution, some day public opinion will demand that this matter be cleared up. The country wants to know the truth. [Franceschini] Do you think Yeltsin will try to block the amnesty at the very last minute? [Lukyanov] If he does so, he would be smothering the new-born constitution. The Duma has acted lawfully. A reasonable politician will not take such a step. He does not enjoy enough popular support to afford doing that kind of thing. [Franceschini] Does this mean, then, that the struggle between the president and parliament has come to an end? [Lukyanov] Can the struggle come to an end if the government does not change its policy? No, it cannot. Because of such a policy, social inequality has reached unprecedented levels in Russia. If Yeltsin does not change his policy, the struggle will flare up again even more forcefully. [Franceschini] Do you not think that Yeltsin has already changed his policy, by making the radical reformers leave the government, and slowing down the pace of reform? [Lukyanov] It is too late. He should have done so two years ago. I hope that common sense will prevail now. If Yeltsin defends the state's heritage, if he safeguards the most basic human rights, if he seriously combats crime, and protects our country's -- rather than some other country's -- interests in the international arena, then we will support him. [Franceschini] Once he is free, will former Vice President Rutskoy become the head of the opposition? [Lukyanov] Rutskoy is jointly responsible for a large part of Yeltsin's policies, starting from the liquidation of the USSR. His former political prisoner's halo will not be enough to enable him to become the country's new leader. [Franceschini] Gorbachev has expressed concern over the amnesty. [Lukyanov] Gorbachev should be happy that he will not have to testify in our trial. Thus he will not risk ending up on the defendants' bench rather than staying among the witnesses. [Franceschini] Do you consider yourself a communist? Would you like to restore the dictatorship of the proletariat? [Lukyanov] We cannot go back, dictatorship will never again be possible. Despite the fact that today we are living under an authoritarian, Bonapartist regime, with all the power concentrated in the president's hands, democracy is a conquest that no one can take back from us. Within the Duma, I am not part of the communist group, but the communists call me the parliament's Deng Xiao Ping. Said by them, I regard it as a compliment. [Franceschini] While you were in prison you wrote poetry. Are you still writing any or did your inspiration dry out? [Lukyanov] I am still writing. However, in prison I wrote 200 poems, but I have only written 30 as a free man. "Outside" there is no time to reflect. Who knows, perhaps I would be happier "inside."
