He made these remarks while meeting with foreign delegates attending an international seminar on China's new investment style of "B.O.T. (build, operate and transfer)". China's reform and opening to the outside world demand a peaceful international environment and China is willing to cultivate economic cooperation with foreign nations and international organizations, the vice-premier said. Each party should make use of its own strengths in the cooperation, he said, adding that many Western countries have advanced technology, management systems and abundant capital, which could be combined with China's rich natural resources. In addition, he said, China has established a certain economic basis. The country also has a huge market potential and its labor costs are lower. The combination of both parties will be mutually beneficial, he said. The vice-premier told the delegates that China is willing to cooperate with foreign partners in various forms, including the "B.O.T.", which is quite "acceptable". Senior executives from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other international organizations as well as internationally prominent companies participated in the seminar, which was sponsored by the State Planning Commission.
