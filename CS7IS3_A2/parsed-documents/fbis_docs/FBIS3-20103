In the first round last Sunday, the two parties in Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's coalition and their allies garnered 44.59 percent of the votes, the same score as in March 1993 general elections in which they trounced the then-ruling Socialist Party. The Socialists made a respectable showing last weekend, taking more than 22 percent of the votes compared to 17.59 in the disastrous legislative election. Up for grabs in the second round run-offs were 1,372 councillors' posts in France's 95 departments. Only about a third of the races had clear-cut winners in the first round. The election is also Balladur's first national-level test since he came to power a year ago. He is widely believed to have presidential aspirations. President Francois Mitterrand's term ends in May of next year. Turnout as of 5:00 p.m. [1500 GMT] was about 48 percent, down slightly from last Sunday, the Interior Ministry said. Polls closed at 6:00 p.m. [1600 GMT] in most areas, except in large cities, where they were to remain open an extra two hours. The voting comes after a week of angry and sometimes violent demonstrations by students opposed to a government plan to fight record unemployment by letting businesses pay young people a lower minimum wage. Political analysts said the effect of the demonstrations at the ballot box was hard to predict. The occasional outbursts of violence by the students might translate into support for the government and its efforts to fight crime, the analysts said. But at the same time, the students' opposition to the government employment plan might be reflected in the electorate as a whole, the analysts added. In any case the election is not expected to cause any major shift in the balance of power on the local level. Right-wing parties currently control 75 of the country's 95 departments, compared to 12 for the socialists, six for their left-wing allies and two for the communists.
