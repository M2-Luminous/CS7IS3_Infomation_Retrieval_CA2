The existence of the Greek minority in Albania and of Albanian refugees in Greece are circumstances that favor this cooperation and ease bilateral understanding. Mr. Serreqi stressed that, viewed from a judicial aspect and considering the resources it possesses, Albania, which has made concrete steps toward a market economy, sees as a favorable circumstance the fact that Greece, as the only Balkan country near the EC and being the EC president for the current six-month period, can possibly influence Albania's concrete engagement in EC economic projects.
