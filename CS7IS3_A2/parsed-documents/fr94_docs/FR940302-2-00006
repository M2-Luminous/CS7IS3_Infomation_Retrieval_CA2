SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Access Board established a Recreation Access Advisory Committee to provide advice on issues related to making recreational facilities and outdoor developed areas readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This advice will be used by the Access Board to develop accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 for newly constructed and altered recreational facilities and outdoor developed areas. The advisory committee is composed of owners and operators of various recreational facilities; persons who design recreational facilities or manufacture related equipment; Federal, State and local government officials responsible for parks and other outdoor developed areas; and individuals with disabilities and organizations representing the interests of such persons. The Recreation Access Advisory Committee has formed subcommittees to assist in its work. The subcommittees include: Amusement Parks; Golf; Play Area Settings; Recreational Boating and Fishing; Developed Outdoor Recreation Facilities and Areas; and Sports Facilities. Subcommittee meetings will be held on Friday, March 18, 1994 (11 a.m.&hyph;2:30 p.m.) and at other scheduled dates. The public is encouraged to attend subcommittee meetings and to provide input in the form of written material. Information about these subcommittees can be obtained from Peggy Greenwell at the address indicated at the beginning of this notice. This meeting is open to the public and meeting sites will be accessible to individuals with disabilities. Sign language interpreters and assistive listening systems will be available for individuals with hearing impairments. Lawrence W. Roffee, Executive Director.
