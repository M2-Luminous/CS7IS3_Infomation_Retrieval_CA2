The path traveled by the EU and Ukraine to meet each other during the year-long negotiating process was not easy. There were both points of mutual understanding and seemingly insurmountable -- at first glance -- obstacles; however, victory was achieved by the joint desire of both sides to establish legal foundations for Ukraine's joining European processes. In one fell swoop, Ukraine has ceased to be a subject of international relations in spite of its own will. With regard to the official membership of the former Ukrainian SSR to the United Nations and other organizations with their headquarters in Europe, this did not make Ukraine a full-fledged participant in the European community of nations. This is why the joining of European economic and political structures is a logical and necessary direction in Ukraine's foreign policy at the current stage. Ukraine ranks fifth in Europe in terms of population and first in terms of area. It is not a reason for pride or some pretensions, but this fact cannot be disregarded, either. Europe, too, has many key positions in Ukraine: transit highways, reserves of raw materials, and ten of millions of qualified producers and perspective consumers; or, quite the opposite -- a potential hotbed of instability if the ark of Ukrainian statehood goes to pieces. Therefore, many things depend on how Western states approach our country. The EU, in this context, plays a leading part. The development of multifarious cooperation between Ukraine and the EU is a path toward the gradual integration of the Ukrainian economy into the European economic zone and the establishment of broad economic ties with leading European countries, without loosing traditional ties within the CIS framework. In 1993-94, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, with the participation of a number of branch ministries and departments, held four rounds of official talks with the European Commission on the concluding of a framework agreement on partnership and cooperation. The Ukrainian side raised the question of broadening the framework of cooperation, which was fixed in a draft agreement proposed by the European Commission, to the level of conditions stipulated by appropriate agreement on associate membership, in particular, with Poland, Hungary, and other East European countries. This is the first agreement on cooperation to be concluded with a republic of the former USSR. This agreement provides a reliable and large-scaled basis for the development and expansion of political and economic relations between the EU and Ukraine, and is another piece of evidence supporting democratic processes in independent Ukraine, as well as of the significance assigned to Ukraine's political and economic reforms by the EU. This document underscores the importance of democratic values, respect for human rights, and dedication to the principles of market economy, and treats them as an important element of partnership between the EU and Ukraine. The sides also believe that the development and strengthening of regional cooperation, as well as the support of Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, are important prerequisites for the future prosperity and stability in Central and East Europe, as well as on the European continent as a whole. The foundations were also built for full-fledged and mutually beneficial cooperation between Ukraine and the EU in the wide realm of political, economic, and humanitarian questions; in the immediate future, it will be possible for Ukraine to obtain political support and economic assistance in its efforts to democratize social life and reform the economy according to market principles. The political part of the agreement confirms the importance and necessity of the contribution made by both sides toward the consolidation of a new democratic Europe, as well as the development of political and economic process on the European continent. It is a matter of principle to introduce permanent political dialogue and a system of regular consultations on all levels and in the entire network of political, economic, and other issues of mutual interests. In the economic part of the document, the EU notes the important character of Ukraine's efforts to transform itself from a state monopoly over trade and system of centralized state management of the economy to a system based on market principles; the EU also expresses the need to render permanent assistance to our country in this direction. The sides agreed that mutual trade will be liberalized according to GATT principles, while taking into account amendments that were introduced during the recent Uruguay round of negotiations. The EU will lift its restrictions on trade with Ukraine with the exception of so-called "sensitive" goods, including steel, coal, textiles, agricultural products, and nuclear materials. Trade in these branches will be regulated by special agreements, which are already prepared, or are being prepared, on the basis of quotas established for Ukraine. On the other hand, Ukraine also has the possibility to introduce certain quantitative limitations in new branches of industry and in those branches which are subject to restructuring. However, it should be noted that these limitations may be operational in the transitional period, prior to 31 December 1998, or prior to the joining of GATT by Ukraine if this joining takes place earlier. It is a well-known fact that our country attaches special importance to the issue of antidumping procedures in the sphere of expanding economic cooperation with the EU "12." Provisions of the economic part of the agreement testify to the positive stance of EU countries with regard to the solution of this problem. In particular, this concerns the possibility of a constructive and flexible mechanism for examining antidumping issues through consultations. As market reforms in Ukraine proceed, the sides will revise the provisions of certain chapters, in particular, those on trade to create a free trade zone between the EU and Ukraine. Therefore, the last year of the transitional period, that is, 1998, will see the outset of consultations on the beginning of a negotiating process to create a zone which can become an intermediate link toward the full membership of our country in the EU. Even today we may speak about positive results in the relations between Ukraine and the EU. The EU Council of Ministers session, which preceded the signing of the agreement, was also devoted to the discussion of assistance to Ukraine, in particular, the financing of compensation capacities at the Rivne, Khmelnytskyy, and Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plants, which would be able to solve the problems of energy deliveries in the event of Chernobyl's shutdown. Regarding the idea of Ukraine's future associate membership in the EU, it should be noted that the implementation of this idea is quite realistic. It is difficult to predict for the time being how far-reaching and strategic will be the consequences of the relations which are just beginning to take shape on a permanent and legal basis. First, this will depend to a great extent on the steadfastness and tempo of democratic processes and, which is especially important, of economic reforms in Ukraine. Second, this will also depend on the meeting of obligations which were made by both sides under the agreement. The signing of this historic document opens the door for our future membership in the European area, but it does not guarantee that we will join this area. It is up to us whether we will be able to use this opportunity. It depends on how proficient we are in resolving problems, safeguarding the implementation of economic reforms, transforming and demilitarizing the economy, implementing large-scale privatization, and stabilizing credit and monetary sphere. It is quite within the scope of our powers to do this.
