In the second round of presidential elections, which are due in May, 1995, Rocard would score 42 percent against 58 percent for Balladur, said the Louis Harris poll for the weekly VALEURS ACTUELLES. But Rocard improved his score by four points on a similar poll carried out a month ago while Balladur lost four points. If the contest was with Chirac, Rocard would win 44 percent of the vote against 56 percent for Chirac, the poll said. The figures were identical to last month's.
