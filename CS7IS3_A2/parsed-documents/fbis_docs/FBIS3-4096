Every company applying for a loan from the IECF must submit, together with the loan application document, a copy of the report on the feasibility study on the project concerned, a copy of the economic returns analysis report, and a report on the company's capital flow. 2. To keep the authorities informed of the spending of the loan extended by the IECF, every borrower is to forward in a timely manner a report on the spending of the loan extended by the IECF and a relevant financial statement to both MOFERT and the Ministry of Finance. 3. In compliance with the current interest rate for bank loans, the annual interest rate for loans extended by the IECF is to be readjusted as of 1 April 1989 to 4 percent per annum for loans in Renminbi and 5 percent per annum for loans in U.S. dollars. Loans granted before 1 April 1989 also will have their interest rates readjusted to the above annual rates effective 1 July 1989. 4. In the case of any debtor failing to repay the loan as scheduled for any special reason, it is to apply to MOFERT for late repayment one month before the loan is due. MOFERT can approve the application for late repayment, provided the application is found, on examination, to be justified. However, in this case, the interest is to instead be charged on the loan according to the annual rates fixed by the Bank of China and the Construction Bank of China. Should the reasons given to support the late repayment application be found unjustified, no late repayment will be allowed, and the interest rate for the loan will be readjusted to the annual interest rates fixed by the Bank of China and the Construction Bank of China effective on the due date of the loan. In addition, an extra 20 percent financial service fee will be charged to the debtor. [Signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Ministry of Finance 20 April 1989
