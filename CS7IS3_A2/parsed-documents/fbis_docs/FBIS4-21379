FBIS4-21379 "jpten009___94045" JPRS-TEN-94-009 JPRS Environmental Issues 11 February 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA RUSSIA Draft Document on Effects of Pollution on Health of Russian Draft Document on Effects of Pollution on Health of Russian Population 94WN0187B Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI in Russian 11 Feb 94 p 4 94WN0187B Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Russian CSO [Abridged report of Interdepartmental Commission of RF Security Council on Ecological Safety: "Each Person Must Decide How To Save Himself and His Children"] [Text] Around 28.2 million tonnes of pollutants from 18,000 stationary sources and another 22 million tonnes from mobile sources were discharged into the air of Russian cities and smaller communities in 1992. This is equivalent to 300 kilograms of pollutants for each inhabitant of Russia during the year. The leaders in industrial discharges of solid substances are Magnitogorsk, Nizhniy Tagil, and Chelyabinsk, as well as the cities of Asbest, Troitsk, and Suvorov; the highest levels of sulfur dioxide emissions have been recorded in Norilsk, Monchegorsk, Nikel, Orsk, and Omsk; the highest levels of nitrogen dioxide emissions are in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Surgut, Asbest, and Omsk; the highest levels of carbon monoxide emissions are in Novokuznetsk, Magnitogorsk, Lipetsk, Cherepovets, and Nizhniy Tagil. Vehicle emissions are at the highest levels in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Krasnodar, Omsk, Ufa, Volgograd, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, and Voronezh. Calculation methods based on the relationship between the total amount of substance discharged and its allowable concentration are used in the hygienic assessment of discharges of toxic substances into the air. This coefficient, which is known as the "relative risk coefficient," served as the basis for the categorization of substances in order of risk and the cities where these substances are present in the atmosphere. The main substances recorded were benzpyrene, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, which are connected with the substantial emissions of power engineering facilities, and lead. It must be borne in mind that official emission statistics do not reflect the whole spectrum of pollutants because some enterprises do not submit this information in the necessary detail. Furthermore, many enterprises discharging substances containing toxic metals that are dangerous to human health are not included in these indicators. Official air pollution statistics also do not include emissions of toxic metals resulting from the consumption of solid and liquid fuel (coal and fuel oil). Calculations based on information about the elements of fuel indicate that the volatile microelements contained in coal--arsenic, mercury, bromine, and antimony--enter the atmosphere along with thousands of tonnes of vanadium, manganese, fluorine, and zinc compounds. The estimated 80 million tonnes of fuel oil used each year in power engineering pollute the air with thousands of tonnes of vanadium, nickel, boron, and bromine and dozens of tonnes of many other elements. Motor transport is a major source of lead particles in the air of virtually all Russian cities (except Moscow). These emissions can amount to 2,000 tonnes a year. An assessment of the relative danger of discharged metals indicates that lead is the main hazard--furthermore, it is the most pervasive element--followed by compounds of vanadium, nickel, manganese, and fluorine. The relative danger of pollutants in the air of different cities was judged by six types of substances (solids, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds) listed in official reports. The leaders in terms of the relative danger of emissions per unit of municipal area are Norilsk, Nikel, Novotroitsk, Angarsk, Monchegorsk, Novokuybyshevsk, Magnitogorsk, Cherepovets, Orsk, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Novokuznetsk, Nizhniy Tagil, Zima, Zapolyarnyy, Sterlitamak, Lipetsk, and Salavat (Table 1). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Relative Risk Coefficient of Pollution in Some Cities | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |City |Coefficient | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moscow |0.70 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yekaterinburg |0.74 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kaliningrad |1.21 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Berezniki |1.59 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Prokopyevsk |1.64 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Samara |1.70 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ufa |1.78 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Arkhangelsk |1.98 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Komsomolsk-on-Amur |2.21 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Volzhskiy |2.27 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Perm |2.90 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Krasnoyarsk |3.18 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Khabarovsk |3.18 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chelyabinsk |3.45 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Volgograd |3.51 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dzerzhinsk |3.65 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kemerovo |3.95 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tolyatti |3.99 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kamensk-Uralskiy |4.04 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Shelekhov |4.19 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Groznyy |4.26 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Barnaul |4.36 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Omsk |4.49 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Salavat |5.67 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lipetsk |5.99 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sterlitamak |6.19 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Zima |7.23 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Zapolyarnyy |8.55 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nizhniy Tagil |8.98 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Novokuznetsk |9.57 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk |10.14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Orsk |10.52 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cherepovets |12.28 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Magnitogorsk |12.30 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Novokuybyshevsk |13.88 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Monchegorsk |14.17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Angarsk |14.44 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Novotroitsk |15.35 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nikel |22.83 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Norilsk |85.85 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Many cities where the air is polluted by substantial quantities of organic and inorganic substances--small and medium-sized metallurgical cities in the Urals and the chemical production areas in Stavropol Kray and in Kirov and other oblasts--are not on the list. A detailed description of the composition of emissions, with a view to the makeup of organic substances and the presence of metals, could change the ranking of cities considerably. The problem of dioxins entering the air and the environment also requires immediate action. Existing estimates and evaluations of technological processes suggest that the existence of dioxin could present problems in around 20 cities in Russia. The large quantities of substances entering the air of cities are resulting in higher concentrations of pollutants in the air. According to the 1992 state report on the environment of the Russian Federation, levels of air pollution exceeding 10 times the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) were recorded in many of Russia's cities and industrial centers. The most highly polluted cities with metallurgical industry include Lipetsk, Magnitogorsk, Kamensk-Uralskiy, Krasnoyarsk, Nizhniy Tagil, Novokuznetsk, Cherepovets, and Bratsk; the most highly polluted cities with chemical industry include Berezniki, Omsk, Perm, Tolyatti, Usolye-Sibirskoye, and many others. The combined findings of air pollution studies by Roskomgidromet [Russian Hydrometeorology Committee] indicate the presence of a variety of pollutants in the air of many cities (Table 2). Cities with the Highest Concentrations of a Group of Specific Pollutants City Substances and maximum concentrations Perm ammonia (74), hydrogen chloride (12), ethylbenzene (59), toluene (64), benzene (13), xylene (26), styrene (58), sulfuric acid (22) Omsk ammonia (30), xylene (4-6), ammonia (24) Berezniki hydrogen chloride (15), sulfuric acid (17), xylene (3) Dzerzhinsk hydrogen chloride (20), ethylbenzene (30) Tolyatti ammonia (30), toluene (14), benzene (9), styrene (20), xylene (3) Kemerovo ammonia (27), formaldehyde (11) Nizhniy Tagil phenol (5) Lipetsk formaldehyde (10), ammonia (10) Volzhskiy hydrogen sulfide (47), formaldehyde (2) The group of identified substances in the air depends largely on the analytical capabilities of local laboratories, and this is the reason for the high number of identified ingredients in Perm, for example, with its well-equipped laboratory. The results of air quality surveys at Roskomgidromet stations that are published in almanacs provide no opportunities for assessing the spatial features of pollutant distribution. Air pollution levels near enterprises are much higher, however, than the city averages. In the air near the Permneftorgsintez enterprise in Perm, for example, the concentration of phenol can be as high as 22 times the MAC, the concentration of sulfur dioxide is 3.8 times the MAC, and the concentration of nitrogen dioxide is 6.6 times the MAC. The concentrations of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrylaldehyde, acetone, ethanol, and butanol in the air of residential neighborhoods near the Khimvolokno and Azot enterprises in Kemerovo are 250 times the MAC. Higher concentrations of pollutants in the air are carried for long distances encompassing sizable developed territories. In Berezniki, for example, a city surrounded by potassium production units, the concentration of many pollutants exceeds the maximum allowable concentration even at a distance of 5 kilometers from the plant. An analysis of some of the results of air pollution surveys conducted by the public health service, scientific research institutes, and departmental laboratories revealed even more problems with air quality than those listed in the reports of Roskomgidromet. Pediatrics and Air Pollution The level (or quality) of public health depends on many biological, socioeconomic, medical-organizational, and ecological factors. An analysis of just one health indicator--the number of children with chronic illnesses in clinic records--throughout the Russian Federation reveals that the number doubled between 1980 and 1990 and reached around 6.5 million in 1990. Therefore, one out of every five children had one chronic illness. Of the 16 recorded types of illnesses, there was a higher rate of chronic pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis, and sinusitis (2.3 times the earlier figure), iron deficiency anemia (1.5 times), and bronchial asthma (1.3 times). The ecological component plays a significant role in the etiology of all of these illnesses. It is possible that if there were separate medical statistics for the urban population of large industrial cities, the rise in the rate of illness would be even more perceptible there. Studies of the health of schoolchildren, conducted according to a single set of methods over many years (1960-1990), indicated that the number of virtually healthy children in the first grade decreased over the 30 years from 60.8 percent to 45.4 percent, and the number in the eighth grade decreased from 59.8 to 47.9 percent. The rate of chronic illness in these age groups rose from 39.2 to 54.6 percent (first grade) and from 40.2 to 52.1 percent for the eighth-graders. The most severe effects of environmental pollution take the form of the higher rate of infant mortality and the increased frequency of birth defects. Many studies of the effects of environmental pollution on the state of public health record a significant rise in various indicators of illness among children, primarily respiratory disorders. Half of the adult patients have suffered from bronchial asthma since childhood. In recent years this disease has grown indisputably "younger." Cases of bronchial asthma in children in the first months of life are no longer extremely rare. In some cities the number of people with bronchial asthma is five or six times as high as it was. In Moscow, for example, the rate of bronchial asthma among children was seven times higher in 1981 than in 1949 (6.9 cases for each 1,000 children). In St. Petersburg the number of children suffering from bronchial asthma increased from 2.9 per 1,000 in 1982 to 3.7 per 1,000 in 1987. The number suffering from asthmatic bronchitis also rose: from 6 to 7.7 per 1,000 (T. Pogorelova and I. Malysheva, 1986). The rising rate of bronchopulmonary disorders is connected largely with air pollution in the cities. The rate of upper respiratory disease in children in the zone affected by chemical production units in Samara is twice as high as the average. The rate in neighborhoods near petrochemical production units and petroleum refineries is 2.5 times as high; the rate near the metallurgical combine is 4 or 5 times as high, and so forth. In a city with metallurgical industry the rate of otorhinological disease is 3-5 times the average near the combine, 2-3 times the average at a distance of 1.5 kilometers from the combine, and 1.5 times the average at a distance of 6 kilometers. Moscow Statistics Illustrating Spatial Features of Distribution of Bronchial Asthma Among Children The highest levels of air pollution are in the center, northwest, and northeast of the city. The rate of bronchial asthma in children within the territory of 110 pediatric clinics here is three or more times as high as indicators in "clean" districts of the city. All exceptions were closely correlated with the spatial locations of major highways and industrial enterprises. The loci of this illness are concentrated in homes situated near the zoo, the race track, the perfume factory, and other plants and major highways. ...A direct relationship between bronchopulmonary disease in children and the level of air pollution has also been discovered in several other parts of the country. The very fact that twice as many children in the Russian Federation died of bronchial asthma in 1990 as in 1980 is indicative. The results of clinical epidemiological studies of the role of air pollution in the onset of pulmonary disease in children in one of the most highly polluted Russian cities--Nizhniy Tagil--are indicative. Starting in the 1970s, more and more children in Nizhniy Tagil began complaining of hoarseness and breathing difficulties that did not fit the usual clinical definition of pneumonia or typical bronchial asthma. The same child could suffer from bronchial obstructions several times a year. This coincided with the start-up of the bank of coke ovens in December 1986 without the necessary dust and air filters. It was then that the rate of tracheobronchitis rose and asthmatic attacks in children became more common. The number of children hospitalized with bronchial asthma in the city also rose. The effects of air pollution are experienced by the residents of industrial cities and of small communities located near industrial enterprises, gas and oil fields, and toxic waste disposal sites. There is so little information about the state of public health in these communities, and the findings of existing studies can only be viewed as preliminary results. The village of Cherkasskiy near Ufa has a population of 2,300. The village is surrounded on three sides by oil refineries, a synthetic alcohol plant, and the "Khimprom" enterprise. Concentrations of phenol in the air are 1.9-4.2 times the MAC, the level of hydrocarbons is 2.7 times the MAC, and the hydrogen sulfide level is 1.5 times the MAC. Drinking water does not meet standard requirements in terms of organoleptic or chemical indicators. The children there are more likely than those in the control group to suffer from disorders of the respiratory organs, the central nervous system, the skin, and the urinary organs. The rate of these illnesses is also higher among adults, as well as the rate of cardiovascular and otorhinolaryngological disease (materials of the Ufa Scientific Research Institute of Human Ecology and Occupational Medicine). The pollution of the air with emissions of specific pollutants has had severe effects in several cases: Specific symptoms and complex syndromes. The most disturbing and most vivid examples are the effects of the operations of plants producing protein-vitamin concentrates and other enterprises of the microbiological industry.... The rate of bronchial asthma rose dramatically in Angarsk after the start of operations at the protein-vitamin concentrate plant in 1979. The number of cases of chronic upper respiratory disease in children increased 7.3-fold and there was an eightfold increase in the number of cases of chronic bronchitis. The mass poisoning of the population occurred in 1988. People living near plants producing antibiotics in Saransk have complained of frequent pains in their joints and skin rashes. The growth of antibiotic production has been accompanied by coughing, sneezing, and allergic rhinitis. Special studies attest to the specific allergization of the organism to penicillin (52 percent of the respondents), the candida antigen (54.5 percent), or both antigens (29 percent). ...In the "aluminum" cities, just as in some other large industrial centers, dental pathology is accompanied by changes in the whole motor-reflex apparatus in children. A special in-depth study of the children in Shelekhov, which is the site of an aluminum plant, revealed that the frequency of skeletal dysplasia was three times the average, corroborating the data on the osteotropic properties of fluoric compounds. Physical Development of Children A variety of functional and morphological defects in children exposed to the effects of air pollution arises virtually at the time of birth. This is connected with the effects of air pollution on the mother during pregnancy and prior to conception. In Moscow the average weight of the newborns of mothers living in the zone affected by emissions from the Motor Vehicle Plant imeni Likhachev is 400 grams (or 10 percent) below the average weight in the southwestern subway region. Cities and villages of the copper ore mining and enriching combines in the Urals have a higher number of children with extreme anthropometric characteristics. These cities are marked by lower indicators of body length at birth and less balanced anthropometric indicators. Children weigh less on the average in Novotroitsk near the Orsk-Khalilov metallurgical combine and in Orenburg (materials of the School of Hygiene of the Orenburg Medical Institute). A comparative analysis of the growth standards of physical development in infants and toddlers (the first three years of life) for oblast centers--Ufa, Yekaterinburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Samara--revealed that the worst indicators were in Ufa: clear signs of increasing asthenia (narrow chest and minimal weight combined with minimal growth). The physical development of children in different regions of Ufa revealed verifiable disparities depending on the intensity of the influence of anthropogenic factors (materials of the Bashkir Medical Institute). Lower anthropometric indicators were also found in children of pre-school age in the zone affected by emissions of boron production units in Dalnegorsk, ferroalloy production units and enterprises producing building materials (keramzit gravel and asphalt) in Moscow, copper smelting and aluminum plants, and many other production units. In one of the most highly polluted neighborhoods in Moscow (Kalininskiy Rayon), there were 5 percent fewer children between the ages of 3 and 7 with balanced (or proportional) physical development and almost twice as many children who were underweight or overweight. These deviations from anthropometric standards are indicators of the state of pediatric health at the time of the study and indicators of possible subsequent changes. Children with maximum deviations from average anthropometric characteristics are known to suffer more frequently from pathological changes than children who deviate little from the norm. An analysis of the development of children in the "copper" cities of the Urals indicates retarded physical and neuropsychological development (these children are older when they take their first steps) and delays in primary dentition. These children are also older than the average when they begin speaking. Therefore, changes in the normal physical development of children, particularly in combination with an unhealthy lifestyle (hypodynamia, inadequate physical training, and so forth), can lead to deviations in the state of their health later as well. As a rule, however, it is rarely possible to define the main external factor or only external factor destroying the nervous system in children. Special studies have established the influence of small doses of lead, mercury, and organic phosphates (pesticides), a shortage of iodine, and possibly of goitrogenic substances affecting the neuropsychological development of children. Paradoxically, the development of the system most vulnerable to ecopathogenic influences in children, namely the brain, and deviations in the neuropsychological development of children in the zones of ecological stress have not attracted enough attention from pediatricians, psychoneurologists, hygienists, and ecologists. Health of the Adult Population and Air Pollution It is difficult to assess the state of health of the adult population in cities with higher levels of environmental pollution. This is due to the lack of official statistical reports and to the procedural difficulties of keeping records of this kind, which require consideration for the role of occupational factors, bad habits, and the lifestyle in general. There are some studies that offer convincing evidence of the negative role of air pollution. The rate of chronic respiratory and pulmonary disease (pneumonia, bronchitis, laryngitis, and pharyngitis) and otitis in adults between the ages of 15 and 60 in Vladimir was 2.8 times as high in the zone affected by emissions from the chemical plant as in the control group. A detailed study of the effects of air pollution on public health was conducted in Novokuznetsk. The non-specific pulmonary disorders of workers of the metallurgical combine were studied to assess the effects of air pollution on the health of the adult population. In accordance with hygienic air quality surveys in the developed part of the city, workers were divided into one group living in the zone of maximum air pollution, a second group living in regions with average pollution, and a third in the zone of minimal pollution. The engineering and technical personnel and employees of the combine with no contact with occupational hazards of a chemical nature were used as the control group. This method revealed some tendencies in the combined effects of chemical pollutants on the health of workers in production and non-production areas. Perceptible differences were discovered in an analysis of the general rate of illness among workers living in the zone of maximum air pollution and workers in the zone of minimal pollution. Unfavorable ecological conditions lead to the development of occupational pathology. The Novokuznetsk aluminum plant workers living near the plant, for example, were twice as likely to suffer from occupational fluorosis. It developed much more quickly in this group, and cases of toxic hepatosis and specific changes in dental enamel were more common, reflecting the influence of fluorides at work and at home. A study of the effects of air pollution on the frequency of requests for emergency medical treatment for cardiovascular and pulmonary disease revealed a direct connection. The number of requests for emergency treatment for cardiovascular disorders was 2.4 times as high as in the zone with a relatively low level of air pollution (materials of the Comprehensive Hygiene and Occupational Disease Institute of the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences in Novokuznetsk). Similar patterns were observed in other large industrial centers in East Siberia--Bratsk and Angarsk. Indicators of requests for medical assistance by adults with no relationship to occupational hazards were much more numerous in Bratsk than in other cities in Irkutsk Oblast--Selenginsk and Baykalsk. The population of Bratsk is more likely to suffer from disorders of the nervous system, sensory organs, and cardiovascular system (1.2-1.9 times as likely). Besides this, the inhabitants of Bratsk are more likely to seek treatment for immunologic disorders and diseases (N. Matorova et al, 1990). A verifiable connection was established in Angarsk between the levels of short-term air pollution in the city and the daily patient rate--and in some years, the daily death rate. Chemical air pollution was responsible for 6-21 percent of the fluctuations in the daily patient rate (for different categories of illnesses) and 2.7-19.4 percent of fluctuations in the daily death rate (Ya. Leshchenko et al, 1993). Public Health and Food Pollution Food can be the source and agent of many chemicals posing a potential threat to human health. The results of surveys conducted from 1988 to 1991/92 indicate that from 0.8 to 3.8 percent of the analyzed samples of food products exceeded public health limits for lead, from 1.1 to 1.7 samples exceeded the cadmium limits, and from 0.4 to 4.7 percent exceeded mercury limits (V. Tutelyan et al, 1993). High levels of environmental pollution by metals in the environs of metallurgical production units can cause the considerable accumulation of toxic metals in vegetables, fruit, and berries. The content of heavy metals--lead, cadmium, chromium, and nickel--is extremely high in vegetables and berries grown between the cities of Revda and Pervouralsk in direct proximity to [passage omitted in source] In Russia as a whole, there were signs of nitrate pollution in from 9.8 to 7.7 percent of all analyzed samples of food products. Levels of food pollution began to decline in 1990. The degree of produce pollution by pesticides also decreased (from 3.2-3.5 percent in 1988/89 to 1.7-2 percent in 1991/92), but pesticide levels are still quite high in some parts of Russia. In Krasnodar Kray, for example, pesticide use is two or three times the national average. Studies of the state of public health in different parts of Krasnodar Kray indicate that high pesticide levels in communities in grain and rice farming regions are accompanied by higher rates of otorhinolaryngological disease, bronchial asthma, tuberculosis of the respiratory system, severe respiratory infections, and retarded physical development in children. Changes in the state of health are less pronounced in the adult population, but the rate of treatment for arterial hypertension and disorders of the digestive organs is three times as high. The health of children is much worse in regions with high pesticide levels in Rostov Oblast. Reproductive Health The reproductive health of the population is one of the most accurate indicators of public health and an indicator of local ecological conditions. Environmental pollution causes disturbances of endocrine functions and the immune, hemopoietic, and other systems in pregnant women and infants. The rate of severe pregnancy complications is constantly rising in Russia. The rate of pregnancy-related toxemia rose by 41 percent between 1981 and 1989, representing 7.7 cases per 100 births. Furthermore, cases of severe forms of toxemia--eclampsia and preeclampsia--increased 4.8-fold. Pregnant women were 2.6 times as likely to suffer from anemia, twice as likely to suffer from kidney disorders, and 21.9 percent more likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease (N. Vaganov, 1991). Although the rate of prenatal problems has risen everywhere, the rise is more pronounced in large industrial centers, where many women are employed in jobs with hazardous working conditions. In Ufa the rate of toxemia in pregnant women rose from 8.9 to 20.1 per 100 births in the last 21 years. This is almost three times as high as the republic average. The reason is the employment of many of the women at enterprises of the petrochemical complex (Bashkir Medical Institute, 1992). It is extremely difficult to gage the effects of environmental pollution in these cities on the state of reproductive functions. An analysis of the health indicators of pregnant women not employed in hazardous jobs but living in highly unsatisfactory ecological conditions confirms the presence of significant disparities. Women in the metallurgical cities of the Urals--Kamensk-Uralsk, Kirovograd, and the Novokuznetsk neighborhoods near the aluminum plant--were more likely than the women in the control group to suffer miscarriages, spontaneous abortions, premature births, and other pathological disorders. A similar situation was recorded in Krasnokamsk in Perm Oblast, the site of a pulp combine. In Baykalsk and Bratsk, other cities with pulp and paper industry, and in Shelekhov, a city with aluminum production units, disorders of reproductive functions were much more severe than in a "cleaner" city in East Siberia. Infant Mortality The rate of infant mortality is an important indicator of the quality of public health and social welfare. It is extremely difficult to judge the effects of environmental pollution in cities on the rate of infant mortality. Studies in this field are extremely few in number. Indicators of the early neonatal death of infants (death in the first week of life) over nine years in seven cities and seven rural rayons inhabited by around 2 million people were studied in Chelyabinsk Oblast (Chelyabinsk-40). The rate of infant mortality turned out to be most closely related to the level of nitrogen dioxide emissions (correlative coefficient of r=0.76) and hydrocarbons (r=0.79). These factors have an impact of around 60 percent on the rate of infant mortality. The same study, incidentally, did not establish a connection between radiation levels and birth defects and early neonatal mortality. A comparative analysis of infant mortality rates in the urban and rural populations is of some interest in revealing the role of the ecological factor. The rate was higher in urban locations in 14 oblasts. They included such industrially developed territories as Moscow, Kursk, Lipetsk, Rostov, Orenburg, and Novosibirsk oblasts and the Republic of Bashkiria. Effects of Environmental Pollution on Rate of Malignant Tumors in Russia The rise in the rate of malignant neoplasms in Russia is staying ahead of general population growth and the growth of the population over the age of 60. The number of new cases of oncological disease among citydwellers increased 1.7-fold in the last 20 years. The number of people first diagnosed with malignant growths in Russia rose by 23 percent between 1980 and 1991 and reached 394,300, corresponding to an average of 1,080 new patients a day. The number of patients who died during this period rose by 30 percent and amounted to 290,500 in 1991 (an average of 796 deaths a day). Death from malignant neoplasms has reduced the average lifespan of the male population of Russia by 2.8 years and the female lifespan by 2.2 years. The amount of hypothetical unproduced national income resulting from this is 4.1 billion rubles (in 1990 prices). The number of new cases of disease is expected to rise to 480,000 by the year 2000, or one new case each 66 seconds, and the number of deaths is expected to rise to 346,000 (or 940 a day). Around 18 of every 100 babies born in Russia in 1991 could suffer from malignant neoplasms, and the average lifespan of patients in some age groups could be as low as one-seventeenth of the general lifespan of these age groups (Ye. Aksel et al, 1993). The number of people categorized as completely disabled by malignant neoplasms exceeded 72,000 in 1990 in Russia, or 20.2 percent of the total number. Conclusion The adverse effects of environmental pollution on public health in Russia are a genuine threat to national security and can affect each of us. According to current estimates, around 20 percent of the total rate of illness is connected with the irritating effects of environmental pollution; in some areas the figure can be much higher. Regrettably, conclusive studies providing quantitative assessments of the contribution of environmental pollution to the development of various diseases are extremely few in number. The definite deterioration of public health indicators in recent years has been connected with environmental pollution and with socioeconomic difficulties. A more complete understanding of the role of environmental pollution in changes in the state of public health could result from the improvement of several types of activity on the federal, regional, and local levels. They include the following: --more detailed reports of the discharges and emissions of all potential polluters, with lists of the substances entering the atmosphere and surface and ground water, and detailed reports of the substances in solid waste disposal sites; --improvements in the pollution monitoring system for more complete records of the whole range of pollutants in a specific territory and for information about the spatial distribution of pollutants; --the widespread use of modern remote methods of emission control--such as the laser and sonar systems--for constant and current data on pollutants; --a better system of regional and federal public health statistics with more detailed breakdowns (by ages and territories); --the collection of statistical data for small territories that might be subject to the effects of various types of pollutants; --analytical epidemiological studies to determine risk and dose indicators for specific pollutants and their combinations; --the compilation and implementation of national programs to minimize the effects of all substances known to be highly toxic (benzpyrene, PAC's, PCB's, radon, beryllium, cadmium, lead, and other toxic metals).
