FR940527-1-00258 FR940527-1-00014 •The projected increase in the market basket for dialysis services in fiscal year 1995, estimated at 4.3 percent; •A positive adjustment of 0.7 percentage points to reflect the additional costs associated with scientific and technological advances; •A negative adjustment of 1.0 percentage points to encourage productivity improvements; and •A negative discretionary adjustment of 4.0 percentage points to reflect the relationship between payments and estimated fiscal year 1994 costs. •This results in a net update recommendation of zero percent. In 1972, the Congress extended Medicare coverage to almost all U.S. residents with end-stage renal disease. These beneficiaries are entitled to all Medicare-covered services, including dialysis treatments or transplant services to replace lost kidney function. Since 1983, payment for outpatient dialysis services has been based on a composite rate. The composite rate is a prospective payment intended to cover the costs of services typically furnished during a dialysis treatment. Derived from data from 1977 through 1979, it represents a weighted average cost per treatment for dialysis provided in facilities and at home according to the proportion of beneficiaries treated in each site. This method was intended to promote the less expensive home treatment alternative by paying the same amount for care provided in either site. The level of the composite rate has remained essentially unchanged since it was developed. OBRA 1990 mandated that ProPAC recommend an annual update to dialysis payments. In developing its recommendation, the Commission first estimated how much payments should increase between fiscal years 1994 and 1995 using a methodology similar to that employed in the update recommendation for PPS hospital payments. Then it evaluated the appropriateness of the base payment rate to which the update factor would be applied. (See Appendix A for more information on the background analyses.) Market Basket _The market basket index measures changes in the price of inputs dialysis facilities use to produce dialysis treatments. It is based on a set of input components that reflect all the goods and services dialysis providers purchase. Using 1992 dialysis facility cost report data, four types of inputs were identified: capital, labor, other direct costs, and overhead. Each component has a weight that represents its cost share, or proportion of total expenses. The price change for each component is measured by a proxy. The price proxies were adapted from those Medicare uses for the PPS, home health agency, and skilled nursing facility market baskets. The Commission estimates that the prices of inputs used in a dialysis treatment will rise 4.3 percent between fiscal years 1994 and 1995. Scientific and Technological Advances _The scientific and technological advances allowance is intended to encourage dialysis facilities to adopt new technologies that improve the quality of patient care, even when they increase costs. It is an estimate of the combined operating and capital costs of new and emerging dialysis-related technologies, and their expected increase in use for the coming fiscal year. To reach an informed judgment on the appropriate allowance, ProPAC examined a set of the most important new cost-increasing innovations in the dialysis industry. On the basis of this analysis, the Commission concluded that Medicare payments should rise by 0.7 percent to cover the costs of new technologies in fiscal year 1995. Productivity Improvement _The productivity adjustment is intended to give dialysis facilities a financial incentive for continued improvements in productivity through the more efficient use of resources. It is an estimate of the productivity gains that can be expected for the coming year. The Commission considered a range of options to reach an appropriate adjustment. ProPAC's historical productivity study and recent trends in the cost per dialysis treatment suggest a higher estimate may be appropriate. Concerns that further reductions in the length of dialysis sessions may adversely affect quality of care support a lower adjustment. ProPAC concluded that a modest productivity target of 2.0 percent arrives at the proper balance. The savings from productivity gains should be shared equally by the industry and Medicare, resulting in a productivity adjustment of ^1.0 percentage points.
