Beginning today, more than 400 CRS guerrillas will lay down their weapons and join in a new sociopolitical movement. Those present at the ceremony included government representatives, ambassadors, and, for the first time in the peace process, international observers from the Netherlands. These 400 rebels will turn over their weapons, some of which will be smelted and others thrown into the sea. The two sides today agreed that 300 weapons will be turned over, even though a document being finalized by the CRS states there are 450 weapons.

A verification commission comprising government and CRS representatives and international observers will verify compliance with the peace agreement every four months. The signing of the peace agreement makes the CRS the fourth rebel group that Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo has convinced to join civilian life during his administration.
