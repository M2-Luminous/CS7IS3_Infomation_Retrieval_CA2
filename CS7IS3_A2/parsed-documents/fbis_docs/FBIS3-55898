The situation is calm if somewhat tense along the line of confrontation, which is marked by the Inguri River. The Abkhaz side has given permission for power engineers to cross the so-called border to carry out repair work at Inguri hydroelectric power station in Gali rayon. Units of the Georgian armed forces stationed in the region are guarding the area along the river Inguri. The situation in Gali rayon in the border area remains critical as Abkhaz separatists and mercenaries from the northern Caucasus continue to rob civilians, burn houses, and kill people. Under an accord between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides, between 25 and 30 people a day are granted passes and cross the road bridge over the Inguri from Zugdidi rayon into Gali rayon. However, according to reliable information, mines laid by Abkhaz separatists have killed over 60 people attempting to cross illegally.
