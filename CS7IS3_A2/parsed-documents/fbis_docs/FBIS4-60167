FBIS4-60167 "drnes099_k_94002" FBIS-NES-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 IRAQ London TV Reports on Iraq's Nuclear Capability London TV Reports on Iraq's Nuclear Capability LD2005112594 LD2005112594 BFN [Editorial report] London ITV Television Network in English at 1830 GMT on 19 May in its "3-D" program carries at 15-minute report entitled "Saddam's Secret Bomb," showing exclusive video footage of Iraq's bomb factories -- revealing the whole truth about Iraq's nuclear program, raising questions about the role of the British Government, and international monitoring agencies. The program opens with shots of a Scud missile landing on an allied base during the Gulf war and a parade of Iraqi weaponry, followed by comments from David Kay, the UN investigator who uncovered Iraq'secret weapons program after the Gulf war. Kay says: "They were probably 36-months away from having deliverable type of weapons that would have fit either their own Scud missiles or extended range Scuds, or in their high performance aircraft in small numbers. If the war had not intervened -- as we sit here today in mid-1994, they would have at least have had crude nuclear devices, and probably their first deliverable packages would have coming on line." Over extensive shots of Iraqi nuclear sites scattered throughout Iraq, and shots of various items of equipment Kay then says: "The major building where they were going to manufacture nuclear weapons, actually cast the uranium metal, cut it into shapes, put the high explosive around it, is one that could well have produced twenty nuclear weapons a year no problem. It was quite frankly better than most of the American facilities that do the same thing. A lot of the equipment was still there in crates, and it was really something that any lab in the West would be happy to have." The report then shows exclusive video taken by the Iraqi's prior to the Gulf war, showing extensive shots of its (?Calutron) plant which used huge magnetic coils to extract the nuclear material, followed by comments from U.S Senate investigator Ken Timmerman who says: "We were on the verge of a nuclear catastrophe in Iraq and nobody was really aware of what was going on. One of the problems with nuclear proliferation is that you can never know with certainty exactly how far away a country such as Iraq is from the bomb. Our intelligence community does not know and they cannot know. The Iraqi's had a fantastic international procurement network. They were buying companies all over the world, but the very heart of it was in London, they would set up dummy companies to purchase on the open market high technology, machine-tools, nuclear materials, everything that they needed for their nuclear weapons program." The report goes on to show footage of Iraqi factories at al-Tuwaitha, al-Atheer, and Badr, a list of British companies who unwittingly supplied equipment to Iraq, unaware it would be diverted to its secret bomb program, and a MI6 document warning of Iraq's nuclear capability. John Gordon, former head of the British Foreign Office Nuclear Department, then says: "I think Britain broke her obligations as a nuclear weapons state under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, because under Article One we are enjoined and we agree in no way directly or indirectly to help other countries acquire nuclear weapons, and in selling machine-tool equipment which we knew might well be used for making centrifuges for the illicit nuclear weapon enrichment program, it seemed to me we were quite clearly in breach of this obligation." Over footage of UN inspections of the Iraqi bomb sites, Kimmerman concludes by saying: "A nuclear India, a nuclear Pakistan, a potentially nuclear Iran, potentially nuclear Iraq, a nuclear North Korea, perhaps South Korea, perhaps Japan as well armed with nuclear weapons. What is going to keep them from using those weapons? There are no security arrangements that could prevent the next war from being nuclear. There are other countries that are seeking nuclear weapons and they are doing the same things that the Iraqi's did, the same type of procurement, and we in our greed are making the same mistakes."
