Mr. Patten was at his most forthright yet in a marathon two-hour 20-minute grilling before the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee -- ruling out a referendum, insisting legislators voted in in 1995 would not be a "Trojan horse" for Britain and fiercely, while succinctly attacking both China and his British adversary Sir Percy Cradock. In a sometimes emotive performance he praised the people of Hong Kong. "I do get angry sometimes at the contempt shown for the people in Hong Kong who have created one of the most successful economies in the world and who have shown remarkable sophistication in every aspect of life and who are expected to continue to create one of the most successful economies in the world in a political vacuum. "They say of the people of the 10th most successful economy in the world that it contains a population who aren't capable of deciding who should collect their dustbins." Mr. Patten told the all-party committee investigating relations between Britain and China that it was his "firm, sincere hope" that discussions could be resumed although time was very short. "I still hope that the negotiations can be resumed at any time and when the Chinese side give us the nod our officials will be on the plane to Beijing." He explained that if Legco refused to pass either of two tranches of his democracy package then he would face difficulties constitutionally. "You can't legislate on very close terrain to that on which you have lost the battle. "The options would be either to try a different approach and put forward different legislation or to decide that we have to settle for existing arrangements in a re-run in 1995." Asked by Tory MP David Sumberg whether or not a referendum was viable, Mr. Patten insisted that opinion polls over and over again had shown support for his package. A referendum would not resolve the issue because Legco would still have to pass legislation. He added sternly: "It is an issue completely neuralgic to the Chinese side and I am not in the business of trying to tweak Chinese tails. China regards it as the ultimate sin and I don't think it is very sensible to take on more arguments in a day than is absolutely necessary." The MPs questioned Mr. Patten in detail over the whole gamut of Hong Kong issues. The Governor revealed that soon he would have to go ahead with the localisation of laws unilaterally because of the lack of progress in the JLG. He insisted he would continue to press "with great vigour" for UK passports for both the 52 war widows and the 7,000-strong ethnic community. The Governor meets Home Secretary Michael Howard today to take up these issues. He also disclosed that before he goes ahead and tables the second set of democracy legislation he will publish the full details of how the talks progressed and finally broke down. "I think it would be very difficult to justify further legislation without filling in that background," he said. The Commons committee room was crammed with more than 70 diplomats press and members of the public, including four officials from the Chinese Embassy for the hearing: Those who could not fit in heard Mr. Patten give evidence through a sound system to an overflow room. The Governor admitted as he began his evidence that his was "a difficult job all round and no one should be too surprised or too censorious that it is occasionally a more bracing or bruising experience than any of us would like". Even before he arrived the relationship with China had not been blessed with as much co- operation as Britain would have liked. "We have not been arguing with China about increasing the pace at which the legislature is democratised, though some think we should have been. "What is at issue is whether those arrangements are fair or unfair. That is the nub of the argument. "Should it not be possible to reach agreement with China on this issue then we will have to proceed with legislation. "We will work with and through the legislature, not going further than the community wishes, but not going less far either." Mr. Patten pulled few punches in his description of the Chinese approach. "I think it has been pretty irrational, largely rhetorical and usually devoid of argument," he said. He detailed to the MPs the talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in New York, prior to his first announcement of the democracy package and how this was passed on to the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office by the British Embassy in Beijing. Mr. Patten said Sir Percy Cradock's suggestion that Britain had refused consultations at that stage was "completely untrue". He accused the Chinese of using traditional tactics in trying to personalise their attacks on him and isolating individuals they did not agree with. It was "ludicrous" to suppose that any governor could conduct policy which produced this degree of controversy off his own back. He was a politician and very sensitive to public accountability-- more so than others might have been. Tory MP Sir John Stanley asked why he had gone for a policy of defiance, as it was described by Sir Percy. But Mr. Patten accused the former ambassador to Beijing of not saying what he would settle for. Mr. Patten said the 17 rounds of talks had "reached the end of the elastic" when they were called off. Asked why he had not gone to Beijing prior to announcing his package, he said that if he had that would make "lame ducks look pretty agile".
