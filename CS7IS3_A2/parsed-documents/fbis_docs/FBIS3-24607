The variability of HIV genes, combined with the latency phenomenon that is inherent in lentiviruses, enables the virus to elude the defense systems of the human body rather successfully 4, 6]. In western countries with the largest number of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS victims (USA, France, England, Germany), numerous HIV isolates were obtained differing in antigenic and molecular-biological properties [1, 3, 5]. The existence of two HIV serotypes was established: HIV-1 and HIV-2 [4, 6]. Immunodeficiency viruses were isolated from primates and cats that were very similar to HIV. With the appearance of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS cases in the former USSR, it became necessary to isolate and study the HIV strains circulating in this territory. For this reason, our objective here was to isolate and analyze the features of domestic HIV strains. Material and Methods Isolation of viruses. We obtained HIV isolates from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) using a modification of the method in [1]. After PBL isolation with use of a ficoll-isopaque (Sweden) gradient, they were stimulated by phytohemagglutinin in a concentration of 5 �g/ml (Sigma, USA) for 48 h, eluted and cultivated in the presence of human interleukin-2 for 4-6 weeks or up to the time of cocultivation with lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines, as well as with PBL from healthy donors stimulated as described above. Viruses. In addition to our isolates, we used HIV strains kindly furnished by Professor L. Montagnier: HIV-1/BRU, Professor Gallo: HIV-1/IIIB, and Professor J. Levy: HIV-1/SF4. Cells. We used transferable human cell lines H9, Hut-78, CEM, MT-4, MOLT-4, CEM-SS, U-937, Jurkat tat and others, obtained from the collection of the Institute of Virology imeni D. I. Ivanovskiy, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. The cells were cultivated in a concentration of 0.3-0.5 million per milliliter medium RPMI-1640 with 10 percent fetal calf serum, 300 �g/ml L-glutamine, and 100 �g/ml gentamycin, and incubated in suspension form. Viability of cells was determined by staining with 0.4 percent trypan blue. Immunofluorescence. Cells that expressed HIV antigen on the surface were counted by the standard method using serum containing antibodies to HIV-1 from an AIDS patient. Electron microscopy. After centrifuging at 2000 rpm for 5 min, cell sediments were collected and fixed successively in 2.5 percent glutaraldehyde solution and 1 percent OsO[.sup]4[/] in phosphate buffer, dehydrated and embedded in araldite. Sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and silver nitrate using conventional techniques, then examined under an SEM-100B microscope. Enzyme immunoassay. For direct enzyme immunoassay (EIA), we used a test system that we prepared for demonstration of HIV-1 antigens in culture fluid of cells infected with HIV-1 where antibodies to HIV-1 obtained from blood serum of AIDS patients were adsorbed in the solid phase. Peroxidase-tagged antibodies were obtained by binding immunoglobulins from the serum of HIV positive individuals (titer greater than 1:40,000 in the Organon test system) with armoracia peroxidase using the periodate method. EIA sensitivity constituted more than 2 ng/ml viral antigen. We added up to 0.1 percent tween-20 to the specimens of material and applied them to wells in a tray. They were incubated for 18 h at 4�C, washed, conjugate in a 1:1000 dilution was added, then they were incubated for 1 h at 37�C. We eluted them, added substrate and measured absorption. Reverse transcriptase reaction. The reaction was run in a lysate of precipitated virus (25,000 rpm, 1.5 h, lysis in buffer of: 50 percent glycerin, 7.5 mM HCl pH 7.5, 75 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT [dithiothreitol], 0.2 percent triton X-100). The reaction was carried out in a buffer of: 10 mM HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM KCl, 2 mM magnesium chloride solution, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.02 percent triton X-100, 0.2 mg/ml poly(rA)-digo(dT)[.sup]10[/] and [.sup]3[/]H TTP, 2 �Ci per specimen. Incubation for 1 h at 37�C [1]. Polymerase chain reaction., isolation of DNA from cells. 1.5 ml cell suspension was precipitated, the sediment eluted 3 times in buffer at 4000 rpm for 30 min. We added 100 �l phosphate solution and saline buffer (pH 7.2) containing proteinase K in a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Incubation was carried out for 1 h at 55�C, for 16 h at 37�C, then heated for 2 min at 94�C. The reaction was run using the following concentrations of reagents: dNTP mixture -- 200 �M each; primers -- 1 �M each; template -- 50 pg per sample; Tag enzyme - polymerase -- 4 U per sample, tris-HCl pH 9.3 -- 10 mM; KCl -- 50 mM; magnesium chloride -- 2 mM; gelatin -- 0.1 mg/ml. We used 25 cycles at the following temperatures: 2 min at 37�C -- fusion, 5 min at 72�C -- elongation, and 2 min at 94�C -- denaturation. 4. Results and Discussion Experiments for isolation of HIV isolates from material taken from HIV positive subjects and AIDS patients in 22 cities of the former USSR: Moscow, Elista, Leningrad, Rostov, Stavropol, Penza, Volgograd, Smolensk, Riga, Armavir, Donetsk and others. We obtained a total of 81 HIV isolates. Effectiveness of HIV isolation constituted 29.1 percent in the case of asymptomatic carriers, 71.4 percent in HIV positive cases with generalized lymphadenopathy, and 90.5 percent in AIDS patients with severe manifestations of the disease. Immunological analysis of the HIV isolates enabled us to determine that 79 out of the 81 HIV isolates are type I, 2 are type II and are HIV-2 strains. We identified HIV isolates using several independent methods. At the early stages after HIV isolation, the virus was tested using enzyme immunoassay and immunofluorescence analysis, and we also measured reverse transcriptase activity in the culture medium. Then we studied the HIV isolates using electron microscopy, the immune blot method and polymerase chain reaction. The test results are listed in the table.

The data indicate that the first signs of HIV are demonstrable on the 7th-10th day of observation by determination of reverse transcriptase activity. Peak RT occurred on the 16th-19th day for many strains. The level of reverse transcriptase activity differed appreciably, depending on the isolated strain. It was possible to distinguish a second group of strains which demonstrated an RT peak on the 30th-35th day. The patterns of rise and decline in RT activity in peripheral blood lymphocytes coincided on the whole with detection of HIV antigen by EIA. After infecting transferable lymphoblastoid cell lines with HIV strains, maximum production of HIV antigen in culture fluid occurred on the 3d-5th to 12th-15th day, depending on the type of cell culture and HIV strain. Reproduction of isolates in sensitive cell lines was accompanied by a typical cytopathic effect. Most frequently, infected cells showed virus-induced fusions of cell membranes of giant ``balloons'' and syncytia. In other instances, there were no such structures; however, a strong cytodestructive effect was noted. The time of syncytia formation in infected cells depended on infectivity of the strains, and with highly infective strains they appeared on the 4th-5th day. The cytopathic effect of viruses was demonstrable in the 2d-3d week after infecting the cell cultures in the case of 3 strains differing in infective activity. Formation of syncytia was correlated with expression of HIV antigens on the surface of infected cells, as demonstrable by indirect immunofluorescence. The number of cells with HIV antigens in the cell population ranged from 2-7 to 24-53 percent for HIV-1/IV3, HIV-1/IV17, HIV-1/IV21, HIV-1/IV39, and HIV-1/IV54. Electron microscopy most often revealed HIV virions near the cell membrane or showed budding on it. Mature virions consisted of spherical particles 100-120 nm in size, with a pear-shaped, acentric core. Virions of a new HIV generation were demonstrable on the 3d day after infecting cells, while the maximum number of extracellular and budding viral particles was found on the 5th postinfection day. The spectrum of isolated HIV differed from that of cell cultures. A large group of strains was capable of reproduction only in a limited number of cell lines. In some cases, HIV-1/IV5, HIV-1/IV7, HIV-1/IV11 and others were isolated from asymptomatic HIV carriers. However, this pattern was not always observed and, in the case of HIV-1/IV13, HIV-1/IV24 and others from asymptomatic carriers, strains were obtained for which there was a wide spectrum of sensitive cell lines. Some of the HIV strains had the capacity to grow on both lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines. In many cases, these were strains isolated from patients at the 3d-4th stage of disease, with marked symptoms. It must be noted that, in addition to the capacity to multiply in different types of cells, the HIV strains demonstrated differing kinetics of viral production in cells of the same type. Thus, the obtained HIV-1 isolates can be divided into two groups, having low and high productivity. The former group has a limited replicative capacity, low or negative RT and EIA. The second group is characterized by high infectivity (4.5-6.0 TCID[.sup]50[/]), high RT, EIA, and capacity to multiply in various transferable cell lines. Separation of strains into those with low and high infectivity is also typical of HIV isolated in Europe and the United States, which is indicative of the similarity of biological properties of our HIV strains and foreign ones [2, 5]. Comparison of characteristics and level of viral antigen production by cells infected with Russian, highly infective strains to reference strains HIV-1/IIIB, HIV-1/BRU, and HIV-1/SF4 revealed that they have the necessary properties to recover HIV antigen for diagnostic purposes. Using a set of primers complementary to the sites of the gag and pol genes and the polymerase chain reaction, we obtained viral DNA fragments 2438 base pairs in size. The fragment was then spliced into the Blue script SK+ plasmid, TG1 cells were transfected, and clones were isolated with this fragment of the HIV genome. As a result of sequencing the DNA of HIV-1/IV54, it became possible to compare amino acid sequences of the gag protein fragment of this virus to the prototype foreign HIV-1 specimens [7]. The findings indicate that the homology of strain HIV-1/IV54 with HIV-1/MAL, which is typical for the African content, constitutes 65 percent. Similarity to the North American strain HIV-1/MN constitutes 81 percent, which is indicative of somewhat greater resemblance of HIV-1/IV54 to the American HIV-1 subtype. Studies of HIV strains isolated from HIV positive individuals from different regions of our country revealed that the HIV isolates were heterogenous. Mainly the type 1 virus, HIV-1, is circulating among the population of Russia (98.1 percent); however, in the last 2 years HIV-2 infection has been noted among our citizens. Thus, it can be noted that there is circulation in our country of HIV-1 and HIV-2, which differ in molecular-biological properties, but are similar in the main parameters to the prototype HIV-1 strains that are widespread in America, Africa and Europe.
