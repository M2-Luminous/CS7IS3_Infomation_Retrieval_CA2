A scroll from a Korean living in Longjing City, Jilin Province, China, shows Chong-il Peak against the background of Mt. Paektu and, to the right of it, letters "Wijamanbang" meaning that the greatness of Comrade Kim Chong-il is shedding rays all over the world, and below a tiger crouching on a rock before a pine tree representing his grit and courage and reflecting the wish for his longevity in good health. A congratulatory poem wishing the dear leader good health and a long life came from a veteran in Russia, a "Phoenix treasure boat" made of gold and silver from a compatriot in America and rare fish from an old man in Canada.
