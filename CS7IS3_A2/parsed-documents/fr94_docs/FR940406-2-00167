ACTION: Notice of request for a revision to an existing OMB clearance (9000&hyph;0006). SUMMARY: Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve a revision of a currently approved information collection requirement concerning Subcontracting Plans/Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts (Standard Form 294). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Fayson, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy, GSA (202) 501&hyph;4755. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Purpose In accordance with the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631, et seq. ), contractors receiving a contract for more than $10,000 agree to have small and small disadvantaged business concerns participate in the performance of the contract as far as practicable. Contractors receiving a contract or a modification to a contract expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) must submit a subcontracting plan that provides maximum practicable opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business concerns. Specific elements required to be included in the plan are specified in section 8(d) of the Small Business Act and implemented in FAR subpart 19.7. In conjunction with these plans, contractors must submit semiannual reports of their progress on Standard Form 294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts. A satisfactory subcontracting plan is required before a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) can be awarded. The contracting officer must examine the information in the proposed plan to determine if the plan is in compliance with the Small Business Act and the FAR. In addition, the information is used for policy and management control purposes. Information submitted on Standard Form 294 is used to assess contractors' compliance with their subcontracting plans. B. Annual Reporting Burden The annual reporting burden is estimated as follows: Respondents, 1,625; responses per respondent, 36; total annual responses, 58,500; preparation hours per response, 6; and total response burden hours, 351,000. This represents an increase in the previously approved burden to reflect the number of subcontracting plans that may be required with initial offers.
