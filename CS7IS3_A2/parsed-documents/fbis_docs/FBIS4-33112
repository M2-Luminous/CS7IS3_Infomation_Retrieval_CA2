"This year's performance is better than expected," said Roberto Caiuby Vidigal, president of the Confab [National Brazilian Steel Forging Company]. "For the first time in recent years the capital goods sector is registering an increase, and the continuation of this increase will depend on the next president," he added. The idle capability of the capital goods sector is still considerable (nearly 46 percent) but the amount of new projects is also considerable: At the beginning of the year the Brazilian Association for the Development of Basic Industries (Abdib) estimated there were $38 billion worth of investment projects requiring capital goods, engineering services, construction, and assembly. An Abdib bulletin released this month states: "From the first quarter of 1993 the investment rate and percentage variation of Fixed Capital Gross Formation [Formacao Bruta de Capital Fixo] that had accumulated during the four previous quarters began to climb, thus reverting the negative trend of 1991 and 1992." The number of new factories (industrial plants) still remains small, as in the case of Cenibra [Brazil-Japanese Cellulose Corporation] [sentence as published]. Companies are, however, investing in productivity, quality improvement, and the environment. Caiuby said that Confab earned 20 percent of its sales in a bad year from the sale of $14 million worth of dust-removing systems for Usiba [Bahia Iron and Steel Mill] and Acesita [Itabiera Special Steel Company]." The largest steel distributor in the country, Rio Negro company increased its sales of sheet steel by 34 percent during the first quarter compared to the same period in 1993. During the first quarter of 1994 Usiminas, Cosipa, and CSN [National Iron and Steel Company] produced 1.616 million tonnes of sheet steel, some 21.7 percent more than the 1.330 million tonnes produced during the same period last year. The 286,000-tonne increase relates to the direct consumption of the car industry for four months," said Loureiro [not further identified]. "Consumption has dropped since April but will increase with the implementation of the real," he foresees. Faced with a favorable international market, coffee producers are experiencing an exceptional moment. Luiz Suplicy Haffers, the vice president of the Parana Coffee Association, has said that coffee is quoted at $130 per bag. Brazil produces 22 million bags, which totals $2.4 billion. This is more than was obtained in 1993 when the Brazilian production of 25 million bags realized $1.65 billion at an average price of $66 per bag. Exports this year may range between $1.8 billion and $2 billion compared with $1.064 billion in 1993. Considering the record harvest figure of 76 million tonnes of grains expected for this year, the farming GDP is estimated to rise to 6.6 percent this year. This has prompted an increase in tractors and machinery sales. Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries (FIESP) has said increased investments are essential for long-term economic growth. He said: "There are a lot of people waiting to invest and the scene will be better defined after the elections," adding, "in the electricity field, foreign businessmen seek us out, offering to invest -- which has not happened for years." They want to invest in mills like Serra da Mesa and in the privatizations of Light [Power Services, Inc.] and Escelsa [Espirito Santo Power Plants, Inc.]. Moreira Ferreira said: Industrial production dropped in April "but recovery is possible," adding, "the outlook is neither over optimistic or pessimistic." He considers the increase of the real salary value by 5.4 percent in April as healthy. The economic recovery during the second half of the year depends on the success of the Real Plan. "July will be the decisive month," he said. Moreira Ferreira is optimistic over the economic plan and praised the finance minister's "firm attitude" in rejecting salary increases for public and state company workers and his presidential support for the Federal Revenue Office, which created a favorable atmosphere for economic expectations. The FIESP president still has some reservations over the policy of "very high" bank interest rates and over state banks. He said: "They may increase the public deficit." The reduction of import tariffs has created difficulties for Brazilian industries.
