FR941028-0-00110 FR941028-0-00010 8. 43 CFR 4.1385: An alternative deadline is provided for issuance of an initial decision when no hearing is held. In addition, in order to implement the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, OHA has added rules (§§4.1371(c), 4.1381(c)) providing the parties an opportunity to employ alternatives means of dispute resolution, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 571(3) (1988), before the hearing and appeals procedures set forth in the following rules. Any party could decline this opportunity, in its discretion, at any time. Because no new obligations are imposed and this voluntary procedure does not affect substantive rights, its adoption does not require separate notice under the Administrative Procedure Act. Determination of Effects The Department has determined that these rules will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq . Executive Order 12866 These rules were not subject to OMB review under Executive Order 12866. National Environmental Policy Act The Department has determined that these rules will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment on the basis of the categorical exclusion of regulations of a procedural nature set forth in 516 DM 2, Appendix 1, section 1.10. Paperwork Reduction Act These rules contain no information collection requirement requiring Office of Management and Budget approval under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq . Takings Implication Assessment These rules do not pose any takings implications requiring preparation of a Takings Implication Assessment under Executive Order No. 12630 of March 18, 1988. Drafting Information The primary author of these regulations is Will A. Irwin, Administrative Judge, Interior Board of Land Appeals, Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of the Interior.
