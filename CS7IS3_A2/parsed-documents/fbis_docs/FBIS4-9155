One would not have expected something like this from a diplomat who was considered the most persistent and competent mediator in the search for a peaceful settlement to the Bosnian war. It was believed that no one could put out of joint this diplomat of fine manners and notable tolerance. Many news analysts have tried to explain the motives and grasp the background of his outburst and believe that the popular Russian envoy has made a diplomatic blunder and simply "cracked." By his nervous and explosive reaction to the Bosnian Serbs' behaviour, even if things had really occurred as he said, Churkin has failed both as a politician and diplomat. As a negotiator and mediator, he did what was the easiest and what a good politician would never do -- he gave up Bosnia in a moment of personal frustration. Time, which eventually reveals all, will show whether Churkin's outburst has cut short his brilliant diplomatic career which was developped mainly owing to his efforts in the Yugoslav crisis. Churkin has managed to score more diplomatic points in his mediating mission in Bosnia than anyone else, including Lord Owen. It appears, however, that the burden of such a fame was too much for him. Time will also shed more light on some other issues and motives of such a reaction. For instance, why was outburst caused only by the Serbs' conduct. Previously there were also dramatic events and all sides broke their promises, but Churkin never got upset. Not even when the Bosnian Serbs were bombed without consultation with his country, although this could have been the right moment to tell the NATO leaders that they should realize once and for all that Russia is a big state and not a banana republic, as he told the Serbs. Nevertheless, the most important question now is about the further role of Russia in the resolution of the Bosnian drama and overall Yugoslav crisis. It should not be crucially influenced by Churkin's outburst and by Russia's "brotherly feelings" towards the Serbs. In any case, Russia has not given up Bosnia. This is evident from the latest peace initiatives of President Boris Yeltsin who has announced serious Russian engagement, including cooperation with all factors of the international community and negotiations with all warring sides in Bosnia. The problem is so serious that it cannot be resolved at the level of deputy foreign ministers, the Russian defence minister said yesterday in a rather rough allusion to the position of Vitaliy Churkin in his country.
