In this connection, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] source disclosed on 23 March that a task force has already been set up within MOFA to deal with economic sanctions to be imposed by the UNSC on North Korea and with other situations, and that the task force is fully prepared to consult with other government ministries and agencies. Commenting on the prospect of the UNSC adopting a resolution, the same MOFA source pointed out, "The UNSC will adopt a resolution urging North Korea to accept complete nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency and will then see how North Korea responds to the resolution." The source also added that the possibility of the UNSC imposing economic sanctions on North Korea at this point is slim. The source indicated that if the UNSC decides to impose economic sanctions on North Korea, "Japan is obliged to go along with them as a member nation of the United Nations." As for the need to amend current laws and ordinances for Japan to comply with the economic sanctions, the source clearly said, "Each government ministry and agency is now closely examining ways to amend them." The economic sanctions against North Korea may create a serious situation for Japan's security, and for that reason the task force is expected to study 1) ways to ban remittances by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea, for these remittances have been strongly criticized by the United States and other nations; 2) the possibility of increasing reconnaissance and information-collecting activities by the Self-Defense Forces in accordance with UNSC resolutions; 3) ways to airlift about 9,000 Japanese in South Korea back to Japan if South Korea enters an emergency situation. The same MOFA source indicated that "it is impossible for the Japanese Government to regulate visits by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea through which money is remitted from Japan to North Korea." The source, however, declined to definitely comment on the possibility of suspending the issuing of reentry visas for ethnic Koreans.
