The result of the last round of PD [Democratic Party]-PDSR talks, which was held yesterday, 26 April at the headquarters of the Senate, can be summed up through Adrian Nastase's [executive president of the PDSR] statement: "The talks have concluded for good!" Sources of the negotiating teams revealed that, in the attempt to divert attention from the major objective of the negotiations (that is, the modification in the parliamentary majority) the ruling party proposed that a draft accord regarding the political conduct and cooperation between the parliamentary parties and the PDSR, as well as a draft economic and social program for 1994 that was to be examined by experts of other parties, should be discussed. The PD negotiators believed that the ruling party's proposals regarding previous demands of the opposition and of Mr. Roman's party were insufficient and inopportune. Therefore, eventually, the sides proceeded to discussions on the issue of parliamentary restructuring. The same sources revealed that the PDSR took into consideration the variation in which the PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party] should be one of the balancing factors of this majority. In turn, the PD negotiators rejected the proposal, which they considered inadequate from the opposition's viewpoint. Considering that the power of invention of the PDSR is unlimited when it comes to political "arrangements," they proposed that the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian Democratic Party] together with the PD and the PDSR should participate in a possible government formula. Not being able to start negotiations on behalf of the PNTCD, the PD proposed a summit meeting with all leaders of the opposition (in spite of the PDSR's aversion to the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania and the Liberal Party '93), a meeting that should create the common ground for discussions. In practical terms, in this way, these negotiations could continue endlessly if the ruling party is not determined to take a clear decision. Here are the statements of those who carried out the negotiations: Ion Solcanu, representing the PDSR: "This stage of the negotiations has to conclude with a proper examination of the economic and political situation in our country. Likewise, our talks identify the necessary solutions to overcome the current deadlock. The dialogue might be extended to other opposition parties as well." Adrian Severin, representing the PD: "As far as we are concerned, we cannot accept political bigamy. We cannot accept that the PDSR cooperates with the parties included in the current pentagon [PDSR, PUNR, Greater Romania Party, Socialist Party of Labor, and the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania] and, at the same time, with the opposition parties, in a possible parliamentary or government formula. The PDSR has still not succeeded in understanding the fact that it is not possible to propel the country toward democracy together with extremist parties or nostalgic-restoration parties. The talks have concluded for good, in spite of our efforts."
