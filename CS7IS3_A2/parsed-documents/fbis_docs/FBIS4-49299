He fully affirmed the new change taken place at the plant as a result of the efforts to halt deficits made by this plant and the nonferrous metal general company. He again stressed: In a certain sense, the endeavor in halting deficits and increasing profits is precisely aimed at ensuring stability and using the new opportunity brought about by the market economy to accelerate structural readjustment and optimize distribution of the production factors. [passage omitted] With a history of 40 years, Beijing Copper Wire Plant is a small enterprise producing copper as well as copper alloy wire and strips. The plant now employs 348 workers. In recent years, its products have enjoyed good sales and have been exported to the United States, Hong Kong, and other countries and regions. It has earned over $1 million every year, and the demand of its products has exceeded the supply. However, owing to fund shortages, its output and performance have kept on declining since last year. In the first quarter of this year, it even suffered a loss for the first time. After allocating a certain amount of circulating funds to this plant through the full cooperation of departments concerned, output in April registered a 20 percent increase over the average month output in the first quarter. In addition, the morale of its staff and workers was stable and they were enthusiastic about production. [passage omitted] Chen Xitong said in his speech: Today, after looking at the plant and hearing the report on the work of this general company, I have noticed the good spirits of workers and staff members. From the general company to its subordinate plant, staff and workers have all been vigorous in halting deficits, thus effecting an improvement in production and giving rise to a new atmosphere throughout the enterprise. This is the result of the concerted efforts of leaders and the working class of the general company and the plant. I hope that you will keep on working hard. Facts prove that it is completely necessary to support the enterprises and trades having good marketing and good performance, like the Beijing Nonferrous Metal General Company, by allocating appropriate amounts of circulating funds to them. Chen Xitong pointed out: To rapidly popularize the experience in carrying out comprehensive reform gained by this first light industrial general company, the essential idea is to use the new opportunity and the favorable conditions brought about by the market economy to carry out structural readjustment and optimize the distribution of production factors. In the endeavor of halting deficits and carrying out structural readjustment, we should resolutely break with the idea of "brand, position, and face," the idea of "mine, yours, and his," and the idea of "waiting for higher levels' support, loans, and improved situation." If we fail to break with these three ideas, we will lose opportunity, efficiency, and popular support. We should make cadres more aware in submitting themselves to the central authorities' general task of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability." We should also clearly explain to workers that structural readjustment is in agreement with the essential interest and long-term interest of workers and staff members. He again stressed: In a certain sense, the endeavor of halting deficits and increasing profits is precisely aimed at ensuring stability. We should continue to carry out the method of resolving problems by looking into both its causes and signs. At the moment, the most urgent task is to make staff and workers have something to do, to make enterprises profitable, to make workers' lives ensured, and to make workers' income raised on the basis of developing production and improving efficiency. Otherwise, stability will be impaired and problems will be hard to be resolved thoroughly. Then, Chen Xitong discussed with enterprise leaders on the cross-defaults owed between different enterprises. He also affirmed the measure adopted by the plant to withdraw loans. [passage omitted]
