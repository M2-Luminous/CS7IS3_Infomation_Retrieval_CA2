The sources said the fighting between the Third Brigade of the south stationed there and the First Brigade of the north claimed a number of deaths and injuries. This was the fifth clash between northern and southern troops since February 21, one day after the feuding president, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and the vice-president, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, signed their reconciliation accord in Amman. The fighting took place after President Salih warned that "anyone trying to disrupt Yemen's unity and its national ranks will pay a dear price." He called on the entire Yemeni people to remain vigilant against "separatists and powers opposed to the unity of Yemen." He call was made at a mass rally held in Sanaa to commemorate the first anniversary of Yemen's multiparty general elections. The Yemeni president, who heads the General People's Congress, accused leaders of the Yemen Socialist Party headed by Al-Bid of shuttling in some Arab capitals to raise funds for the purchase of mines and guns with the aim of "aborting the process of unity and democracy." Vice President Al-Bid and Salim Salih Muhammad, one of the Socialist Party's leaders had recently visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and some other Gulf states. North and South Yemen merged in May 1990 to form the United Republic of Yemen. The political crisis developed last August when Vice President Al-Bid returned to Aden, capital of the former South Yemen and refused to return to Sanaa. The two men were said to have sharp policy differences over a number of key issues of the Republic. The crisis has continued despite repeated Arab mediation efforts to reconcile the two parties and end the feud. Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have tried to arrange a reconciliation conference between Salih and Al-Bid. Jordan and Oman previously arranged such meetings but failed to bridge their differences. A joint Omani, Jordanian, American and French military commission formed at the end of February to prevent military clashes in Yemen have called for restraint by both sides.
