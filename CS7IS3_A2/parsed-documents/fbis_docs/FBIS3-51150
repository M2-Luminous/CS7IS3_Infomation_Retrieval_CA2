This is the first wave of violence to take place this year in Venezuela, where a new tax has increased consumer products by 10 percent. According to witnesses, the disturbances began when the police fired shots and used tear gas against a "peaceful" demonstration of residents who had blocked traffic on an important avenue. The people were protesting the hike in public transportation rates in effect since late December. The reports add that two persons were wounded -- one by bullets -- during the clash. A grocery truck on the outskirts of Barcelona was looted and there were attempts to loot some stores in the downtown area, but the police stopped them. Although it was a people's protest, University of Oriente students expressed solidarity with the protest and burned a city bus. At 1900 (2300 GMT) there still were serious traffic jams throughout the city.
