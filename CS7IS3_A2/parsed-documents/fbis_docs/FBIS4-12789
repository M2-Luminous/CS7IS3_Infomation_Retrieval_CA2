The sentence, which cannot be appealed, was the first to be issued by the Court of Justice since the 1970s. It comes after the government decided last month to reactivate capital punishment in Lebanon. The soldiers 'Abd-al Karim Jeij and Muhammad Zaatar had been handed over by Syria to Lebanese authorities as part of the investigation into the murder of jewellers Ghassan and Jalil Antonios. The soldiers were not present in court when the verdict was announced on Tuesday. Lebanese fugitive Nehme Hamade lives in Belgium, which has refused a Lebanese request to extradite him. On March 11 parliament voted in a law bringing in the death penalty for political crimes and scrapping an extenuating circumstances clause which had exempted politically-motivated crimes. The vote was part of a package of measures by the government to tighten security and legal procedures following a church bombing in February which killed 10 people and wounded 54 others. The death penalty, always by hanging, has only been applied three times in the past 35 years in Lebanon. The last execution was carried out in 1983.
