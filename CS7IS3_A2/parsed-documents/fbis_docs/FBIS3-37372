"The (Communist) Party hated Mikhail Gorbachev the way he hated it", Oleg Shenin, former secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, told the trial which probes the coup on Tuesday. "The tragedy of the Soviet Union was that head of state Mikhail Gorbachev lost the reigns of control over the country", he added. This was the subjective reason for the collapse of the Soviet Union, according to him. "There were no major objective reasons for the collapse of the USSR -- there were only subjective reasons", Shenin said and added that the coup was organised in order "to save the union state". He added that he had for long advocated extraordinary measures to improve the deteriorating economic situation in the former USSR.
