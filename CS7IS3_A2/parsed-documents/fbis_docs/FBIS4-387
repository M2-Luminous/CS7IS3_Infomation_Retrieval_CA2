We convey sincere condolences from the Rwandan Government and people to the bereaved family. Finally, in accordance with Article 42 of the Constitution of 10 June 1991, the vacant post of the president of the Republic is assumed by the speaker of the National Development Council [CND]. Rwandans, it is in that capacity that I address you tonight, given the tragic moments we are experiencing that force us to take the following urgent measures. The five political parties taking part in the current transitional government, namely the National Revolutionary Movement for Development [MRND], the Republican Democratic Movement [MDR], the Social Democratic Party [PSD], the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] and the Liberal Party [PL], have agreed to put in place a transitional government whose most urgent tasks are: First, the effective management of state affairs, notably by restoring order and the security of people and property; second, the continuation of contacts with the Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] with a view to putting in place the broad-based transitional government, and this within the shortest time possible, in any case before the expiration of the six-week period set by the UN Security Council; third, to seek ways and means of solving problems related to the famine that has claimed victims in certain regions of the country as well as the resettlement of those displaced. The political parties taking part in the newly formed transitional government have decided to appoint Mr. (Jean Kabanda) as prime minister. We have approved this. We have also approved the list of ministers for his government that he submitted to us. They are: - (Jerome Bicamumpaka) minister of foreign affairs and cooperation; - Faustin Munyazesa, minister of interior and communal development; - Agnes Ntamabyaliro, minister of justice; - Augustin Bizimana, minister of defense; - Straton Nsambumukunzi, minister of agriculture and livestock; - Dr. Andre Rwamakuba, minister of primary and secondary education; - Dr. Daniel Mbangura, minister of higher education, scientific research and culture; - Emmanuel Ndabahizi, minister of finance; - Prosper Mugiraneza, minister of civil service; - Eliezer Nitegeka, minister of information; - Justin Mugenzi, minister of trade, industry and crafts; - Dr. Augustin Ngirabatware, minister of planning; - Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, minister of health; - Andre Ntagerura, minister of transport and communications; - Jean de Dieu Habineza, minister of labor and social affairs; - Yacinthe Rafiki Nsengiyumva, minister of public works and energy; - Gaspard Ruhumuliza, minister of environment and tourism; - Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, minister of family and women's promotion; and - Callixte Nzabonimana, minister of youth. Rwandans, dear friends of Rwanda, the times we are experiencing demand that we increase our vigilance twofold. The security of people and property is a necessity [words indistinct] the Rwandan Armed Forces in particular. In this regard, I would like to express the Rwandan people's gratitude to the members of the Rwandan Armed Forces who continue to take on their duty with dedication, selflessness and love for their country. We encourage (?them) to persevere on this path. [passage omitted] Issued in Kigali, 8 April 1994; [Signed] Dr. Theodore Sindikubgabo, president of the Republic.
