He said: Comrades, Happy Lunar New Year! I am very pleased today to attend the 1994 Sichuan Provincial Lunar New Year Tea Party. I would like to take this opportunity to extend -- on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the leaders of State Council departments who have come with me to Sichuan -- festival greetings to the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and People's Government; to the leaders of all party, government, military, and mass organizations who are present at the tea party; to veteran comrades who have made enormous contributions in different historical periods; and to all PLA officers and soldiers, as well as the Sichuan people! I wish all of you happy Lunar New Year! I also wish all of you good health, good work, and happy family! Vice Premier Zhu Rongji went on: In 1993, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Sichuan forged ahead energetically and scored phenomenal achievements on all fronts. Last year, Sichuan not only witnessed fast-paced national economic growth, but also handled properly the relations between reform, development, and stability to a certain extent, thus conforming with both the work principles formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the overall national interests. The CPC Central Committee has called for seizing each and every excellent opportunity to deepen reform, expand opening up, push ahead with development, and maintain stability. Sichuan's enormous achievements have been fully affirmed by all the State Council department leaders who have come with me to Sichuan this time. After going back to Beijing, we will study conscientiously the demands you have raised this time, and will take practical steps to help you resolve problems. I believe that led by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and by the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and People's Government as well, the Sichuan people surely will be able to score greater achievements in the year 1994! I wish all the comrades present at this tea party good health! Thank you! A number of excellent entertainment performances were staged at the Lunar New Year tea party.
