The Oman Arab Bank (OAB) and the Oman-European Bank (OEB) have been involved in negotiations for merger, which will be the third in Oman since the Central Bank announced the incentives three years ago, bankers said on Wednesday [2 February]. "We are holding negotiations but they are still in their initial stages," OAB general manager, 'Abd-al Qadir 'Asqalan, told AFP by telephone from Muscat. "The capitals of both banks already meet the requirements set by the Central Bank but the merger is in line with the government policy to cut the number of banks and strengthen the banking sector." Oman had 11 national banks and 12 foreign units before mergers were launched and the Central Bank issued instructions for raising their capital to at least 10 million Omani riyals (26 million dollars). The first mergers involved the Bank of Muscat with Al-Ahli Bank and the Oman Commercial Bank with the Omani Al-Masraf institutions. All of them merged to ensure their capital meet Central Bank requirements and to raise their adequacy in line with guidelines by the Bank for International Settlement [BIS]. Central Bank incentives for merging banks include a deposit of 10 million riyals (26 million dollars) for 10 years with an interest rate of three percent and exemption of taxes on profits for five years. Officials have said they wanted to halve the number of banks on the grounds the local market is relatively small. "Mergers will strengthen the banking sector as they will boost the financial position of banks and cut competition in the local market," said Mansur al-Zakwani, banking chief at the Omani Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "This will also enable banks to face foreign competition." 'Asqalan, whose bank is owned by the Jordanian Arab Bank and the Omani International Company for Development and Investment, said merging with OEB could give birth to a bank with a capital of 20 million riyals (52 million dollars) as the two have a capital of 26 million dollars each. "We do not want to talk about the situation now as we have not yet entered into details. But we might raise the capital later," he said. Other Gulf states are urging their banks to merge or raise their capital to strengthen their financial position and meet the eight-percent level set by BIS as a floor for capital adequacy, the ratio between shareholders equity and assets. The BIS move, which took effect in January, is intended to ensure banks worldwide have enough funds to face a financial crisis. Most of them have reported positive results of their measures, which included stronger intervention in banks, regular inspection of their balance sheets and incentives to merging units. In the United Arab Emirates, officials said the adequacy of the country's 47 banks had exceeded 10 percent. The banking measures in Oman run parallel with large-scale reforms to revive the economy and lessen reliance on unstable oil earnings. The reforms include privatisations, freeing interest rates on loans, new incentives to investors, opening up the stock market, and upgrading the infrastructure to attract foreign capital.
