The municipality of Copenhagen still has a widespread and serious narcotics problem, and new cases of HIV infection are confirmed daily, but the problems are not any longer growing. Nevertheless, it is certainly not a rosy picture that the AIDS and Narcotics Council gives in its report for 1993. "Our initiatives in the treatment and information side, and our condom and needle-exchange programs have borne fruit. The situation in Copenhagen is less negative than many other places, but it is definitely serious," says Copenhagen Chief Public Health Service Physician Claus Lundstedt. In the narcotics area it is particularly falling prices and rising consumption of smoking-form heroin that is causing concern. But also the group of young people who are in danger of becoming addicted have need for concern, according to the council report. "We must have more and better treatment services that should offer individual treatment plans for each abuser. But if they are not motivated to free themselves from their abuse, we aren't going to spend money on them," says Lundstedt. The council is trying to find a particular method for dealing with those drug abusers who are HIV-infected and sick. At the same time, a better information campaign will be directed to those in socially disadvantaged groups and foreign-language speaking groups, whom until now have been more difficult to reach. Schoolchildren are to have education on HIV and AIDS, and there is going to continue to be free handing out of condoms and clean needles. The council is going to try and get better statistical data regarding both narcotics and HIV. "There is a huge need for more information, because as it is now, we don't have a real insight on the extent of the problems," says Lundstedt.
