FBIS4-49501 "drchi089_a_94007" FBIS-CHI-94-089 Daily Report 7 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General IAEA Will Not Send Inspection Team to DPRK IAEA Will Not Send Inspection Team to DPRK OW0705022594 Beijing XINHUA in English 0158 GMT 7 May 94 OW0705022594 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Vienna, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today it will not send an inspection team to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to observe the refueling of the country's main nuclear reactor. "We received a letter from the DPRK a short while ago, but it does not constitute the basis for sending an inspection team to the DPRK," a spokesman for the Vienna-based agency said. Therefore, the spokesman said, "The IAEA will not send an inspection team." The DPRK's letter was a reply to one sent Tuesday [3 May] by the IAEA to the DPRK's Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam insisting that its inspectors carry out safeguard tests during the refueling. Earlier, the DPRK had invited the IAEA to send inspectors to watch the replacement of spent uranium fuel rods at its main five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, but stressed the IAEA could only observe the operation. But the IAEA insisted that its inspectors make tests at the reactor to ensure that no radioactive fuel had been diverted into the making of nuclear weapons, as suspected by Western countries. The DPRK says its nuclear facilities are for peaceful purposes only. The IAEA spokesman also said that "Refueling the reactor without IAEA inspectors and permission for them to carry out safeguard inspections constitutes a serious violation of the safeguard agreement."
