Students protesting a government scheme to allow firms to pay less than the legal minimum wage to young people also occupied the railway station at Calais, northern France, for three hours, causing serious disruption. In Lyon, eastern France, scene of violent demonstrations Monday and Tuesday, riot police used water cannon and fired tear gas to disperse a group of about 100 youths and tried to arrest another group armed with baseball bats. Lyon students said most of them were holding meetings to plan for major country-wide demonstrations Friday. In Paris, students in technical universities called a one-day strike. About 100 youths laid down on the tracks at Montparnasse station, holding up high-speed (TGV) trains and main-line expresses for two hours. Suburban services came to a halt. In Calais, the state railway company SNCF bussed stranded passengers to other railway stations. In Caen, Normandy, 1,000 students marched peacefully through the town before heading for the capital, where they held up trains for 30 minutes. Another group took over a nearby motorway tollgate, allowing drivers through against a token payment. Demonstrations were also reported at La Rochelle in the west and at Reims in the northeast. Students are demanding complete withdrawal of the government's pay cut plan. In its latest form, the plan states that young people with diplomas or university degrees may be paid 80 percent of an ordinary salary for 80 percent of working time, with 20 percent of training. Initially, the government's scheme proposed that all youths be paid 20 percent less than the minimum wage of 5,900 francs (1,000 dollars) a month. Now only unqualified youths may be paid less than the minimum. Students called the plan a poor reward for years of study and trade unionists denounced it as opening the way to firing older workers and replacing them with poorly paid youths. France has 3.3 million unemployed -- almost 12 percent of the work force -- of whom more than 750,000 are under 25.
