Haavisto said in Kuopio today, that the matter is not yet connected to neutrality, and the treaty will not endanger Finland's neutrality. Haavisto thinks that the Partnership for Peace idea is a positive solution because it strengthens security in Europe, and in that sense it is in line with Finland's basic aims. According to Haavisto, it is then a different matter whether the treaty in general is a sensible thing for Finland. This afternoon it will be reported in Finland what timetable will be adhered to when the decision on the offer is to be made. According to Haavisto, the Foreign Affairs Committee will discuss the Partnership for Peace for the first time this week.
