Lucinschi's party received 43.18 percent of the votes, Nicolae Timofti, the chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, told a news conference here today. After the Agrarian Democratic Party comes the Socialist Party and the Yedinstvo Intermovement bloc supported by the Russian speaking- population, which received the votes of 22 percent of the electorate. Parties calling for unification with Romania -- the Christian Democratic People's Front [7.5 percent of the votes] and the Intelligentsia and Peasants bloc, headed by Former Parliamentary Speaker Aleksandru Mosanu, that broke away from it [9.21 percent] were defeated. The remaining nine parties and 20 independent candidates were unable to cross the four percent barrier and did not get into the new parliament. Their votes will be divided up among the winners. Thus, the Agrarian Democratic party receives 56 of the 104 seats in the new parliament and can form the new government independently. There will be two political camps poles apart: Those who favor independence and Moldova's participation in the CIS (84 mandates) and the unionist minority (20 mandates). It is expected that Petru Lucinschi will be the new speaker, and current Prime Minister Andrey Sangheli will be instructed to form the government. It is also likely that deputies will ratify the CIS agreements signed by Mircea Snegur, and will begin talks on settling the conflicts with Komrat and Tiraspol [breakaway Gagauz and Dniester Republics respectively]. In the opinion of observers from the UN, the CSCE, NATO, and a number of states, the elections in Moldova were well-organized and democratic.
