U.S. Vice President Albert Gore and President Carlos Menem gave addresses. Al Gore thanked Argentina for hosting this conference with such a magnificent level of hospitality -- referring to Menem -- and asked everyone to help him create a global infrastructure of information. He added that information is a treasure which must be shared if it is to be of true value. Let us now go to an excerpt of Menem's address: [Begin Menem recording] As Argentines, Argentines who are doubly proud. First for the distinction of having been chosen to host this conference. Also for the opportunity of showing the world our achievements in the arduous task we have undertaken, to transform the state and especially the privatization and deregulation of the communications sector. It has been an essential step in our policy: To modernize the country's structure and thus be better armed to confront the challenges of the 21st century. We have done all this and will continue, thinking of future generations. This why the transformation process being implemented avoided every opportunity for speculation. [end recording] That was part of Menem's address. He also stated that during the course of this conference, a contract will be signed to expand the cellular telephone service throughout the country, and that a international tender, one of the few examples in the world, is about to be issued to resolve the structural problem of how to control the radio-electric spectrum.
