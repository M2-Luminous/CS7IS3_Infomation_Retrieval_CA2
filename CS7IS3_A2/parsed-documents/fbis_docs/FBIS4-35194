We welcome you to the Voice of the Arabs. ['Urayqat] Good morning. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You have been selected minister of local government in the Palestinian National Authority. Can you tell us about the authority's makeup? ['Urayqat] So far, 15 portfolios have been selected. Of course, the president, brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], is the head of the Palestinian National Authority. The posts that have been given out are as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Health |Dr. Riyad al-Za'nun | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Education |Yasir 'Amr | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Justice |Furayh Abu-Middayn | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Finance |Zuhdi al-Nashashibi | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sports and Youth Affairs |'Azmi al-Shu'aybi | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tourism and Antiquities |Ilyas Frayj | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Social Affairs |Intisar al-Wazir | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Labor |Samir Ghawshah | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Housing |Zakariya al-Agha | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Culture and Arts |Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Post and Telecommunications |'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Transport |'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Planning and International Cooperation|Dr. Nabil Sha'th | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Economy and Trade |Ahmad Quray' | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Discussions on filling the other portfolios is continuing, including the Ministry of the Liberated and Injured Affairs [as heard], Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Information Ministry, Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Religious Affairs, Environment Ministry, and Interior Ministry. Appointments to these posts have not been settled yet and deliberations will continue for several days. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Are there any obstacles to the appointment of the remaining ministers? ['Urayqat] It is not really a question of obstacles. We are keeping two issues in mind. First, we are trying to represent the largest possible sector of our people in the National Authority. Contacts are taking place on several levels for this purpose. We hope that these contacts will produce a broad representation of the political movements in the National Authority. The second issue is that what we are doing now is not as easy as in other countries. We are starting from square one. We are facing huge challenges and difficulties, including the devastated infrastructure left by the Israeli occupation in Jericho and the Gaza Strip and the ruined infrastructure we are expecting to take over when the Israelis evacuate the other areas. The gaps found in the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement present further difficulties. The challenges and responsibilities are great. This is why we are making further contacts. We need more time so we can include the broadest possible representation in the National Authority while keeping in mind that the people filling the posts must have the necessary qualifications. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What criteria were used in selecting the Palestinian National Authority's ministers? ['Urayqat] There were several criteria. We had to keep in mind the mingling of Palestinians living abroad with those living inside. As you will notice, several PLO Executive Committee members and people from other PLO institutions have been given portfolios. We believed in the importance of qualifications and experience but also in the appointees' patriotic commitment and their willingness to accept the challenges. We are passing through an interim phase unprecedented in modern times. Above all, we must preserve the Palestinian people's unity at this stage, regardless of where they live. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. 'Urayqat, in this interim period you are certainly facing immense difficulties that, as you say, are a product of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory. What are your working plans for the future? ['Urayqat] As you know, our work began immediately after the occupation troops left. Still, no matter how fast we act, we will remain somewhat behind. We must remember that normal development in the occupied Palestinian territories was effectively halted in 1967. No matter how fast we work and implement our programs, we will remain a little behind because we have a lot to do. We have already done something in the short time that has passed since the end of the occupation of Gaza and Jericho. All government departments are now using documents and letterheads bearing the Palestinian National Authority's stamp. New departments have been established. Some temporary appointments have been made in all the areas. Now that the portfolios have been distributed, every ministry will build up its organizational structure and draw up plans and projects for the first 100 days. We must work quickly now. We want to finish our present work in the next few hours, not days. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. 'Urayqat, Israel consistently casts doubt on the Palestinian National Authority's actual ability to govern. Israel is saying that the Palestinians were always ruled by others and casts doubt on their ability to govern themselves. ['Urayqat] We are really facing two types of Israeli campaigns. First, media campaigns trying to undermine our efforts -- we have been expecting this -- and second, Israeli actions that violate the clauses of the agreement or create faits accomplis as in Jerusalem and the settlements. They are expanding the existing settlements. I believe that what we are doing is an experiment that involves factors of success and failure. I can definitely say that if Israel continues its current actions and fails to alter its occupier attitude to a neighborly attitude that involves respecting an adjacent nation that the experiment will fail. So far we have heard only accusations and incitements from the Israeli officials. They are also carrying out conspicuous, blatant violations of the agreement. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. 'Urayqat, we wish success for the Palestinian National Authority. We hope that the fraternal Palestinian people will fulfill their aspirations in the next stage, now that they have begun to restore their national rights. Thank you very much. ['Urayqat] You are welcome. I would like to say one last word. The current stage is one of planting, not reaping. It is a time to tighten our belts. It is a small step on a long route. We hope, however, that in the next few years our efforts and struggles will be crowned by the establishment of an independent state. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] God willing. ['Urayqat] God willing. Thank you.
