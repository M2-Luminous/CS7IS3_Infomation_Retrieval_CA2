FR941216-2-00056 FR941216-2-00037 [Docket No. CP95&hyph;104&hyph;000, et al.] Northwest Pipeline Corporation, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings December 7, 1994. Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. Northwest Pipeline Corporation [Docket No. CP95&hyph;104&hyph;000] Take notice that on November 29, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84158, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;104&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216) for authorization to abandon by removal its existing Piceance Creek Meter Station (Piceance Station) located in Rio Blanco County, Colorado, under Northwest's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;433&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Northwest proposes to abandon and remove the Piceance Station due to a lack of contract obligations for service since 1989 and the fact that Questar Pipeline Company (Questar) has removed its immediately adjacent interconnecting downstream facilities, thus making it operationally impossible for Northwest to continue to deliver natural gas. The Piceance Station is located in Section 8, Township 2 South, Range 96 West, in Rio Blanco County, Colorado, at milepost 0.05 on Northwest's Piceance Creek Lateral. The Piceance Station currently shares the station site with other facilities which will continue to be operated by Williams Gas Processing Company. The estimated cost of removal is $7,000 and the station site will be regraveled. In Docket No. CP67&hyph;141 (37 FPC 304) Northwest's predecessor was authorized to construct and operate the Piceance Station for providing service under special Rate Schedule X&hyph;17. The Piceance Station consisted of a 4-inch meter and appurtenances located near the eastern end of Northwest's Piceance Creek Lateral. Pursuant to Commission order dated April 8, 1992 in Docket No. CP92&hyph;252&hyph;000 (59 FERC 62,020), Northwest was authorized to abandon service to Questar under Rate Schedule X&hyph;17 at the Piceance Station. Comment date: January 23, 1995, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 2. Colorado Interstate Gas Company [Docket No. CP95&hyph;106&hyph;000] Take notice that on November 30, 1994, as supplemented December 5, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), P.O. Box 1087, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80944, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;106&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.208 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.208) for authorization to construct and operate a new lateral pipeline facility, under CIG's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;21&hyph;000, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. CIG proposes to construct and operate the Parachute Creek Lateral (Parachute), a new 16-inch pipeline and appurtenant facilities in Garfield and Rio Blanco Counties, Colorado at an estimated cost of $9,302,000 for the receipt of gas from fields located in the Piceance Basin in Garfield County, Colorado. CIG states that Parachute will connect to CIG's 20-inch Uinta Basin Lateral which in turn connects to CIG's 22-inch and 24-inch Wyoming Main Line. Specifically, CIG proposes to construct 36.8 miles of 16-inch pipeline and a meter station consisting of two 6-inch meter runs to receive the gas into the lateral. CIG states that long term (10 year) signed contracts with Snyder Oil Corporation and UtiliCorp United Inc. for 37,000 Dth per day supporting the need for the proposed Parachute facilities are included as an appendix to its application. Additionally, CIG states that it will hold an open season for capacity on the lateral with capacity awarded based on net present value. CIG further states that compression may be installed should firm capacity being requested exceed the available capacity. Comment date: January 23, 1995, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 3. K N Interstate Gas Transmission Co. [Docket No. CP95&hyph;113&hyph;000] Take notice that on December 5, 1994, K N Interstate Gas Transmission Co. (K N Interstate), P.O. Box 281304, Lakewood, Colorado, 80228, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;113&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for authorization to install, own and operate certain jurisdictional pipeline and compression facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. K N Interstate proposes to install, own and operate 43.9 miles of 16-inch pipeline, running parallel to its existing mainline, from a point near the town of Casper in Natrona County, Wyoming to a point near the town of Douglas in Converse County, Wyoming; 8.0 miles of 16-inch pipeline to connect the Douglas Processing Plant to K N Interstate's mainline near the town of Douglas in Converse County, Wyoming; and a 2,000 horsepower compressor at the Guernsey Compressor Station in Platte County, Wyoming. K N Interstate estimates the cost of the facilities to be $14.9 million. It is stated that K N Interstate currently operates a gas processing plant at Casper, Wyoming, which is used to process supplies of gas received from sources west of Casper. It is stated that the plant is a lean oil absorption plant which uses Freon, a chlorofluorocarbon, as a refrigerant. K N Interstate states that since the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons is being phased out, K N Interstate must take action with regard to the Casper Plant. K N Interstate submits that its best course of action involves the closure of the Casper Plant and the construction of pipeline facilities to facilitate the movement of unprocessed gas to an existing processing plant located near Douglas, Wyoming, for processing.
