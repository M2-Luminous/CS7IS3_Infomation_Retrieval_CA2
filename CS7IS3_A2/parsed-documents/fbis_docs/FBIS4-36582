He said that "modern recorders can forge anyone's voice. And the phrases I read in AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT contain terms the president does not usually use. Anyone's voice can be imitated." He was speaking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone from his residence in Paris. [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Ghani said: "We want a dialogue with the brothers in the Socialist Party, except those against whom a decision was issued by the prosecutor general. We do not believe that the Socialist Party is working against unity. It is the elements which exploded the situation militarily and squandered the Yemen Arab Republic's capabilities." [passage omitted] He pointed out that the "secessionists exploited the cease-fire announced on the eve of 'Id al-Adha to safeguard the people's lives and capabilities. So they continued their rebellion and announced the secession. Then the Security Council adopted a resolution, which we accepted for the sake of public welfare and to prevent matters from escalating and worsening, even though we opposed it on the grounds that the crisis is an internal affair. But they still announced the formation of a government." He stressed that Sanaa's acceptance of the Security Council "proceeds from its emphasis on unity and the sovereignty of the Republic of Yemen over all its territory." Then he said: "We had wanted from the outset to implement the Security Council resolution, but the others' arbitrariness prevented us. And when we set a date for the cease-fire, they sent their aircraft and naval units to shell the targets of legitimacy, as attested by reporters who were present in the sites." He criticized the statement issued in Abha [Saudi Arabia] by the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] ministerial council. He said, "I do not believe that the position taken by the GCC after we did our utmost to improve relations with them is in the interests of any state, Is the aim is to settle scores, it is erroneous."
