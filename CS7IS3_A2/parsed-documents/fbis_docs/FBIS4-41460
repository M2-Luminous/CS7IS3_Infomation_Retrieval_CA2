"We also have serious questions as regards data provided by the Americans. We hope to clear the matters up with the U.S. side during subsequent contacts," emphasised the spokesman who requested anonymity. Russia and the United States have created a confidence-building mechanism as regards chemical arms on a bilateral basis. The mechanism is in operation and provides for exchanges of data on the military-chemical capabilities of the sides and for consultations should questions arise, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
