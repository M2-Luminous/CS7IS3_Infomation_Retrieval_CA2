FBIS4-52186 "dreas089_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 North Korea Radio on ROK's Military Acts Inside DMZ Radio on ROK's Military Acts Inside DMZ SK0905065694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0320 GMT 9 May 94 SK0905065694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0320 GMT 9 May 94 Korean BFN [Text] The South Korean puppets have committed a grave military provocation inside the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ]. The South Korean puppets on 8 May committed a grave military provocation by deploying armored cars into the DMZ south of Ipo-ri, Kumgang County, Kangwon Province in the eastern section of the front line. On the same day at around 1855, the puppets mobilized armored cars from the direction of Sowha-myon, Imje County of South Korea's Kangwon Province to the DMZ near the Military Demarcation Line and assumed a firing posture aimed at our side. Prior to this, the puppets, on 1, 3, and 4 May deployed recoilless guns and large-caliber machine guns to the DMZ southeast of Kijon-ri, Changpung County, in the western section of the front line and set up a position. On 5 May, they ran madly about by firing some 70 large-caliber machine gun bullets from the same position. In the meantime, at around 1115 on 6 May, hundreds of puppet Army bandits armed with large-caliber machine guns and automatic weapons sneaked into the DMZ south of Peak No. 1211 in the eastern section of the front line, frantically staged a war exercise for a Northward invasion in broad daylight, which extremely irritated us. In addition, the South Korean puppets, at around 0846 on 2 May, committed a hostile act of dragging some 10 vehicles loaded with hundreds of heavily armed bandits into the DMZ south of Mabang-ri, Cholwon County, Kangwon Province, in the central section of the front line. From 1 to 8 May, the number of armed bandits brought in to build military facilities and positions inside the DMZ and to conduct war exercises reached approximately 6,400. The recent arms buildup -- timed to coincide with the South Korean puppets' war exercises for a Northward invasion staged with the U.S. imperialists under various titles by mobilizing the latest equipment of mass destruction -- is a deliberate and premeditated military provocative act designed to drive the situation surrounding the Military Demarcation Line to a dangerous phase. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets should squarely see the touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula due to the rascals' war provocative commotions and should not act recklessly.
