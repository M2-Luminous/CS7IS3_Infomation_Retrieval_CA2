How will you deal with this reality? ['Abd-al-Ghani] First of all, the Security Council's position is very clear through Resolution 924, which proceeds from the UN Charter and stipulates the independence and sovereignty of the state, that is the Arab Republic of Yemen proclaimed on 22 May 1990. Besides, in one of its drafts, the resolution stipulates that it is an application of Article 34. This was omitted because it concerns disputes between two states or more. So the resolution talks about what is happening in the Republic of Yemen. There is no indication at all that the recognition question is on the cards. [Abu-Husayn] Recognition is on the way, as southern leaders say, because of Sanaa's rigidity and failure to comply with the Security Council resolution. What is your opinion? ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is untrue. Sanaa complied with and implemented Resolution 924. Actually the fighting was halted for six hours the first time, but the other side violated it. On the eve of the blessed 'Id al-Adha and on the occasion of the unity's fourth anniversary our legitimate forces complied with the cease-fire, but Aden did not, and announced the secession. The fourth time, we complied, but Aden announced its decision to form a government. We are the legitimate government, and it is in our interests to have a cease-fire. But it is in the rebellious side's interests to continue to fight and to keep the issue alive on the front pages of newspapers. And it is in its interests for the United Nations to continue to issue statements and resolutions, while we complied and welcomed the UN secretary general's envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, and we sent our delegation to Cairo to engage in a dialogue, and we conceded some of the demands we had stressed. [Abu-Husayn] Like what? ['Abd-al-Ghani] That the dialogue should not be conducted in the tripartite coalition framework, but, rather, in the Republic of Yemen framework in implementation of the Security Council resolution, but the southern leadership refused because it wanted the meeting to be held in the framework of two states. [passage omitted] [Abu-Husayn] What is your opinion of your bombardment of cities and residential areas and killing of civilians? ['Abd-al-Ghani] First of all, we are not targeting any citizen, civilian or military. This war is imposed on us by some Socialist Party leaders, not all of them. Because the Socialist Party is unionist, and it had the honor of signing the unity agreement with the General People's Congress. This is why I say that the rebels in the south are using civilians as human shields for military purposes and so that public opinion will sympathize with them. I wonder here: What view does public opinion take of shelling Sanaa with the internationally banned Scud missiles, which claimed the lives of 23 citizens? [passage omitted] [Abu-Husayn] Despite all you say, the siege is imposed on Aden, and there are northern intentions to burn it. ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is untrue. We will not burn Aden, because Aden has not responded to the secessionists. It has expelled them, and they now live in world capitals and in safe areas. All governorates of the Republic of Yemen reject these people, who have rebelled against legitimacy and portray themselves as the victims. [Abu-Husayn] But the people of the south celebrated the DRY's proclamation on 22 May 1990. ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is untrue. That state and its leadership were not set up through elections or a referendum. So we wonder: Under what legitimacy does it rule or represent the people of the south? [Abu-Husayn] It seems that the dispute is not over unity, but, rather, the way in which it was established, because the south has not ignored the unity, and some southern leaders say that secession has been imposed on them. ['Abd-al-Ghani] True, no Yemeni will dare reject the unity. And if the dispute is over the form of the unity, why have southern leaders rejected the new formulas which we spent months negotiating? I was a member of the dialogue committee with Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, and we reached the Pledge and Accord Document by dint of strenuous efforts and continued dialogues, but southern leaders rejected this document. [Abu-Husayn] But they are demanding that Sanaa comply with the stipulations of the document, saying that the southern state was established on the basis of the principles stipulated in it. ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is designed for public opinion. [passage omitted] [Abu-Husayn] I ask you again, and I want a specific answer: Is it possible to return to a unified state in these conditions? ['Abd-al-Ghani] Why not? Yes, it is possible, provided the people of Yemen are left alone. We are confident that, if that happens, we will find solutions to problems, because what complicates the problem is internationalizing and Arabizing it. Thus we urge the brothers and friends to focus their efforts on supporting unity, and to stop supporting one group against another. They should support the wish of the Yemeni people, who welcomed unity on 22 May 1990. [Abu-Husayn] Will the abolition of the southern state be among the solutions? ['Abd-al-Ghani] Yes, the southern state should be abolished, and unity between the two peoples, not two states, established. I requested a meeting yesterday with the brothers from the Socialist Party, especially Salim Salih, who was in Cairo, but he left Cairo and refused to meet with me because he wanted the meeting to be held on the basis of two states -- which is unacceptable. [passage omitted] [Abu-Husayn] The south believes that Resolution 924 means halting the fighting first and then engaging in a dialogue. ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is true, but in addition to a phrase which says, in the framework of the Republic of Yemen. We are willing to do that, and I announce through AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that we accept an immediate halt to the fighting as of this very moment, and the time now is 6:30. But I have to receive a telephone call from the other party, announcing its acceptance of this, then we would agree on an unconditional dialogue and on the first matter, that is, a halt to the fighting. The second matter is dialogue: let us negotiate everything within the framework of the Republic of Yemen, legitimacy, and the Security Council resolution. [passage omitted] [Abu-Husayn] How will you deal with the Security Council resolution if they are stepped up to the point of imposing sanctions? ['Abd-al-Ghani] We have not committed a crime for us to be punished, nor have we fought anyone outside our borders. [Abu-Husayn] What about the results of your meeting with Lakhdar Brahimi in Cairo? ['Abd-al-Ghani] The meeting was very good. We spoke about the importance of implementing the Security Council resolution, I stressed Sanaa's readiness for that, and we agreed to continue consultations and contacts. [Abu-Husayn] With regard to the Arab League's role, do you want it to continue its endeavors? ['Abd-al-Ghani] Why not? Especially as the League has said from the outset that what is happening in Yemen concerns the Yemenis. [Abu-Husayn] What is the position of both Iraq and Iran toward you, especially in light of the accusations that they are supporting you militarily? ['Abd-al-Ghani] First of all, Iraq is currently being subjected to an embargo, and if an ant moves out of it, it is under close watch. Second, we are capable of protecting unity and need not import people to defend our unity. As for Iran, it supports unity politically, and we welcome the position adopted by it or by any other state.
