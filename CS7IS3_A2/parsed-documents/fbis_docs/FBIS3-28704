It also gave tacit approval to the bombings of the offices of three oil companies by the leftist Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB]. "We believe it is the right of the people to protest in the loudest possible manner, and RAM will be a participant in the planned protest actions," Captain Danilo Lim, RAM spokesperson, said in a televised interview. Church, labor, consumer and even business groups have also joined the clamor for a rollback in fuel prices. Lim described the attacks on the oil company offices as "the only language which the government understands. Such bombings are being conducted since only through such acts can the people capture the attention of the government," he said. In a separate interview on radio, Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan, who led several of the coup attempts, urged the government to heed the public outcry or face worsening violence. At the same time, however, he appealed for sobriety and for earnest dialogues. "We need a sober approach. We are on the side of the protesters because the impact is serious, but let us focus (our efforts)," he said. "The choices are we either fight each other again or sit down and talk about how we can help one another." Another rightwing rebel, Proceso Maligalig, who is involved in peace talks with the government, said: "We should be dispassionate about this. We should be rational about it. This could be the start of a serious problem." In the provinces: -- The multisectoral People's Initiative to Denounce and Reject Oil (Price Increases), or PIDRO, called off a rally scheduled in Davao City on Sunday, the day Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed visits Davao. -- Students and non-government organizations plan a big protest rally today in Baguio. A bigger rally is set for 9 February to coincide with the general strikes planned in Metro Manila, Davao and Cagayan de Oro cities. -- A similar mass action is scheduled today in lloilo City, regional center of Western Visayas. -- Three radio stations in Cebu City whose commentators have reportedly been urging people to join a civil disobedience movement are under fire from the National Telecommunications Commission [NTC]. The National Bureau of Investigation, meanwhile, released a sketch of one of four men believed to have lobbed sticks of dynamite at Petron and Shell buildings in Makati last Tuesday. On that day, too, a bomb was hurled at the Caltex office in Manila. President Ramos reiterated an appeal for sobriety and solidarity "so as not to jeopardize our efforts for national recovery. Panic and extremist actions can only result in higher inflation, fewer jobs, reduced investment, trade and tourism, and delayed growth," Mr. Ramos said at the opening of the two-day conference of the Federation of Industrial Security Organization of the Philippines. [passage omitted] "It is not the people who should bear the brunt of the government's excessive spending and blind obedience to the dictation of powerful forces outside the government," Lim said. Echoing a common sentiment aired by other protest groups, he said the Ramos administration could look for other ways to raise revenues than increase the price of gasoline and other petroleum products. In Camp Crame, top police officials and security officers of government and private installations agreed in a meeting to adopt "airtight defenses to thwart further sabotage around their facilities." Police officials said these measures would include security in and around power, oil, water and communications facilities. "We are not taking any chances despite the pronouncement of the ABB to hold off further attacks in Metro Manila," said Director Pedro Sistoza, deputy chief for administration of the Philippine National Police. Present at the meeting were security chiefs of Caltex Philippines Inc., Pilipinas [Philippines] Shell, Petron, Meralco [Manila Electric Company], Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, National Power Corp. and the Energy Regulatory Board. [passage omitted] The National Telecommunications Commission will investigate radio stations DYLA, DYRB and DYFX in Cebu for their commentators' advocacy of civil disobedience as a form of protest. Danilo Sy, NTC regional director, said he would ask officials of the three stations to explain why their commentators were allowed to make statements that could cause public unrest. DYLA is owned by the Associated Labor Union-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP). DYRB belongs to defeated presidential candidate Eduardo Cojuangco, and DYFX has the Iglesia ni Cristo [Church of Christ] as its major stockholder. Rally organizers in Davao City put off their mass action in response to an appeal from Mayor Rodrigo Duterte to hold their rally any day except on the day of Mahathir's visit. The organizers also had a dialogue with Duterte's chief of staff, Leoncio Evasco. Duterte later promised to provide government vehicles to transport protesters from the countryside to the city center. "I would like to extend my gratitude to whoever were planning to stage a mass action for their understanding," he said. Duterte said he would not join a rally set for Monday by the militant People Against Oil Price Increase because "the greater interest of the people requires that I support President Ramos. My duty is to assure that the government remains stable," he said.
