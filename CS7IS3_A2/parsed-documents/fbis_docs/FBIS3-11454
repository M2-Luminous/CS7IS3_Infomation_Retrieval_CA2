The event, which will take place in Buenos Aires and will be attended by Argentine President Carlos Menem, will gather together representatives from 182 countries. On 18 March USIS distributed a note reporting on the special attention the United States is giving to the event, in that Vice President Gore is involved in the issue of the development of the "information superhighway." This network will enable the United States to create the conditions to transmit images, data, and voice through one physical medium. Another important point to be viewed in Gore's speech will be the proposal to open the telecommunications area to bids, because in several countries telecommunications are a monopoly, under state control. Gore will go to Argentina to defend the fast deregularization of the sector, as this is "a path that can increase investment in the area and result in improving the quality of the services." This message, and the idea of ensuring harmonious development, will also be presented at the G-7 conference scheduled for July in Italy. Al Gore will stay in Buenos Aires only for the opening of the conference, which will last nine days. The U.S. delegation to the conference is comprised of representatives from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates this sector; from the Department of State and the Department of Commerce; and from private enterprises. FCC Chairman Reed Hunt will take the opportunity to point out to those attending the conference that "information" can be in two places at the same time. He will address them via satellite, live, from another meeting -- the National Association of Broadcasters convention -- which will be taking place in Las Vegas in the United States. Gore will begin a series of discussions searching for harmonious solutions to telecommunications development. What has become clear is that it does not help to concentrate physical means, optic fibers, and satellites in the northern hemisphere while the world turns around a globalized economy. The program contemplates the definition of practical actions. Another goal of the meeting is to discuss the bases for ITU regulations and programs aimed at developing telecommunications during the 1995-1999 period.
