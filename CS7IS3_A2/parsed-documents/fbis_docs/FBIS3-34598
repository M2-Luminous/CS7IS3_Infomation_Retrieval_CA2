He said: Having given up on the possibility of achieving a military victory; having used their air force and guided missiles for months without being able to shake up our domestic front despite the enormous destruction they caused to our lifelines; having discovered that a ground war, if attempted, would result in a great disaster for them; and having watched the Iraqis occupy al-Khafji without air cover, the enemies resorted to treachery and treason. They turned to the Iranian regime of ayatollahs that has raised the slogan of war against the arch satan in order to mislead the simpletons and to pretend that it is not in league with the arch satan and, in fact, with all the satans in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. The Iranian rulers have carried out this disgraceful act, despite all its meanness, deception, and betrayal of a Muslim neighbor, in order to support the unjust infidel and to seek revenge from Iraq for defeating them and foiling their plans in the second al-Qadisiyah [Iraq-Iran war] -- hence their inferiority complex. The leader president commented on that by saying: Withdrawal from Kuwait was not within our plans, if it had not for that treachery. We wanted to deprive the enemies of any opportunity to undermine the domestic front, which was our main concern. As for the question of fighting the enemies, that was something else. If circumstances did not let us fight the enemies outside the border, we were ready to fight them inside Iraq. We planned to draw them into the cities, and thus foil their plans against our domestic front. So the enemies know the secret of Iraqi steadfastness. It is the solid domestic front, which our wise leadership has considered the main base. It is, in fact, the object and means of the revolution and its ambitious programs. When the enemies realized their treachery had little effect by any military standards -- it certainly failed in its strategic aim to overthrow the regime and to establish a foothold on our land -- they declared a unilateral cease-fire, thereby acknowledging their military and political defeat despite all the international mobilization and the propaganda campaign which carried on for 400 [as published] hours daily. Since the enemies can justify their premeditated action in using Iran to carry out their treachery -- in view of their well-known baseness since the days of Khalid Bin-al-Walid and Salah al-Din's encounter with the Crusaders, Iran will not be able to justify its action. The enemies are infidels who claim no religion or mission. But what do the ayatollahs, who are entrenched in the vestibules of trickery, have to say when they claim to be faithful and good Muslims, who uphold the values and ethics of the chaste imams?!! Due to their strong disappointment, the treacherous used their lackeys, those rotten head traitors, to establish a new situation in northern Iraq that was bound to disappear, and to divide Iraq into small sectarian or ethnic states, so it would be easy for them to control its resources and to end the blessed revolution march of the Ba'th Party and its masses. If we go back to enemy plans and designs we will discover that they had indeed planned for such a situation. They knew that a military victory over Iraq was an impossibility. So they pinned their hopes on their agents here and there to carry out the plan of splitting Iraq and turning it into another Lebanon. There are several points in common between the al-Sa'ud family and the Tehran regime, whether they conduct their relations openly or secretly -- "the claimants of religion" in Riyadh are of a Jewish descent dating back to 'Abdallah Ibn-Saba, who extended a secret hand to the Persian Mazdaist Abu Lu'lu'ah Fayruz [name as published] in order to stab the Caliph Faruq for a cause that was more than personal. Historical documents prove the al-Sa'ud are nothing more than a guided tool in the hand of the foreigner, and that Iran had never been ruled by a ruler who was sincere to Islam or friendly to the Arabs. The al-Sa'ud cannot also be dissociated from Zionist Jewish policy. One can trace that by considering their common attitude, as well as their independent stands, toward the Ottoman position on the Palestine question. Put simply, the al-Sa'ud are in full harmony with all or most of the Zionist Protocols. A book published by Ahmad Baha' al-Din in 1967 under the title: "Israiliyat" contains all the details of this harmonious relationship. All historical documents show the al-Sa'ud were never a party to any sincere Arab plan that was hostile to Jews, imperialism, and Zionism. Whenever they were forced, they simply promised, but they never fulfilled their promise. In fact, the al-Sa'ud's history shows their hatred to Arab nationalism. We have all read about their armed raids and attacks on Arab tribes in the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. Even the Gulf sheikhdoms and the al-Sabah of Kuwait know that, and hold memories of stands which may not be clear to the reader now. The al-Sa'ud attacked Yemen in 1934. Their position on Jamal 'Abd al-Nasir's intervention in Yemen and their secret involvement in the June 1967 setback are well known. Their relationship with Egypt only deepened after 'Abd al-Nasir's departure. Here is Henry Kissinger explaining to us the roles played by the agents in the region. In an article in THE WASHINGTON POST published in August 1992, Kissinger says: The climate in the Middle East became good and suitable for a settlement satisfactory to Israel after the following: -- The collapse of the USSR. -- The destruction of Iraqi power. Kissinger points out that Iraqi power did not represent one country but a whole nation. He also referred to the Iraqi role in 1967 and 1973. He declared that the agents in Saudi Arabia were a great support for what had happened. They asked the United States in 1967 to direct a blow to 'Abd al-Nasir. The also instigated the aggression against Iraq and allocated "$700 billion" [as published] as a minimum sum for the costs of the aggression. It has been proven that the Saudi Government told criminal Bush that it would revamp its military establishment after the Gulf War by spending sums to the tune of $12 billion, and that criminal Bush convinced the Congress to sell 72 F-15, 18 F-15E, and 24 F-15H aircraft to Saudi Arabia to make it the central Arab power in the post-war period to help achieve the short-term and strategic aims of the imperialist-Zionist plan. As for the liberation of Palestine, it is an empty slogan which the al-Sa'ud have made meaningless. The roles of the Iranian Persian side and the al-Sa'ud side, which is of Jewish lineage and spirit, may appear contradictory on the outside, but they are harmonious in substance, aim, and purpose. The Khomeynite phenomenon raised the slogan of "exporting the revolution" to eliminate the Arab national identity, and the al-Sa'ud Wahhabist Movement sought to divide the nation for the sake of its common interests with the covetous foreign infidel. When the leader president referred to the historic mistake -- telling Iraqi commanders on Army Day this year that Iraq did not commit a historic mistake during the Gulf War -- he wanted to draw a clear line between our principles that are reinforced by noble values, and enemy stands that are full of falsehood, deception, and evil cunning. The stands were historic mistakes in part and parcel, and in intention, action, thought, and reality. Throughout the years, the enemies have been committing mistakes history has recorded against them. It is as if they are born with a stigma on their foreheads, a lineage stigma of meanness and villainy carried from generation to generation. Perhaps, time and some form of self re-examination will enable those who forgot or pretended to forget to learn the lesson of history.
