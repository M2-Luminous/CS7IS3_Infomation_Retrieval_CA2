Citing unofficial sources, SRNA [news agancy] says that the bridge near Okucani linking RSK and the Srpska republic will be discussed tomorrow in Belgrade by Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of Butrus-Ghali, and RSK President Milan Martic. This morning at about 0530 UNPROFOR units completely blocked all roads between western Slavonia and this bridge. The "blue helmets" denied access even to trucks carrying bread. Several hundred citizens gathered at about 1100 near the bridge to protest against this blockade. As we have unofficially learned in Knin, the members of the RSK ministry for internal affairs, who control the bridge, have no intention of abandoning it. At today's talks Colonel Wood received an offer whereby members of UNPROFOR may control the bridge along with Krajina's police, SRNA says.
