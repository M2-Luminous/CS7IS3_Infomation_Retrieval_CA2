This is Russia's stand set forth by Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Avdeyev at a meeting with National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov. Mr. Avdeyev told journalists that he raised the issue of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Russia's stand on NATO's ultimatum to the warring sides. The UN Security Council has authorized NATO to use force only if UN troops are attacked, Mr. Avdeyev said. The tragedy in Sarajevo did not affect NATO troops but nevertheless the NATO Council issued an ultimatum to the warring sides and threatened with air strikes. If air strikes are to be used then it is necessary for the UN Security Council to extend a new mandate to NATO. Russia's stand is that in principle the possibility of air strikes should not be excluded. [passage omitted]
