Considering the need to deepen economic reforms, increase productivity in foreign trade and economic relations, promote and improve exports, and liberalize the activity of exporting establishments, encouraging them to contribute toward improving the Republic's foreign currency reserves and export potential, I have decided: 1. All legally authorized persons be allowed to export strategically important products. Considering the income from the sale of products abroad and the legal amount to be used from that income to improve the Republic's integrated foreign currency fund, the sale of the minimum volume of strategically important products in return for convertible foreign monetary units in 1994 be established and approved. 2. Regarding the effort to be made to liberalize the export of strategically important products, the volume of domestic need for those products in 1994 be established and approved so that the demand of the establishments and organizations can be met. The producers will be directly responsible for the sale of the established amount of strategically important products in return for convertible foreign monetary units and for the supply of the established amount of products for domestic needs. 3. The financial resources to be created through the sale of strategic or nonstrategic products be transferred to the Republic's integrated foreign currency fund without delay. The sale of the Republic's products in return for convertible foreign monetary units be effected either on the basis of advance payments or in accordance with irrevocable letters of credit so that the financial resources to be created through the sale of the Republic's products can be used to realize the most important social and economic projects and to meet the most urgent needs of the people. 4. The committee responsible for Azerbaijan's customhouse offices be instructed to allow those who will be legally authorized to export Azerbaijan's products to export their commodities in return for convertible foreign monetary units only if they possess documents from pertinent banks confirming that the commodities to be exported have either been paid for in advance or are covered by letters of credit. 5. The state establishments and organizations be instructed to sell their products either by putting out contracts for bidding or through the Republic's stock markets to guarantee the market value of their products. 6. The Azerbaijani Council of Ministers draw up and approve the new norms and levels of the allocations to be made from the funds created through exports and other trade activities to the Republic's integrated foreign currency fund within 10 days, ensure that, as a rule, the state establishments and organizations sell their products either on the basis of contracts that will be put out for bidding or through the Republic's stock markets so that the prices of products can be established in accordance with the demand in the markets, and prepare and approve the rules for the reorganization of foreign trade within seven days. The Council of Ministers draw up and approve a new tariff system for energy consumption to increase the Republic's export potential and seriously reduce fuel and other forms of energy consumption. Considering the increasing rate of inflation, the Council of Ministers rearrange the sale prices of fuel and other forms of energy in the Republic once every three months so that the productivity of the fuel and energy supply complex can be improved. To simplify customhouse procedures, obstruct the violation of laws, and establish discipline in that field, the Council of Ministers approve the listed documents required for exports and imports within seven days. It must be noted that those who are legally authorized to export or import commodities will not be asked to submit any document other than those listed for customhouse procedures. 7. The Azerbaijan National Bank be recommended to draw up and implement the measures that are required to establish the manat's domestic value to allow the money market among the banks to function properly. Regarding the need to stimulate exports, the Azerbaijan National Bank be recommended to give priority to producer establishments, which sell products to foreign countries, when exchanging manats for other currencies, systematically supervise the foreign currency operations by the commercial banks in accordance with the existing laws, and see to it that the allocations to be made from the funds, which are acquired by the authorized exporters and importers, to the Republic's integrated foreign currency fund in accordance with the established norms are transferred on time. 8. A state committee be established to supervise foreign economic relations so that the foreign economic work in the Republic can be organized and the productivity of trade activities can be increased. That committee be empowered to authorize barter agreements for products that are of strategic importance to the Republic. Appointments to the state committee be as follows: a. First deputy prime minister be chairman. b. Deputy prime minister and minister of economy. c. Minister of finance. d. Minister of foreign economic relations. e. Chairman of the State Committee for Customhouses. f. Director of the State Main Inspectorate for Taxes. g. Chairman of the Azerbaijan National Bank Executive Committee. h. Chairman of the Azerbaijan International Shares and Commerce Bank [Azerbaijan Sehimdar Komnisya Beynelhak Banki]. The state committee be instructed to study the agreements concluded by individual establishments and organizations for imports and exports and inform Azerbaijan's president and prime minister about the Republic's foreign trade situation at least once a month. 9. The chairman of the state committee be instructed to draw up the rules and regulations of the State Committee for Supervision on Foreign Economic Relations and submit them for the president's approval within two weeks. 10. A provision in paragraph 2 of the decree the president issued on 10 January 1994 to improve Azerbaijan's foreign trade says that the export of strategically important products be subject to the president's approval. That provision be regarded as null and void. 11. The Azerbaijan Council of Ministers adopt decisions for the implementation of this decree. [Signed] Geydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan.
