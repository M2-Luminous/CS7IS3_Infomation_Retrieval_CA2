Scientists in the light industry sector, who actively conducted scientific research activities by upholding the party's intent, finished developing the technology for the production of tasty and nutritious imitation meat made with beans, and put this technology into practice. By deeply cherishing the lofty intent of the dear comrade leader to constantly upgrade the people's living standard, scientists in the Grain Engineering Research Institute and Food Machine Research Institute of the Academy of Science for Light Industry, dedicated their passion and study to developing a large quantity of good- quality foodstuffs suiting people's taste. They succeeded in producing a tasty, nutritious, and easy-to-process imitation meat by using bean residues from which soybean oil was extracted. The imitation meat, which was recently researched and developed, is highly nutritious, and is easy to process and store. In addition, its structure [chojik kujo] and the feel when it is chewed are nearly the same as meat. Thus, it has a good flavor. Besides, the process to manufacture it is simple and its cost is low. For this, it is regarded as a cheap foodstuffs product. This has been proven by several papers presented by scientists after examination and analysis. Various products were compared and showed that 100 grams of pork has 107 calories; meat 88, and bean curd made of bean residues has 82. However, the calorie value of this imitation meat was 134, showing 1.2 times more calories than pork, 1.5 times more than meat, and 1.6 times more than bean curd made of bean residues. An analysis shows that pork has 21 percent of protein; meat 18.7 percent, and bean curd made of bean residues 9.6 percent. However, bean-based imitation meat showed 14.5 percent of protein. Thus, it has contains more protein than bean residues-made bean curd, although less than pork and meat. Besides, 95 percent of the bean-based imitation meat protein is digestible. It has no harmful element to the health of people. Bean-based imitation meat has also the advantage that it can be stored for a long time. This meat is easy to dry, and can be stored for about a month in the summer without packing, and about five months in the spring and autumn. The refrigerated and compressed bean-based imitation meat can be stored for as long as one year, and if well packaged, it can be stored for over a year. Thus, the bean-based imitation meat, has a high nutritious value, is easy to process, and it is tasty. Residents in many places who actually included this meat in their diet said its taste is similar to that of chicken when they mixed in various seasonings after soaking it in water for a few minutes. In particular, soup made with this meat mixed in with some real meat, pork or chicken, is very delicious, just as that made of real meat. Since the cost of making bean-based imitation meat is very low, it is very cheap. Bean residues from which soybean oil was extracted, some salt, and baking soda, are all the materials required for producing this imitation meat. Electricity consumption is also very low. Besides, its production process is simple, and setting up its production facilities is relatively easy. The process is as follows: We cut bean residues, from which soybean oil is extracted, into pieces of a certain size and mix them in water with salt and baking soda. We then knead them, and put them in a two-axis screw compressor. They will then be turned into a form of fiber in the machine at a temperature of 135 degrees Centigrade and at a three-megapascal pressure. Following this, they will pass through thin mechanical nozzle opening, and will spout out to the air instantaneously. This is how the imitation meat is produced. As its production process is very simple, one can easily produce it anywhere if one has a two-axis screw compressor. Functionaries and workers in the Yongbok general foodstuff plant in Pyongyang, in the Changgwang dried rice foodstuff plant, and in the rice mill of the Chunghwa cooperative farm in Chunghwa County, have gained experience in producing bean-based imitation meat in cooperation with scientists. Their experience shows that if we work with revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, we can easily learn this production process. In fact, engineering workshops in foodstuffs plants set up this production process with their own strength, and are using it to produce bean-based imitation meat. The bean-based imitation meat, which was produced by the light industry scientists, who uphold lofty intention of dear comrade leader, will certainly contribute to enriching the people's dietary life in the future.
