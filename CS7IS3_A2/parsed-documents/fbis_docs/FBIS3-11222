Baena Soares added that the possibility of including drug trafficking on the agenda of the meeting he will hold with President Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella on 18 March "depends on the decision" of Argentine officials. As to armed forces' participation in the antinarcotics effort, he said: "It is up to each country to decide about that because several countries believe this is a task to be fulfilled by police." The OAS has a special commission to deal with this issue, and Baena Soares said he is in favor of "concentrating efforts to reduce demand for drugs." He said: "To reduce this demand means to educate and rehabilitate drug addicts and reinstate them into society." At 1030 today, Baena Soares and Menem will attend the ceremony closing the OAS experts' meeting that has been discussing the guidelines of a new security system for the hemisphere that can adapt to the changes that have been occurring in the international political scene. On 17 March, Menem received from the Panamerican Foundation for Development the Inter-American Leadership Award for 1994. President Menem was decorated in the presence of Baena Soares. Thanking him for the honor, Menem said he was proud to have "brought peace" to the country by granting presidential pardons. At the end of the 17 March meeting, four basic points to be included in the final document were established. This final document will officially be released at the end of the experts' meeting that started 15 March. According to a proposal made by a U.S. delegation member, the OAS might establish "a center for the solution of conflicts" occurring in countries on the American continent, and a mechanism to bring together OAS member countries' defense ministers similar to the one that institutionalized the foreign ministers' conferences. It was established during the meeting that the Inter-American Defense Committee should advise the OAS political organizations, and that the Inter-American Defense College should cooperate in reorganizing a security system for the continent.
