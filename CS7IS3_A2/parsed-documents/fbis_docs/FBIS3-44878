It is reported that members of the committee held that, according to the stipulations of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the PRC will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997 and the British Government will return Hong Kong to the PRC on the same day. This means that British rule over Hong Kong will end on 30 June 1997. Prior to this, the British Government is using two constitutional documents, "Letters Patent" and "Royal Instructions," as legal grounds for its rule over Hong Kong. It rules Hong Kong specifically through a political structure composed of the Legislative Council, two municipal councils, and district boards. The British Hong Kong political structure is an overall reflection of the British rule over Hong Kong. With the termination of British rule over Hong Kong, the two constitutional documents that hold its power together will definitely be abolished, that is, the legal grounds will disappear. This signifies that the original British Hong Kong political structure that rules Hong Kong will of course terminate concurrently. British rule over Hong Kong can neither be extended beyond 30 June 1997, nor can it be allowed to make any decisions to let the existing political structure do so. Otherwise, it will be considered to have overstepped its power, and the principle of sovereignty stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law will be meaningless. If such were the case, it would be the same as extending British rule beyond 1 July 1997, which is absolutely impossible. According to the abovementioned principle, council members of the last term of the three-tier political structure under the British Hong Kong Government can only serve until 30 June 1997. However, current relevant laws of the British Hong Kong Government specify that all the terms for council members under the three-tier political structure are four years. Members of the committee felt that this clearly contravenes the abovementioned principle, and therefore is definitely invalid. The day when China resumes its sovereignty over Hong Kong, 1 July 1997, is also the time of the termination of the existing British Hong Kong political structure. This is also a justified and inevitable outcome when Britain returns Hong Kong to the PRC and the Chinese Government resumes its sovereignty over Hong Kong. This is the duty the British Government should fulfill and a right the Chinese Government should exercise, as stipulated in the Joint Declaration. Members of the committee pointed out that the first legislative body and district organizations of the Hong Kong SAR established after 1 July 1997 will be completely different in nature from the political structure of the British Hong Kong Government prior to 1 July 1997. It will not be a "complete copy" of the original British Hong Kong political structure, but one that will be established in accordance with the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law and relevant decisions of the National People's Congress [NPC]. It will be a political structure that embodies the Chinese Government's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and shows that Hong Kong is run by its residents and enjoys a high degree of autonomy. The status, power, and organization of the legislative body of the Hong Kong SAR will differ greatly from the Legco, which acts as a British Hong Kong consultative organization. The Basic Law and relevant decisions of the NPC on procedures for establishing the first government and legislative body of the Hong Kong SAR have specified conditions and confirmation procedures for council members to ride on the "through train." The Chinese Government had hoped that China and Britain would make arrangements for a smooth transition for members of the last term of the British Hong Kong Legco through consultations. However, as China and Britain could not reach an agreement on Hong Kong's 1994/1995 election arrangements in their talks, conditions for the transition of council members no longer exist. Members of the committee pointed out that the two legislative institutions, different in nature, cannot be lumped together, even if there had been an agreement between China and Britain on arrangements for transition. Nor is it because of the absence of an agreement that the current issue of the different nature of the two legislative institutions has emerged. As mentioned earlier, it is the different legal grounds that decide the different nature of the two legislative institutions. Members of the committee also pointed out that as component parts of the British Hong Kong Government political structure, the district boards and two municipal councils of Hong Kong are closely connected to the administrative power of the British Hong Kong Government. Therefore, as with Legco, the last term of the district boards and two municipal councils of the British Hong Kong Government will inevitably be terminated on 30 June 1997. If the regional organizations are not of an administrative nature, they certainly may transit to the Hong Kong SAR and all they need is an agreement between China and Britain. However, for reasons known to all, China is unable to realize this wish.
