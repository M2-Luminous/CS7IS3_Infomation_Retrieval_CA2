Gaviria, who arrived in Japan on Saturday for a five-day visit, expressed interest in joining APEC at a meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the officials said. Gaviria also said he wants Japan to become a "bridge" in strengthening ties between Colombia and the Asia-Pacific region, they said. Hosokawa told Gaviria Japan welcomes the strengthening of ties between Colombia and the Asia-Pacific region and that he thinks bilateral ties between Colombia and Japan will increase. In the November APEC meeting in Seattle, Mexico and Papua New Guinea won membership to the forum, while Chile was named to become a member this year. The group froze further membership applications through 1996, however. Ministry officials said Japan will take into account Colombia's bid and will convey the intention to other members of APEC. Also during the 20-minute meeting at the prime minister's official residence, Hosokawa told Gaviria Japan has decided to extend yen loans to Colombia for an agricultural development project along the Ariari River, the officials said. Japanese and Colombian officials are currently negotiating the amount of the loans, they said. Hosokawa said Japan is considering sending a mission to Colombia within fiscal 1994 to study participation in a project to improve the traffic network in the capital city of Bogota. Japan will also extend a cultural grant-in-aid of 45 million yen to Bolivar Memorial Museum for its purchases of audiovisual equipment, Hosokawa said. Turning to economic relations, Gaviria urged Japan to import tropical fruits from Colombia and to have cut flowers quarantined in Colombia before exporting them to Japan, the officials said. He also said Colombia wants to export coal and petrol in the future. Japanese ambassador to Colombia Masaki Yagi, who accompanied Hosokawa in the meeting, said the matters concerning tropical fruits and cut flowers should be discussed when Colombia's agricultural minister visits Japan in April and that the coal and petrol issues should be discussed among the private sector.
