The NESAVISIMAYA GAZETA daily reports about a regular round of talks between representatives of major factions in the state duma and a candidacy for its chairman. Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the Agrarian Party, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that if "no consensus is reached on the nomination of a candidate to the post of the duma speaker satisfying to all, then deputies' votes will have to be counted." The newspaper says that this is precisely what leaders of each of the factions will have to do, with this procedure expected to be especially painful for the "Russia's Choice" bloc since it will obviously lack its own votes to overweight the votes of the Agrarian Party, the Russian Communist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party. The results of the elections to the new Russian Parliament held on December 12 and the victory of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky was regarded by many people as a threat posed by Russian fascism, says an article published by the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. According to the newspaper, the "Russia's Choice" bloc, having spent twice as much as the Liberal Democratic Party and having bought much more air time on television than the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, has lost to Zhirinovsky the elections by party blocs and managed to level the situation thanks to those constituencies which cast ballots for individual candidates rather than for party blocs." "All this gives ground to believe that by doing so Russian electors, in fact, have denied confidence to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the government which after the elections becomes the government of the minority," the article says. Acording to the article, millions of electors voted not for fascism or fascists, but rather for clear-cut politics". Forecasting the development of the situation in the new Russian Parliament, the article says that "at present, representatives of some parties and blocs renounced cooperation with the Liberal Democratic Party which is "fraught with distabilisation in parliament and sharp increase of the role and powers of the president." As for economic problems, the article says that neither of political parties which won seats in parliament has a clear-cut and comprehensive economic programme and one can say with certainty that neither the state duma, nor the federation council will deal with the economics now, leaving it for the government to attend to." The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA daily carries an intreview with ex-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Commenting on the development of the economic situation in Russia, Gorbachev said that nowadays, Russia needs politics uniting people rather than splitting the country. As for the victory won in the elections by the Liberal Democratic Party, Gorbachev described its leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, as a splendid actor, adding that " it very important to fund out who directs him and who backs him up." "Undoubtedly, his capabilities were appreciated and will be made use of in future, but I do not see the need for launching an anti- fascist movement in Russia. Are we going to accuse of fascism people who voted for Zhirinovsky? By the way, the Constitution would not have been approved without these people's votes," Gorbachev said. An article published by the SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA today also denies that there is a need to create the so-called "anti-fascist front". The article says that the idea of creating this front is obviously directed against "triumphant elections held by the Liberal Democratic Party led by Zhirinovsky, and, consequently, against the free will of electors which makes up the basis of democracy." The TRUD daily focuses on the results of 1993 discussed from different points of view by prominent Russian philosopher Alexander Tsipko and an economist and state duma deputy, Vasily Selyunin. Tsipko pointed out that in 1993 he was disappointed in what was going on in Russia, adding that "neither the truth, no democracy and the market itself were any good to a Soviet man." Selyunin expressed a different opinion, pointing out that in 1993, an end was put to dual power in Russia and the living standards began to gradually improve which is seen from the fact that the consumption of food has increased approximately by ten per cent. "We have saved our economy which many former soviet republics failed to do," Selyunin said. The PRAVDA daily writes in its economic forecast for 1994 that the living standards of the population will further decline. "In 1994, approximately 33 per cent of the Russian people will have an average income per capita less than the minimum subsistence level," the newspaper said. The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper published the results of a sociological poll. The majority of respondents believe that life has stabilised and 13 per cent of respondents even said that their life improved over the past year.
