FR941007-2-00056 FR941007-2-00031 Western Area Power Administration Replacement Resources Process, Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992 AGENCY: Western Area Power Administration, DOE. ACTION: Notice of public consultation meetings. SUMMARY: On August 8, 1994, Western Area Power Administration (Western) published a notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 40357&hyph;40359) announcing its intent to initiate a public consultation process to identify methods of replacing lost Glen Canyon Dam power and to report the findings to Congress, as required by the Grand Canyon Protection Act (GCP Act) of 1992. (Title XVIII of Pub. L. 102&hyph;575). Section 1809 of the GCP Act requires the Secretary of Energy to consult with representatives of the Colorado River Storage Project power customers, environmental organizations, seven Colorado River Basin States, and the Secretary of the Interior to identify methods to replace the lost power from Glen Canyon Dam. The Secretary of Energy, acting through Western, has the responsibility of marketing power generated from Glen Canyon Dam, including power acquired by Western to replace the power lost at Glen Canyon Dam. Western now announces that four consultation meetings have been scheduled to provide full opportunity for public participation. Western has developed an information packet outlining the replacement resources process and the required report as a starting point for discussions with customers, other stakeholders, and the public. Western is seeking feedback on: (1) The proposed outline of the process, (2) the proposed content of the report, and (3) the potential methods to acquire the most cost-effective alternative firm power replacement resources needed to meet Western's firm contract obligations. The information packet will be distributed to identified stakeholders and other publics on Western's mailing list. To receive this packet or have your name or organization added to the mailing list, call or write Jeffrey McCoy at the address below. DATES: Public information meetings will be held as follows. All meetings are scheduled from 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. local time. November 7, 1994 Salt Lake City, Utah, Doubletree Hotel, 215 West South Temple. November 8, 1994 Albuquerque, New Mexico, Best Western_Fred Harvey Hotel, 2910 Yale Boulevard SW. November 14, 1994 Phoenix, Arizona, Western Area Power Administration, Phoenix Area Office, 615 South 43rd Avenue. November 18, 1994 Denver, Colorado, Stapleton Plaza Hotel, 3333 Quebec Street. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The GCP Act was enacted to protect environmental resources in Grand Canyon National Park and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area below Glen Canyon Dam. Operation of Glen Canyon Dam has been modified on an interim basis pending completion of the Glen Canyon Dam environmental impact statement to assure the protection of these resources. Identifying feasible replacement power resources will require assessment by Western of the magnitude and timing of the power lost at Glen Canyon Dam and the cost for replacing it. Western's customers will then decide if they desire Western to replace any or all of the lost Glen Canyon Dam resource. Such acquisitions might be made by Western on behalf of firm power customers on a pass-through cost basis. Western will use an integrated resource planning approach to acquire long-term replacement resources at the lowest possible cost. Western will consider a variety of resource options, both supply-side and demand-side, as well as renewable resources. A Replacement Resource Methods Report to Congress detailing Western's findings is to be completed no later than 2 years after implementation of long-term operational criteria at Glen Canyon Dam. Notices of dates and locations of future consultation opportunities will be published in the Federal Register and provided to interested stakeholders. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jeffrey J. McCoy, Resources and Marketing Studies, Western Area Power Administration, P.O. Box 11606, Salt Lake City, UT 84147&hyph;0606, (801) 524&hyph;5399 or (801) 524&hyph;5493. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE: Western will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 through an appropriate level of environmental analysis on the impacts of implementing selected replacement resource methods. Western is just beginning the process of identifying methods to replace lost Glen Canyon Dam hydropower. Environmental impacts will be a factor in that process. DETERMINATION UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 12866: DOE has determined this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866; accordingly, no clearance of this notice by the Office of Management and Budget is required. Issued at Golden, Colorado, September 29, 1994. William H. Clagett, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24926 Filed 10&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
