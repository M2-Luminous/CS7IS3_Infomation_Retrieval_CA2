Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] General Constand Viljoen said the alliance will resume negotiations once the ANC [African National Congress]-SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance recognizes the sovereignty of Bophuthatswana. Johan Classen reports: [Begin recording] [Classen] General Viljoen held discussions with President Mangope in Mbabatho earlier today, before the decision was taken by the Freedom Alliance. He said the situation in Bophuthatswana was totally unacceptable. He called the violence total terrorism. [Viljoen] Well, to start off, we don't rejoin the process. And I think if that is the case, we must seriously in this country start talking and considering partition of the country, because if there is no way of finding a solution by negotiations, to jointly stay and share this country, then we must really start thinking about partition of the country. [Classen] Gen. Viljoen predicted that the same situation might develop in KwaZulu, and at a later stage in the Republic. He also explained why military intervention, be it by the South African Defense Force or the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement], was the wrong option. [end recording]
