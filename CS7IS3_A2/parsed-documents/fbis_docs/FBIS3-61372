Kravchuk, president of Ukraine I.S. Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy, acting prime minister of Ukraine H.S. Surgay, chairman of the State Committee for Coal Industry of Ukraine On 28 December 1993 in Lugansk Oblast's city of Antratsit the general directors of coal production associations of Ukraine discussed measures to stabilize work in the sector. Basic demands, in respect to which a decision at the state level is essential, were adopted for the elimination of the catastrophic situation at the coal enterprises. 1. The price of coal and coal products established for January 1994 must be fixed in dollar equivalent at the exchange rate of the dollar as of the end of December 1993 and indexed monthly proportionate to the change in the price of the dollar in relation to the karbovanets (that is, the price for February 1994 must be established proportionate to the price of the dollar at the end of January and so forth). 2. The transfer in the first quarter of 1994 to the books of the local authorities of facilities of the social sphere and, prior to this transfer, their directed financing from centralized sources. 3. To liquidate as 1 January 1994 the structure of the Uglesbyt [expansion unidentified] of Ukraine and transfer to the coal-production associations the right to independently exercise the functions of supplies and sale of coal and products of its conversion in accordance with direct agreements with consumers and government contracts. 4. To convert coal at enrichment factories in accordance with agreements, with the reimbursement of the expenditure on the enrichment and the right to sell the end product by its producer. At the demand of the coal-production associations to transfer the enrichment factories to the associations. 5. To extend loans to the coal industry enterprises in stable fashion against standard stocks of commodity and material values. 6. On account of the tardy revision of the price of coal and coal products and pricing mistakes on the part of the Government of Ukraine, nonrepayable arrears of enterprises of the coal sector had formed by the end of 1993. These arrears have practically halted the production and financial activity of the enterprises. We demand that enterprises of the coal sector be relieved of the current debts. 7. For the restoration of economic and business relations with enterprises of Russia and other neighboring and distant states: a) to liberalize customs legislation; b) to introduce identical customs rules with states of the "near abroad"; c) to authorize the state-owned enterprises on their leaders' responsibility to ship and receive products, with customs documents being drawn up at the customs house within a month from the day of shipment (receipt) of products; d) to exempt imported production engineering equipment and materials for the coal enterprises of customs duty and taxes. 8. To provide for the allocation of monetary resources from centralized sources to pay compensation for length of service to all working people of a coal-production association before 10 January 1994. 9. To extend coal-export licenses to the first quarter of 1994. 10. To index the coal enterprises' working capital or allocate long-term soft loans for its replenishment. 11. To abolish the "government order" concept as lacking a legal foundation and to distribute coal resources according to direct agreements and government contracts concluded on mutually advantageous terms. 12. To communicate the response to this demand before 10 January 1994 in our presence in the city of Kiev. General directors: [Signed] V.G. Ilyushenko of Donetsugol, V.I. Kuzyara of Makeyevugol, A.N.
