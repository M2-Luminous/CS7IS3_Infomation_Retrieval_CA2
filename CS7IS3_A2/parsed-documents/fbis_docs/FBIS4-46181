Four terrorists, one of them a foreigner, surrendered to the security forces in a bid to benefit from the repentance law. Sixteen members of the terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization, who were trained in Greece in explosives and sabotage actions and who were planning to undertake actions in tourist centers in the Aegean region, were captured in Izmir along with their weapons. The terrorists arrived in Turkey from Greece aboard boats. The three boats they used, one of them a speedboat, were confiscated. The separatist organization's foreign courier and its regional leader are among those caught as a result of a series of operations conducted by the Izmir Security Directorate antiterror units. In their interrogation, the terrorists confessed that they were trained in explosives and sabotage at a PKK camp in Greece. It was said that they were caught at a time when they were awaiting orders to begin actions in order to undermine Turkish tourism. Noting that they provided personnel for the terrorist organization's cadres in the mountains, the terrorists explained that they conducted work in Izmir's Yamanlar Mountain for a camp to be used temporarily for entering and leaving the country. Searches conducted of the terrorists' houses and of their persons yielded one Kalashnikov automatic rifle, two pistols, magazines and ammunition for these weapons, two sticks of dynamite, and large quantities of documents and action plans. The 16 terrorists were referred to the Izmir State Security Court.
