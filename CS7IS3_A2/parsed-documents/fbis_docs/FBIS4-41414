President Yeltsin Presses `Red Button' for First Time"] [Text] The latest annual command staff exercise on control of the Russian Federation Strategic Nuclear Forces, held 21-22 June at the Russian Army General Staff with the participation of the main staffs of the Navy, the Air Force, and the Strategic Missile Forces (the sea, air, and ground components of the strategic nuclear triad), differed markedly from the previous ones. Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov told SEGODNYA's correspondent that for the first time the country's top civilian official -- the supreme commander (the president) -- personally directed the national Strategic Nuclear Forces. This is without precedent in the entire existence of Soviet nuclear weapons. On the morning of 22 June -- a notable day in Russia's history -- during the final stage of the exercise, Boris Yeltsin arrived at the General Staff accompanied by his national security adviser Yuriy Baturin and, according to General Kolesnikov, "personally exercised control" from the General Staff Central Command Post. According to the military, "the president showed a deep understanding on matters of the control of strategic forces and issued guidance on improving the Strategic Nuclear Forces taking into account the bilateral agreements with the United States and Great Britain on missile retargeting." Then the president returned to the Kremlin, canceling a scheduled meeting with the press, so his personal impressions about how the famous nuclear button operates remain unknown to the broad public. Meanwhile, the country's top military leadership went to "a command post at one branch of the armed forces to rehearse one element," and with that the training session was successfully concluded. According to the chief of General Staff, the exercise showed that the Russian Federation nuclear triad and early warning system are "ready to address the tasks assigned in accordance with existing regulations."
