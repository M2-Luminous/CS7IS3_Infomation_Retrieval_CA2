The Czech Republic pays much attention to this kind of operation and the NATO initiative [words indistinct] and this, according to the Czech politicians, is the most direct and concrete way to NATO. Antonin Baudys also told Algirdas Brazauskas that Lithuania's wish to join NATO had influenced the position of the Czech Government on this issue. Speaking to Ceslovas Jursenas, the Czech minister of defence said that his country expected to become a member of NATO in five years. Talking to the journalists Antonin Baudys was more careful and did not mention any specific date. He only said that this would depend on when NATO will see that the Czech Republic was a reliable partner, which he said would not take too long. Besides, according to Antonin Baudys, not only countries of the Visegrad triangle should be simultaneously accepted into NATO, but also the Baltic countries and Bulgaria, Slovenia, and Romania. The Czech minister of defense also said that the Visegrad triangle was not a closed structure, but should embrace all of Central and Eastern Europe. At the moment, the Czech Republic, without declaring publicly its intentions to proceed toward NATO, is making concrete steps in this direction. This year joint military exercises are to be held with (?the Netherlands) and France within the framework of Partnership for Peace. The military structures are being reorganized according to the NATO model. (Andrius Vasiliauskas), representative from the Ministry of National Defense, who was accompanying the delegation, told the journalists that the Lithuanian military structures were established according to the NATO model from the start.
