The British troops fired four mortars from a Warrior tank and three flares after coming under attack at around 4:50 a.m. (0250 GMT) Sunday, said United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Major Rob Annink. The UN peacekeepers' position near Kobilja Glava, around 10 kilometres (six miles) northwest of the Bosnian capital, was targeted by Bosnian Serb machinegun fire and four grenades, Annink said. The UN troops had been "very, very vulnerable," caught in a "position lower than the position from where they were attacked," and hence had fired back, Annink said. The resulting exchange was "very heavy," he said, but added that no casualties were reported. Earlier Sunday UNPROFOR reported that a British UN officer died of a gunshot to the head late Saturday night while walking through Sarajevo in civilian clothes. He was killed after the city's 10:00 p.m. (2000 GMT) curfew came into effect as local police checked his identity while he was leaving a Sarajevo cafe, UNPROFOR officials said. They identified the officer's body at the city's Kosevo hospital. The officials said they believed the death of the officer was accidental.
