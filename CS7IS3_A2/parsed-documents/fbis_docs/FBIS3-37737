He was twice at the center of public attention. The newspaper recently published his program for the Russian Government. Next week this well-known economist is flying to the Crimea. He has been invited there by Yuriy Meshkov, the leader of the government, who was recently elected president of the Republic of the Crimea. The temperature on the peninsula is above zero. Local residents are already concerned about the approaching sowing work and in addition, of course, at the rising unemployment, the stoppage of enterprises, the rising cost of living, and the low wages. Generally speaking, then, it is like everywhere else. Will the political temperature change after the Russian Government team's arrival in the Crimea? "It is hard to say," candidly admitted the 47-year old Saburov, who has spent almost all his life since graduation from the Moscow State University-Mechanical-Mathematical Department devoting himself to sectoral economics. "I am going there as an economist but there is work for a politician down there, too." "Will Saburov take all his ministers with him from Moscow?" "No, no way," he himself answered as he opened the door. "It will be necessary to form a balanced cabinet on the spot and we will have to include local representatives. Anyway, in principle I have not actually been appointed. At the moment, Yuriy Meshkov has only invited me to fill this post and I have agreed. Now it is necessary to study the law most carefully -- and see how it is to be done..." [Pavlova] Within Leonid Kravchuk's entourage the opinion has already been expressed that according to the law there cannot be a premier in the Crimea, is that not so? [Saburov] I think that this is the initial reaction, that is all. There has been some misunderstanding here -- we will investigate it together. In Saburov's opinion, he is aware of how complex the status of the Crimea is and how difficult relations there could be in the future. But he is convinced that pro-Ukrainian people will not present serious opposition to his "duet" with Yuriy Meshkov. Even die-hard nationalists are still looking out for the well-being of their nation. If the government team sets itself the task of raising the living standard of the Crimean people and if the specialists who have been invited in do not merely state this but actually get down to tackling the urgent questions here, things could improve. What are the priorities in the Crimea? My interlocutor, a candidate of economic sciences, believes that one of the paramount and main problems is the establishment of market relations there. [Pavlova] In your opinion, are the reforms in the republic going extremely sluggishly? [Saburov] They have almost ground to a halt. This is where that half-forgotten word, acceleration, is needed -- not in the formal sense of the word, of course. My task is to ensure that all citizens have the opportunity to work, to ensure that those employed in the state's service get their pay on time, that everyone has water and electricity, and that public transport works properly. This is the policy, but it is a national economic policy. Sorting it out will not be all that easy. [Pavlova] Do you consider the problem of the [Black Sea] fleet an economic policy? After all, one way or another it will have to be dealt with? [Saburov] Without fail. My task is to ensure that the Black Sea Fleet gets prompt finance and, to put it crudely, that the officers and seamen do not starve. And to ensure that, come what may, the fleet does not become a seething cauldron of passions. [Saburov ends] It was difficult not to ask Saburov about the fleet. And the conversation on that theme was, to put it bluntly, not a brief one. But his main idea was this: To take all measures necessary to ease the social tension in the fleet. Furthermore, he said the same thing about the residents of settlements and cities. The measures needed there are somewhat different -- a reliance on small- and medium-scale business, which will give the Crimean people both knowledge of the market and income and correspondingly will generate income for the Crimean exchequer which, in Saburov's opinion, is almost empty. Will all this not be empty assurances and mere words? Definitely not, he believes, recently our people have been working more and more on the budget or on programs or else they have been selling off every last thing that they have... But for an economist (in power) to openly declare that his main task is the well-being of the people and not simply to declare it but to make every effort to achieve it -- such a thing, in Saburov's opinion, has not happened in a long time. The serious economic work which will begin after a detailed study of the situation on the spot will be highly specific, Saburov believes. Here in the capital he is already making promises but immediately seems to restrain himself. "Judge by my actions. The Crimea will be open to all -- that is the first and the main thing, you will see that for yourself..." [Pavlova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, does the annexation [prisoyedineniye] of the Crimea to Russia feature in your plans? [Saburov] This is unreal. After all, you know that it has a special status. Furthermore, I do not intend getting into a conflict with the motherland or aggravating the Ukrainian question. Breaking off ties is a bad thing to do, they must only be strengthened!" My last question to Saburov was this: What will one of his first economic steps be? The answer was quite unexpected but, I think you will agree, interesting -- to create the conditions for the activity of banks in the Crimea.
