However, according to the Czech Statistical Office's figures, the balance of trade--that means the difference between exports and imports--is worsening. This means that the export and import curves are more and more divergent. In your view, what has caused this occurrence? [Klaus] This is merely a partial occurrence. Last year, we had an absolutely enormous and unexpected increase in exports, which far outstripped the increase in comparable countries and the increase in exports in Europe, where stagnation continued. Compared with the large increase in 1993, the figures for 1994 are positive, it is true, but, in view of their immense starting point, they are far lower than last year. Moreover, the balance of payments and other elements of our financial, commercial, and other exchanges abroad--and not only as far as goods are concerned--are a more important indicator than the balance of trade. You know very well that tourism plays a major role. There are countries in which it is so strong--Austria, for example--that their imports are always greater than their exports. This difference is covered in the long term by income from tourism. So, in my opinion, it is wrong to infer any more far-reaching conclusions. [Krejci] In this context, views are being expressed that the government's approach toward supporting exports should be changed. [Klaus] We have discussed this in the government many times, and it is not the majority view. This involves a quest by the exporters, who are lobbying and going around all of our institutions to obtain certain further advantages for exports. I do not know of any export company, however, for which the state could in some fundamental way conjure up a place in the sun so that, on this basis, it can gain a foothold on world markets. It is primarily the company itself that must do this, and the role of the state in all of these matters really is just a peripheral and supplementary one. This is the fantasy of enterprises that in the past were used to something else. [Krejci] The government has discussed an amendment to the banking law. You have said, in this context, that the matter of insuring bank deposits is a secondary issue that should be resolved only in the future. Why? [Klaus] I did not say "a secondary issue." The draft amendment had two elements. The first concerns the extent to which the central bank may intervene directly in the independent, private commercial banks. The second concerns whether and how to start insuring deposits. In this connection, I said that we consider the issue of the banks' possible supervision and regulation to come first and that of insurance to come only second. We really see no reason to stitch together a law with a hot needle because we had a problem with a few small banks. Insuring deposits is a problematic issue, because, in principle, it is up to the individual to decide where to deposit his money. This forms part of the decisionmaking of each of us, and the simple and guaranteed insurance of deposits would mean wiping out an individual's responsibility for where he has deposited his money. Second, this would mean a massive reduction in the responsibility of bankers as such. For them, not only the fact that they lose some of their capital is a punishment. The fact that they cause difficulties for thousands of depositors is also a punishment. Such bankers are consequently written off for good, and they have not the slightest chance of ever again being able to operate in this branch. It is necessary to put extra pressure on bankers. That is, they behave far more circumspectly if they do not have the certitude of the generous insurance of deposits and have to strive at all costs themselves to bolster the finances entrusted to them. On the other hand, there is an undertaking to protect the citizen-saver. And, somewhere on the borderline between these two interests, it is necessary to find a perfectly balanced form of insuring deposits. [Krejci] As far as supervising the Czech National Bank is concerned, the point was that the ownership rights of private people could have been infringed. What kind of guidelines should there be here? Where should supervision extend, and where should it not extend? [Klaus] We do not want to infringe the rights of private entities. Therefore, we are a little reluctant about giving any extraordinary powers to the central bank. However, making money is something completely different from making watches or ties. When the tie manufacturer fails, nothing happens. When the money-maker fails, this has serious consequences for the whole of society. In this case, it is very difficult to find the right borderline. The fact that we have not approved the amendment to the banking law does not mean that we do not want to get tough and deal with this issue. [Krejci] The Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party [KDU-CSL] has called upon the other governing parties to discuss the situation within the coalition, with the proviso that this would involve a kind of assessment after two years of coalition government. How do you or the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] view this proposal? [Klaus] If I want to conduct an assessment, I have to begin with myself. The KDU-CSL would do well to think about how much it contributes to the coalition squabbles or how much someone else contributes to it, inasmuch as whatever unsettles the public and the coalition are the issues that this party drags out. I would begin here, and I would not ask for a sweeping assessment. The ODS decided at its political board meeting that of course it accepts this activity by its coalition partner and that it will attend such meetings. Nevertheless, it itself will not prepare any written material on this subject in advance. We do not feel the need for such an assessment, and, moreover, we feel that improving relations within the coalition does not depend on whether we put something down on paper. That is to say, I do not know how such a paper can erect a dam against the various utterings of the gentlemen deputies from the Civic Democratic Alliance, the KDU-CSL, or the Christian Democratic Party.
