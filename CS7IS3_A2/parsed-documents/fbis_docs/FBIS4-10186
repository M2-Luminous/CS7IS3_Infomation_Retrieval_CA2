He added that an inter-ministerial team will be established to negotiate a bilateral treaty or Chile's inclusion in NAFTA. Here is a report by Carmen Castro: [Begin Castro recording] Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said the Chilean Government seeks to consolidate its ties with the United States at all levels. Figueroa said the Chilean Government's overall foreign policy guidelines grant particular importance to the strengthening of its ties with neighboring countries, the United States, and Asia. Within this framework and on the basis of the new international order, Carlos Figueroa stated that Chilean policy toward Latin America should be fully compatible with a greater insertion in North American markets. According to Carlos Figueroa, the Chilean Government grants great importance to negotiating a free trade agreement with the United States at either the bilateral level or within the framework of NAFTA, an alternative which is being deeply studied at the Foreign Ministry. He said there is an imperative need to establish a solid interministerial negotiating team that will act in a coordinated and coherent manner to this effect. Carlos Figueroa also stated Chile faces the challenge of consolidating its bilateral ties with the Untied States at all levels. Figueroa said the strengthening of Chilean-U.S. ties is not restricted to negotiating a free trade agreement but includes other important issues like the defense of democracy, the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the struggle against trafficking, the insertion of Chile among the Pacific rim countries, and other multilateral issues. Figueroa stated that, beside constituting relevant issues by themselves, the latter may have a considerable influence on Chile's ability to negotiate the free trade agreement. Figueroa said Europe continues to be a relevant area for Chilean foreign policy but he placed a special emphasis on Asia. Figueroa said an opening within the Asian-Pacific region constitutes one of the main focal point of Chilean foreign policy. He added that the Pacific Basin is undoubtedly one of the most important international scenarios of the future. This region encompasses over 40 interrelated countries, with a population surpassing 2.5 billion and an economic power concentrating over half of the World's production. Figueroa stated that the Asian-Pacific region has experienced the greatest economic growth and has achieved the greatest economic dynamism over the past few decades. The economies of Pacific-rim countries, he stressed, have played a key role in inserting Chile in the new international scenario. [end recording]
