All freshmen have to pay for their education. Fees for education in this university differ according to what subject one majors in. Nine popular subjects including architectural engineering and international finance have their annual school fees set at RMB [renminbi] 2200 per student while other subjects including agriculture, teacher training and navigation are still free of charge and, instead, stipends for the students majoring in these subjects are available. In addition, a system of scholarship and loans for study has been established in order to encourage students to devote themselves to study and ensure poor students can finish their course. Scholarships are sponsored by overseas Chinese and some entrepreneurs. The university will grant monthly living allowances of 60 yuan to all students, who also enjoy free medical care. Good students who have financial difficulties will be entitled to reductions or exemption of school fees. They can also apply for a loan specially set for them. The interest-free loan will be divided into three kinds with a respective annual amount of RMB 1000, RMB 800 and RMB 600.
