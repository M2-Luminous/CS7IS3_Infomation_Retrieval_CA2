A press conference was held yesterday at the American business center in Novosibirsk, regarding the April visit by Harbor Group President Sam Fox to Moscow, Novosibirsk, Saratov and Kazan. The Harbor Group unites 50 enterprises in the United States and Europe which produce goods made of metal, rubber, and plastic, as well as compressors, medical equipment, medicines and precision production parts. It is a supplier of components for IBM, Apple, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. It provides over 50 percent of the medical equipment to all the hospitals in the United States. Its annual turnover is $1.5 billion. As the director of the American business center in Novosibirsk, Robert Ekkart, reported at the press conference, at the present time the Harbor Group has undertaken the development of 10 production programs which will be proposed for consideration to Russian plants in May of this year. Another visit by Harbor Group representatives to Novosibirsk is planned for that time. In the course of this visit, specific programs and conditions of cooperation will be discussed, and technologies and production blueprints will be handed over so that the enterprises may evaluate their own capacities. The conversion enterprises of Moscow, Saratov, Kazan and Novosibirsk have evoked the greatest interest of the Harbor Group. The signing of a number of agreements with the Saratov Aviation Plant, the Novosibirsk production association "Sever," the Berd Electromechanical Plant and the "Sibtekhstilmash" plant is expected in the near future. The Harbor Group intends to place orders with these enterprises for the production of parts and components for computers in batches of from 10,000 to 1 million units. The value of these will comprise from $0.2 to $600, and the overall volume of the orders may comprise $20 million. Mr. Ekkart noted that, considering the high technological level of the Novosibirsk conversion enterprises and the presence of high class specialists, the Harbor Group considers the prices on the production of these enterprises to be satisfactory. In his words, in Moscow the representatives of the Harbor Group "silently walked out of the plant which they were considering, because of the absurdly inflated prices on its products." The initial basis for serious interest by the Harbor Group in the enterprises of Novosibirsk was the cooperation with the Institute of Hydrodynamics of the Russian Academy of Sciences Siberian Department in the sphere of developing pumping equipment. Aside from expressing interest in participating in production projects with Novosibirsk enterprises, the firm is also exhibiting great interest in scientific-research cooperation. Nevertheless, we should hardly expect any large investments by the Harbor Group in Russia in the very near future. This fact was confirmed by Mr. Fox in his comment to the effect that at the present time the Russian conversion enterprises are experiencing the need not for investments, but for loading their production capacities and creating conditions for work.
