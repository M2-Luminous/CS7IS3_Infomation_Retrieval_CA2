According to the cabinet of President Milosevic, the latest developments in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed, as well as the positive developments in the negotiations between Knin and Zagreb. President Milosevic stressed that the bombardment of Serb positions around Gorazde had shattered the delusion about the international community's unbiased attitude to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army's offensive has been going on for weeks before the eyes of the entire world public whereas the United Nations has done nothing to stop this offensive except for placid warnings. On the contrary, Gorazde as a protected zone has been used as a bridgehead for an offensive against the Serb positions. By intervening with its air force, the United Nations has undoubtedly taken part in the civil war on the side of the Muslims, something that should undoubtedly be condemned as it seriously dents the reputation of the United Nations in its capacity as a mediator in the peace process. In President Milosevic's view, in order to overcome the crisis that has emerged it is necessary to settle for peace without prejudicing a political solution instead of escalating military operations and then -- in a situation marked by the absence of armed conflicts -- finish political negotiations. As far as the negotiations between Knin and Zagreb are concerned -- during the course of which the Russian side played an undoubtedly constructive role -- President Milosevic expressed support for further negotiations while expressing satisfaction with the successful implementation of the agreement on the cessation of all hostilities between the army of the republic of Serb Krajina and the Croatian Army. President Milosevic also stressed that his personal contacts with President Martic of Krajina had convinced him of the Krajina leadership's constructive attitude and their sincere desire to overcome the crisis through negotiations. However, the next phase of negotiations that should follow the normalization of economic relations raises in itself the problem of sanctions, which at the moment poses the largest obstacle to the success of the negotiations. It is beyond doubt that all factors interested in peace and in ending the crisis want the economic and traffic links between Knin and Zagreb to be reestablished through negotiations, but that cannot be achieved as long as the international sanctions -- which make such links impossible -- are being applied against one (Serb) side. This is why the international community and the world public will have to face the choice: Either they support the normalization of relations and peace, or -- by keeping the sanctions -- they insist on disrupted relations and confrontations. In that event, the sanctions would be the greatest obstacle to the peace process and the normalization of relations, President Milosevic stressed, expressing his expectance that the forces of peace and cooperation will overpower the protagonists of the war option and of prolonging the crisis. Today's talks between President Milosevic and Vitaliy Churkin were also attended by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic and the Russian Ambassador to Belgrade Gennadiy Shikin.
