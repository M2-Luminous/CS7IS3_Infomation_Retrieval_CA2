Hamid Gul: "Kashmir Is the Main Reason for the Pakistan Army"] [Text] When the independence movement started in Kashmir in 1990, India was not aware of its intensity, breadth, and depth. It did not have any idea about how it was going to spread and how strong it was going to become. Therefore, as the intensity of this movement began to surface, the daze felt by the Indian government and its various agencies began to show. We wanted to let India know that we are not only able to defend ourselves but also are able to take the war inside the enemy's territory. Thus, India has begun to understand that Pakistan wanted to resolve the Kashmir issue by the strength of its arms. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto visited Muzaffarabad during those days and expressed her support for Kashmir's freedom struggle. She even said that her blood was going to join with the blood of Kashmiri people. The Indian policy-makers concluded that the government of Pakistan was ready to make a firm effort. Robert Gates, director of the CIA, visited India and Pakistan during this time. He said that clouds of war were hovering here and there was the danger of a nuclear war. There was not really a clear danger of a war at that time, however, the United States was afraid that if a war was started and nuclear weapons were used, its vision of new world order would get a jolt. If we look at the background of these incidents, we have to agree that 1990 was a very good year for the Kashmir movement. We not only showed our strong allegiance to this struggle for freedom, but also succeeded in making the Indian government aware of how much sacrifice we were willing to make for this goal. The freedom fighters were working for the independence movement with full ardor, although a large number of them were getting killed. Still, the speed of the independence movement was fairly good. The most important accomplishment of the movement for independence was the destruction of India's communication system. Its information and intelligence system was totally destroyed, and the government system was forced to cooperate with the freedom fighters. Foreign Pressure and the Nuclear Program The year 1991 did not prove to be better for the independence movement because a cap was put on our nuclear program. India was worried by our nuclear program and its fear was reduced. It is obvious that when India learned that Pakistan has stopped work on its nuclear program, it started a new strategy. It is proper here to briefly define three terms used in the context of the Pakistani nuclear program: A. Freezing--It means keeping the technology related to nuclear weapon where it is now and not making any progress. B. Capping --It means stopping enrichment of uranium. C. Roll Back--It means destroying materials already prepared and ending the capability to make weapons. Unfortunately, many political circles and persons admitted to putting a cap on the program. I oppose this as none of these political parties had received a mandate from the people. None of the parties had this included in their manifestos. Instead, all of them had promised protection of the nuclear program in their manifestos. However, they did not follow this after they got power and have admitted putting a cap on the program themselves. Why did they do that? Who gave them this right? If they supported democracy then why did they turn away from the mandate the people had given them? The people did not give them the permission. All of them admitted that they did it under foreign pressure. Actually, the international powers had understood that they could control the impending war. They put on pressure which was accepted. India began to get signals in 1991 that we were not ready to go to war over the Kashmir issue. It was communicated by various means that Pakistan did not want to take the risk of a war over Kashmir. Governments make decision over national issues after a lot of thought as to what they should do and what they should not. It was not correct to give India the indication that we could not go to war. As the result of it, India moved its troops from other fronts and sent them to Kashmir. India could not have done this from a military perspective. It should not have taken a position which is termed as a military imbalance. It did that only after it got hints from Pakistan and then caused this military imbalance. India was obviously aware of our weakness ,that is why it moved 550,000 troops to Kashmir. In my opinion this happened because of our weak policy. These 550,000 troops were brought into the valley against 3.5 million people in Kashmir. One other result of our weak policy was that the young men who had come to Pakistan in 1990 after listening to Madam Benazir Bhutto's speech faced additional problems. The government of Pakistan did not provide them full support, and this gave them the wrong impression. As the result of this the movement did not spread outside the valley or at least did not spread as much as it should have. In Jammu, except for in Mayurdoda, the movement did not make much progress. The pressure that should have been put on India was not there. The people of Poonch and other hill regions known for their military character did not join the movement. Our flaw was that we could not give a full message to Kashmiri people as to what we could do for them and how much we could help them. On the other hand, India gave them the message in an atrocious manner that no one could protect them from the bayonets of its soldiers and that their cries could not impress anyone. What affect was there on India of our making noise against its atrocities? Four years have passed, India has given permission neither to human rights organizations nor to Amnesty International to visit Kashmir. It did not allow any press reporter, either. Had Pakistan done that, it would have been in a major crisis. Still, Pakistan did not do anything and it was threatened with being called a terrorist state. False Threats About Labeling Pakistan a Terrorist Nation As for the affair about the threat of being labeled a terrorist nation, I have said repeatedly these were fake threats. They could never declare us a terrorist nation. First, they had to declare the Kashmiri people's freedom fight a terrorist action. They cannot do that because the Kashmiri freedom struggle is a valid movement from political, moral, and legal perspectives. All the laws in the world, and the UN rules and regulations declare it a valid freedom struggle. On the other hand, it is the Indian government that was involved in terrorism. Its armed forces can be called terrorists for their actions. The people of Kashmir and the freedom fighters there are organizing their movement according to old and new laws in the world. They are struggling in their own region in a very civil manner. They did not blast any bomb in Indian territory. Contrary to it, India is terrorizing them in their own land. The people and the freedom fighters are peaceful. Their peacefulness is evident by the fact that they do not kidnap the women and children of their enemies. They do not burn them alive or amputate their hands and feet. In addition, the whole nation--the whole population--is with them. Did it ever happen that the whole population joined the terrorists? The false threat of terrorism ended. It had to end one day. I do not know why were we afraid of it? However, we wasted a lot of time because of the fear of being labeled a terrorist nation. We did not do what we should have because of baseless fears. Many important things could not be done. That caused many problems and complexities. One of the biggest problem is that India, instead of accepting any demand, is once again trying to give the impression to the Kashmiri people that neither they nor Pakistan will find safety by internationalizing the issue. They have to accept Indian rule in the end. Now, India wants them to accept its two conditions. First, to accept the Line of Control as the border. Second, you will get whatever you ask for if you remain within the Indian Union. However, the Kashmiris know that India did not fulfill its promises to them in the past. It forgot the UN resolutions as well as the promises that it made to the Kashmiris under Article 370. It had promised them their own prime minister, their own president, and their own flag. It tore these promises to shreds. India deceived Sheikh Abdullah with promises of friendship and then put him in a jail where he wasted many years. It is obvious that Kashmiris cannot trust India over anything, and Indian strategy cannot be successful now. It is clear that under international pressure India will have to accept the fact that the Kashmiris will not stay with it any longer. Even the secular forces in the West are worried that the Kashmir region might become the center of an international Islamic struggle, and this dispute over land might change into a question of religion. They are especially worried about the Afghan Muslims coming this way after taking care of their own problems, and the spread of a desire among the Pakistani youth to fight for Kashmir. They are worried that the Muslims from all over the world might gather in Kashmir. I am sure that the Muslims will come here if we invoke jihad. If Bin Baz, the chief justice of Saudi Arabia, can issue fatwa [edict] against Afghanistan's Rashid Dostam, it is possible that seeing the brutalities being committed on Kashmiris, he issues a fatwa for jihad here. Then Muslims from all over the world can be asked to participate in this jihad. India will be forced to accept some of our demands. We have to see what demands it will accept. The Third Option The idea of a third option is being floated around in the West. They are saying with great zeal that India also agrees to the third option. In my opinion, this third option is premature at this time. India has first to accept that Kashmir is a disputed region. It is necessary that the Kashmiri people agree on one strategy. They must be united on the demand to be free from Indian occupation and have an ideal government. When India is willing to leave Kashmir, then we can discuss another option. In my personal opinion, the people who talk about the third option are tearing up the UN resolutions. After it, getting a new resolution introduced and passed in the United Nations that is according to the wishes of Kashmiri people will be analogous to harnessing a lion. We should neither be deceived by the tricks played by any superpower, nor should we play any tricks ourselves. Those who say that it is important to use the third option in order to get Western support are wrong. First, it is contrary to Islamic principles to use deceit instead of talking openly. Even if we grant that the United States is honest with us and will be successful in liberating Kashmir, it still cannot be successful is liberating the whole of Kashmir or pressure India to do so. The United States can neither do this nor it will want to regardless of its personal or strategic interests. The reason is that all U.S. policies comply with Israel, and Israel considers India its favorite nation. Both these countries have mutual defense pacts which include agreement to transfer technology. Therefore, Israel considers India a very important country for its own goals. If we work on the third option, the most we can achieve is freedom of the valley. The region of Jammu that is on this side of the Chenab will not be freed. Similarly, the people in Ladakh do not agree with the third option. It is not easy for India to give independence to Kashmir under the third option because it will have to give the option of independence to hundreds of states that were included in India according to the partition formula. It took over Hyderabad and Junagarh forcibly by organized military attacks. Now, if the third option is approved then the states that were forcibly included in India cannot be stopped from leaving India. The whole formula used for the partition will be voided. India will be even more affected by it as 15 separatist movements are already going on there. ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] Meeting Should Be Called Now the question is how to rectify the old mistakes and form an appropriate policy for the future. What immediate steps should be taken to really help the present Kashmir movement? In my opinion, the meeting of the ICO should be called immediately. This is not just Pakistan's problem; this is an international issue. We have seen the role the UN played in Bosnia. The United Nations is not able to play a role for the Muslims. It is futile to have any hope from the present UN leadership. Therefore, looking up to the United Nations would be useless. This will give India more time to take atrocious actions against the independence movement. Similarly, negotiations under the Shimla Pact have also proved useless. The reason is that the Shimla Pact does not offer any basis for resolving the Kashmir issue. The pact is 22 years old and no talks were held on the Kashmir issue under it. Instead, this dispute can be resolved only if we hold a plebiscite within this framework. However, is the UN Security Council willing to take the initiative to hold a plebiscite according to its own resolutions? Not at all. Instead, Boutros-Ghali is talking about negotiations. The United Nations pays his salary to implement those resolutions. Therefore, at present the only viable course is to call the meeting of the ICO. I say that the United Nations and the Shimla Pact have failed in stopping the bloodshed in Kashmir. The emergency meeting of the ICO should be of the same nature as the one called in Islamabad after the Soviet attack on Afghanistan. The United States seems to be changing its thinking and will not have any objection to the calling of an ICO meeting. Iran had presented a resolution on Afghanistan. It would be better if another country proposes a resolution this time again. Ideological Consensus Factionalism and political unrest in Pakistan can be detrimental to the Kashmir movement. It is an encouraging development that the whole nation had united on 5 February and had told India that we are all united over the Kashmir issue and we will not allow India to shed our brothers' blood. However, the tug-of-war for power among the political parties again and again takes us away from the real issue. It is unfortunate that during the recent election, motorways and yellow cabs were made important issues, but Kashmir, on which our fate is hanging, was not made an election issue by any political party. If the present feeling persists among the people, we will keep drifting away from Kashmir. At present, it is important to assure all Kashmiris that all Pakistani people are with them with all their means. It is extremely important for the Kashmiri people to develop ideological and philosophical consensus among themselves. They should understand it well that whenever any talks are started to move away from the UN resolutions, it will lead to the danger of division of Kashmir. If India can accept anything, then it is the division of Kashmir. As for divisions, India might have to implement this idea on itself. There are 160 million Muslims in India [as published] and India must give them a separate land for them to live on. This will lead to a division like that we saw in Yugoslavia and this will not be an ideological issue. Then we can ask India: If a few hundred thousand Dogras [Pandits] cannot live with the Muslims, how can you expect 160 million Muslims to live with the Hindus in India? If Hundreds of thousands of Hindus can live with dignity in Pakistan, why not the Dogras? In my opinion, India will be obliterated one day and Kashmir will become independent. When Khalistan is established, where will these Dogras go? It will be atrocious if they are cut off both from India and Kashmir. They will have no place to go. Therefore, the Dogras should take full part in Kashmir's struggle for independence. Another question that is raised is: If Kashmir is taken out of India following the UN resolutions, what kind of relationship will it have with Pakistan? I do not think it is a major issue. It would be better if Kashmir makes some agreements with Pakistan. These agreements will be useful for Kashmir and enable it to benefit from Pakistan. It is in Pakistan's lap geographically. I do not think Kashmir should become another state in Pakistan. it will not be appropriate. It will not be safe from Pakistani administrative drawbacks, and it will not have the guarantees to protect its political, geographical, and economic identities for which it is fighting the jihad now. The way Pakistani governments have shown their weakness and the way its people have shown their apathy have not given encouragement to Kashmir's independence movement. We cannot praise their courage and forbearance enough as they have kept their struggle alive. Still, because of the change in Indian military policy, the population in cities is facing innumerable problems. The Indian military avenges the attacks on the people living in the cities. There is a limit to the patience of these people. The freedom fighters have to fight outside the cities according to guerilla war rules and make the Indian troops pay the price for being in cities. Instead of making noises about India, we should console the suffering Kashmiris. India says that it cannot free Kashmir because it will break up the nation. However, why should the blood of Kashmiris be used to protect India's unity? What kind of logic is this? We are not giving you freedom because it will break up our country! If India breaks up, let it be. India can tell us that Pakistan must be broken into many parts. Will we accept this demand? What Should Be Our Policy? Our assistance to Kashmir should be free of any weakness or flaw. We should not worry about India attacking us and or a war against us. India is in no position to start a war as it has a lot of its army tied up in Kashmir. Even if it decides to attack us, our armed forces are capable of dealing with it. We will make this war go on while India would try to decisively defeat us in a short period. This is not possible for India. We do not want a nuclear war. Instead, we have to prepare our soldiers. We are engrossed in financial profits and our nationalist thought is limited. We have to look at the issues within the framework of group and personal interests. The main reason for our army's existence is defense of Kashmir because defense of Kashmir cannot be separated from defense of Pakistan--these are like two lives in one frame of body. The defense of Kashmir is the combined responsibility of us all, including the armed forces. The independence of Kashmir is our responsibility from moral, legal, geographical, and historical perspectives. If the Pakistani armed forces are sensitive to it, then it is according to the natural demands. India considers Kashmir an integral part of it without any moral or legal ground. We have thousands of such reasons which prove that Kashmir is Pakistan's indispensable part. If the Pakistani government demonstrates helplessness or carelessness in this matter, we will have to wake up Pakistan urban centers, especially the people. If the major cities wake up over the Kashmir issue and are prepared to sacrifice their lives for their Kashmiri brothers, no government will be able to be careless. We must communicate the fact that Pakistan's existence depends on Kashmir's freedom to the people, especially those living in cities and are progressive and support status quo. This is a very welcome development that there is a large number of youth in Pakistan that are strongly opposed to the Western imperialism. It is true that the power and technology of the West is superior to us, however, we have one thing that can make us proud and that is our allegiance to our faith. We can sacrifice our lives for our religion, which the West cannot do. Our ability to sacrifice our lives is our main strength and protection. Those who are proud of being secular despite being Muslims should learn from the unfortunate situation in Bosnia. It is a must that the people of Pakistan unite over the issue of Kashmir. If we united then the Muslims in whole South Asia including those in India and Bangladesh will also support us jointly. However, first we have to be united ourselves.
