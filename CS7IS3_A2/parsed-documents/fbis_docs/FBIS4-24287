It began late this morning and its purpose was to take stock of the financial situation in the 14 countries of the franc zone six months after the devaluation of the CFA franc. This summit, proposed on the sidelines of the funeral of late President Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire in Yamoussoukro, was aimed at harmonizing the economic policies of the countries concerned to cushion the impact of the devaluation. In the same vein, while opening the summit in his country this morning, President Omar Bongo of Gabon, called on his peers to work towards a genuine integration: [Bongo] What is needed here is to take stock of what has been achieved so far and to define some orientations for our common future. We will look at the progress made in the implementation of various programs set up by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and the effective mobilization of aid promised in Dakar both by France and the other financial backers. As for our countries debts, the monetary adjustment has contributed to increase (?taxes) and the present treatment no longer appears to be adapted to enable progress in the implementation of the policy of new integration instruments within the zone of West African Monetary Union and the Bank of Central African States. Today, more than in the past, the fate of our countries lies in our own hands. We have the duty to resolutely commit ourselves to implement a genuine integration process, without any ulterior motives and without selfishness. The summit continued in the afternoon behind closed doors and 12 of the 14 heads of state attended. Persistent rumors have been circulating on a possible devaluation of the CFA franc. The rumors are denied by the Africans and their economic partners along with the IMF, the World Bank, and France. Correspondent Franck Medome talked to Niger president Mahamane Ousmane on a possible devaluation. President Ousmane said that the devaluation rate decided in Dakar was fixed at 50 percent to prevent further devaluation: [Ousmane] First of all, I would like to say that this decision will not be made now. These rumors are circulating just because people are seeing the 14 heads of state of the franc zone meeting here in Libreville with other partners. This makes people think of a new devaluation, especially when they remember the Dakar summit in January. They saw the heads of state meet in Dakar and saw the outcome and now the same heads of state are meeting in Libreville and think that this is to devaluate the CFA franc once again. No. This is not the case. People should understand that at the Dakar summit we agreed to devaluate the CFA franc by 50 percent in order to ensure a further devaluation was unneccessary. We said this was once and for all and would last for years to come. And this should be clear, there will be no other devaluation. It would be nonsense. [Medome] We can therefore be sure that President Mahamane Ousmane will not be contradicted. There will be no other devaluation of the CFA franc, at least not for the time being. [Ousmane] That is the truth. [passage omitted] Several resolutions were adopted at the end of the Libreville summit. Among them, the resolution on Rwanda: [Unidentified rapporteur] Preoccupied by the massacres of the Rwanda civilian populations and the massive destruction taking place in Rwanda for several months, satisfied with the decision made at the OAU summit and the efforts made recently by the international community to end this intolerable situation, including Resolution No. 929 of the UN Security Council on 22 June 1994, and [words indistinct] in line with the same resolution on humanitarian grounds by several members of the United Nations at the initiative of France and some African states, and while waiting for the reinforcement of troops of the UN Observer Mission in Rwanda, we call on the entire international community and especially on African states to contribute and increase the UN troops in Rwanda in order to make them more operational. We also call on the heads of state of neighboring countries to pursue their mediation efforts in order to find a lasting solution to the conflict, and stress the need for urgent action from African states to find a peaceful solution to the conflict and to ensure the protection of the population and the return of civil peace.
