Mr. President, let us please begin. Could you comment on your two-day visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina and tell us the most important things -- have your expectations been fulfilled and what happens now? [Tudjman] I believe I could say on behalf of the Croatian state delegation that our expectations have been absolutely justified and fulfilled. We held talks with the state and political leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Mr. Izetbegovic [Bosnian president], Mr. Zubak [Bosnian Croat leader], Ganic [Bosnian vice president], Silajdzic [Bosnian prime minister] and their associates. Understandably, the talks focused on the implementation of the Washington agreement on the creation of both the Croat-Muslim federation and the confederation with Croatia. We achieved full unanimity in this respect and we also specifically discussed economic and legal cooperation. I believe that, in this regard, our visit was completely worthwhile. In addition, everything else about the visit was of great interest. The very opening of the Croatian Embassy in Sarajevo was marked by the presence of many Croats from Sarajevo. It was there that we discovered out that there are 120 Croats at Sarajevo University. We were pleasantly surprised by the young Croats' choir and we also met many other Sarajevans. We and the citizens of Sarajevo attached particular importance to our stroll through the streets of Sarajevo -- something not so common in these wartime days. Apart from Sarajevo, we visited central Bosnia -- Nova Bila, Vitez, Busovaca. What happened in Nova Bila should really be seen -- the conditions in which the local doctors worked while they were attending the wounded and taking care of the Croat population. Although the delegation members and I had been informed about this and watched your television reports, to witness this in person is a very moving experience. This should be written about, told about. I am taking this opportunity to appeal to the Croatian public to pay tribute to those people by helping them build a new hospital. Instead of an operating theater, they are still performing surgery in improvised premises at the church, where wooden benches are sometimes used as hospital beds. Our encounters with Croats in central Bosnia and later in Herzegovina show that the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina have accepted the Washington agreements but that there are still some open questions. When we explained that everything that has been accomplished in resisting Serb aggression with the creation of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna, its military units and organization of authority, that all this will remain intact until the Croat-Muslim federation and the confederation become a tangible reality, people both in Herzegovina and in Bosnia approved. Wherever we went, Citluk, Capljina, especially Mostar [pauses] the visit to Mostar was of great interest to us, but it was also important for the citizens of Mostar. We went for a walk in the streets of Mostar, we visited the Franciscan monastery and the church that was demolished on 9 May, 1992. This act of vandalism should be seen -- not only the destruction of the church but also the bombing of the library. This attests to the determination and courage of the people who decided to remain until this day on the frontline in defense of their right to remain on this soil. However, we were very impressed by what we found in western Mostar, the part under Croat control: About 25,000 Croats -- the figure is approximate, about 22 to 25,000 Croats -- are living together with 9,000 Muslims and 3,000 Serbs without any problems. This means that citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina are really prepared to make an effort in the name of peace, that they will accept a political solution, and that the Croatian authorities in Mostar and in Herceg-Bosna and the Croat representation [predstavnistvo] in the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina sincerely wish to see that the drafts of the Croat-Bosniak federation and a confederation with the Republic of Croatia are realized, and that they have the support from the Croatian people in all this. [Reporter] I would ask one more question if possible. Mr. President, I would go back to the talks in Sarajevo. Certain agreements have been reached with President Alija Izetbegovic. When do you expect these talks to be implemented in concrete terms? [Tudjman] The talks have already begun. As you know, at the last session of the constituent assembly the leadership was appointed, i.e. Mr. Kresimir Zubak was appointed president of the federation, Ganic was appointed vice president, a premier designate was also nominated. At the next session of the assembly on 21 June work will continue on the forming and appointment of the government. Other steps are also being taken. Talks are starting on the canton borders. All this depends on future talks and solutions which the international community will come up with regarding efforts to solve the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis as a whole. [Reporter] If there are no other questions, may I thank you, Mr. President. [Tudjman] Thank you.
