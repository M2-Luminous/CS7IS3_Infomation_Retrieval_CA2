His native place is Lianjiang County, Fujian Province. In 1946, he entered the Taiwan University to study agroeconomy. After graduating from the first political economy graduate class of the Chinese People's University in 1952, he took up teaching work in that university. He was transferred to Shenzhen University to become a vice president of the university from 1983 to 1986. At present, he is a professor of economy of the Chinese People's University and concurrently a member of the university committee, a part-time professor of the teaching team of Zhongshan University and the China Association for Science and Technology, an executive director of the China Taiwan Studies Society, the president of the Beijing Taiwan Economic Studies Center, an executive director of the China Market Economy Studies Society, and a director of the China Comprehensive Development Academy. His studies on economic theories involve the commodity economy, the market economy, the individual economy, the special economic zone economy, Taiwan's economy, and opening to the outside world, and he has put forward distinctive ideas. He has published more than 100 academic theses. Major works published by him (including works for which he acted as the chief editor and works he wrote together with others) include: Economic Reform in China (published in 1980, and translated and published in the United States), The Issue of Socialist Economy in China, Studies on the Economy of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, Issues of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, Opening Up Economy in China, and so on. Opening Up to the Outside World Is Liberating and Developing the Productive Forces [Gao] Comrade Deng Xiaoping made some important remarks in the south from 18 January to 21 February 1992. On 23 February, you published in RENMIN RIBAO a long article, "Opening to the Outside World and Utilizing Capitalism," which attracted extensive attention at home and abroad. You were really beating the drum of the times! [Fang] That article had been written two to three years before it was published. That it was able to be published at that time was related to the publication of the important remarks in the south by Comrade Xiaoping. Opening up to the outside world began after the Third Plenary Session of the 11 CPC Central Committee. With regard to the past practice of closing the country to international intercourse, opening up to the outside world is undoubtedly a reform and an even more profound reform at that. Like other reforms, it is to liberate and develop the productive forces. [Gao] This important role of opening up to the outside world is related to its content. Therefore, there is a question of understanding and knowledge, and explanation and interpretation are needed. [Fang] The first is to introduce funds and develop the productive forces. Shortage of funds is an important factor restraining socialist modernization in our country. In the past, we thought of solving this problem by relying on ourselves alone. As a matter of fact, having no domestic or foreign debts was not an expression of superiority, but only tied us up. It was not conducive to developing the productive forces. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, we have made use of more than 100 billion yuan of foreign funds, most of which have been used for key construction projects in agriculture, communications, telecommunications, and the energy and raw materials industries, and for strengthening some weak links in the national economy. To develop foreign-invested enterprises is an important way to introduce advanced foreign technology, to use foreign scientific management methods for reference, and to develop the market abroad. The second is the introduction of advanced foreign technology. Science and technology are the first productive force. Much of the science and technology of our country is already in a leading position in the world, but on the whole, there is still a certain gap with the developed countries. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, the introduction of technology has been carried out on a large scale in our country. By the end of 1992, we had introduced more than 18,400 technical transformation projects, which increased the output value by 874.2 billion yuan, and increased profits and taxes handed over to the state by 103.5 billion yuan. The introduction of technology also has laid a foundation for new industries and has promoted the development of high- and new- technology industries so that many traditional products have caught up with those at the international level. Then comes the introduction of modern economic management methods and the use of such methods for reference. In our country, economic management is backward and is a far cry from the demands of large-scale social production and modernization. Without changing the backward situation in management and without modernizing economic management, the entire national economy will be seriously impeded. An important task in opening up to the outside world is to introduce and use for reference the management methods and ways of operation of developed foreign countries. In the past dozen years and more, we have learned from the experience of foreign countries in scientific management, effectively improved the management system of our country, and promoted the development of social production through channels, including sending personnel abroad, inviting personnel to come, and setting up foreign-invested enterprises. The Market Economy Demands Opening Wider to the Outside World [Gao] Opening up to the outside world is an important means to promote rapid economic development. Today, when we are determined to establish the socialist market structure and practice the market economy, the importance and practical significance of opening up to the outside world are even more prominent. [Fang] We still lack experience in practicing the market economy. We have to learn the practice of other countries through opening up to the outside world and in exchanges and contacts with countries all over the world, particularly with modern capitalist countries. We should explicitly put forward the necessity of learning from, making use of, and using for reference, the useful market-economy knowledge and experience of capitalist countries that have practiced the market economy for several hundred years. Capitalist countries have accumulated rich experience in their economic activities over a long period. Acute competition demands that they concern themselves with changes in the supply and demand relationship and in commodity prices in the market all the time, and that they readjust their own production and operation activities in good time; the threat of bankruptcy compels them to try a hundred and one ways to tap potential, lower production costs, and improve quality so that they may defeat their rivals in the market -- a merciless battlefield; and the pursuit of profit urges them to constantly improve management and operation, carry out careful calculation and strict budgeting, and pay attention to economic results. In a word, their immediate interests make them work hard to enable their enterprises to meet the needs of the market. Only in this way can their enterprises have vitality and attain the goal of making profits. In this respect, some of their practices are quite worthy of learning. [Gao] The market economy itself is of an open type. If we say it is still possible to close the door of our country to practice the traditional planned economy for a period of time, it seems totally impossible to close the door to practice the market economy. [Fang] I think so. We should not and cannot close the door in developing the socialist market economy and in establishing and perfecting the socialist market economy structure, but must open the door of our country, establish closer ties with the world economy, and further develop economic relations and trade with various countries of the world. The world today is an open one, and it is also a large unified international market. No country can isolate itself from the world economy and the international market. With the in-depth development of the world's new technology revolution, the international division of work is being carried out at a deeper level, the international market is constantly expanding, and the economic ties between countries are becoming closer and closer. To enable our country's market economy to keep abreast of this new historical tide of the world, we must energetically take part in the international division of work, and plunge ourselves into the competition in the international market. While formulating the strategy for developing the domestic market economy, we must take into consideration the trends of development in the world economy, understand the laws of change in the international market, and seize and make timely use of international opportunities that are conducive to us. [Gao] In the world today, the modern market economy seems to have become a world system. [Fang] A world market economy system has been formed. The economies of various countries have been brought into this system to varying degrees, and cannot be independent of this system. Likewise, China's socialist market economy has to be geared to the world and become a part of the world's market economy system. Therefore, we must respect international norms and act in accordance with them. However, it is also necessary to gradually understand and master ways of using international norms in the practice of opening up to the outside world. International norms mean customary practices accepted by the majority of countries and regions in international exchanges. Although they are not in a written form, they have a binding legal force. Viewed from the angle of developing our country's market economy and of promoting economic exchanges between our country and various countries of the world, the study and use of international norms in economy and trade have even greater significance. Re-Entry Into the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Requires the Establishment of a Market Economy Structure [Gao] China's application for the restoration of its status as a GATT signatory state, that is, what people usually call re-entry into GATT, is undoubtedly an important move to open wider to the outside world, to enable China's economy to move toward the outside world, and to join the great international market. [Fang] The purpose of applying for re-entry into GATT is to promote the development of China's foreign trade, close economic ties with various countries of the world, a better grasp of international economic information, and more rapid development of the export-oriented economy. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, the Chinese economy's moving toward the outside world has become a trend. For various reasons, however, trade conflicts often have occurred. This requires the coordination of world- acknowledged principles, and each country should undertake responsibility while enjoying rights. This is the only way conducive to further expanding China's economic relations with foreign countries and to the Chinese economy's really moving toward the outside world. [Gao] Seven years has passed since 1986, when China applied for re-entry into GATT, and talks concerning the matter are still being held. The factors affecting China's re-entry into GATT are very complicated. In addition to political factors, obstacles in the economic aspect are also worthy of examination. [Fang] One of the fundamental issues is that GATT is based on the market economy, but China has practiced a highly centralized, unified planned economy for a long time. The two are incompatible as far as the economic structure is concerned, and it is difficult for the two to be in tune. This cannot but become a serious obstacle affecting China's re-entry into GATT. This issue once more shows that if we still do not change the old traditional economic structure and establish a new market economy structure, how much we will be out of step with the times; and if some people still have doubts and worries about China's practicing the market economy, and even take a negative attitude toward this, how greatly they have gone against the tide of historical development. Following the reform of the economic structure for many years, we have greatly reduced the scope of mandatory planning and gradually have expanded the role of market regulation. To date, we have explicitly put forward the necessity of developing the socialist market economy and of establishing the socialist market economy structure. This will make it easier for China's market economy to converge with the world's market economy, to meet the requirements of GATT, and to create very favorable conditions for re-entry into GATT. Following the reform and opening over the past 10 years and more, China's economy has now developed the strength to participate in international economic activities. A relatively stable international trade environment is needed for speeding up the socialist modernization of China and for developing the socialist market economy. Do Not Copy Mechanically [Gao] It is an unavoidable task to study the experience of foreign countries and use it for reference, including experience in practicing the market economy. In recent years, you have stressed somewhat the "opening wider to the outside world and correctly making use of capitalism." What is "correctly making use of capitalism" in your view? [Fang] First of all, we must study and understand foreign experience and capitalism. Without understanding them, we cannot learn well. For example, a traditional view holds that in capitalist countries, where the market economy is practiced, it is possible to manage individual enterprises in a planned and organized manner, while the entire social production is in a state of anarchy and the state can accomplish nothing. [Gao] A conclusion opposing the market economy or a conclusion opposing macroregulation and control can be deduced from this view. Please tell me something about the actual situation in this respect. [Fang] This common failing of capitalist countries did exist in history and it remains serious in some countries today. Since World War II, however, relatively great changes have taken place. The state has strengthened intervention in the economy and has done something to deal with the problems brought about by the market economy. To restore their war-damaged economies, some capitalist countries even once put the economy under very strict control. Countries practicing the five-year or ten-year plans, which are regarded as the patent of the planned economy, are not rare. Is this not macroregulation and control of the market economy, if it is put in our way of saying things? Of course, their control of this kind is not usually carried out by means of administrative orders, but by economic and legal means. In particular, such control is guaranteed by legislation. In fact, the market economy of Western countries today is not a totally free market economy without any restraint or planning. [Gao] All this is worthy of our attention. In the course of establishing the market economy structure, the government should change and improve the means for carrying out macroregulation and control, and also should strengthen its functions in macroregulation and control. [Fang] Moreover, it should proceed from China's realities, and should not copy mechanically. This is not just because the socialist market economy is essentially different from the capitalist market economy in terms of social nature, but also because we are still in the initial stage of socialism, and although many measures adopted by economically developed capitalist countries in developing the market economy are neutral in nature and without class character, they are implemented in a specific social system and are bound to have the characteristics of their respective societies. We cannot copy mechanically, even what is effective in the capitalist system, and we should integrate such measures within China's realities. [Gao] We are practicing the market economy under socialist conditions. This is the most important reality. [Fang] Therefore, the most important thing is that we must uphold socialism and must guard against and overcome rightist or "leftist" deviations. In addition, I think that Shenzhen's experience in studying foreign experience and using it for reference should be properly studied and made use of.
