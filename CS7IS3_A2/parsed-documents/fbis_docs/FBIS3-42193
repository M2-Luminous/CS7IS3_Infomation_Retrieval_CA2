Information obtained by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI affirms that Turkey's minister of foreign affairs returned from his "historic" visit to Israel with a plan for the two countries to cooperate on security matters. This would involve the implementation of a Turkish military plan to send commando units to al-Biqa' and to Syria under the pretext of shelling the PKK's positions. However, the real objective of this plan, which received Washington's blessing, was to drag Syria into the peace process by closing in on it and intensifying the pressure on it. What are the particulars of this plan? Why did Turkey reveal the Israeli cards it has been holding at this time in particular? And what will it receive as its payback? Late last October, an emergency secret meeting was called by Tansu Ciller, the prime minister of Turkey. The meeting was held in her office, the prime minister's office in Ankara, and it was attended by Ms. Ciller; by Mehmet Golhan, the minister of defense; and by Dogan Gures, the chief of staff of Turkey's armed forces. At that meeting Ciller stressed the need to adopt a new military action plan to fight what she called Kurdish terrorism. She was referring specifically to operations by the PKK, which is led by Abdullah Ocalan, also known as Apo. Recently, these operations took a grave turn for the worse when General Aydin, the chief of police, was assassinated in Diyarbakir. Aydin's assassination aggravated Turkey's official position to such a degree that Ciller removed Nevzat Ayaz, the minister of defense, from his position. Ciller then issued very strong statements, threatening neighboring countries who were supporting "Kurdish terrorism." [She was referring] specifically to Syria and Iran. Ciller started her meeting with senior military officials with a pessimistic pronouncement expressing her disappointment with the failure of previous military plans. She called for the application of a new, more repressive strategy aimed at putting an end to "Kurdish terrorism" once and for all. Application of this strategy would start now, and it would continue through the end of 1994. Ciller angrily pointed out to those officials that their former strategy will have to be considered a failure, and she read in front of them the most recent security report prepared by Turkish intelligence. The report explained the particulars of the strict security and military measures that had recently been taken to pursue armed Kurds in southeast and east Anatolia. More than 150,000 soldiers supported by the most modern tanks, armored vehicles, explosives, and war planes had been deployed in the region. Militias made up of Kurdish area residents were utilized, and weapons as well as monthly salaries were sometimes placed at their disposal to secure their assistance in pursuing the armed Kurds. The Turkish army was using all forms of repression against the population. Sometimes, entire villages were burned, and the residents of those villages were driven out of their homes. Although all Turkish security agencies--the army, police soldiers, police officers, intelligence officers, and special forces--took part in all these battles and operations, Ciller herself asserts that they were not able to bring about a resolution of the military situation. Nor were they able to stop attacks by the PKK's forces against security personnel, tourists, trains, and economic facilities. Ciller then asked the new minister of defense to give her his analysis of the reasons why the strategy had failed and [his assessment] of the strength of the PKK fighters. He replied, "Our information indicates that the PKK has more than 10,000 fighters, and perhaps 15,000. Kurdish residents who support the PKK do so either out of conviction or as a result of coercion. The problem, however, lies in the support the PKK is receiving from outside the Turkish borders, because it is that support that is allowing the PKK to make preparations for its operations, to train its operatives, and to supply itself with weapons. This is what is happening in Iran, in Iraq, and even in Syria. It is also happening in the PKK's camps in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley." A New Strategy The Turkish prime minister shuddered and said, "They have to be stopped. This is a crucial matter for the stability of Turkey's security, economy, and international standing. A new plan to fight terrorism must be devised, and everything has to be utilized in that fight, even if we have to fight battles in Iran, Iraq, and Syria and risk the danger of war breaking out with those countries." Ciller then took out from one of the drawers in her desk a report, which had been prepared for her by military intelligence. She briefed the two men who were meeting with her about the main points of that report, and she said that it was incumbent on us to move in that direction and to prepare an integrated military plan. Ciller issued a new, strong statement after that meeting, threatening Iran and Syria with a campaign to pursue the terrorists inside their territories. After all, the terrorists had been pursued for years inside Iraqi territory, and Iraqi Kurds subordinate to Barzani and Talabani have been taking part in those operations. Most Turkish military personnel and politicians joined this stepped-up pursuit of the Kurds, and Turkey's chief of staff declared, "We will put an end to the PKK before the spring of 1994." In early November it was noticed that Syria was the focus of the campaign mounted by Turkish officials. They would sometimes accuse Syria of offering the PKK support and giving it refuge on Syrian territory, and at other times they would raise once again the issue of PKK camps in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley as well as that of increased Kurdish operations near the Syrian-Turkish borders. Last week Turkey's intensified political and media campaign against Syria became extremely brazen, and its implications became very grave when Hikmet Cetin, the minister of foreign affairs in Ankara, took advantage of his visit to Israel--it was the first such visit--and repeated the threat to Syria. But Cetin added other indications to the threat when he spoke unequivocally about "the need for cooperation between Israel and Ankara to fight against Syrian supported terrorism." Cetin accused Damascus of continuing its support for the PKK, and he revealed upon returning to his country that "a new stage in Turkey's relationship with Israel had begun." He reiterated his rejection of the prospect that some areas of the Middle East turn into free zones for terrorist activity. Cetin went further than that in his military statements when he said that Turkey "intended to respond to any terrorist action launched directly or indirectly from its neighbors' territory. Such an issue could not possibly be left without resolution." He added, "The future of relations with Syria depends first of all on the elimination of terrorism." The implications of the warning issued by Ankara were quickly grasped by those who have been watching developments and monitoring the secrets of Turkish politics and the question of the PKK. And yet, given the public and unequivocal entry of Israel into the picture, these observers wondered with considerable concern about the implications of the warning and its [possible] aftermath. They wondered, specifically, about what Turkey and Israel had in store for Syria, the country which was obviously becoming the object of attention, and they wondered also about the roles the new Turkish-Israeli alliance would play in the region. Information available to AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI affirms that Turkey's minister of foreign affairs visited Israel against the backdrop of the new strategy devised by Turkey's military and political leaders. The Turkish minister's visit to Israel was not made in the context of making a contribution to promote the peace process. The Turkish minister did not go to Israel to play a part in the multilateral negotiations and in [the talks over] the problem of water. The minister went to Israel in an attempt to put an end to the PKK and in an effort to get Israel to make a security contribution to that effort. The magnitude of that contribution could become greater in light of developments in the peace process. This information indicates that Turkey's new military plan, which was approved to fight the PKK, includes a declaration of some sort indicating that all the [country's] military capabilities would be mobilized and all of Turkey's regional and international cards would be utilized to bring about the success of the plan. Turkey's new military plan is based on increasing the number of personnel in the Turkish army from 700,000 to 1 million soldiers. Military operations against PKK fighters in Turkey would be stepped up, and those PKK fighters would be pursued on land and in the air inside Iran's, Iraq's, and Syria's borders, even if clashes with these countries' forces were to become necessary and lead to the creation of tension in relations with them. In conjunction with this plan Ankara would go back to using the waters of the Euphrates as a weapon to apply pressure to Damascus. The new plan would also continue the policy of planting mines on the borders and moving forward with the establishment of an electronic security zone along the border with Syria. This plan, whose estimated cost exceeds $10 million, is being implemented in close cooperation with Israeli military experts. This close cooperation on security matters came about after Israel's military experts persuaded Turkey to set up a security zone similar to Israel's security zone in south Lebanon and to improve upon it. However, new developments in the Turkish security plan--and AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI was able to obtain details of this plan--place emphasis on a larger role that Turkish intelligence and special commando units would be playing in going after PKK fighters in Turkey and in Iran, Syria, and Lebanon as well. To this end, Ciller quickly approved the establishment of a "special army." That is, she approved the establishment of private militias that would not be officially affiliated with the Turkish armed forces. These militias would be made up of ordinary citizens who would be trained in combat, infiltration, and explosive techniques. Included in that army also would be Kurds from all countries, who are known for their support for Turkey and their work for Turkish intelligence. That is, Kurds from Iran, Iraq, and Syria would be included in that army, which would also include units made up of Turkish Muslims, known as Turkey's Hizballah, a group which has been engaged in war against the PKK for quite some time. Turkish Commandos in al-Biqa' Valley What will be the role of those militias? Based on information that has been leaked about the Turkish plan, it seems that military and political leaders in Ankara will charge those militias with the task of carrying out sabotage operations in Iran and Syria. Those militias would conduct counter-infiltration operations across the borders, and they would penetrate the ranks of other Kurds. This information adds that emphasis in the Turkish plan is still being placed on shelling PKK camps in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley and that consideration is also being given to shelling some of the PKK's locations in Syria. 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam, the vice president of Syria, declared unequivocally that his country would not condone having "any party use Syrian territory as a base from which the security of any neighboring country would be violated." No international source nor even any anti-Syrian intelligence agency has so far confirmed the possibility that Turkey's accusations might be valid. Information available to AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI indicates that the Turkish military plan to shell the PKK's positions in al-Biqa' Valley was the subject of the security talks which were conducted in Israel by Ankara's minister of foreign affairs. That [in fact] was the main purpose of the visit. It is known that economic cooperation between the two countries underwent significant development in recent years and that the volume and nature of trade has been such that large amounts of Turkish water have been exported on oil tankers which dock periodically in the port of Haifa. The Jewish lobby, which exercises strong influence in Turkey, played a major role in reinforcing the growing closeness between these two countries on political and security issues. Turkey and Israel, located in an Arab and Islamic world, share a concern about their relationship with Europe, and they also share the role of defending Western and U.S. interests in the context of NATO, an organization in which Israel plays a supporting role. In the past years Israel started applying Ben Gurion's theory of "a small zone around the Arab world," which means relying on Turkey and the Shah's Iran to form a ring around all the borders of the Arab world. Israel decided to expand that zone around the Arab world after the collapse of the Soviet Union by extending it across the Islamic republics in Central Asia. It penetrated these countries with the cooperation and coordination of Turkey, which was motivated by domestic, regional, and international goals and aspirations. This cooperation between Israel and Turkey strengthened the cooperation between the two countries on security matters to "fight terrorism." Ankara received significant services from Israel, and those services transferred to Turkey the Israelis' expertise in [dealing with] "terrorism." The Turks even received detailed reports about the PKK camps in al-Biqa' Valley. These reports included maps and photographs as well as information about the movements of the party's leaders and the training of its elements. Cetin's recent visit to Israel served as a shot in the arm for the cooperation between the two countries. Information affirms that Israel did approve a protocol for some of the temporary bases that will be used by Turkish commando units on the Lebanese border strip. Israel agreed to offer these units all necessary assistance that would enable them to gain access to al-Biqa' Valley, hit PKK positions, and return [to their bases] by way of Israel. But the question that is being asked by observers is this: Why did Turkey decide to increase the tension between it and Syria at this time in particular? Why did it decide to bring its strategic alliances with Israel out in the open? Given the fact that a strategic alliance with Israel implies not only open hostility to Syria but also to the Arabs, why did Turkey decide to do this before the peace process ran its course? Why did it decide to do this at a time when the region appears to be starting to move toward a comprehensive peace as well as regional economic cooperation among all the parties? A Ring Around Syria It is known that the latest crisis between Turkey and Syria over the PKK is not the first such crisis between them. That crisis between the two countries, who had previously defused the tension between them, had almost led Ankara to launch a water war against Damascus. That situation was defused by means of two high level security protocols, the first of which was signed in 1987. The latter, which was signed last year, affirmed that problems between the two countries had been resolved and that the two neighbors had agreed to get rid of the bone of contention between them that had been caused by the PKK. At that time contention over the PKK had led Ankara to threaten strikes against PKK positions in al-Biqa' Valley. Observers today are wondering in bewilderment about what it was that they missed that caused Turkey to step up its campaign against Syria and to make such threats against it. Why would Turkey go so far as to declare its cooperation with Israel on security matters? These observers point out that the fatal blows that are being delivered by the PKK against Turkey are ones that for the most part are delivered by PKK operations carried out inside Turkish territory. These operations affirm that the party's constituency and its power base are in Turkey and not elsewhere. That is why observers acted promptly to find other reasons and other goals for the Turkish-Israeli campaign against Damascus. It is now certain--and this was revealed by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI in issue number 870 dated 5 November 1993--that this issue is not a simple one, but that it is rather complicated and involves many other issues and concerns. Turkey is using the PKK issue with Syria to achieve regional and international objectives that are no longer a secret to anyone. That is, Turkey is trying to contribute to the effort to set up a ring around Syria, to isolate it, and to drag it into the peace process. Informed sources are saying that when the prime minister of Turkey returned from Washington some weeks ago, she appeared to have received the kind of support that strengthened and emboldened her. She started her campaign against Syria by coordinating it with Washington and Tel Aviv. It was noticed that coordination in this campaign placed special emphasis on the terrorism issue, which is an international winner. While Israel tried to undermine Syria's international reputation by raising the issue of its support for "Hizballah terrorists" and the resistance in Lebanon, Ankara chose to dwell on the support which Damascus has been giving "Kurdish terrorism." That theme is heard with sympathy in the West because the PKK kidnaps foreign tourists and adopts a strategy of carrying out operations with explosives in European countries against Turkish interests. It is obvious that the payback Turkey is asking for, namely, to become a visible member of an Israeli-American alliance, is one that will strengthen its position for achieving what it has been aspiring to and striving for. Turkey wants to become a major power in the region, and it wants to work with the United States to spread its influence in Central Asia as the Soviet Union's successor. Turkey wants to penetrate Eastern Europe by way of the Balkans, and it wants to have the right to represent the West in the Middle East on an equal footing with Israel. Turkey wants to benefit from the possible outcome of the post-peace period. Turkey's more obvious goal, however, is that of forming a ring around Syria, preventing it from trying to foil the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, and applying pressure on it to make it join the peace process in Sidon with a weaker position and with fewer cards. That is why the Syrians regarded the threat that was made by Cetin in Israel as obvious and expected. Consequently, their reaction to it was cool and unruffled, because Turkey's action to carry out such threats and declare the zero hour for the new Turkish military plan depends, as Turkey's previous threats did, on the balance [of power] and the variables in the region. The implementation of Turkey's threats and new military plan depends also on developments in the talks and on the results of Christopher's visit to the region, which is scheduled for next month. The outcome of all that remains to be seen. Until then Turkey will keep the issue of the PKK alive, and it will continue making threats.
