FBIS3-32543 "drlat027_o_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 Colombia Escobar's Personal Files Implicate Raul Castro, Others PA0802221994 Madrid EFE in Spanish 0408 GMT 8 Feb 94 PA0802221994 Madrid EFE Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 7 Feb (EFE) -- The television newscast Q.A.P today revealed documents from the personal files of Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the slain head of the Medellin Cartel, which compromise politicians, judges, officers, and other personalities. Included among the documents is a video that shows a cartel member asking Escobar not to kill him and reminding him of his involvement in terrorist attacks, kidnappings, and alleged intercessions in Cuba before someone identified as Raul Castro. Although the video does not mention the contact's position, it is believed to be Raul Castro, brother of Cuban President Fidel Castro and commander of that country's Armed Forces. It also mentions without naming them some people close to former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, according to the television newscast. The documents, which include photographs, videos, and letters, reveal the irregularities committed at Envigado's La Catedral prison, where Escobar was held for almost a year with 14 of his most sinister lieutenants, who held loud, bawdy parties with hundreds of persons illegally entering the facility. Trials were even held against members of the Medellin Cartel. Escobar also had secret documents belonging to the DEA and various Colombian state entities. He had the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of people who testified against him and reports on bribes he paid to judges and politicians. The authorities also found among Escobar's possessions documents belonging to the Cali Cartel, but the greatest share of the papers consisted of letters from people and institutions asking him for money for different purposes, among them a letter from a community of nuns requesting his "good offices" for a social project. The father of the killer of presidential hopeful Bernardo Jaramillo went to La Catedral to ask for money to purchase a home and thus reward the "courage" of his son, who was barely 15 years old when he was killed in the ensuing reaction by bodyguards of the Patriotic Union candidate. With the discovery of Escobar's personal files, the authorities have been able to clarify many deaths, kidnappings, and attacks perpetrated on the orders of this major drug trafficker and terrorist, who was killed in a shoot out with police on 2 December in Medellin.
