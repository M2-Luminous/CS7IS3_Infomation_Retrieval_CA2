FR940516-0-00019 FR940516-0-00008 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AAL&hyph;06] Modification of Class D Airspace and Class E Airspace AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This action modifies the Class D airspace area at Bryant Army Heliport (AHP), AK, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action also modifies Class E airspace at Gulkana Airport, AK, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated flight service station's hours of operation. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with the Bryant air traffic control tower (ATCT) is required and to clarify when Class E airspace exists for instrument approach procedures at Gulkana Airport. DATES: Effective date: 0901 u.t.c. June 23, 1994. Comment date: Comments must be received on or before June 23, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Manager, System Management Branch, AAL&hyph;530, Docket No. 94&hyph;AAL&hyph;06, Federal Aviation Administration, 222 West 7th Ave. Box 14, Anchorage, AK 99513&hyph;7587. The official docket may be examined in the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel for the Alaskan Region at the same address. An informal docket may also be examined during normal business hours in the Office of the Manager, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, at the address listed above. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert C. Durand, System Management Branch, AAL&hyph;531, Federal Aviation Administration, 222 West 7th Avenue # 14, Anchorage, AK 99513&hyph;7587; telephone number: (907) 271&hyph;5898. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments on the Rule Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the ``DATES'' section. However, after the review of any comments, and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or to amend the regulation. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at Bryant AHP, AK, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action also amends Class E airspace effective hours at Gulkana, AK, to coincide with the associated flight service station's hours of operation. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at Bryant AHP and a control zone (CZ) existed at Gulkana. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation of ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation at Bryant AHP makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with the air traffic control tower Bryant AHP, AK, is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures at Gulkana, AK. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to modify this Class D and Class E airspace area in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
