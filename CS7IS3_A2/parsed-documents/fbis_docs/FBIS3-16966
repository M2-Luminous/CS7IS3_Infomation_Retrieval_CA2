Their role in our social life and economy is significant. When we say that there is no alternative to reform, this means that the importance of cooperatives will be constantly growing, whether we want this or not. I want to draw your attention to those processes that are under way in particular in rural areas, and deny allegations by those who claim that reform is not advancing. Here are concrete figures. In general, the total number of cattle has unfortunately been decreasing over recent years. Both the tempo and the trend of the decline in the state and kolkhoz sectors are steady, and the decrease is measured in millions of head. However in [private] village farms, an opposite process is under way. In 1993, the data were as follows: The total number of cattle went up by 240,000 head, which amounts to the emerging of a medium-sized oblast. The number of pigs increased by more than 200,000. Converting into symbolic figures the number of cattle and pigs raised in the private sector over the last three years, we would receive almost a million head. Incidentally, the increase rate was almost 13 percent in 1993. What does this mean? If you fail to change your infrastructure to account for these changes, an enormous incongruity may arise. Your reform and production must be in line with the changes and trends currently under way in Ukraine as a whole. And instead of reducing and curtailing the scope of your activities, you should expand it on a qualitatively new basis of cooperation and mutually advantageous contracts. One of the speakers at the congresses maintained that consumer cooperation is losing authority. I think this is not the case. The only ones to believe this are those who either prefer not to notice changes or have not been given to realize the actual state of things. Yesterday, Valentin Roshchin, our guest from the Russian Federation who is first deputy chairman of Russia's Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives, spoke here. He pointed out: "I hope that your congress facilitates the revival of cooperatives in a new form." Sincerely greeting your congress, I want every one of you to leave this hall with a deep conviction that we should revive the cooperatives in a new form, the one dreamed about by outstanding scientist Oleksandr Vasylyovych Chayanov. He depicted its essence as "cooperation of cooperators." Thus, the future belongs to you and manufacturers. Next comes the issue of relations between consumer cooperatives and the state. I support what I once said in an interview with your newspaper VISTI: "Cooperatives are a state within the state." I said this many times to people from the agro-industrial complex and consumer cooperatives. If you do not become a state within the state, we will not change production relations. If we fail to do this we will also fail to change our attitude toward work and thus, improve our living standards. This does not mean that you break away from the state and become independent. Everybody depends on the state. Saying that manufacturers, entrepreneurs, or cooperative bodies are independent is just an invention. They are all dependent because they all are parts of the state. The point is how dependent they are, whether they are directly subordinated [to the state] or they coexist on an agreement, contractual, or other bases. I mean that consumer cooperatives should build their relations with the state primarily on the basis of agreements. If a state delegates some of its functions to consumer cooperatives, this should be provided for by an agreement and this agreement should be strictly observed. If one party or another fails to observe this agreement, the third branch of power -- the court -- will have to intervene, and everything will be regulated by order of the court. I say this not out of desire to pit consumer cooperatives against the state, but because this is in line with Ukraine's actual laws and the realities of a democratic state of law. Inflation is one of the most acute problems, and one of the speakers here has said that it has eaten up your money. Tell me, whose money has it not eaten up in Ukraine? It has eaten up cooperatives' money, people's savings, state enterprise, kolkhoz, and sovkhoz assets. When inflation in a state begins to swell, it eats up everyone's money without distinction, but the poorest people are afflicted more than others. Unfortunately, it happened so that the group of people with which consumer cooperatives are dealing is the most impoverished one. If someone today is aiming to liquidate village stores or introduce such reform that would ban consumer goods from villages, this is sabotage and not reform. Those guilty of this should be punished by administrative or other measures. There was talk at the congress that there are attempts to appropriate consumer cooperatives' property and privatize it. We cannot let this happen. Cooperatives alone have the right to manage their property. Whenever some property is privatized in a normal economy, the state demands that 70 to 80 percent of the previous assortment of goods, specialization, and special features of this commercial outlet be retained. Thus, neither privatization nor any other change in the form of ownership should result in shortages of consumer goods in village stores. If today it is unprofitable to ship bread to villages -- and this is a reality -- this must not be attributed to cooperatives. You are performing state functions and should have an agreement with the state, which should either partially compensate your losses or you will divide them among yourselves, or find other mutually advantageous solutions. You all remember the times when there was no difference between state commerce and consumer cooperatives, aside from better goods being shipped to state stores. Cooperatives did not function in accordance with their charter. A legal footing has now been created for both consumer cooperatives and other forms of ownership. Leasing and sharing are becoming more widespread; destatization is under way. This process will be expanding. In developed countries, even power plants are in private hands, but the energy system is state-run and every power plant contributes power and heat to the system. I am not speaking about privatizing the power system, perhaps we will come to this in 10 years or so. The point is how to make consumer cooperatives survive along with other economic structures. Are cooperatives in a better situation than state commerce or the state production sector? Their situations are virtually analogous. Our colleagues from Russia and Moldova spoke here. It turned out that we have common problems and, as long as they remain unresolved, there will be no stable ties about which some political forces like to speculate very much. The ties have been disrupted because payment mechanisms ceased to exist. As early as three years ago, there were shortages of money. If someone tells you that Ukraine abandoned the ruble zone, do not believe him. This is being said by those politicians who find this statement advantageous. In reality, Ukraine, along with other republics, was thrown out of this zone, which was an objective process. As we all know, in September 1993, some states signed an agreement about the creation of an economic union, but as of today, the ruble zone has been created neither between Russia and Kazakhstan nor between Russia and Belarus. This zone can be created solely under one condition: Either Belarus, for example, becomes a part of Russia or the two states unite on the same basis as EC countries are trying to, after 40 years of cooperation. We are not a unique phenomenon and no islanders that can do whatever they want. This illusion has afflicted severe damage on Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and other republics. I think that consumer cooperatives must be among the trailblazers in making mutually advantageous contacts. We should not think about global all-embracing things. Let us first establish normal relations between our cooperatives. However, you will set up these relations quicker, if instead of a simple exchange of goods currently termed barter, the "blood vessel" of the financial-credit system starts to function. Who has money for this? Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy reported in his speech yesterday that a 500-billion karbovantsi credit had been earmarked for consumer cooperatives. Did you feel that? Let us be frank -- this credit will produce no tangible effects, because judging by the data cited here, your projects demand more than 10 trillion. When there is no proper correlation between products and money, no matter what politicians do, there will either be sky-rocketing inflation (which we are experiencing today) or a tough financial-credit policy that will lead to a normal market, and economic correlation between money and product supply. We have started this work, but believe me that we cannot do it given our ersatz currency and the inflation rate of 1993. This year, a spark of stabilization started burning. Not a torch yet, because what kind of stabilization is that, when people are not being paid wages and cannot buy products? However, this is the kind of spark that gives hope and proves that things can be improved. Banks have been bitterly reproached from this rostrum for granting high-interest credits and reaping dividends. This is also a reproach for me, because the National Bank is subordinated to the Supreme Council. However, the Supreme Council does not manage banks as was said here. We do not exercise this kind of control. The National Bank is subordinated solely to the law and depends on the Supreme Council, only in the sense that the latter passes laws on bank activities. The National Bank's function is to oversee the proportion "money -- product -- money," while the issuance of credits belongs to commercial or departmental banks. There are voices calling to nationalize these. However, this is not the kind of road for us to choose. We should encourage competition between banks. If we want to go back to the administrative-command system and totalitarianism, then we should proclaim them state banks. However, we cannot go back to what once existed. Thus, we must act in such a way as to make banks have interest in manufacturers. According to Chayanov, the nature of market relations envisions that if someone comes and buys something, the seller should give him an award. If a shareholder, a farmer, or a village resident deposits his money in a bank, this must be advantageous for him. However today, everything is the other way around. There is just one solution, that is to put an end to the monopoly of these banks. What Ivan Illich Bakhchyvanzhi from Odessa Oblast told us here, and he was not the only one to say this, means that you are able to create your own bank within your system. It will interact with you and other banks, and then you will get things going. Then, the interest-increase curve will begin to decline, because you will be able to bargain about credit interest rates, doing this on mutually advantageous terms. It is good that you are already laying the foundation of your bank. I know about the agreement to allot a certain sum of state money for this bank, so as to let you purchase small bakeries for rural areas, about which there was talk here, freezers, and other equipment; as well as more actively carry out reform in your sector. Important issues, not only for consumer cooperation, have been brought up in this hall. I am grateful that you have given the floor to village and rayon council heads and a school principal. Cooperative workers from different oblasts told us a lot of interesting things. One can feel that despite tremendous hardships, you have had good initiative on the way to the market. These sprouts have been conditioned by life. I am sure you can cite a lot of concrete places in which reform in different spheres is advancing despite all the obstacles. Two years ago, one of the managers from Donetsk Oblast, asked by me why people had not been allotted land for vegetable and collective gardening, answered with surprise: "Do you mean we have to give them blackland?" This is some stance indeed! People can be given slopes, ditches, and other worthless patches of land, but by no means blackland. However in spring, grass will grow even through asphalt. Let me cite these figures: Over the last four years, the volume of areas earmarked for vegetable and collective gardening has significantly increased. What have been the results of this? Here I have data from some oblasts. In previous years, more than 100,000 tonnes of potatoes were shipped yearly for the needs of Kiev residents. In 1993, 16,000 tonnes were shipped, and now nobody knows what to do with them. The point is that the production of potatoes by all the social groups in the oblast has grown more than twofold. The same thing happened in Dnepropetrovsk Oblast. Some 37,000 to 40,000 tonnes of potatoes used to be shipped to Zaporozhye Oblast every autumn, in accordance with the central plan. In 1993, the figure was 6,000 tonnes, and nobody in the city complained about shortages. It turned out that potatoes grow there as well. Under the old economic system, potatoes would not grow in southern oblasts, but when land was given to the people, they started to grow in both Zaporozhye and Dnepropetrovsk Oblasts. I could cite more examples of this kind. You have repeatedly mentioned the Law on Consumer Cooperation here, adopted by the Supreme Soviet. In my opinion, it is far from ideal, but it has opened the door for you and provided a legal footing for developing your structures. However, commenting on that law, one senior official once said: "I have all grounds to claim that the law on cooperation is a result of a bribe." [words within quotation marks in Russian] You might be perplexed to hear this phrase, but it is a reverberation of times wept for by some people. Of course, such managers do not like reform in consumer cooperation, because cooperative members no longer address them with these kinds of questions: "Ivan Petrovych, we have received five freezers, 10 suits, and 30 shirts. To whom shall we sell them?" Such managers do not care about baby food or our other hardships. However now, you must become the only masters of your system. You have held 36,000 accounting conferences on all levels, and this congress crowns your work. Thus, you should decide how to live and continue your work. Today, law provides a legal footing for consumer cooperation. If you make right decisions, people will be grateful to you; if your decisions are faulty you feel the consequences. There exists a wise saying: "The trial and error method is not the best one, but nothing better has been discovered so far." One should not simply mark time; one should move forward and make progress, stumbling. The only ones to make no mistakes are those who do no work. You say that your best people abandon you for commercial structures. If you cannot create conditions like those in commercial structures, the outflow of people will continue. You must create conditions to make people come to you and not vice versa. In my opinion, employees will not abandon Ivan Illich because the conditions created in his organization grant both good wages and supplies for village people. If you fail to do this, you will lose your workers. I would like to say a couple of words regarding the essence of our political reform. In 1990, the Supreme Council was elected and is now completing its work. We have lived through many things over the last four years: We have passed the Declaration of Ukrainian Sovereignty and the Act of Independence; debunked the administrative-command system and everything that accompanied it; and created more or less democratic conditions. For the first time ever, opposition has been formed in the legislature which, according to international norms and rules, is a necessary attribute of every parliament. Lack of opposition amounts to monopoly on power and lack of democracy. Over that period, we have passed more than 400 laws and 1000 resolutions. Political forces give different evaluation of these laws on the eve of elections. Some claim that these laws cause anarchy, while others say that they want to enter the new legislature to rescind everything adopted by the current Supreme Council. However, we should go to the Supreme Council to continue the creation of a legal footing for radical reform, modify and improve existing laws. It depends on us whom we will elect on 27 March. After this day, there will be no one to blame. Thus, I am addressing you as the cadre dealing with 23 million people, including 10 million in the heart of the country. We should kneel before these people and thank them for tolerating us. We should tell them: Empower those whom you believe trustworthy. This power should act and not be afraid of anything, because it is popular, that is elected by the people. We already have a legislative basis for village people electing village heads, rayon residents -- rayon heads, town residents -- town heads, oblast residents -- oblast heads, and the entire Ukrainian nation -- the Supreme Council and the president. Deputies of representing organs of power will also be elected in villages, towns, rayons, and oblasts. Thus, the legal footing for holding democratic elections has been formed. The newly elected legislature, along with the rest of the nation, will have to continue the development of a democratic state. Please, believe that Ukraine is forever, and it depends on us whether it will be happy or unhappy.
