FR940111-0-00054 FR940111-0-00015 Section 110(m) does not vitiate section 179 because section 179 sanctions are not statewide but are imposed on the specific area for which the deficiency arises, in most instances nonattainment areas. As stated previously, section 179 mandates that sanctions be imposed 18 months after a finding is made. While the imposition of sanctions earlier under section 110(m) could remove the need to impose sanctions under section 179 sanctions in that area, section 179 has continued force and effect in areas where section 110(m) sanctions are not imposed. The EPA does not believe that imposition of sanctions under section 110(m) conflicts with section 179 sanctions. Application of sanctions earlier than 18 months is not inconsistent because EPA believes the purpose of section 179 was to ensure that EPA did not delay sanctions beyond the periods prescribed in that action. 4. Regulatory Limitation on Early Imposition of Sanctions Comment. The United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) recommends adding a statement to the rule that EPA expects to impose sanctions on a statewide basis earlier than 18 months only in limited circumstances, after notice-and-comment rulemaking. Response. This statement was not in the proposed rule and EPA believes it should not be included in the final rule. The EPA stated in the preamble to the proposed rule that it would only apply sanctions early in ``unusual circumstances where the State has indicated explicit resistance to working to resolve a plan deficiency'' (see 57 FR 44534). The final rule revises this preamble language because EPA believes the term ``unusual circumstances'' provides little guidance as to when EPA intended to use its discretionary sanction authority. While EPA does not intend to use the section 110(m) authority in all situations where a finding is made, the Agency needs to ascertain that it has the flexibility to use this option when necessary. In order to develop some plans or plan items, States must perform certain steps that EPA can track to determine whether the State will meet deadlines in the Act. When a State believes that EPA can impose sanctions only after a deadline is missed and 18 months have gone by, then there is little incentive for the State to take the necessary actions to complete authorization and implementation of politically-difficult rules and regulations. The EPA needs to maintain its flexibility to respond rapidly to situations where it appears a State will not meet a deadline, and to assure the State that it does not, in fact, have an extended grace period for noncompliance. The certainty and swiftness of imposition of the Act's penalties are critical to timely completion of the SIP's. Consequently, the revised language, clarifies EPA's position concerning when discretionary sanctions may be appropriate while retaining EPA's flexibility to use such sanctions to ensure compliance with the Act. Thus, EPA will exercise section 110(m) sanctions earlier than 18 months only in cases where: 1. The State has indicated an explicit resistance to resolving a plan or program deficiency or to making a required plan or program submittal; or 2. Where special circumstances, particular program needs, or time constraints dictate the need for use of such sanctions. Thus, the rule retains the Administrator's discretion to apply sanctions at any time after a finding is made; however, EPA will provide notice and opportunity for comment on the basis for all section 110(m) actions.
