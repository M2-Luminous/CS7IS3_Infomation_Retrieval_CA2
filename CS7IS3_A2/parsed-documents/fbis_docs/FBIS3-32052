One of the bombs was defused, and the other exploded at 12th Street and 19th Avenue in Zone One. [Begin unidentified spokesperson recording] Two bomb scares were being handled. One was defused at 40th Street and 3d Avenue in Zone Three, behind the quarters of the National Police 1st Brigade [words indistinct]. The other, a fragmentation grenade, was thrown against a house. We cannot assume the last one was part of the terrorist actions that have been taking place in Guatemala City. We believe it could have been hurled at a private home, but we do not know which one, perhaps by someone who was inebriated. [end recording]
