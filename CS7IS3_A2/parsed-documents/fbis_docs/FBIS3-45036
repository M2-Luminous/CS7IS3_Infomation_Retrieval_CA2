He added that the two sides should not deal with sensitive political issues in their working level talks. Mr. Tang made these remarks in a report delivered at the third session of the first council of ARATS. He noted that certain new matters had arisen in the course of routine cross-strait talks on the implementation of the agreement reached by the heads of the two organizations. Since Taiwan had introduced into the working talks certain political and legal issues including matters which had not yet been settled, this, Mr. Tang said, was seen as a violation of the direction in which the two sides should be moving. He stressed that the two non-governmental organizations should base their work on economic and routine affairs. Mr. Tang urged the Taiwan side to return to the consensus reached in the talks between the heads of the two groups, saying he hoped ways leading to a solution of routine matters would be found in a bid to reach an agreement acceptable to the two sides on the basis of mutual respect, equality, seeking truth from facts and common ground while reserving differences. The aim is to continue with the talks between the two sides in order to facilitate links and cooperation between them and to push forward cross-strait relations.
