Given the exacerbation of the economic crisis, they demand that urgent, practical measures -- aimed at stabilizing the national economy and relations in the social sector, ensuring a decrease in retail prices, the liquidation of crime and corruption, and the termination of the illegal redistribution of state property -- be undertaken. There are many reasons for this to be done. There is a big gap between the consumer basket and actual wages.
