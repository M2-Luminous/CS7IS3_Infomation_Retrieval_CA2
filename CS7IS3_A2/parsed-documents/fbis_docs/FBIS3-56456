Russian economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy who is said to succeed Gaydar, in an interview with IRNA here Monday described Gaydar as an incompetent person for membership in the new cabinet. He said that Gaydar always introduced the former speaker of parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov as the main obstacle on the way of economic reforms but during the past three months since the dissolution of the parliament he did not carry out any constructive measure. Comparing certain members of the government with that of the former Soviet Union, he claimed that some of them only thought about having fashionable offices, modern cars and luxury houses instead of paying attention to more important matters. He reiterated that he would not accept the post of deputy prime minister.
