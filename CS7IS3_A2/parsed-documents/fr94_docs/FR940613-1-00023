FR940613-1-00023 FR940613-1-00003 In the same vein, the Board believes that ESOPs (tax-qualified or otherwise) should not be accorded higher purchase priority rights than long-term depositors. The Board believes that general principles of fiduciary duty require that the board of trustees of a State Savings Bank put the interest of long-term depositors ahead of the interests of management and employees. Thus, the proposed rule would require that ESOPs not be accorded a higher subscription right priority than ``eligible depositors.'' The term ``eligible depositors'' would be defined as a depositor holding qualifying deposits at the bank as of a date designated in the bank's plan of conversion that is not less than one year prior to the date of adoption of the plan of conversion by the converting bank's board of trustees. The FDIC requests specific comment on whether the one-year period is sufficient and on whether the period chosen should be based on the board of trustees' first consideration of whether to convert to stock ownership. E. Submission of Business Plans For safety and soundness purposes the FDIC must know the institution's business plan for post-conversion operation, growth and investment of any newly injected capital. The reason is that institutions converting from mutual form undertake a major restructuring that possibly could lead to significant changes in the nature or volume of business conducted. Converted institutions become answerable to shareholders for the first time, and the shareholders are concerned with obtaining a reasonable return on their investment. As discussed in the preamble to the Interim Rule, in the past some institutions, in leveraging capital raised through a conversion and reaching for a return on equity, have vigorously competed for loans and unduly liberalized underwriting standards. Such practices led to loan losses that in many instances depleted more capital than was raised through conversion and, in some cases, failures and losses to the Bank Insurance Fund. For these reasons, the proposed rule would require State Savings Banks that propose to undergo a mutual-to-stock conversion to submit a business plan including, among other things, a detailed discussion of how management intends to deploy the capital raised through the sale of stock in the conversion, expected returns resulting from the plan, and the justification for any intended stock repurchases. F. Post-conversion Stock Repurchases As indicated above, the proposed rule would require that the business plan submitted to the FDIC in connection with a proposed mutual-to-stock conversion include a detailed discussion of how the capital acquired in the conversion will be utilized, including, among other things, a justification for any proposed stock repurchases. The FDIC is concerned that substantial buyback programs begun immediately after the bank's conversion to stock form may not have a legitimate business purpose. Such repurchases also raise issues about whether the conversion stock was appropriately valued. In addition, the FDIC is concerned that a recently converted institution have a capital base adequate to safeguard against possible unexpected losses that may occur under the new organizational structure. To protect against these potential problems, the proposed rule would prohibit stock repurchases for one year following the conversion. Stock repurchases after that period would be considered on a case-by-case basis under section 18(i)(1) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(i)(1)) which prohibits state nonmember banks from reducing or retiring capital without the prior consent of the FDIC. VI. Merger/Conversions In some cases, mutual institutions convert to stock ownership in the course of a merger or acquisition transaction with another depository institution or holding company. This is generally known as a merger/conversion. In merger/conversions depositors of the converting institutions obtain the right to purchase stock in the acquiring institution and not the converting savings bank. In exercising its fiduciary responsibilities the board of trustees of a State Savings Bank must assure that value of the converting institution is fairly distributed. This means not only guarding the interests of long-term depositors against insiders and professional depositors, but against acquiring institutions. Based on the proposed conversions we have reviewed in the recent past and other merger conversions we have studied, the Board has observed that, in virtually every merger conversion, the acquiring institution captures a large portion of the value of the converting institution. It is also not uncommon in merger/conversions for the management of the converting mutual institution to receive extremely generous compensation and benefit packages. The OTS Revisions prohibit merger/conversions. As indicated in the preamble to the OTS Revisions, there is an issue whether the management of a mutual institution is opting for a merger/conversion, instead of a standard conversion, based on the best interests of the institution and its depositors or in response to the level of benefits offered to management by the acquiring entity. As noted in the preamble to the Interim Rule, there have been numerous complaints recently by depositors and others that permitting healthy mutual savings banks to be acquired by means of a merger/conversion has resulted in some savings bank insiders putting their interest ahead of the interests of the converting bank and its depositors.
