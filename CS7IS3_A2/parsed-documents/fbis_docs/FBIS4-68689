The chief sensational aspect is the defeat of the electoral bloc Democratic Unity of Petersburg. Democratic Unity led 19 candidates to the finish line--more than all the remaining electoral associations combined, but only three of the candidates nominated by the Belyayev bloc will get seats. Aleksandr Nikolayevich himself, destined by many to become chairman of the coming assembly, was not among the victors. After the first round of voting, Belyayev outdistanced his rival--Aleksandr Shchelkanov, former chairman of the city executive committee, by an almost twofold lead. Several days prior to the runoff election, Shchelkanov assessed the directive of the mayor on extending the 20 March voting as illegal, and proposed to Belyayev that they mutually withdraw their candidacies. Judging from the response of the Belyayev team, this proposal was seen as an attempt to avoid the inevitable defeat of "a politician who had not fulfilled himself." One can today assert that Shchelkanov--who wrote "In the event this is rejected, I will be forced to prolong my fight and will be victorious"--assessed the situation more sensibly... Turning now to other electoral associations. The bloc All Petersburg passed through the second round with minimal losses, gaining four seats. The blocs Our City--Our Home and Unity for the Sake of Progress had one victor each. But Beloved City achieved the greatest success--all five candidates in this association who underwent the second round of voting were victorious over their rivals. Independent candidates will get the remaining seats. As before, however, the results are not entirely conclusive. The dispute on legality of the first round is not yet over. We know that the majority of electoral associations are disputing the mayor's decision to extend the voting time frame. Only Democratic Unity and Business Petersburg supported the decision. It cannot be ruled out that they will now change their opinion and join others seeking to attain acknowledgment of the spring elections as invalid. It should be stated that a great many "oddities" took place prior to the second round as well. At one of the polling stations in District No. 9, for example, oranges were distributed from a Mercedes to voters, along with an appeal to vote for Yuriy Novolodskiy. The team of the respected chief of the justice administration interpreted this fact as provocation (albeit only after his competitor's authorized agents submitted a complaint to the Central Electoral Commission). The provocation story would be quite convincing had not a Novolodskiy overseer reminded prisoners during the voting at Kresty--"Did you get the free cigarettes? They are from us..." Gifts were also promised to the voters at District No. 23. True, not to all--only to those who supported Shukhrat Sayfullayev, president of the joint-stock company Peter the Great, in the second round of voting. They were promised monthly sponsored assistance out of the company's specially established assistance fund. True, it is not entirely clear how people swallowing this bait could prove they voted for him--it is hardly likely that precinct commissions would release their certified documentation. It cannot be ruled out that Sayfullayev's recent rival, Boris Pustyntsev, will contest the voting results--such campaigning is entirely too similar to outright graft. The campaign in District No. 11 was also waged "freestyle." One of the candidates, Valeriy Selivanov, was forced to apologize to the voters during a radio presentation for the fact that he was unable to respond to their questions during television debates. The fact of the matter is that for some reason it was not the presiding official, and not the chairman of the electoral commission who sorted out the questions--but rather Democratic Unity leader Aleksandr Belyayev, who came to the studio to support the candidate of his bloc. Only after the television debates were over was Valeriy Nikolayevich able to find out what indeed his voters had asked. The effect of the Selivanov radio broadcast was unanticipated. He received phone calls recommending that he not make idle chatter about it--or what would then happen would be his fault. If this was a joke--it was not all that funny. After all, during the election campaign two of Selivanov's authorized agents were subjected to attack. Disputes as to how honest the election was in one district or another and how legal the election was overall will go on much longer than one month. Especially since the new Assembly will still not be able to get down to work. Until such time as three-fourths of the deputies are elected, the elections are not valid. It is foolish to be guessing today what awaits us in the fall--by-elections or a new campaign which will clearly take place under different rules. In any event, political experts and the leaders of political parties have time to analyze the frame of mind of St. Petersburg residents. It is entirely evident that the defeat of Democratic Unity candidates in the majority of districts cannot be just a coincidence.
