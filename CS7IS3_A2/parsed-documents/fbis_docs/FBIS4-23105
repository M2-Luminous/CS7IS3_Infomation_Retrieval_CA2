All four of Europe's biggest microelectronics firms--Philips of the Netherlands, the French-Italian firm SGS-Thomson, and the German companies Siemens and Temic--show a trend toward profitability. Philips made a profit in 1993, as did SGS-Thomson and Temic. The microelectronics department of Siemens will become profitable this year, according to department head Juergen Knorr. These companies are also investing in new facilities. SGS- Thomson recently opened a modern factory near Grenoble that produces semiconductors with structures of 0.5 micron, and will soon be producing 0.35 micron structures. In late May 1994, Temic will open a new factory in Heilbronn to produce components for infrared data communications. Siemens' factory for memory chips in Regensburg has become so successful that it is being expanded, and Siemens is building a new plant in Dresden, primarily to produce primarily DRAMs (Dynamic Random Access Memories). European microelectronics firms and research institutes are also developing new technologies and positioning themselves for emerging markets. Recently the Heinrich Hertz Institute for Communication Technology in Berlin developed a method of combining lasers and photodiodes with electronic chips in one component. This device can transform optical signals into electric signals, or electric signals into optical ones. This development drew worldwide attention. Siemens has achieved an almost 70-percent market share in high- frequency components for mobile radios. The company is forming a strategic alliance with the Finnish firm Nokia, which is number two in the world in the end equipment area. Another growing market is automobile electronics, which "is one of the strengths of the Europeans," according to Carl Muehlner, business manager of Dataquest GmbH. For example, the German company Bosch has developed a Controller Area Network (CAN), a data network which can unite all electric and electronic devices in a car. Mercedes-Benz already uses this system in its luxury cars. Other markets of the future with significant European participation are chip cards and multimedia. The problem area remains computers, but SGS-Thomson has established a new department in order to enter the microprocessor market in the near future. (Duesseldorf WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE in German 6 May 94) (BC) POLICY ISSUES German Industrialists View Research Policy--During a German Ministry for Research and Technology closed conference on innovation policy in May 1994, Tyll Necker, president of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), called for cost reductions and deregulation, as well as tax subsidies for industrial research. He complained of the high costs of labor and taxes in Germany. Research Minister Paul Krueger admitted that Germany is a land of high costs, but pointed out such advantages as a well-educated workforce, central location, excellent infrastructure, advanced research facilities, and productive work culture. Necker stated that in comparison with other industrialized countries, Germany's labor costs are 25 percent higher, additional personnel costs are 40 percent higher, and company taxes are 30 percent higher. German companies reacted by making cost reductions and by introducing lean management and lean production, which also affected research negatively. However, the tight financial situation gave these firms no choice, according to Necker. He said that the BDI would urge the reintroduction of indirect support for research from the government. Necker also urged reforms in European patent law, saying that the costs are too high, especially for small and medium-sized companies. He called for deregulation of the research institutes. The state should provide good conditions for research, but allow companies to manage their own technology policies without intervention, he said. According to Necker, Germany is still a leading technology country with a good mix of branches of industry. However, German companies trail their most important competitors in certain high technology fields such as microelectronics and information technology, he said. (Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT 26 May 94 p 6) BC Netherlands Trails in Technology--A report by the Merit Research Bureau for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Dutch companies are cutting R&D spending with the result that the Netherlands is trailing its competitors in most fields of technology. While government R&D spending appears to be reasonably high, much of it is for nontechnical subjects, and the number of students studying science is dropping, according to the report, which was issued in April 1994. Research spending by companies, as a percentage of GNP, is also dropping. Even in high-tech sectors such as aerospace and computers, Dutch companies spend less on R&D than their foreign competitors. The Merit report recommends fiscal measures to stimulate R&D, more scientific research by universities, and closer ties between technical institutes and industry. (Amsterdam HET FINANCIELE DAGBLAD 21 Apr 94) BC CORPORATE STRATEGIES Philips Investment in France--In an effort to regain predominance within the European semiconductor industry, Philips is investing 500 million francs ($89 million) in a subsidiary in Caen, France, in order to double the company's total integrated circuit (IC) production capacity over the next three years. The Caen plant will be equipped with an additional line for producing O.7-micron- technology ICs. The submicron CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) circuits will be manufactured on 150-millimeter silicon wafers. The operation will boost the number of employees at the plant (now 830) by 200. In 1993 the plant produced 300 million chips and exported 90 percent of them. (Paris L'USINE NOUVELLE 24 Mar 94) IM Alcatel Moves to Enhance its Competitive Stance--Alcatel, the French telecommunications giant, recently made two strategic moves to enhance its market position. It created Alcatel Optronics, a specialized subsidiary, and it decided to participate in the Globalstar satellite communication system. Alcatel, which has long been involved in optoelectronics at its research center in Marcoussis and at its German subsidiary SEL, recently set up Alcatel Optronics in Nozay, France with 250 employees, 250 million francs ($44 million) in sales and a planned 20-percent sales increase in 1994. The new operation will be responsible for all the group's optoelectronics developments and marketing. Alcatel Optronics will manufacture active components such as lasers and photodetectors, an activity which had been divided between Marcoussis and SEL's German site. SEL will concentrate on passive devices such as multiplexers, and the Lannion plant will assemble and test products for underwater use. Alcatel Optronics will be able to respond to the present needs of its telecommunications branches as well as to the future demands for switching of Alcatel Bell and Alcatel-CIT. Alcatel reacted to the emerging large-scale alliances in telecommunications, such as the Iridium project and Teledesic, by joining the Globalstar satellite communication project. The company hopes to gain a good competitive position at the beginning of the 21st century especially in America, where these ventures have already begun to take shape. Globalstar will offer worldwide voice communication, data transmission, telecopying and position fixing services through stationary or mobile terminals. The system is planned to start operation in 1998 and a decade later is projected to have 10 million subscribers. Alcatel's contribution to Globalstar's costs over a four-year period will be to 45 percent. Ventures like this are not new to Alcatel; in 1991 the company joined Italy's Alenia, acquiring 49 percent of the Loral Corporation subsidiary Space Systems, and set up a joint venture with California-based ()ualcomm in 1990 in satellite position reporting services (EutelTracs). (Paris L'USINE NOUVELLE 31 Mar 94 pp 26, 27) IM Akebono Brake to Build R&D Center in France--In 1995, Akebono Brake, Japan's largest automobile brake manufacturer, will open an R&D center near Paris that will employ about six engineers. Work there will be concentrated on developing new friction type materials and prototypes. Once installed in Europe, the Japanese firm intends to establish relations with Peugeot and Renault. Above all, it aims at enlarging its customer base, which in Europe consists only of the United Kingdom. At present, most of the company's production goes to Mitsubishi, Nissan, and Toyota. It had a revenue of 106 billion yen ($1 billion) in 1993, and a net profit of 489 million yen ($5 million). Akebono is owned by companies including Toyota (15.4 percent), Nissan (15.6 percent), Germany's Bosch (13.8 percent), Isuzu (5.1 percent), and Mitsubishi (1.5 percent). Suzuki will presumably also become an owner.
