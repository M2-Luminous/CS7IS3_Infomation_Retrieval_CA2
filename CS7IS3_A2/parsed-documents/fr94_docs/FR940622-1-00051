Box 80711, Wilmington, DE 19880-0711, submitted pesticide petition (PP) 1E3990 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for dimethyl ether (DME) when used as an aerosol propellant in pesticide formulations applied to animals. Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading, and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement on inert ingredients published in the Federal Register of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for dimethyl ether will need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below: 1. A cardiac sensitization study in the dog with a no-observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL) of 100,000 parts per million and a lowest-observed-adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 200,000 ppm. 2. A 4-hour acute inhalation toxicity study in the male rat with an LC 50 of 164,000 ppm. 3. No evidence of mutagenicity with and without metabolic activation when exposed in a closed system to Salmonella strains at concentrations determined in a cytotoxicity test. 4. A 2-week inhalation study in rats with a NOAEL of less than 10,000 ppm. 5. A 4-week inhalation study in hamsters showing changes in red blood cell counts in females and decreased white blood cell counts in both males and females and decreased body weight and relative spleen weight in males with a NOAEL of 2,000 ppm. 6. A 13-week inhalation study in rats showing elevated neutrophil counts in all test groups with a NOAEL of less than 1,000 ppm. 7. A 13-week inhalation study in hamsters showing decreased red blood cell count and hemoglobin in males with a NOAEL of 5,000 ppm. 8. A 2-year rat inhalation study in rats showing female rats had a statistically significant increase in total mammary tumors at the highest concentration tested and a significant positive trend for total mammary tumors. The Cancer Peer Review Committee concluded that this was due to the less-than-usual incidence of total mammary tumors in the control group, compared to historical controls, and concluded that there was no convincing evidence of carcinogenicity in this study. The systemic LOEL in this study is 0.2% (2,000 ppm) based on a significant increase in the incidence of splenic congestion in males at 6 months, decreased red cell count in males and females at the mid and high doses at 6 months, increased absolute spleen weight in males at the high concentration at 6 and 12 months, and congestion of the spleen in males at the high dose at 6 months. The systemic NOEL is less than 0.2% (2,000 ppm). 9. Two rat developmental effects studies by inhalation with a NOEL for maternal toxicity of 2% DME and a NOEL for developmental toxicity of 0.125% DME. Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300342]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
