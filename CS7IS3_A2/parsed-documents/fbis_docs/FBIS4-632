Former British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington was the first of the seven foreign mediators to arrive on Tuesday, but declined to comment on prospects for the mediation. He said he and ex-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger felt honoured to have been invited to mediate. The other mediators invited are Mr Justice H K Bhagwati of India, Mr Justice A Leon Higginbotham of the United States of America, Prof Paul Kevenhorster of Germany, Mr Justice Antonio la Pergola of Italy and Prof Jean Antonie Laponce of Canada. The terms of reference for the mediation process will be determined once they have all arrived. Meanwhile, the government who until now has been lukewarm about the mediation process, fearing it could reopen a range of already-settled constitutional issues, will join the mediation process. ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa told Transitional Executive Council members on Tuesday although it was originally intended only to involve the ANC and the IFP, negotiators at Friday's leader's summit at Skukuza in the Kruger National Park had decided the government should become a party to the mediation. He however warned against IFP expectations that the elections might be postponed. "The IFP seems to be getting into the mediation process in the hope that the process will result in the date of elections being postponed. "The election date is sacrosanct, not even the mediation process can tamper with it," Mr Ramaphosa added. ANC President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday said he was confident the mediation could resolve the deadlock over the IFP's participation in the election as well as the role of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini under a new constitution. Speaking in Johannesburg, Mr Mandela said the mediation process was an "important development" which raised the possibility of solving the problem "of some of those who are outside the process". "They (the mediators) have a very difficult job indeed" after the "lack of success in the meeting last Friday". Mr Mandela said he would make "special recommendations" to the mediators "so that their efforts can as far as possible be successful". Should mediation fail, talks would continue with the parties involved. "Dialogue is our important weapon," he told reporters. Meanwhile, Constitutional Development Deputy Minister Fanus Schoeman said on Tuesday the mediation should revolve around guaranteeing a free election as there was no time to renegotiate the interim constitution. He said the government had doubts about the draft mediation guidelines to resolve the deadlock. According to the guidelines, the interim constitution would have to be virtually renegotiated, according to Mr Schoeman. But there was little time for this. He said that specific parts of the guidelines should rather be used to bring the IFP into the constitutional process by obtaining the party's permission for a free election in kwaZulu. The IFP could still get involved in constitutional negotiations after the elections, he said.
