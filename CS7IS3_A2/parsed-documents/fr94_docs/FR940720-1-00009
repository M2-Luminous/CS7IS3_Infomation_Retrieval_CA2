FR940720-1-00009 FR940720-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Social Security Administration 20 CFR Part 404 RIN 0960&hyph;AD72 Computing Benefit Amounts, Disposing of Underpayments, Resolving Overpayments, and Payment Restriction AGENCY: Social Security Administration, HHS. ACTION: Proposed rules. SUMMARY: We are proposing to revise our rules on computation of benefits to define the term ``first becomes eligible'' as it relates to a pension based on noncovered employment. We are also revising the computation rules to provide that we will consider all government service used by a pension-paying agency when we determine whether an individual first became eligible before 1986 for a pension based on noncovered employment. We are also revising our rule on determining fault regarding overpayments to state that benefit deductions because of net earnings from self-employment are not applicable after an individual attains age 70. Additionally, we are revising our rules on underpayments to clarify a misleading cross reference. Finally, we are updating the list of countries to which benefit payments are withheld because of Treasury Department restrictions. DATES: Your comments will be considered if we receive them no later than September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in writing to the Commissioner of Social Security, Department of Health and Human Services, P.O.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 215(a)(7) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires us to perform a modified computation of the primary insurance amount (the basic benefit amount) of an individual's old-age or disability insurance benefit if the individual first becomes eligible after 1985 for such a benefit and for a monthly periodic payment based on noncovered employment. The modified computation affects individuals who are concurrently entitled to such a monthly periodic payment and to old-age or disability benefits under title II of the Act. It results in a lower primary insurance amount that would have been computed if the monthly periodic payment had been considered. However, neither the Act nor our regulations at 20 CFR 404.213 define the phrase ``first becomes eligible.'' In defining ``first becomes eligible,'' we have identified two interpretations which pertain to the date creditable service is acquired. One interpretation is that an individual first becomes eligible when he or she has currently acquired enough service to qualify for a pension. The other interpretation is that an individual first becomes eligible when he or she has acquired enough service to qualify for a pension, regardless of when the service was acquired. We recently became aware that some individuals have purchased credit for prior service, e.g., military service, which could affect their eligibility date and allow them to become eligible before 1986 for a monthly pension based on noncovered employment. Such an individual would thus be excluded from the modified computation because he or she first became eligible for the monthly pension before 1986. There is no restriction in the Act which precludes using purchased credit to establish eligibility before 1986 for a monthly pension based on noncovered employment and we see no reason not to consider purchased credits when deciding whether the modified computation applies. We have adopted the interpretation that we will consider all applicable service used by the pension-paying agency, regardless of when the service was acquired. Under this interpretation, an individual ``first becomes eligible'' for a monthly periodic payment for the first month (including a past month) that the individual meets all the requirements for the payment except stopping work or applying for the payment. We, therefore, propose to amend ยง404.213(a) to include the definition of ``first becomes eligible'' and our policy on applicable service.
