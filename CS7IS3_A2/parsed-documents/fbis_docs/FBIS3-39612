The British troops will reinforce United Nations forces already in the Bosnian capital and help monitor the ceasefire and control Serb and Muslim heavy weapons. The self-sufficient force, including engineer, logistics, anti-tank and mortar specialists, earlier left the UK base at Vitez in Warrior and other armoured fighting vehicles. They will be joined shortly by a second company of Coldstream Guards, bringing the total deployment in Sarajevo to almost 300 men. Hopes were high that the Moscow initiative to send 400 Russian troops to Sarajevo would persuade the Serbs to comply fully with the NATO ultimatum to withdraw or hand over control of their heavy weapons by midnight Sunday [20 February]. Although the Bosnian Muslims and others have voiced concern about Russia's close relationship with the Serbs, they will not seek to prevent the move. And Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind sought to calm fears about possible Russian bias towards the Serbs. "Of course it is the case that Russia has a particular relationship with Serbia, but that also applies to other countries," he said. Malaysia was very close to the Bosnian government, yet its troops were serving under the UN in the war zone. "We all accept there will inevitably be old friendships, old ties, that have to be taken into account," said the Defence Secretary. "The crucial point is that all forces in Bosnia come under the UN command." The Russian decision has led to a significant withdrawal of heavy guns, with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic pledging that the war in Sarajevo was finally over. The UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, said there was a "particular exodus" and he believed that people finally wanted peace. The Russian move eased pressure on the Government, under attack for refusing to send an extra infantry battalion to Bosnia after Sir Michael appealed for 3,000 more troops. Mr Rifkind again defended the Government's position, stressing that Britain had 2,500 troops in the region while other countries like the United States had no representation. Sixty specialist mortar locating troops are due to leave Britain for Sarajevo tomorrow with morale sky-high. Men from the 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery [RHA] at Topcliffe, North Yorkshire, will join colleagues from the 1st Regiment RHA from Tidworth, Hampshire. They will take five sets of Cymbeline mortar locating radar systems, which will be able to detect the precise source of any shell fired in violation of the Sarajevo ceasefire. [passage omitted]
