"However," Churkin noted, "it is not our intention to bring about a crisis over this issue in the relations between Russia and the international community." Churkin added that "Russia has good communications with the Serbian side just as Germany communicates well with Croatia and the United States does with the Muslims." Churkin expressed dissatisfaction with "some aspects of NATO's decision" to give an ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs since, in his words, this has created "duality regarding the situation in Sarajevo." "These decisions go beyond the framework set by UN resolutions. If this standpoint had been adopted at a session of the UN Security Council, we would have full unanimity in the stands of the international community," Churkin said. In his view, air strikes "are the last resort in the event of direct attacks on UNPROFOR or in a difficult humanitarian situation." Reflecting upon his visit to Sarajevo, Churkin said that "his impressions were encouraging" following talks with commander of the UN peace force General Jean Cot, Serb General Ratko Mladic, Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. "My impression in the wake of all these talks is that all the sides to the conflict are now thinking about peace rather than further fighting," Churkin said and added that General Mladic "convinced him that he would meet UNPROFOR's demand with maximum flexibility."
