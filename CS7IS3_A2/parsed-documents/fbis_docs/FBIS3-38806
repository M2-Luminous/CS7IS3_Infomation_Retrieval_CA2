But you get the feeling that it has again fallen into a period of lethargy. [Claes] I have never properly understood why the Greek presidency has been condemned before it has begun. I believe that for internal political reasons, elections, change of government, the Greeks were late in preparing their presidency. But when you see the busy agenda for the meeting of the Council of Ministers on Tuesday and Wednesday [7 and 8 February], the Greeks seem to be on their way to surpassing the reputation of the Belgians who were already moving forward at exceptionally high speed. There is a lot to be done, but with one inevitable priority: The enlargement of the Union. We have just under one month to conclude the negotiations. [LE SOIR] Do you believe it will be possible to respect the 1 March deadline? And if not, will it matter? [CLaes] Everything depends on what you mean by "respect" the deadline. If we over-run by a few weeks, it is not serious. If, on the other hand, we don't manage to conclude within two or three months, that will be a serious setback. We would then have to wait for the new European Parliament to meet which has to give its assent. But I still believe it is possible to conclude the negotiations within the deadlines set. [LE SOIR] Certain candidate countries, Norway and Sweden, are facing negative public opinions. Do these countries require special treatment? [Claes] For Sweden, the situation is less clear. The latest opinion polls show a majority in favor of membership. Essentially, it has been stated and restated that we must not start the exceptions game all over again. Either candidates accept Maastricht and Community progress to date, or it will not work. There is room for periods of transition and specific regulations for specific problems. But there is no room for permanent structural exceptions. It is not the EU which is asking Sweden and Norway, and so on to join. The populations in question must know what they want. [LE SOIR] You are president of the European Socialist Party and you have elections in four months. How are you going to present the image of a more human Europe to your voters? [Claes] We must explain to Europeans that we are in the depths of a structural crisis and that virtually all the problems we are currently facing go beyond national borders, that the problems are interconnected, and that we therefore need a voluntarist policy at international level. That is the only way to avoid the explosion of our social model. [LE SOIR] But are we not doing precisely the opposite? Is not Europe an excuse for doing nothing? [Claes] In all honesty, I do not believe so. Governments everywhere are trying to boost the competitiveness of companies, encouraging employers and employees to find more imaginative labor solutions, promoting flexibility. We cannot say that Jacques Delors' White Paper has not been acted upon. Governments everywhere are adopting the same approach. That is a sign of the reality of Europe. [LE SOIR] And at the social level, do you feel that Europe is acting? [Claes] We must be honest: It is a great weakness for Europe. Miet Smet, during the Belgian presidency, obtained some results. I am the last person to underestimate his work, but we must not exaggerate the results either. The Twelve have legislated on working hours, but a 48-hour week remains possible. We have also legislated on youth employment, but it is still possible to work at the age of 13 in Europe. It is time Mrs. Thatcher and her consorts stopped criticizing us for a savage social policy!
