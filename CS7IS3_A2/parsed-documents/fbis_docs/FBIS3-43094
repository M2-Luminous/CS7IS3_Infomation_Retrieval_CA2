Posvyanskiy, RAS Institute of Radioengineering and Electronics, Moscow, Russia] [Abstract] Resonant-tunnel diodes (RTD) based on GaAs/AlAs heterostructures were produced using the method of molecular-beam epitaxy, and their static volt-ampere characteristics were examined. A two-barrier structure (TBS) with a 14 nm thick non- doped GaAs layer as a spacer was grown on a 1.5 �m thick n[.sup]+[/]-GaAs (doped by Si) with a 3 x 10[.sup]18[/] cm [.sup]-3[/] concentration of impurity. 2.5 nm thick AlAs layers were grown as TBS barriers. A 4.5 nm GaAs layer was used to form the TBS potential well. The difference in optimal temperatures of growing GaAs and AlAs constitutes the particular feature of growing this structure. Because of this feature, the temperature of the substrate was varied during the growing process. The TBS was grown at the substrate temperature of 690�C, and the GaAs layers at the temperature of 620�C. Differences were detected in the volt-ampere characteristics of the RTD produced on identical heteroepitaxial structures. An equivalent RTD model is proposed. The volt-ampere characteristics of the RTD were computed within the framework of this model for different conditions. Figures 5, references 7: 1 Russian, 6 Western
