A component of the MP's (Hungarian Army's) long range planning, the development will go into series production not earlier than 1995. MH approved the plans--selected through bidding--in 1991. The 40-employee Gepfet company built the first prototype at a time when Laszlo Jeno was still state secretary in the defense ministry. "Presently", Laszlo Jeno informed us," the firm is building three more prototypes equipped with diverse options." Then he added: "in my estimation this all-terrain vehicle with a Volkswagen engine, fit also for civilian use, would cost at today's prices from 2-to-3 million forints." According to Army experts, development of the prototype had cost 6 million, while Laszlo Jeno estimates all development expenses to be around 30 million forints; 40 percent contributed by his own company, 20 percent each by Raba, Malev and Technoimpex, the owners of Gepfet, and the rest from credits.
