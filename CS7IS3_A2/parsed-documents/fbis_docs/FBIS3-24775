Officials here said that international mediators had annulled the results of eight constituency polls disputed after ballots last year, in theory leaving the government's parliamentary majority intact with 63 out of 125 seats. But in the Gabonese capital Libreville, officials said nine constituency polls had been annulled. This would leave his supporters with 62 seats -- one less than an overall majority. The polls were among 58 which had been questioned after voting which began last May, but which was interrupted following widespread unrest, and which was eventually won in October by supporters of President Lissouba. Previously the balloting in 125 constituencies had given 65 seats in the National Assembly to pro-Lissouba candidates. The version of annulments announced here ousted two pro-Lissouba candidates. The results published in Libreville at a ceremony presided over by Gabonese President Omar Bongo ousted three. There was no explanation of the contradiction in the results. Fresh ballots will be organized in the eight or nine disputed constituencies. Observers suggested that the confusion may be due to the fact that some candidates were the subject of a number of demands that their election be annulled. But the situation was unclear late Monday. There has been speculation for months that the pro-Lissouba coalition could lose its overall majority as a result of the findings of the international arbitrating committee. The committee comprised seven judges -- two appointed by the Organization of African Unity, two by the European Community, two by France and one by Gabon -- and was set up under an accord signed in Libreville in August. In a statement the arbitrating committee called for calm. "We have carried out our work in complete independence, so as to bring peace back to the country," it said. Amid the confusion, calm appeared to have returned to the streets of the Congolese capital Monday, after more than a month of unrest between presidential supporters and opposition forces. Government forces withdrew from areas south of the city, where the opposition has strongholds in the suburbs of Bacongo and Makele-Kele. Opposition forces were also not in evidence. Clashes after the first round of voting last year claimed some 30 lives. Voting resumed in October after both sides agreed to set up the inquiry. But violence flared again in November, when around 50 died during fresh bloodshed.
