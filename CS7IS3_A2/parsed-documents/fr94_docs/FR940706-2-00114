Headquartered in Houston, TX; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance applicable to all workers of the subject firm. The certification notice was issued on May 17, 1994 and published in the Federal Register on June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28429). At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The investigation findings show that the correct name of the subject firm through December 31, 1992 was Hughes Christiansen Company, Inc.
