FBIS3-7541 "dreas060_a_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-060 Document Type:Daily Report 29 Mar 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Government Announces New Market-Opening Package OW2903024894 Tokyo KYODO in English 0228 GMT 29 Mar 94 OW2903024894 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Japan on Tuesday [29 March] unveiled a new package of measures to further open its markets to foreign products, in a bid to cut huge trade surpluses and deflect criticism from trading partners, especially the United States. The package, approved by the cabinet Tuesday morning, centers on tax cuts and other macroeconomic steps to spur domestic demand, market-opening measures in four sectors and voluntary overtures in three priority areas of the stalemated trade talks with the U.S. Noting the need to overhaul Japan's economic structure, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said in a statement that the new package clearly shows his administration's resolve to achieve such reform and bring the nation's economy into harmony with the international community. Earlier Tuesday morning, Hosokawa telephoned to U.S. President Bill Clinton to explain the package in advance and seek U.S. understanding of Japan's efforts to increase foreign access to its markets. Thanking Hosokawa for the call, Clinton said he looks forward to scrutinizing the package, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. Clinton reportedly said he still believes Japan and the U.S. can reach an agreement in the so-called "framework" trade negotiations that collapsed at the bilateral summit in Washington on February 11. Clinton was also quoted as telling Hosokawa that the two countries can gauge progress in the openness of Japanese markets by "objective criteria" while addressing Japan's concern that setting numerical targets would lead to managed trade. The package has no fresh proposals on macroeconomic measures but promises to draw up concrete plans by the end of June for comprehensive tax reform, including permanent tax cuts and boosting the amount of the current 10-year, 430 trillion yen public works spending program that began in fiscal 1991. With no new fiscal measures, the package features four market-opening items -- deregulation, promotion of imports and investment, enhancing competition, and boosting government procurement. Deregulatory steps involve abolition of regulations that directly block foreign access, international coordination of licensing and inspections systems, and simpler application procedures. The measures center on four areas -- housing and land, information and communications, distribution, and financial services and insurance. Under these basic guidelines, the package pledges to devise concrete measures to either abolish or ease government regulations by the end of June. Concerning measures to enhance competition, the package calls for stricter enforcement of the antimonopoly law, issuance of guidelines to bar bid-rigging, and the carrying out of surveys on business practices and price gaps between Japan and other countries. Import and investment measures include the holding of seminars, trade fairs and other information-exchanging opportunities, action programs for fiscal 1994 to offer tax, financial and other incentives, and better use of the office of trade and investment ombudsman. The package also includes Tokyo's voluntary actions to enhance foreign access in three priority areas identified in the framework talks with Washington -- automobile and auto parts, insurance, and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. Japan believes the announcement of its new package will lead to the resumption of the deadlocked trade negotiations sometime in the next three months in hope of reaching an accord at the annual summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations in Naples in July, Takemura said. Tokyo is scheduled to issue a follow-up package before the G-7 summit that will offer more concrete plans for macroeconomic measures. The package offers no specific targets for either cutting the trade surplus or for market access. But it spells out that a government economic forecast indicates the ratio of current account surplus to gross domestic product (GDP) will dwindle from 3.4 percent in fiscal 1992 to 3.1 percent in fiscal 1993 ending Thursday, and to 2.8 percent in fiscal 1994. Asked if this will be taken by the U.S. as a promise by Japan to whittle down its trade surplus to that level, Takemura replied, "we don't regard this as our international pledge." The package also introduces and welcomes plans announced recently by the automobile industry and major automakers to increase purchases of U.S.-made parts to specific amounts.
