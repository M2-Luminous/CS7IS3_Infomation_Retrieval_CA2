The unstable situation in Russia and a reduction in advance stockpiling for allied air support were the central topics at the annual news conference at the Southern Norwegian Defense Command in Stavanger yesterday. Vice Admiral Bjorner Kibsgaard, the commander in chief in southern Norway, said that the result of the Russian parliamentary election points toward a more unstable situation in Russia. He characterized statements made by certain new leaders after the election as blatant ambition. Kibsgaard indicated that in the last two months there has been intense training activity on a Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kusnetsov, but that it will take years for the ship to operate with the planned air strength of Flanker and Frogfoot--NATO terms for Russian aircraft. "The Russian military is undergoing a hefty downsizing, but remains a modern and effective force despite extensive reductions," said Captain Christian Grundt, who is chief of intelligence and security at the Southern Norwegian Defense Command. Since 1992, the standing forces in Russia have been cut to 1.2 million soldiers, but a combat-ready, standing emergency force of 200,000 men is maintained. Training activity has increased in the last year, and there have been 150 sorties along the Norwegian coast as far south as Stavanger. The strategic submarine fleet with nuclear weapons onboard is on maneuvers just as before and moves continually with its nuclear cargo in the Barents Sea. There continues to be a capability ready for use whenever called upon. Parallel with this plan, the NATO countries, with Norway leading, are planning joint exercises in the northern regions, in which Russia would participate. These would not be complex military exercises, but rescue exercises and training aimed at working together in a UN context. The Russians have also adopted a new military doctrine, passed by the Russian security council on 9 November and approved by President Boris Yeltsin. "What is new in the military doctrine is the fact that the Russians state they do not have any declared enemies and that their security goal is to prevent war," said Kibsgaard and stressed that the old political ideology was now gone. Russia promises not to use force against other states unless their nation or other allied nations are targets of aggression. Nuclear weapons are to be regarded as deterrents, and Russia distances itself from first strike with nuclear weapons. Under certain circumstances, Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons. As to its relationship with neighboring countries and former Soviet republics, there is uncertainty with regard to the objectives of the Russian military in protecting Russian interests, which include those in foreign territories. Political Leadership In answer to a question from AFTENPOSTEN as to whether the new military doctrine will lead to stronger political control over the military, Kibsgaard said: "The military power apparatus has a lot of influence, but from what we have seen, the political authorities have control over the military." With regard to the dramatic days in October, the commander in chief felt there was some uncertainty as to whether the Army remained loyal to Yeltsin because they supported him or because they saw their own purposes best served by quelling the uprisings. At present, the defense command is familiar only with the published version of the military doctrine. Kibsgaard felt that it was still too early to comment on possible changes in Russian military strategy.
