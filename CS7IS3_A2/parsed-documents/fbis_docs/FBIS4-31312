Can you compare the state of relations between the two countries at a time of their struggle for independence, and today when these relations are not as idyllic as they used to be four years ago? [Kucan] I cannot see much improvement in our relations. They are simply stagnating. This is a bad thing and does not reflect the fact that we are two countries. It does not reflect our interests and is far below the level of both countries' vital interests. It is true, as you say, that our relations had a far more glittering past, which was more beneficial to both countries. This was at the time of dissociation and our nascent independence when the two countries set their standards of international conduct. These standards were based on the realization that a peaceful way was needed, that arguments were needed, as well as respect for others, that dialogue was needed. All of this facilitates coexistence once it has been established that living together in a shared state is no longer possible. At that time, by these standards, both countries established their recognizable individuality in international relations. They managed to prove the fundamental validity of their decision to exercise their right to self-determination. It is then justifiable to ask: Why are they not capable now of meeting these same standards in their mutual relations? Why has their will decreased? Why do they not find the resolution of these issues a priority? Why do they rather find priorities elsewhere? To some extent we can justify and understand this as a result of the different circumstances surrounding Slovenia, as opposed to those surrounding Croatia. Given both countries' ambitions, I am referring to their European ambitions. It is nevertheless a short-sighted view that the issue of mutual relations are not a priority. Countries that are incapable of resolving their shared issues along European criteria -- without creating difficulties for others and without shifting their responsibility to others -- will not be welcomed by the family of European nations. Among other things, this demonstrates the need to establish first, whether there is a political will to really start resolving these problems. In other words, this is not a matter of parading a nonexistent idyll which is of no use to anyone, but the realization of the true gravity and importance of these problems, which must be geared to resolving conditions along the border. This is something which directly affects peoples' lives. In this context, the economic sphere must also be mentioned, as it directly affects the quality of life in both countries. My principal task during my visit to Zagreb is to find out whether there is such a will on the part of Croatia, something that, in my view, is impossible to do without talking to Mr. Tudjman. [Correspondent] I will mention some outstanding issues: the state border, the Ljubljanska Bank, Krsko nuclear power plant, property relations. In your view, how much are these issues an expression of the real state of affairs, and how much is there a need for both countries to confirm their internationally recognized independence on these issues? [Kucan] Unfortunately, the reality does not allow a strict separation of internal and foreign policies. One is in the service of the other. Each democratic and wise policy has to take into consideration not only the affirmation of the state in the first place, but also whether it is able to organize life in the state in a bearable way, and whether it is able to organize it in such a way that it does not infringe on the equal rights of other states and other nations. The problems that you have just mentioned have been inherited from our life in the former Yugoslav state. In part we are able to resolve them through bilateral talks and negotiations; in part they need to be settled, for principled reasons, within the framework of the succession of the former common state. We should not forget that part of the succession issue is in connection with other states that have been created, or are being created, on the territory of former Yugoslavia. I would not set them out as a condition, that only after these issues have been resolved -- even though I am not underestimating their seriousness -- it would be possible to resolve other issues. The biggest difficulty for Croatia and Slovenia is the decline in economic cooperation. As regards Slovene exports, Croatia is the third economic partner, and as regards imports it is in fourth place, and is declining. Unfortunately, this trend is continuing this year. We can partially justify it with the fact that Croatia lives somewhat according to the logic of a war economy. However, that is not the right answer. Property issues have not been settled, in addition to a series of other things, which in the long run -- at a time when the situation in the Balkans went this way -- are falling to a completely different level of economic exchange [as heard]. This huge decline does not just represent a decline in quantity, but also a decline in the quality of relations. Slovenia has concluded agreements on free trade with Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and an agreement with Poland is being prepared, and as regards the option of concluding such an agreement with Austria -- given its specific nature because of Austria's admission soon into the European Union -- we are thinking about Austria and Croatia. We have only signed a declaration on reaching such an agreement. This is not to mention those that need to be signed, such as the avoidance of double taxation, an agreement on securing investments, which would show good will and an understanding of how much our economies are linked. But for the time being we have not talked about it. [passage omitted] The problems of transition are very complex. Everyone is solving them in line with their specific conditions; what everyone has achieved as regards long-term and wise results. The only way in which it is possible to look at these problems is that each result would have to be a success for all of us. Otherwise, Europe will remain divided, and not just politically. It will also be divided into its developed and underdeveloped economic parts. This is precisely where Croatia and Slovenia should ask themselves where they will find a place in that division, and how much they themselves will be to blame if they remain behind the border signifying the economically underdeveloped part of Europe. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Slovene and Croatian politicians agree that good-neighborly relations require respect for the interests of both sides. To what extent is this commitment being influenced by some radical views held by a certain part of Slovenia's political public? Can they decisively interfere in the creation of far more positive relations between Slovenia and Croatia? [Kucan] Individual radical views certainly do not contribute toward better relations. They do not contribute toward the belief that there is a will to regulate mutual relations, such mutual relations that are based on the equality of both states, on recognition of the principle of justice and mutual benefits in resolving the most sensitive and disputed issues, such as those you have already mentioned. However, an integral part of pluralism and democracy is the peoples' right to express their views and opinions, including the most extremist and most radical ones. The question of state policies is whether to accept these as a fact or to oppose such extremist views with the arguments that a state policy must have. To base a policy on extremist views is, of course, a short-sighted thing. So is basing a state's approach to another state on extremist standpoints. The real force that can change the current strained relations between Croatia and Slovenia is certainly not in the hands of extremists. The real power in Croatia is in the hands of the legitimate bodies of government and parliament, and President Tudjman. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] As far as European integration processes are concerned, we must of course mention relations between Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia, and the Ossimo agreement. Certain political circles in Italy want the agreement to be revised. Can such demands change the EU's [European Union] basic criteria, which are vital for democracy in the EU and all other states, and can they change the EU's relations with Slovenia and Croatia. [Kucan] Slovenia, Croatia, and the entire democratic Europe are justifiably worried by the outcome of the Italian elections. My opinion is that the outcome is an expression of the will of the people of the Republic of Italy. Therefore, this is a fact which we have to accept and respect. What will be the policy of the Italian coalition government, including the neo-fascists? This will be reflected in the government's standpoints and in its specific measures to implement them. This is the only relevant thing when making a political judgment. We base our standpoint solely on this. Any prejudged condemnation or suspicion would be a sign of immaturity in international relations. It is true that Italy has blocked Slovenia's participation in the east-west group negotiations in Warsaw. It is true that it has prevented Slovenia from being one of the nine states discussing a stability pact in Paris. I hope that it will not use its veto to prevent Slovene negotiations with the EU. All these things require an adequate response once they have taken place, a response based on European principles, on the principles which the EU complies with, primarily on the principles of the Helsinki and the Paris declaration, which are the mainstay of the CSCE. Our relations with Italy are formally regulated under the Ossimo treaty. Slovenia insists on being a successor to this treaty, while the Italian Parliament has recognized this. This does not mean that all our relations are regulated or that they are regulated in the best possible way. It is 10 years since these agreements were signed. Some problems which have not been resolved by these agreements or which could be solved better, require good will, mutual trust, and, just like in relations with Croatia, justice and mutual benefits. We cannot tolerate a situation in which unresolved bilateral relations are used as blackmail, for instance as an obstacle, a condition attached to Slovenia's participation in multilateral relations. I do not believe that the EU will tolerate this, either. As far as fascism is concerned, Slovenia is totally explicit in this respect. Some xenophobic and fascist-style phenomena in Slovenia must be met with condemnation on the part of the democratic public. The Slovene people must be aware that in World War II they were on the side of the victorious anti-fascist coalition. It is precisely today that the 50th anniversary of the invasion is being celebrated. Regrettably, Slovenia has been unjustly left out. Slovenia is not there. However, regardless of this, Slovenia's position during World War II in the anti-fascist coalition is the Slovene people's most convincing historic argument in Slovenia's international relations. [Correspondent] As far as the area of former Yugoslavia is concerned, the question inevitably arises of resolving the Bosnia- Herzegovina crisis, the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia. What is your view of the Washington agreement? In your opinion, does it mark the real beginning of the end of the war in this region? [Kucan] First, I would like to say that everything that is going on now is a matter of redressing some initial mistakes and some initial underestimation of the gravity of the reasons behind, first the Yugoslav, and now the Balkan crisis. I believe that as yet no one has a realistic notion of how to solve this crisis as a whole, and of how to turn the Balkans, as an area of permanent instability, into an area of relative stability -- relative in terms of today's stability in Europe. Every contribution, of course, which replaces the military framework of the conflict with a diplomatic search for a solution is welcome and worthy of every effort. From this viewpoint the Washington agreement is also a precious contribution toward ending the war. On the other hand, it shows the futility and absurdity of the military conflict between the Croats and Muslims. In my view, the most damaging consequence of this conflict is the fact that it obscured the true nature of the conflict, that it obscured the identity of the aggressor and what its ambitions were in Bosnia-Herzegovina. You see, the world is not talking about a war waged against Bosnia-Herzegovina, but about the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In other words, it is talking about a civil war, something that is a far easier issue in terms for international politics. Such a policy inflicted a great deal of damage on Croatia, in particular. During my international meetings and talks, I have been protesting against attempts at putting an equals sign between Croatia and Serbia, and their respective motives, ambitions, and goals. I particularly protested, not very long ago, when sanctions against Croatia were being discussed. From this viewpoint, healthy relations between Croatia and Slovenia would considerably reduce this risk. Hence, the Washington agreement is a very important step, but I cannot see it as the last move in resolving the crisis. [Correspondent] The Washington agreement mentions the possibility of setting up a confederation between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and Croatia. Is a new Yugoslav integration possible in this area? [Kucan] No. A confederation between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and Croatia is possible, should both countries be interested in it, be genuinely interested in it, not giving in to the imposed interests of some other states that wish to simplify the situation and change the acute phase of the conflict into a latent one, with the possibility of this latent phase becoming an acute one again. I cannot see any fundamental reasons or arguments for the recreation of a Yugoslav federation, confederation, or association, at least as regards Slovenia. Should it suit other countries that were created or are being created on the territory of former Yugoslavia, Slovenia will raise no objections. That is for them to decide. Slovenia is, by its spiritual, cultural, and civilizational tradition, a central European state. It has European ambitions, as I have already mentioned. They cannot be realized in a package, or with the states of the former Yugoslavia, or with the states of the Visegrad group with which we have developed good cooperation, or with a central European group, but through gradually fulfilling conditions set forth as criteria for making a decision on whether Slovenia fulfils conditions for being admitted to the European Union. Slovenia is immensely interested in cooperating with all states, primarily with its neighbors, with states in central Europe, and also with the states of former Yugoslavia, according to the circumstances, when the war stops there, when the process of transition starts, and when they display the will for joining the European integrations. As part of the search for solutions to the Balkan crisis, all these states need to be given the opportunity to seek prospects in Europe. Their isolation will serve to exacerbate the crisis, and will do nothing for the stability of the region. So, the quality of relations is not to be found in the nature of the association, but is the result of objectively formulated interests and the possibility of realizing these interests on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In other words, the nature of relations will differ considerably from relations in the former common state. They will in no way be different from the nature of Slovenia's relations with other states. This is where our prospects are, and it has nothing to do with any institutional links with the states emerging on the territory of former Yugoslavia, or whether it suits others or not. Slovenia will not oppose any attempt to set up something that is or was similar to the former Yugoslavia. [Correspondent] According to information at our disposal, or rather, according to reports by the Slovene press, there will be no meeting with President Tudjman on the one hand, but on the other you will meet with President Tudjman [as heard]. How much would this meeting contribute toward the efforts to more speedily resolve the existing problems between Croatia and Slovenia? [Kucan] My view is that it is not up to the presidents to tackle specific problems. They must ascertain if there is a political will in both states to resolve the problems of bilateral cooperation. It is sad that there has been no dialogue between us for almost 20 months, despite our agreement on the need for annual meetings. It is also sad that there has been no dialogue at a governmental level. This could lead to the conclusion that, in fact, there is no interest or firm strategy, or idea of what importance both Ljubljana and Zagreb attach to relations between the two states. Responsibility for the failure to tackle issues cannot be laid squarely with one side. Each side must be made aware of its responsibilities. If this was the case, a cement mixer at the border crossing in Plovanija would not be of vital importance for determining the nature of the relations, or for resolving the problems, and for whether we are prepared to resolve them or not. It should not depend on this whether or note I meet with President Tudjman. In other words, under Slovenia's constitutional order, it was normal for me to ask the Foreign Ministry whether, in such circumstances, we should accept the invitation. The Foreign Ministry replied affirmatively. After that, and in view of the unilateral move inside the disputed territory -- and this territory is disputed because Slovenia believes firmly that it is its own -- it was necessary to get the Slovene Government's view. The Government judged the reply by Croatian Prime Minister Valentic as satisfactory, and that the construction work had been discontinued. This was a good reason for testing Zagreb's interests and willingness to cement our relations, and to intensify efforts to resolve our bilateral relations. This is the main task of my visit. This is a working and not a protocol visit. Ahead of me are extensive talks with President Tudjman. As far as I know, he also thinks that time is not the main reason behind the talks, but a need for a profound exchange of views and arguments. I expect us to reach the common conclusion that unilateral moves are not the way toward finding solutions. Sound relations, in particular in the economic sphere, and increased cooperation provide the framework for resolving the problems much easier. However, isolated problems and insistance on tackling them alone reflect a lack of desire to resolve other problems. To what extent such views are wrong and fateful, that is something I have spoken about before. [Correspondent] Mr. President, thank you for the interview.
