Telecooperation and a multimedia datalink are supposed to keep the travelling frenzy within bounds. Albert Noltemeier refuses to accept at least one argument from those opposed to the government's partial move from Bonn to Berlin: "Effective cooperation is also possible over great distances," maintains the expert from the Society for Mathematics and Data Processing (Gesellschaft fuer Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung mbH, GMD) in Sankt Augustin near Bonn. Noltemeier knows what he's talking about. The national research institute itself has long been testing work in "distributed organizations." As early as last summer, the society set up more than 30 teleworkstations at its headquarters in Schloss Birlinghoven and in locations in Darmstadt and Berlin. The datalink functions via telecom's switched broadband network with a bandwidth of 140 megabits per second. The workstations are each equipped with a computer, audio and video accessories, and the necessary applications software. This is testing the future of the "innovative Bonn-Berlin datalink" (Informationsverbund Bonn-Berlin, IVBB), developed for the Federal Ministry of the Interior by the GMD together with partners at universities and in industry. The project bears the name POLIKOM. The term is a combination of the Greek polis (cities) and communication. Prof. Dr. Dennis Tsichritzis, GMD's chairman of the board, sees implementation of the link as an "outstanding opportunity for the exemplary use of cooperation and communication technology in Germany." POLIKOM, for which the federal government will spend at least 120 million marks by 1997, should give Germany a leading position in the area of multimedia technologies. Economic researchers estimate that the market for high speed communication systems will boom. With components for this technology, sales could grow from almost $20 billion to about $55 billion by 1997. US President Bill Clinton declared the national networking of the states with data connections as being among the most important tasks in building up the infrastructure. Total cost: $500 billion over 15 years. Whether or not Clinton can mobilize these gigantic sums in view of pressure to cut costs in the American budget remains to be seen. Germany, however, with Bonn and Berlin as separate seats of government, needs a modern communications link. Industry is also urgently seeking possibilities for faster data transfer. And in a united Europe, it would be almost essential for survival. "European integration will put demands on all forms of government to coordinate and integrate their functions," says Dr. Nigel W. Horne of KPMG Management Consulting in London. However, this sort of cooperation and communication can hardly succeed with today's methods, which, along with telephone and fax, are characterized in particular by automobile, airplane, and train travel. In Great Britain alone, according to a traffic study, job-related car travel amounts to about 170 billion kilometers each year. Depending on the size of the company car, that corresponds to billions of liters of gasoline, which, moreover, are increasingly often frittered away uselessly in traffic jams. Horne is not the only one convinced that "effective communications systems, which reduce the need to travel, can contribute to energy conservation." POLIKOM managers have already outlined a scenario of how that could function: A member of the Bonn Bundestag who wants to lead talks in his district, see how construction is coming along in Berlin, and take part in a committee meeting usually needs two to three days to do it now, suffers a lot of stress, and travels many kilometers. With POLIKOM technology, the representative could manage this all in a single day, largely stress-free and without having to leave his office. Telepresence and telecommunication are the technical terms for this. In the future, says Dr. Josef Schaefer, program manager of the project, telepresence techniques should make it possible "to hold working meetings with participants in different locations using the same databases, transparent presentation media, and with joint work on the same document." That is far more than today's videoconferences already offer. Figure 1. Telepresence: Collaboration hundreds of kilometers apart. [Figure not reproduced] In general, the systems must assure the exchange of information between partners in different locations, facilitate collaboration between widely scattered sites, and support the cooperation of groups over relatively great distances. Through joint viewing of documents, telepointing, and joint editing, mediated by data lines, this should operate as if the coworkers were sitting in a single building on several different floors, as commonly happens today. In telegroup work areas, it must be possible for discussions to take place in which everyone has rapid access to the same archives, records, and documents. Personal teleworkstations should facilitate rapid contact with each other over hundreds of kilometers at any time. In this way, telecooperation, the shared performance and coordination of tasks, should become possible. In POLIKOM, a sort of personal assistant is supposed to organize tasks, manage and monitor deadlines, and perform secretarial duties. Information can be obtained quickly from a multimedia archive. Encoding functions and electronic signatures should provide for data security. Figure 2. Datalink: Multimedia documents from the electronic archive. Features include: decentralized information sources; records and written document management; multimedia archives; organizational knowledge bases and other sources of information; distributed telecooperation workstations; personal files; data switching; network access. [Figure not reproduced] All are functions which are available at least in the early stages today, but which must still be integrated into a whole. In today's prototypes of POLIKOM teleworkstations at the GMD-- cost per workstation about 50,000 marks--some of these functions are already being tested: video-tools, multi-media-mail, an organizational knowledge base, an activity assistant, or the security system SECUDE with chip card terminals for electronic signatures. The technical basis of the system will not only be cheaper in the future, but also considerably more powerful. The most important point however: The systems must be so reliable and easy to use that they are accepted. This is what GMD wants to test in practice. In the Cologne-Bonn area, it is currently working on a project in the area of industrial development. A structural development company, founded in 1991 on the basis of the Berlin resolution, is to insure the future of the region together with several industrial developers--soon supported by multimedia functions and telecooperation.
