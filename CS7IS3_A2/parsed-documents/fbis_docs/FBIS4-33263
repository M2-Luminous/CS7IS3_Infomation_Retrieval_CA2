Three Cubans unsuccessfully tried to break into Mexican Ambassador Carlos Tello Macias' residence located in the exclusive neighborhood of Miramar on Monday afternoon, according unofficial reports. A similar incident took place on Tuesday when four other Cubans tried to break into French Ambassador Jean Raphael Dufour's residence, also located in Miramar, which is west of Havana. In that incident, security guards arrested two men and two others fled. Reports that were later denied of similar incidents in at least four other missions circulated in newspapers this week while the residence of the Belgian ambassador, Paul Vermiersch, continues to be occupied by over 100 Cubans who are trying to leave the country. The building is surrounded by police while the authorities of both governments are holding talks to achieve a peaceful evacuation of the house in exchange for a Cuban offer to refrain from carrying out any reprisals against the asylum seekers.
