Andronov's Publication in the Newspaper ZAVTRA"] [Text] The Russian Federation President's court of appeal for information disputes, having examined the content of several items published in the mass media, television programs, and other information items, considers it necessary to issue the following statement. While Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin has advanced and is implementing the nationwide unifying idea of civil peace and accord, the consolidation of the Russian state on this basis, and the promotion of reforms and democracy -- an idea which is encountering increasing support in society -- some mass media have adopted a drastically destructive stance. The use of rumors, stories, and reports based on unverified facts and leading to the fueling of tragic interethnic conflicts, overt immorality, the groundless and unproven defamation of Russia's institutions of statehood, and as a whole the abuse of freedom of speech have unfortunately become the trademark of several publications and television and radio programs. These items aimed at destabilizing the sociopolitical situation in Russia include I. Andronov's article "Secrets of the Kremlin" published in the newspaper ZAVTRA, issue no. 11 for 16 March 1994. The author tries to discredit, diminish, and hurt the Russian Federation president with profoundly immoral and malicious speculations on the subject of his health and, not spurning the basest methods, is seeking to introduce into the public consciousness the idea that the head of state is an incapable and incapacitated politician. I. Andronov adorned his article with numerous quotations, unfounded and taken out of context, from various sources, mainly foreign ones, and mixed them with rumors and conversations known only to himself, providing the whole with his own unseemly comments. Taking advantage of the fact that the press services of federal state organs do not always promptly cover the work and state of health of Russia's top statesmen and do not promptly deny various insinuations in this field, the author voice completely unfounded speculations, spreads absurd stories, and draws far-fetched historical parallels -- and all this to sow alarm and lack of confidence, to pile up obstacles on the path to civil accord. But for his own highly dubious publicity he uses cock and bull stories which obviously have nothing to do with the author about his importance, the attempts made on his life, and similar "detective thriller" stories. Assessing I. Andronov's item, the court of people realizes that, of course, it is futile to reason with and appeal to the conscience of the editor of a newspaper of the "spiritual opposition," which prints such items. At the same time it would also be wrong to leave them unheeded and unassessed, and that includes the odious item produced by I. Andronov. A legal barrier should be erected against flagrant, shameless, and unjustified attacks on Russia's institutions of statehood and on their leaders and representatives and here ethical values should be used. The court of appeal believes that I. Andronov's article "Secrets of the Kremlin" is an abuse of the free mass media and violates article 4 of the law on the mass media and universally accepted ethical norms and serves as justification for warning the chief editor that the newspaper ZAVTRA could cease publication. The court of appeal is sending its statement to the Russian Federation Committee for the Press for the adoption of the measures stipulated by the law against the newspaper ZAVTRA. [Signed] A. Vengerov, chairman of the court of appeal, 4 April 1994, Moscow.
