Although Japan's market opening package requires further study, it proposes specific ways to reduce the country's trade surplus, increase public investment and advance deregulation, a Foreign Ministry official said. "We evaluate highly the sincere efforts for market opening by the Japanese Government, such as expansion of domestic demand and increasing imports," he said. "We hope that the plan's specific contents will be wrapped up in June and include more concrete and effective opening measures," the commentary said. "And also that such steps by the Japanese Government will improve South Korean entry to the Japanese market and contribute to rectifying the trade imbalance between South Korea and Japan."
