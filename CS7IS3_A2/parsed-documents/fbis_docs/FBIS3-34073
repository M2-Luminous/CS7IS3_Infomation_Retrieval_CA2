He added: The presence of these dear ones in society and in various arenas of the Islamic revolution act as an inspiration to the people and contribute toward reconstruction. He went on: The esteemed families of the martyrs, the devotees, and the war-disabled are regarded as a vast network, which protect the Islamic revolution and its holy and remarkable gains in society. Speaking today on the third day of the auspicious occasion of the Ten Days of Dawn, which is named the day of devotion and martyrdom, and addressing families who have donated more than one martyr, the president went on: You have voluntarily given your dearest assets -- that is, your sons -- to be martyred for the path of God. You are, thus, the best examples of devotion and self-sacrifice. You have proved that nothing is more dear to you than the path of the Islamic revolution and the line of his eminence the imam, may God be satisfied with his deeds. He added: Thanks to the strength given to the Islamic revolution by the martyrs, the devotees, and their families, the Islamic Republic of Iran is stronger and more stable than any other regime in the world, despite today's seditious world and despite so much resentment and hostility against us. Since the families of the martyrs are continuing the path pursued by their dear ones, this system's stability will increase daily. Referring to the fact that the Islamic revolution of Iran has its roots in the hearts of all the members of society and other Muslim and deprived nations of the world, the president said: This revolution is not dependent upon individuals. Those who think that by eliminating certain individuals they can deliver blows to the revolution are mistaken; in the same way that after the passing of his eminence the imam, God's blessings be upon him, which was a great loss for the nation, the esteemed leader, Khamene'i, as a wise and aware leader took the reins of the leadership of this divine nation and decisively and vigorously continues the path and holy aspirations of the founder of the Islamic Republic. He added: As a servant, I always feel indebted to the nobility, dignity, and the comprehensive participation of all the members of the public in all the stages of the Islamic revolution, especially the esteemed families of the martyrs, those missing in action, and the disabled. I hope that in the future I will be able to exert more efforts in helping these people. Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: God has provided the leadership of the revolution and the steadfastness and self-sacrifice of the Iranian people as proofs and guiding lights for history and for those who come after us, so that the people of the world may see God's will with their own eyes and can use it as a model. The president said: Negative propaganda and the expanding nature of the animosity and hatred of world arrogance toward the Islamic revolution have further strengthened and consolidated it inside the country, have encouraged the onlookers outside to make further studies of the amazing dimensions of this historic phenomenon of the present age, and have forced them to review their negative assessment of the Islamic revolution. Praising the sublime status of the martyrs, those missing in action, and the disabled, and the patience and dignity of the members of their honorable families, the president said that by keeping alive the memory of the epic deeds of those beloved ones we will be able to awaken pure consciences. He said: Those acts of self-sacrifice have ensured the future of the revolution and the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The fruits of their self- sacrifice have made it possible that, alongside the efforts for reconstructing and strengthening the economic health of the country, the spiritual foundations of the society will also be further strengthened. According to the Central News Unit report, at the beginning of this meeting, which was also attended by the families of the martyrs of the presidency [as heard], Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Rahimian, the representative of the vali-ye faqih and the head of the Martyrs Foundation, made a short speech in which he expressed his gratitude for God's grace and blessings in removing the danger to the life of the president. Amidst the crushing slogans of the families of martyrs condemning the conspiracies of the enemies and prayers for the health and well-being of the president, Rahimian said: The esteemed members of the families of martyrs and the disabled, through their dignity, piety, and detachment are trying to have an active presence and participation during the period of the reconstruction of the country, as they did during the period of the holy defense, Iran-Iraq war. In these ceremonies, some of the children of the martyrs chanted revolutionary songs.
