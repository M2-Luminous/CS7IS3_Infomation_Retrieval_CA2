FBIS4-45478 "jptdd027__l94056" JPRS-TDD-94-027L JPRS Narcotics 20 May 1994 WEST EUROPE PORTUGAL Cooperation Between Police, Customs in Recent Heroin Bust Cooperation Between Police, Customs in Recent Heroin Bust Lacking 94WD0380A Lisbon PUBLICO in Portuguese 20 May 94 p 55 94WD0380A Lisbon PUBLICO Portuguese CSO [Text] The seizure of over 17 kg of heroin that occurred on Tuesday night at the Portela airport in Lisbon prompted the Criminal Investigations Police [PJ] to issue a communique. The message deplores "the lack of cooperation on the part of the DGA (General Customshouse Directorate) employees, who were unwilling to intervene until PJ agents insisted, and after consultations between the authorities present in the customs inspection area." The communique distributed yesterday also notes that, "the Criminal Investigations Police, after making insistent requests of DGA personnel, who appeared reluctant to start inspecting baggage because it was from a flight originating in European space (Rotterdam)," ended up undertaking the largest heroin seizure made in Portugal this year (17.380 kg). After PUBLICO reported the seizure in yesterday's edition, the heads of the Central Directorate for Narcotics Trafficking Investigation (DCITE) called a press conference at which, besides discussing the criticism of the DGA, reported that another man linked to the trafficking network had been arrested. The fourth person arrested in the course of the operation, called "Clean Channels," is an individual from Porto, to whom the drugs presumably were to be delivered. The first three taken into custody were aged between 18 and 35 years, natives of Cape Verde, who arrived from Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. They were supposed to deliver the heroin to supply the Lisbon and Porto markets, according to a statement made by the PJ's assistant general director, Gabriel Catarino. Sufficient Heroin for 268,000 Doses The same official claimed that the confiscated drugs, with a high degree of purity, would have been possible to distribute in 268,000 doses (the so-called "quarters," each weighing a quarter of a gram). The police expressed concern over the fact that the heroin arrived "poorly packed," possibly indicating "that the traffickers were so sure of not being caught that they didn't even take any great precautions." The drugs, presumably from Turkey, as was later revealed, were stored in four plastic containers, some at the bottom of a suitcase, and another wrapped in a bedspread. The Criminal Investigations Police officials also commented that "agents were at the airport since last Wednesday, watching the flights arriving from Rotterdam," since there had been indications that the three "couriers," all connected with the traffic, were due to unload the drugs in Lisbon. One of the individuals captured at Portela, although he has a fixed residence in the Netherlands, also owned a house in the Lisbon area. A scale with traces of heroin, a grinder, and a portable phone were found on those premises. The Porto resident arrested is another person who was already under suspicion. All four were presented to the judge of the Court of Criminal Proceedings yesterday. The Criminal Investigations Police do not preclude the possibility that further arrests may be made.
