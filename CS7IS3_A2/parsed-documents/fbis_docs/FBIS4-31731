As it is known, the SOC has given the MOC a "three-month deadline to return to the canonic order, and if not, an appropriate church procedure would be initiated." Last Friday [10 June], the Macedonian authorities from the border near Tabanovce, escorted the Vranje bishop of the SOC Pahomie back to Serb territory, who was recently appointed "administrator of the eparchies in Macedonia" by the SOC. His intention was to submit the decision of the Holy Synod of the SOC to the "Skopje and Macedonia metropolitan Mr. Mihail." He also carried a request to the Macedonian border organs to enable the interrupted entrance of the Serbian priests into Macedonia and the uninterrupted execution of their mission and intention -- holding religious services in Serbian language in the Macedonian churches. The decision of the Macedonian authorities not to allow Pahomie to enter Macedonia, created an outburst in Serbia. The media mainly operates with the arguments such as violation of human rights, deprivation of rights, brutal use of force, insulting priests who have come in a "mission of God," etc. A representative of the MOC stated yesterday that the Holy Synod of the MOC did not receive an official announcement from the SOC regarding the arrival of the Vranje bishop Pahomie, nor the message which was supposed to be sent to the Archbishop of Macedonia and Ohrid Mr. Mihail.
