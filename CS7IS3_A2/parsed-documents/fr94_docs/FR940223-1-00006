FR940223-1-00006 FR940223-1-00001 A witness for Avonmore West, a handler under Order 135, testified in support of MCP and urged also that if MCP is adopted, the pricing must recognize the relationship of somatic cells to the true value of protein in the milk. The witness cited the Recommended Decision (57 FR 36536) to adopt MCP in the Ohio Valley, Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania, and Indiana orders. The Recommended Decision in that proceeding adopted MCP for the three orders and included adjustments for somatic cells both in prices paid to producers and in prices paid by handlers. He urged USDA to follow its own lead and adopt adjustments for somatic cells based on the evidence presented at this hearing and the Recommended Decision for the three orders noted above. He contended that if MCP is adopted for Orders 124 and 135 without adjustments for somatic cells, producers with a low somatic cell count in their milk will be subsidizing producers with high somatic cell counts in their milk. The only brief filed on this issue was filed jointly by Darigold, Farmers Cooperative Creamery, and Northwest Independent Milk Producers Association. The brief supported adoption of MCP for both orders and recapped the alternative proposals made at the hearing. The brief concluded that the preferred basis of determining component values (other than butterfat) would be as proposed by NWI, i.e., the Class III price would be based on the Green Bay National Cheese Exchange price. This approach was preferred but the brief also indicated that either the original proposal or the proposal to use the average M&hyph;W component tests as the divisor of the skim value to get the per-pound prices for protein or solids nonfat would be acceptable. However, the brief expresses the view that a somatic cell adjustor for paying producers should not be adopted on the basis of the record in this proceeding. The orders should be amended to provide Class II and Class III milk prices to handlers and payments to producers based on multiple component values. This concept is widely supported and is justified by evidence contained in the hearing record. MCP should be adopted as a step towards improving the way the Federal order translates market values for dairy products into milk prices that indicate to producers how these products are valued in the marketplace. As the record indicates, the current pricing system has, over time, placed a greater share of milk value on the skim portion of milk, and a lesser value on the butterfat portion. Nevertheless, a further recognition of market value as it relates to the value of milk components can be achieved by converting the skim milk value into components, either protein or solids nonfat, on a per-pound basis. As the testimony indicates, it is not sound pricing practice to consider that all skim milk has the same value, regardless of its level of protein or solids nonfat content. The varying values for the components in skim milk can be more properly reflected in handler prices for Class II and Class III milk, and prices to individual producers, if MCP is incorporated into the order. Moreover, incorporating MCP into the orders will tend to insure at least a minimum value of the components for all handlers and producers. This element may be lacking where there are varying premium plans in use in the market, and where perhaps not all producers are involved. Also, providing for MCP in the Federal orders will allow handlers to pay lower prices to producers whose milk tests low for the component other than butterfat. Thus, pricing equity among producers and handlers should be enhanced by adoption of MCP. Another reason for adopting MCP is that, as a pricing system, MCP will improve how well the pricing system in the orders translates consumer preferences into economic signals that indicate to dairy farmers exactly what consumers want. Data presented at the hearing show clearly that, over time, consumers prefer milk products with less fat. Adopting MCP for Orders 124 and 135 will facilitate sending clear signals to producers that consumers want less fat and more protein or solids nonfat in their dairy products. Clearly, the vast majority of the milk pooled in these two markets is used for Class II and Class III uses. In the Pacific Northwest market, almost two-thirds of the milk pooled annually in 1989, 1990, and 1991 was classified in Classes II and III combined; and the percentage is increasing, going from 62.51 for 1989 to 64.47 percent for 1991. In the Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon market, over 80 percent of the total milk pooled in the years 1989 through 1991 was used in Class II and Class III products. As proposed, MCP for Order 124 will utilize a solids nonfat component and MCP for Order 135 will utilize a protein component. Not only will such pricing plans recognize that these markets utilize most of their milk in Class II and Class III uses, they also will recognize the particular principal dominant product manufactured from surplus milk supplied in each market. Moreover, the use of protein as the second component in Order 135 will make the provisions of that order more compatible with provisions of the neighboring Great Basin Order.
