No decision has been made, said the official, who declined to be identified, adding it will take some time to review the unsuccessful conclusion of bilateral framework trade talks. The administration plans to hold an interagency meeting as early as Monday to discuss what to do following the talks, he said. He was commenting on a WASHINGTON POST report Saturday. The paper quoted U.S. officials as saying one option would be to announce Tuesday an intention to impose penalty duties on selected Japanese products if it is decided that a 1989 agreement to open the cellular telephone market to the U.S. firm Motorola Inc. has been violated.
