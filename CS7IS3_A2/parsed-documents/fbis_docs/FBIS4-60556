The symposium issued a statement saying that the national symposium's pledge of allegiance to brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman, is a sincere pledge for the command of the battle for unity, for confronting secession, and for the march toward entrenching security and stability, and building a united Yemen which rejects partition, fragmentation, and the relinquishment of any inch of its territory--the Yemen of brotherhood, tolerance, and love. The symposium reiterated absolute condemnation and complete rejection of al-Bid's secessionist declaration and emphasized confrontation of the secessionists led by the traitor of the homeland, revolution, and nation, 'Ali Salim al-Bid. The statement appealed to the Socialist Party leadership, cadres, and broad base which believe in unity and the homeland, to move fast and align with people's masses and political and national forces to face the threat and protect unity and constitutional legitimacy, and bury the crime of secession for ever. The statement warned all states and regional and international organizations of the danger of dealing with the secessionist clique and said that the entire Yemeni people will regard such dealing as a flagrant hostile act against every Yemeni citizen and an interference in the internal affairs of the Republic of Yemen. The statement appealed to our Arab brothers and friends in the world, and all good men to rally round the Yemeni people, unity, progress, and stability.
