We are here with Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, who is playing a tennis match teamed up with Dr. Miguel Silva against Ambassador Alberto Casas and Counselor Ricardo Avila. Are you winning, Mr. President? [Menem] We were at deuce, so we will have to continue to play. [De La Rosa] Mr. President, regarding the surprise speech by Cuban President Fidel Castro at the convention center yesterday afternoon, as well as the subsequent remark he made as he was riding in a car -- something to the effect of: We are divided -- what is your opinion on this? [Menem] I would say there are different concepts of democracy. One is the one understood by free countries in which the people elect their representatives. There are no barriers, no penalties, and no prohibitions on leaving one's territory or on stating one's opinion -- places in which there are no political prisons, persecution, or torture. The other form of democracy is that which Commander Fidel Castro understands. He gets angry, speaks out melodramatically regarding the situation in Cuba, and I say this with all respect due to the commander. Only one thing is to blame for the crisis Cuba is facing, and it is this: As long as Cuba does not live in democracy, and as long as it does not return to a way of life common to other countries in America and in the world, it will be very difficult for our positions to agree. I have been a victim of the tyranny of a dictatorship. I was virtually an outlaw in my own country for 25 years. I spent five years in prison. I know what it is like to be tortured, what the punishment cells entail. I know that my companions suffered greatly during the years when the killings occurred. Nobody can tell me or teach me anything about that, not even the commander, who was never in prison. Moreover, there is no indication that the situation in Cuba will change. This is something that is entirely up to him. This is why I do not see any sense in the melodrama he is making of the Cuban situation, blaming it on the U.S. blockade imposed solely, I would say, by the United States. Other countries are trading and, in fact, bringing capital into Cuba. The measures and controls are so strict, however, that they discourage any type of investment. This is the truth. [De La Rosa] President Menem, this melodrama that you speak of by Fidel Castro, couldn't it complicate things for Latin American integration? [Menem] No, no, no. I am familiar with integration processes in other parts of the world in which countries that disagree with circumstances that prevail in a region or on a continent cannot integrate with the other nations of the region. They do not enter into the free zone until their plans and proposals change. If we live in a democracy, one has to follow the steps of the majority -- not only the majority at the state level, but also the majority at the level of the people. [De La Rosa] Commander Castro noted that he was hurt yesterday afternoon by a lack of solidarity from the Latin American countries against the U.S.-imposed blockade against the island. [Menem] I do not believe it is a lack of solidarity. I reiterate that many countries of the world are commercializing and taking their production to Cuba, as well as working with Cuba over these past few years. For instance, in 1974 the Argentine Republic under the presidency of General Peron broke the U.S. blockade and assisted Cuba with resources, products, and foodstuffs to the point that ever since then, and subsequent to the many contributions that were made, Cuba owes Argentina more than $1 billion. The commander, should then speak of this reality, which we Argentines know of very well. [De La Rosa] Are the Ibero-American countries divided then, as the Cuban president stated informally? [Menem] I do not think they are divided, just the opposite. We are all asking Commander Castro to give respite to the Cuban people -- to leave them in a position to exercise their rights. We are speaking of the defense of human rights. We are speaking of life. We are speaking of liberty. Obviously these things are nonexistent in Cuba. [De La Rosa] President Menem, thank you for suspending your tennis match to give an interview to Caracol Network. Dario, do you have any questions? [Arizmendi] Yes, of course. We are pleased to greet President Carlos Saul Menem again, after interviewing him exactly one year ago for Colombian television. Mr. President, if the Cuban president does not change his position regarding the concept of democracy, as it is understood in Western terms, is there a possibility that he will not be invited to future summits? [Menem] No, no. The commander is always going to be invited. Now, Dario, I do not understand the distinction that you just made -- Western style democracy. I believe there is only one democracy. Everyone participates in that democracy. Democracy is created when people elect their representatives and when the representatives govern for the people. There is only one kind of democracy, and not the kind maintained by Fidel Castro. It so happens that not too many years ago Chilean President Pinochet said his dictatorship was a democratic one. In other words, there are different concepts of democracy, but there is only one kind of democracy. [Arizmendi] President Menem, you have been, perhaps, one of the most principled presidents, and your attitude regarding all types of dictatorship has been well-known to the public for some time. When you meet Cuban President Fidel Castro, how do you greet one another? Is there any kind of warmth or cordiality, or is there distance between you? [Menem] No, there is cordiality, and there is fluid dialogue, but we do not speak of politics or anything related. We were talking yesterday about the place where I was born, what we do there, what my family's activities are, whether my family has vineyards, and if my family makes wine. I explained several things to him regarding my hometown in a province in the northwestern region of the Argentine Republic. We did not broach politics at all. Those things have to be discussed publicly. They have to be treated as we have been treating them since the Guadalajara summit. The commander also, publicly, has referred to his form and style of government, and his references are common to those of any dictatorship, or at least any kind of government outside democracy.
