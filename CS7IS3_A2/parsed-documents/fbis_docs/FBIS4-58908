FBIS4-58908 "drnes089dd_94002" FBIS-NES-94-089 Daily Report 7 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Entry of Police Delayed Entry of Police Delayed NC0805054494 Paris AFP in English 2237 GMT 7 May 94 NC0805054494 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, May 8 (AFP) -- The Palestinian police deployment in the Gaza Strip, scheduled to start on Sunday [8 May], has been delayed again, Palestinian sources said here late Saturday. They said "technical reasons" were to blame for the delay in the arrival of hundreds of policemen from the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, but declined to elaborate. Some 300 policemen left Cairo for the Rafah crossing earlier Saturday, a day after Palestinian general Ziyad al-Atrash announced here that the Gaza deployment would start Sunday after a delay of several days. But Palestinian officials in Amman, meanwhile, said hundreds more policemen were to cross Sunday from Jordan into the West Bank for deployment in the other self-rule area, Jericho. However, the Israeli news agency ITIM said no deployment was expected in Jericho Sunday as the Palestinians had failed to coordinate their arrival with the Israeli army, it said. The police were due to arrive in Gaza, ITIM said, quoting military sources. Under the autonomy deal signed Wednesday between the PLO and Israel, 9,000 Palestinian policemen are to be deployed in Jericho and the Gaza Strip to take charge of security as the Israeli army pulls out. However General Dany Rothschild, coordinator of Israeli activities in the occupied territories, complained Saturday that the Palestinians were not ready to take over their new responsibilities. "If the transfer of civilian powers in the autonomous zones does not take place in an orderly fashion, the situation on the ground will deteriorate," he said. "We still don't have anybody to hand these powers to." He detected a change in the Palestinian stand. "Up until a few days ago, the word from them was: `Give us the keys and leave. We'll sort it out.' Their calls for help are now more frequent and they're starting to realize the size of the task," said the general. On the Israeli side, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is to present the self-rule accord he signed last week with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat for parliament's approval on Wednesday, parliamentary sources said.
