FR940816-2-00063 FR940816-2-00048 National Institutes of Health Meeting; Forum on Cooperative Research and Development Agreements Notice is hereby given that a second Forum on Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), convened as an ad hoc group of consumer consultants to the Advisory Committee to the Director, NIH, will meet in public session on September 8, 1994, from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm, at the Bethesda Marriott, 5151 Pooks Hill Road, Bethesda, Maryland, 20814. This Forum is convened in follow-up to a previous Forum on this topic July 21, 1994. The purpose of the second Forum is to elicit consumer and other public interest perspectives which will be used in NIH's development of policy on the ``reasonable pricing'' clause, which is currently required in its Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) under the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and exclusive commercialization licenses. The Forum Panel members will discuss how best to ensure that the public investment in products developed through licensing NIH technologies is adequately reflected. Discussion will include an analysis of the clause and the Panel will advise on whether the clause has been useful to ensure that the public investment in collaborative research is adequately considered in the subsequent commercial development of technology arising under such research. At the conclusion of the Forum, the Panel will develop and transmit its report to the Advisory Committee to the Director, NIH, for review. Concerned organizations and individuals are invited to present their views at the Forum or submit written views of any length to the Panel. Please submit requests for a 5 minute presentation time, or written views to: Ms. Elyssa Tran, Office of Science Policy and Technology Transfer, National Institutes of Health, Building 1, Room 218, 9000 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20892, (301) 402&hyph;0280 (fax). Written views submitted by September 1 will be distributed to the Panel. Comments and questions related to the proposed Forum may also be addressed to Ms. Tran at (301) 496&hyph;1454. Dated: August 8, 1994. Ruth Kirschstein, M.D., Deputy Director, NIH. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19940 Filed 8&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4140&hyph;01&hyph;P
