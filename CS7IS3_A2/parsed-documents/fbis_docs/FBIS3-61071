According to American military sources, its Washington correspondent reported today that last year's testing of a nuclear devise in the PRC was directly linked to this work being carried out by Chinese missile experts, which has allegedly entered the final stage. The experts believe that the Soviet-built SS-24 and SS-25 strategic missiles, which have an operating range on the order 10,000 kilometers, served as the prototype for a new type of delivery vehicle. It is their opinion that the nuclear device exploded at the Chinese test range near Lob Nor lake in October 1993 was nothing other than one of the warheads which make up the missile's multiple reentry vehicle, and that it had a force on the order of 90 kilotons. The newspaper reports that the product of the Chinese missile experts may be capable of carrying 8-10 nuclear warheads aimed at various targets.
