Alfredsson: "Center Party Congress Supports Party Leader Johansson"] [Text] Falun -- Olof Johansson has the support of his party. This was made clear when the Center Party congress in Falun was yesterday given the opportunity to discuss the political situation after the maneuverings around the Oresund bridge -- and on this issue there was no debate. Bengt-Ake Berg from Jonkoping County was a voice crying in the wilderness when he declared that he feels concern about where the Center Party is going. When he joined the party 20 years ago the Center Party had 25 percent of voters behind it. Today support has shrunk to a quarter of this figure. "Perhaps we should do what our fellow Centrists in Norway did, when they found themselves in the same situation -- that is, leave the government," Berg wondered. No one took him up on this. Instead Per-Ola Eriksson, Andreas Carlgren, Rolf Kenneryd, and Michael Artursson set the tone by praising Olof Johansson in quick succession and asserting that both he and the party have acted completely correctly. "I think that we should be proud to have a party leader who demonstrates that politics means something," Artursson said to warm applause. As he put it himself, Olof Johansson only wanted to add a few "footnotes" to what is contained in the Center Party's election platform. He also wanted to clarify his reply the other day when he was asked whether he can envisage ruling together with the Social Democrats. The election platform remains firm, the Center Party leader assured his audience. This means that the Center Party is striving for a nonsocialist majority with increased influence for Center Party policies. There is no other "objective" in this fall's election. Since both the political and the economic situations are a little "unstable" it might be wise not "to go around ruling things out," Olof Johansson declared. That was what he had wanted to say in his remark about not ruling out cooperation with the Social Democrats. "We must talk about what we want. We must be clear when it comes to our election platform, but we must not rule out different options. But this does not mean a greater desire to work with the Social Democrats, for example, on an objective foundation. Nothing has changed on this point." In the light of recent events Johansson himself has "not found any reason to make even a single correction, to change a single comma" in the election platform. On the subject of the Oresund bridge he told the congress yesterday that "the bridge was more important than an intact government for three of the present government's parties: They had a very clear choice. Our view was no secret. They knew what it was."
