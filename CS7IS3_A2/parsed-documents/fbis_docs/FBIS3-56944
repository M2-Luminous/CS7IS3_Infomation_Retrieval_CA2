The foreign ministers were unanimous in their opinion that the conflict, started many years ago, cannot be resolved through the use of force and should be settled as soon as possible with the mediation of the Russian Federation by political means, by means of talks. Russia, as a mediator, is seeking to bring the stands of both participants in the conflict closer together and to persuade them to sign immediately a ceasefire agreement, Galina Sidorova, political adviser to the Russian foreign minister, told ITAR-TASS after the end of the meeting. The talks are rather complicated, because the conflict is a long one, many problems have been accumulated in relations between the two sides, and they feel mistrust for each other, Sidorova said. Russia is doing its utmost for the agreement on the end of armed confrontation and prevention of destabilisation of the situation in the whole region to be signed as soon as possible, she stressed. According to Sidorova, "now it is difficult to say when the two sides will sit down at the negotiating table, to what extent a possibility of holding meeting by them has become more real. There is a draft agreement, and now it is necessary to bring the stands of the two sides closer together," she said. Kozyrev discussed settlement problems also with Arkadiy Gukasyan, spokesman for the Nagorno-Karabakh leadership. Last Tuesday the Russian foreign minister had a meeting with Azeri Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov within the framework of a programme of working consultations.
