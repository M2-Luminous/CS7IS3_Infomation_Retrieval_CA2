Kazakhstan is a foreign country now. However, on the basis of an agreement, field training exercises are held here just like during the past decades. General designers use these exercises to perfect air defense systems. [video shows air defense systems being fired] Modern Russian air defense systems are superior to foreign ones in terms of multiplicity of channels [kanalnost], protection [zashchishchennost], mobility, and kill probability. So for example, at a recent exercise, the Buk-M1 system scored 30 hits of the most modern air targets with 31 missiles. The air defense men did not disappoint us on this occasion either. Not a single missile missed its target. And that despite the fact that the battery was manned by only two privates instead of the statutory 16.
