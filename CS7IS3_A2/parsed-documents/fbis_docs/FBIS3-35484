A MENA correspondent in Baghdad has learned that negotiations have been going on behind the scenes between representatives of several international oil companies, particularly Western and U.S. companies and Iraq, to exploit the Majnun oilfields in southeast Iraq, which are known to hold the biggest oil reserves in the world. The correspondent has learned from oil experts in Iraq that Iraq prefers the French to the Western and U.S. companies because it believes that the French stance on the embargo imposed on Iraq has recently changed, especially at the Security Council. Observers base this view on a statement made by Dr. Riyad al-Qaysi, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry under secretary, in which he referred to the change in the French stance during a news conference he held with UN team leader Rolf Ekeus earlier this month. A responsible UN source in Baghdad told MENA's correspondent that these oil talks are not regarded as a violation of UN resolutions. Iraq has 110 billion barrels of crude oil--the second largest oil reserves in the world. The Majnun oilfields have 50 billion barrels of proven and unproven oil reserves in the so-called "al-Rumaylah rectangle," which extends from south Iraq to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and some parts of southwest Iran. This field was one of the reasons the eight-year Iraqi-Iranian war erupted.
