Although initial discussions had centered around the figure of Fr3 billion, the aeronautics firm (60 percent owned by the state, 20 percent by Credit lyonnais, and 20 percent by a public holding company, SOGEPA) said it was satisfied with the decision. "The state shareholder's decision will enable Aerospatiale to take full advantage of the market's gradual recovery, notably through such new programs as the Airbus A-330 and A-340," the ministers commented in a communique. The aeronautics industry has been hard hit by the slump in sales, and the Fr2 billion in government funds will bring a much-needed injection of oxygen. In 1993, Aerospatiale faced "abominable" civil markets, "stable" military ones, and "fairly good" demand for space products and services, said its CEO Louis Gallois when he presented the group's results on 5 January. This forced the manufacturer to cut back employee hours and eliminate 1,145 jobs, including 500 in its Eurocopter subsidiary, in 1993. Aerospatiale's deficit reached Fr2.38 billion, and the company expects to break even again in 1995 at the latest. The Fr2 billion in fresh capital should enable the company to pursue the reduction of its debt, which it trimmed from Fr16 to 13 billion over the last two years, and to increase its equity, which now totals Fr6 billion. The cash should also help Aerospatiale expand its programs, several of which--both civil and military--the manufacturer is now studying with its European partners. Examples include the Ariane 5 rocket, the Tiger NH-90 and C-120 helicopters, the ATR-82, the Airbus A-319, the proposed FLA military transport plane, and Airbus A-330-340 spinoffs. Aerospatiale announced in January that it was considering allowing capital investments by outside partners, either this year or in 1995, provided that the state remained majority shareholder.
