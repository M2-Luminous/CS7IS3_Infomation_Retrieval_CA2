The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Defense Army press service reported that after a brief lull in fighting at night, the Azerbaijani troops resumed their attacks today in the direction of Gadrut, Agdam, and Askeran under the cover of fierce artillery shelling of Karabakh's defensive positions. Having massed large forces on the front, the enemy is trying at all costs to breach Karabakh's positions in these sectors. NKR Defense Army subunits are succeeding in halting the numerically superior Azerbaijani troops. Nevertheless, the Azerbaijanis moved forward in the southern sector on the evening of 5 January. The battles are also continuing with alternating success in the north, near Matagis in Mardakertskiy Rayon, where in recent days the Karabakh forces have managed to push back the enemy to its initial positions. The battles were still continuing on all the aforementioned sectors at 1100 today. Both sides are suffering losses. Information gathered from radio interception indicate that during the attacks the Azerbaijanis used assault detachments of foreign mercenaries, most of them from the CIS countries.
