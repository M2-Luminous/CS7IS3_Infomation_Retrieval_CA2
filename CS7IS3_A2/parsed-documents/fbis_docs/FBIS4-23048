Although this process has been used to produce an entire series of industrial paints varnishes, these products are somewhat inadequate in physical mechanical properties and resistance to organic solvents. These shortcomings are commonly overcome by modifying the silicon-organic film formers with organic polymers. Although this improves the physical mechanical properties, it also reduces the heat resistance of the products. Other ways to overcome this problem include improving structural ordering in the synthesized silicon-organic film formers by heterofunctional condensation of structurally organized oligomers, although this had limited success. In the present work a study was made of the synthesis of silicon-organic film formers using sodium oxyorganoalkoxysiloxanes. These universal reagents provide a new level for ordering structural organization of oligomers. This new approach may be used to develop production of a new generation of silicon-organic film formers. Figures 2; references 8 (Russian).
