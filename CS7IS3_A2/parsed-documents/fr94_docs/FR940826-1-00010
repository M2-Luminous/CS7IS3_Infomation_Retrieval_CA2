FR940826-1-00010 FR940826-1-00001 The NFO witness testified that even though they would like to see a $1.00 Class II differential, a 50-cent level should be sufficient, provided that the add-back be retained to maintain the intent that Class II prices be equal to or above Class III prices. If the differential level were set at $1.00, the NFO witness testified that this would negate the need for an add-back because of the unlikelihood that the Class III price would exceed the Class II price. In their brief, the NFO revisited past decisions that affirmed the establishment and intended role of the add-back provision. The NFO reasserted that the add-back provides reinforcement to the principle that Class II prices by definition should not be less than Class III prices. The culprit in the volatility of Class II prices, according to NFO, is the basic Class II formula price and not the add-back. However, NFO did acknowledge that the add-back does play a role, albeit a minor one, in Class II price volatility. Opponents to retaining the add-back provision argued in submitted briefs that it should be eliminated for a number of reasons. All opponents agreed that if the Class II milk pricing method adopts using the second preceding month's basic formula price and adding a fixed differential, then the add-back can only serve to enhance the Class II price. The SFG/AE brief dismisses concern that producers won't deliver milk for Class II use if the Class II price falls below the Class III price. In addition to this not happening in the marketplace, SFG/AE points out, it is also a function of when the price is announced. Producers don't know until the month is over that the Class II price was below the Class III price. Therefore, no purpose beyond price enhancement is served by an add-back provision. This theme is further developed in a brief filed on behalf of Friendship. While CMPC views a ``loss'' to producer revenues without retaining the add-back, there is in effect no ``loss'' Friendship argues. Class II prices below Class III prices arise only during months in which the cheese-driven M&hyph;W price is increasing, said Friendship. In periods of falling M&hyph;W prices, the Class II differential will exceed the target differential. Producers will not be denied the benefit of the Class II differential_rather its payment is delayed by two months, they said. In periods of M&hyph;W price volatility, the fact that Class I and Class II differentials would be added to the M&hyph;W prices for the second preceding month will actually serve to restrain, they said, the extent to which such volatility is reflected in producer prices. Further, the Friendship brief finds it inconsistent to call Class II prices below Class III prices a ``loss'' because it is not balanced against any concept of gain or a ``pay-back'' in months of a declining M&hyph;W and the effective Class II differential at windfall levels above the M&hyph;W. It is clear from the record that there is universal endorsement for changing how Class II milk is priced under Federal orders. The record supports the conclusion that the basic Class II price formula that ``updates'' the second preceding month's M&hyph;W in establishing the Class II price is not functioning as intended; is no longer necessary and contributes, in part, to price volatility; and results in a distorted relationship with other class prices. The record is also clear on the unanimous support for retaining the advance-pricing of Class II milk and that the Class II price should be announced at the same time as Class I prices by using the second preceding month's M&hyph;W price and adding a fixed differential. The only issues of disagreement regarding Class II milk pricing are what is the appropriate Class II differential and whether or not the ``add-back'' provision should be retained. Class II Differential Most handlers and producers agree that the appropriate differential value for Class II milk is at least thirty cents above the Class III price. The record testimony and evidence supports this conclusion on the basis that this differential value is representative of the additional value of milk used in this class; that it has been the effective differential paid for Class II milk on average since 1987; and that handlers regularly pay over-order premiums to secure milk for Class II uses above and beyond the service feature of over-order premiums.
