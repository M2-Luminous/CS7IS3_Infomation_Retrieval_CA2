Develops High Strength, Low Heat Conductivity/Expansion Reaction Sintering SiN 94FE0282A Tokyo NIKKEI MATLS & TECHNOLOGY in Japanese Dec 93 pp 16-17 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0282A Tokyo NIKKEI MATLS & TECHNOLOGY Japanese CSO [Text] Isuzu Ceramics Research Corporation (ICRC, Fujisawa City, Kanagawa Prefecture), an R&D subsidiary of Isuzu Motors Ltd., has developed an Si-N-Al-Ti-O-based structural ceramic material (silicon-nitrogen-aluminum-titanium-oxygen) with high bending strength, low thermal conductivity, and a low thermal-expansion coefficient. This ceramic material, a reaction-sintered product of a mixture of silicon nitride (Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]) and aluminum titanate (Al[.sub]2[/]TiO[.sub]5[/]), was developed to be used for automotive engine components. In energetic pursuit of the development of ceramic-made adiabatic diesel engines, ICRC was trying to simultaneously achieve three desirable physical properties for a ceramic material to be used for the combustion chamber of an adiabatic engine. The properties were high strength, low thermal conductivity to manifest excellent heat-insulation capacity, and a low thermal-expansion coefficient to discourage the generation of thermal stress due to repeated heating and cooling. Previously, zirconia (ZrO[.sub]2[/])-based, partially stabilized zirconia, and aluminum titanate (Al[.sub]2[/]TiO[.sub]5[/]) were used to test-produce combustion chambers of ceramic, adiabatic diesel engines, to maintain the high adiabatic nature of the chambers. However, the zirconia-based material had not only a large thermal-expansion coefficient, but also a high density of 9 g/cm[.sup]3[/]; whereas aluminum titanate was poor in bending strength (four-point bending) at 30-40 MPa. After a search for new ceramics that had the desired, specific physical properties, ICRC zeroed in on reaction-sintered silicon nitride, which had a relatively low thermal conductivity of 16 W/m K (after correction to a solid portion only) bkecause of its high concentration of pores. In addition, according to Mr. Hidenori Kita, Chief Researcher in Material Research Department, ``silicon nitride was found to be made with wide-ranging properties depending on the type and the quantity of a sintering aid.'' Furthermore, reaction-sintered silicon nitride appeared to be a promising ceramic material with high bending strength. ICRC tested aluminum titanate, alumina silicate (Al[.sub]2[/]SiO[.sub]13[/]), lanthanum oxide (La[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]) and cerium oxide (ceria, CeO[.sub]2[/]) as a potential sintering aid to be added to reaction-sintered silicon nitride, because these compounds had been known to reduce thermal conductivity. One of these sintering aids was added to microfine silicon (Si) powder with a particle size range of 5-10 �m, and the blended powder was press-molded to form a green compact, which was subjected to reaction-sintering by heating in a nitrogen (N[.sub]2[/]) atmosphere. In principle, the nitrification reaction proceeds from the surfaces of silicon particles inward, and reaction-sintered silicon nitride is produced when the nitrification is completed through the core of each particle. No shrinkage occurs during the sintering process, because the green compact made of silicon powder is nitrified. As a result, the dimensions of the sintered compact are exactly the same as that of the green compact. Thus, it is possible to fabricate near-net-shape products by the above method, although the sintered compact has many pores because of no shrinkage. The above-mentioned group of sintering aids was narrowed down to two, aluminum titanate and alumina silicate, based on their capabilities to drastically decrease thermal conductivity and to maintain strength after the oxidation treatment for densifying sintered compacts. Subsequently, aluminum titanate was selected over alumina silicate based on the bending strengths, thermal conductivities, and the absolute values of thermal expansion coefficients. It was found that the thermal conductivity of the compact was lowest when 35-wt-percent aluminum titanate was added, and any further addition of the aid rather increased the thermal conductivity. It was also found that the thermal conductivity of the reaction-sintered compact containing 35-wt-percent aluminum titanate was further decreased after it was subjected to a post-sintering oxidation treatment. Based on experimental results, the maximum effect of reducing the thermal conductivity was achieved when the oxidation treatment was carried out at 800�C. The reaction-sintered compact containing 35-wt-percent aluminum titanate had a structure, in that aluminum titanate crystal-rich ceramic parts (with an average size of 20-30 �m) were dispersed in a sintered cluster of silicon nitride crystal grains with an average size of 1 �m. When this compact was oxidized at 800�C, titanium nitride (TiN), which had been formed by the nitrification of titania (TiO[.sub]2[/]) and is a component of the complex oxide of aluminum titanate, was oxidized back into titania. Since titania was less thermally conductive than titanium nitride, the entire compact became less conductive. After the oxidation treatment, the aluminum titanate-rich core portions were found to have high concentrations of alumina (Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]), and the peripheral areas were made of a mixed phase of alumina and titania. Mr. Kita conjectures that this oxidation-formed structure consisting of multiple layers of different compositions ``decreases the thermal conductivity because the structure impedes heat flow by scattering heat-transmitting phonons.'' However, the heating required for the oxidation treatment tends to diffuse the constituent elements of the ceramics, and the porosity is reduced to 20+ percent, which in turn reduces the volume fraction of ``void'' that is supposed to function to keep the thermal conductivity of the entire ceramic material low. As a result, the thermal conductivity increases. Thus, the oxidation treatment conditions were determined based on the balance between an advantage of lower thermal conductivity resulting from the multiple-layer structure and a disadvantage of higher thermal conductivity resulting from the decreased porosity. Incidentally, the newly developed, reaction-sintered, silicon nitride-based ceramic material showed a bending strength (four-point bending) of 125 MPa, a vertical elastic modulus of 75 GPa, and a density of 2.3 g/cm[.sup]3[/]. In addition, the key property of thermal conductivity of this material was 2.6 W/m/K at room temperature, 2.3 W/m/K at 540�C, and 2.4 W/m/K at 800�C; its thermal expansion coefficient was excellent at 3.1 10[.sup]-[/]6/�C; and its anti-heat shock strength was �538�C. It is conjectured that the excellent mechanical properties of this material, including the bending strength, were attained as a result of the precise size control for silicon nitride crystal grains to approximately 1 �m.
