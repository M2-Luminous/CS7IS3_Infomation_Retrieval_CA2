This makes it the first topic in this interview. What new methods are there to confront the blockade against our people at this stage, particularly if it continues for a long time? Is there any new concept for confrontation on the local, Arab, and international levels? [Ramadan] Much has been said about the blockade from the day it was imposed on Iraq before the military aggression. The way this blockade was implemented and applied and the way it was followed up demonstrates the intentions of the powers that imposed it. Today it is more obvious than was the case two years ago; more obvious than was the case on the first day that imposing and following up the blockade had nothing to do with what they claimed; namely, the issue of Kuwait. When we view the details and nature of the dealing between the American United Nations and Iraq, it becomes clear that the imposition of the blockade was aimed at stopping the stage of Iraq's awakening which forms the beginning of the Arab nation's awakening. Had Iraq's stand been confined to the Iraqi region, the proportion of dealing with it would not have been on that level of bestiality. However, they are aware that any awakening in Iraq will serve the Arab nation no matter how they deepen differences and expand boundaries and parochialism. The Arabs will certainly reject this because they believe that whatever happens in Iraq reflects on them positively or negatively. The Arabs have expressed this in many meetings and activities in Iraq and the Arab world despite the pressures put on them by certain governments and regimes. These stands have vividly demonstrated that our Arab nation is one, that our Arab people are one people with the same fate, that the blockade's aims are now clear; namely, they are not linked to Kuwait. The blockade is a struggle between the nation's awakening in confronting its enemies on the one hand and those who have vested interests in continuing hegemony over and exploiting its capabilities and various resources on the other. Therefore, it is the duty of each Iraqi and Arab to confront this condition. The Iraqi leadership, especially President leader Saddam Husayn, has never been under any illusion that the blockade would be lifted when the enemy slogan, which they had claimed was the cause of their action, disappeared. The blockade will erode and wither away by building the society's own resources and will be completely lifted when the criminal enemies realize that it is impossible to achieve the aims for which they imposed this blockade on Iraq. Any observer of Iraq's march, particularly after the cease-fire will clearly see that the progress achieved in Iraq was an expression of the slogan of building self-reliance leading to the blockade's erosion. A great deal has been achieved in the field of returning life to normal and building the pillars of renaissance in terms of quantity, quality, and originality. The efforts that were exerted cannot be compared with those exerted in various stages of building in the past, despite the fact that we had enormous material resources then. The result of this is that the international position toward Iraq is not as unanimous as it was three or two years ago -- despite the fact that you still hear statements about blockade made in different accents, you no longer hear the single voice. Why? It is not because these parties are now feeling guilty about their previous positions on Iraq. It is because the Iraqis rose to the level of the battle and these parties realized that they will definitely not gain even the minimum amount of the benefits they thought they could gain from the blockade. The states that have helped, and are helping, drag out the blockade will be sorry because they have lost a great deal of their interests with Iraq. This is not just an interpretation, but a fact. So many of these states have begun to speak publicly about their material and economic losses that resulted from the blockade imposed on Iraq. Why has this happened? If Iraq disintegrated or collapsed or if a foreign power was imposed on it, we would not have heard what we are hearing in various countries of the world. This contradiction will grow further in the future and will undoubtedly lead to the deterioration of the blockade, leaving in disgrace every one that contributed to it, regardless of the motives and reasons of this or that country. As for the confrontation on the local, Arab, and world front, changes are interconnected. Any development in Iraq's power, responsibilities, and ability to stand fast will reflect on the Arab and international levels. We say that 1994 is an important year and not like any other year of the blockade. The Mother of Battles has produced several facts and exposed the reasons and objectives of the blockade, as well as the enemy intentions. What Iraq has offered to the United Nations and its cooperation with it have deprived the real conspirators and those who were dragged by them of many cards. This is especially the case following the Iraqi position toward Resolution 715. We tell the United Nations and any other international party that they are responsible for the continued blockade. There is no justification for maintaining it, even from the viewpoint of the United Nations, now that Iraq has abided by all resolutions. We absolutely confident that the Iraqi people will emerge triumphant. All nations will acknowledge the Iraqi people's contribution, strength, patience, and sacrifices. The Iraqi people have made great sacrifices to uphold the principles of justice, right, humanity, freedom, and independence. [passage omitted] [Al-'Abd] What can you tell us about Iraqi-UN talks on resuming Iraqi oil exports? [Ramadan] We do not view the lifting of the embargo through the resumption of oil exports as line with the UN formula. The UN formula is another form of the embargo against Iraq and the psychological harm done to the citizens. Yes, we want the embargo lifted and we want to resume oil exports, but without this infringing on our national independence and sovereignty. We want Iraq to sell and buy without any intervention from other powers. As for the current formula proposed by the United Nations for the resumption of oil exports, it is not acceptable, in view of its flagrant interference with sovereignty. We are confident that all the unjust formulas proposed by them under various covers -- which have been used as an umbrella to perpetuate the embargo and prevent Iraq from exporting its oil -- are now over. Therefore, they should now seriously consider lifting the Iraq embargo and allowing Iraq to export its oil. [Al-'Abd] Are you optimistic about ending the embargo and a return of the economic conditions in Iraq to normal? [Ramadan] I am optimistic that the embargo will end through the Iraqis' patience, resolve, and efforts to return life to normal, without being beholden to anybody else. This is the peak of pride for every Iraqi. In the year 1994, we should make more efforts than we did in the previous years of the embargo in the field of development, politics, spreading awareness, and mobilization, benefiting from the experience of past years. We will not begin from square one. We have a good background and a good experience by virtue of three years of hard work, day and night. Yes, this should be our point of departure. And this will impose the willpower of the Iraqis and the good-intentioned from the sons of this nation on the enemies and criminals, primarily America and Zionism.
