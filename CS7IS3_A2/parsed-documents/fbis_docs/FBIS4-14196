FBIS4-14196 "drnes082_n_94005" FBIS-NES-94-082 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 LEBANON Hizballah, Other Parties Criticize Government Hizballah, Other Parties Criticize Government NC2604103494 Beirut AL-'AHD in Arabic 15 Apr 94 p 4 NC2604103494 Beirut AL-'AHD Arabic BFN [Text] The Lebanese Islamic and nationalist parties and forces have held an expanded meeting at Hizballah's Political Bureau premises to discuss developments in the Lebanese arena. The delegates discussed the political situation and public liberties resulting from the government's policy, which is aimed at repressing the honest voices and forces confronting the Zionist enemy and the U.S. schemes in the region. Hizballah was represented at the meeting by the Political Bureau head al-Hajj Husayn al-Khalil, bureau member Abu-Sa'id al-Khansa, and deputies Muhammad Ra'd, Muhammad Funaysh, and Muhammad Yaghi. The other parties were represented by Zahi al-Khatib for the Workers' League; Usamah Sa'd and Khalil al-Khalil for the Nasirite Popular Organization; Tawfiq Muhanna for the Syrian Social Nationalist Party--Higher Council; 'Ali al-Shaykh 'Ammar for the Islamic Group; Sa'dallah Mazra'ani for the Lebanese Communist Party; Mukhtar Haydar for the Communist Action Organization; Hamad Haydar for the Popular Committees and Associations Grouping; Munir al- Sayyad for the Nasirite Organization; Husayn Hamdan for the Arab Socialist Action Party; and Hasan Shalhah for the Union Party. After the meeting, the delegates issued the following statement: Out of their concern for political freedom; in defense of the Resistance's nationalist media and the freedom of expression through appropriate methods; in rejection of the government's repressive policy toward public liberties--a policy demonstrated in the suspension of some papers and television stations; bearing in mind the perpetration of the 13 September massacre against citizens who reject the Gaza-Jericho plan; recalling the ban on broadcasting all audiovisual newscasts and political programs; and out of their concern for the principle of freedom in Lebanon, the Lebanese Islamic and nationalist forces and parties held an expanded meeting, following which they issued this statement: First, the Islamic and nationalist forces and parties strongly believe that the government's recent decision is a clear threat against political life in Lebanon. The government's decision circumvents the nationalist media, which support the peace, unity, and coexistence march, and the honorable Resistance, which seeks to liberate the usurped territories. This decision also paves the way for the Western media to infuse their sectarian and seditious poison and to propagate the imperialist policy against the Arab and Islamic nation and its central issues. Second, as part of a destructive and grave social, economic, and political crisis created by exhausting the citizen with taxes and strangling the country with debts, the government decided to silence nationalist media to prevent them from exposing this policy, which seeks to hold the country's future to ransom. Third, the delegates believe that the government's decision is meant to reward the radios that spread sedition. Instead of closing the radios that violated the covenant of honor, the government equated them with the national media. This reveals the government's deceptive policy, lack of concern for the country's interests, and failure to curb the sedition that almost destroyed peace, stability, and national unity. Fourth, The responsibility for the chaos that overwhelmed the media in the past should be shouldered by the government, which deliberately failed to issue a clear media law that would consolidate national unity and step up resistance of the Zionist enemy occupying our land. Fifth, the delegates urge the honorable Chamber of Deputies to shoulder its historic responsibility under the current delicate circumstances to safeguard the freedom of expression stipulated in the National Accord. The delegates call on the Chamber, in its capacity as the legislative authority that must reflect the people's will and interests, to play its role in confronting the government's policy, which is strangling liberties. Sixth, the media, whether audio, visual, or written, have one mission. So we urge the free Lebanese press to unify ranks in defense of information and political liberties in Lebanon and to undermine the government's acts of discrimination and division. After the meeting, the delegates decided to form committees that will be entrusted with contacting press, trade union, parliamentary, and political functionaries to follow up on the move rejecting the government's unfair course.
