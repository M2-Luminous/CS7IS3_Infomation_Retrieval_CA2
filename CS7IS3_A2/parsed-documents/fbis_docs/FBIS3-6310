Sayson] [Text] Southern Mindanao is fast shedding off its image as the country's traditional economic backdoor and in no time will emerge as the new growth area in the east of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The reason for this change is its abundant agriculture and natural resources which have continued luring unprecedented investments since the early 1990's. Southern Mindanao's passport to a grandiose transformation is its so-called SOCSARGEN (South Cotabato, Sarangani, General Santos City) growth corridor, dubbed as the "agricultural paradise" of the south. Agriculture Secretary Roberto S. Sebastian said the diversified agricultural potential highlighted by the vast and rich fishing grounds of the Celebes and Solomon seas could easily make the area the main gateway to East ASEAN markets. The growth trend has emerged in the early 1990's when investments jumped 800 million to around one billion pesos at present. New firms have also been noted to have mushroomed. Sebastian said there are about 200 big local and foreign investors who have confirmed investing in SOCSARGEN. Malaysia is one of the leading investors in the area as signalled by the recent visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed. Sebastian said a Philippine trade mission is set to visit Malaysia to discuss agriculture complementation between the two countries, especially in the aspect of fishing. A world-class fishport, 20 minutes away from Polomoloc, South Cotabato, is just a part of the infrastructure investments of over $200 million committed by the governments of the Philippines, the United States and Japan. Sebastian said the fishport complex, designed to cover a one-kilometer shoreline with a projected daily capacity of 1,000 metric tons of fish catch, could make SOCSARGEN competitive with Thailand's port. He said fish processing activities are concentrated in Thailand; but once the fishport complex is established, the country can capture part of the fish market. This is due to SOCSARGEN's proximity to the rich fishing grounds of the Solomon and Celebes seas located east of the country. Just by cutting the transit time is enough to lure commercial fishing vessels to land their catch in Southern Mindanao instead of Thailand, Sebastian added. Commercial fishing firms operating in General Santos City are leading participants in this lucrative regional fishing market. There are 34 commercial deep-sea fishing firms with a combined fleet of over 600 commercial fishing vessels' based in the city, making it the second port next to Navotas in fish landings and the leading port for tuna. The five fish canning plants producing as much as $30.8 million worth of products are also projected to increase production with the building of the fishport complex. Sebastian said by 1996, the $30-million Japanese-financed fish port will be completed to consist of a 300 meter wharf for 2,000 gross ton reefer carriers, a 750 meter landing quay and a cold storage for 1,500 metric tons of large tuna. The port has also the capability to accommodate a 60-ton ice plant, brine airblast and contact freezers and some 4,500 square meters of fish market stalls. SOCSARGEN's great marine wealth is completed by high agricultural productivity contributed by the unrivaled soil fertility of the Allah and Koronadal valleys. He said the area produces 40 percent of the country's pineapples, 23 percent of its corn, 75 percent of its cotton, and eight percent of its coconuts. SOCSARGEN is also a major production area for countries area for cut flowers, prawns, bananas, asparagus, seed corn and a leading production site for hogs, livestock and feedgrains.
