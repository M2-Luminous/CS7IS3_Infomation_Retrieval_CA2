The funds raised by 53,818 political parties and supporting groups across the country represented a decline of some 15.1 billion yen from 1991, when the amount hit a record 173.4 billion yen, the Home Affairs Ministry said in its report. It was the first time in five years that political funds fell below the year before, it said. Combined with national-level political funds, the total revenue stood at 332.3 billion yen, down 7.5 percent from 1991. The local-level total expenditure, meanwhile, stood at 156.2 billion yen, bringing the combined expenditure at 328.5 billion yen, a 7.6 percent decline from the previous year. Ministry officials attributed the primary cause of the drop to the sharp decrease of funds collected by the then ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), as well as the economic recession after the bursting of the speculative "bubble economy" in the early 1990s and a growing momentum toward political reform. The ministry compiled the report after political parties' local chapters and political organizations declared their fund-raising balance of payments to local election management committees. Of the amount, political parties collected 66.7 billion yen, down 5.7 percent from the previous year, while 617 organizations raised 3.6 billion yen in fund-raising parties, an increase of 75.8 percent over 1991. The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) topped the list at 29.8 billion yen, followed by the LDP at 22.4 billion yen, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) at 7.1 billion yen, Komeito [Clean Government Party] at 4.0 billion yen, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) at 3.3 billion yen and the United Social Democratic Party (USDP) at 200 million yen. Although many of the major parties registered increases of funds over the previous year ranging from 1.6 percent of the SDP to 24.8 percent of Komeito, the LDP recorded a sharp decrease of 18.0 percent, or about 4.9 billion yen, the report said. The LDP, currently the leading opposition party, was active to raise funds in 1991 to prepare for the House of Councillors elections the following year. The JCP, another opposition party, also suffered a 1.1 percent drop. The coalition's Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and new party Sakigake [Harbinger], two LDP breakaway parties which were founded in June 1992, were not covered. Another coalition bloc, the Japan New Party (JNP), headed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, did not report such funds. Of the 47 prefectures, Tokyo outshone the other prefectures at 18.5 billion yen, followed by Osaka at 11.5 billion yen and Aichi Prefecture at 8.2 billion yen and Kanagawa Prefecture at 7.2 billion yen. The ministry released a report last September on political funds that central offices of political parties and organizations collected in 1992.
