A North Korean Foreign Ministry statement monitored by NAEWOE press here said Pyongyang would not send a delegation to the third high-level meeting with the United States slated for Monday (Washington time). "North Korea would find no other way but to translate into action the measures which were pronounced in its statement on March 12 (on withdrawal from the NPT) in order to defend the nation's right to independence and the security of the country" should the United States avoid high-level talks and resume Team Spirit, and the IAEA distort inspection results and expand impartiality, thereby stepping up its high-handedness and pressure on Pyongyang, NAEWOE, South Korea's observer of North Korean affairs, quoted the statement as saying. The Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, aired by the North Korean Central Broadcasting station and Radio Pyongyang, said North Korea would no longer feel obligated to guarantee the continuity of nuclear safeguards.
