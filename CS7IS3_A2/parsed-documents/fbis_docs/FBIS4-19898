Clark said that the confidence-building measures package has two points, one being the opening of the uninhabited Maras [Varosha] section for Greek settlement under UN supervision, and the other being the opening of the Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport also under UN direction, and the partial lifting of the embargo imposed on the Turkish side. He said that the former will profit the Greek Cypriots while the latter will be to the advantage of the Turkish Cypriots. Clark said these are the last days of the process and that he has met with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias in New York and is due to meet with Turkish officials in Ankara on Monday and Tuesday. He added that he will later meet with leaders of both sides and a draft report should at least be prepared before next Sunday. Clark said the package will benefit both sides and the partial lifting of the embargo will strengthen the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' economy by 20 percent. During their stay, Clark, Feissel, and Cavanaugh will meet with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, Deputy Foreign Minister Ozdem Sanberk, and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller but it is not definitive as yet. The envoys will leave Turkey early on Wednesday morning.
