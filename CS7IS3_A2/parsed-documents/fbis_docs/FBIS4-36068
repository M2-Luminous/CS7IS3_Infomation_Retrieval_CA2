FBIS4-36068 "drnes107_j_94010" FBIS-NES-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Sanaa `Source' Denies Missile Attack Sanaa `Source' Denies Missile Attack JN0206191994 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1700 GMT 2 Jun 94 JN0206191994 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] A responsible source has denounced the new scandal fabricated by the media of the renegade secessionist gang in the Socialist Party headed by traitor agent 'Ali Salim al-Bid, within the framework of a series of fabricated scandals and lies propagated by this gang. The latest of these lies claimed that our heroic Armed Forces fired a missile on Aden, and that shrapnel from the missile, which was exploded in the air by the so-called air defenses of the rebellious, secessionist gang hit a number of worshipers in Aden during dawn prayers. This false and fabricated report, which aims at concealing the crimes of this gang in a manner that exposes it, included a statement by a citizen who was forced to speak on television and said the explosion occurred while the worshipers were kneeling. Another citizen said the explosion took place during the final stage of prayers. A third citizen spoke about prayers while the announcer was telling him what to say. At the beginning of the report it was said that the missile was intercepted by the air defenses of this gang and exploded in the air. This disgraceful contradiction shows the lowly means employed by the media of the renegade secessionist gang in fabricating deceptive reports and falsifying facts. The source said the masses of our Yemeni people know who shells mosques, and who tortured to death our esteemed religious scholars, and who attacked Sanaa, Ta'izz and Zinjibar, as well as al-Rahidah and 'Ataq with missiles, in addition to what happened in the economic and commercial capital, Aden, in January 1986 during the bloody coup against the legitimate leadership of the Socialist party at that time. Our people in all governorates also know those who have renounced the values of our Islamic religion and all deep-rooted norms and heritage throughout their known criminal history.
