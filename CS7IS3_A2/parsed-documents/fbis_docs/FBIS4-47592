To this end, 21 men and 7 women aged 17-54 were exposed to low-intensity laser radiation, and the treatment efficiency was monitored by the patients' state of health, arterial pressure, and central hemodynamic indicators determined with the help of an R4-02 bipolar thoracic rheograph. An analysis of the central hemodynamic indicators after a course of treatment shows that the use of low-intensity laser irradiation has a verifiable hypotensive impact, improves the patients' subjective status, and produces no side effects. Such laser therapy may also be used as an independent treatment method for categories I and II hypertension patients. The systolic/diastolic pressure was reduced from 151.8/96.8 before the treatment to 135/88 after the treatment. Tables 1; references 11: 9 Russian, 2 Western.
