Unidentified assailants opened fire from a car, hitting people going toward the al-Moharraq monastery, 11 kilometres (seven miles) from al-Qusiyah, which lies 350 kilometres (217 miles) south of Cairo. The attack took place at around 6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT), when the traditional iftar meal breaks the fast during the Moslem holy month of Ramadan. The timing of the attack and the target indicated the victims could have been Christians, but there were no details available about them or the gunmen who fled the scene. Islamic militants have previously carried out attacks against Coptic Christians in the same region.
