FR940516-0-00090 FR940516-0-00029 Amendment 2 is scheduled to be submitted for Secretarial review by the Councils in July 1994. It is expected that Amendment 2 will implement the measures in this emergency interim rule on a more permanent basis and include a phase-out schedule for live rock harvests in other areas. Compliance With NMFS Guidelines for Emergency Rules The Gulf Council and NMFS have concluded that the present situation constitutes biological and conservation emergencies, which are properly addressed by this emergency interim rule, and that the situation meets NMFS's policy guidelines for the use of emergency rules, published on January 6, 1992 (57 FR 375). The situation (1) results from recent, unforeseen events or recently discovered circumstances; (2) presents a serious management problem; and (3) realizes immediate benefits from the emergency interim rule that outweigh the value of advance notice, public comment, and deliberative consideration expected under the normal rulemaking process. The basis for the conclusions regarding emergency guidelines (1) and (2) was summarized above. Regarding the realization of immediate benefits, the Gulf Council has determined that an emergency rule under section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act is the only means for immediately addressing the biological emergency involving the Gulf live rock resources. Going through the formal FMP amendment process would delay implementation of the required measures and would result in substantial damage to live rock resources and fishery habitats in the Gulf. This emergency interim rule will prevent live rock collection in the northern Gulf and slow the harvesting rate in the rest of the Gulf EEZ until annual quotas and a phase-out can be implemented under Amendment 2 through the normal FMP amendment and rulemaking process. NMFS concurs with the Gulf Council's findings about the biological emergency regarding Gulf live rock resources and the need for immediate regulatory action. Accordingly, NMFS publishes this emergency interim rule, effective initially for 90 days, as authorized by section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act. By agreement of NMFS and the Gulf Council, this emergency interim rule may be extended for an additional period of 90 days. Classification The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (Assistant Administrator), has determined that this rule is necessary to respond to an emergency situation and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. This emergency interim rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of E.O. 12866. The Assistant Administrator finds for good cause under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) that the need to prevent further environmental damage and loss of fishery habitat makes it impracticable and contrary to the public interest to provide prior notice and opportunity for public comment on this rule. Similarly, to implement measures to address the conservation and biological emergencies in a timely manner, the Assistant Administrator finds for good cause under section 553(d)(3) of the APA that the effective date of this rule should not be delayed.
