The overall allotment in fiscal year 1995 for the marketing of crystalline fructose manufactured from corn is 159,757 short tons. Allotments will be established for the two U.S. manufacturers of crystalline fructose, and they will be notified of such allotments by certified mail. 9. There are in excess of 250 sugarcane producers in Louisiana, and the production of sugar, in the absence of proportionate shares, is estimated to be greater than the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the State's allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory. Therefore, as required the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, proportionate shares on acreage of sugarcane that may be harvested in Louisiana for sugar or seed are established for the 1994 crop of sugarcane, in an amount equal to 108.57 percent of each farm's sugar acreage base. Signed at Washington, DC this 12th day of October, 1994. Bruce R. Weber, Acting Executive Vice President, Commodity Credit Corporation.
