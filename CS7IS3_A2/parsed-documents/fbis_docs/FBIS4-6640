The number of applicants stood at 1,147 for the year ended March 31, falling short of the 15,000 applicants envisaged for the first year of the program, the official said. Under the program, applicants will be given Japanese-language lessons and job training for the first year and then those who pass a job examination test will be allowed to work in Japan for a year without a working visa. The official attributed the fewer-than-expected applicants to the sluggish economy, and the resulting drop in demand for foreign labor. The official also cited a hesitancy among employers to hire those trained under the program. Most applicants were from Asian countries. China led the list of applicants with 602, followed by Indonesia with 426 and the Philippines with 53.
