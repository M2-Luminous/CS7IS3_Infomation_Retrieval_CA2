FR941005-0-00044 FR941005-0-00011 If one or more of these criteria indicate that arctic peregrine falcon populations are declining, the Service will review all available information to determine if arctic peregrine falcons are threatened or endangered with extinction in accordance with listing guidelines outlined in the Act. The Service will monitor arctic peregrine falcons for a minimum of 5 years following delisting. If, after the 5-year period, studies show that recovery is complete and that no factors that threaten arctic peregrine falcons have been identified, the monitoring program may be reduced or eliminated. If studies show that arctic peregrine falcon populations are declining or if one or more factors that appear to have the potential to cause decline are identified, the Service will continue monitoring beyond the 5-year minimum period. Additionally, if harvest of arctic peregrine falcons is implemented, the Service may conclude that surveys and monitoring are necessary. If continuation of the monitoring effort is warranted for any reason, the Service will evaluate the current 5-year monitoring plan to determine if modification of the plan is necessary. National Environmental Policy Act The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Act. A notice outlining the Service's reason for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).
