He said Stepanakert has not yet received the protocol signed by the speaker of the Azeri parliament Rasul Guliyev. In a Wednesday [11 May] interview with INTERFAX Gukasian said that in reality the Azeri side is psychologically not ready for the peaceful settlement of the conflict. He named as evidence the situation on the front-line where Azeri troops continue attacking Karabakh positions. Gukasian stressed that a political settlement is impossible without guarantees of a complete cease-fire. He also declared that Nagorno-Karabakh should be recognized as a conflicting side. In his opinion only the deployment of a peace-keeping force in the conflict zone can stop the bloodshed.
