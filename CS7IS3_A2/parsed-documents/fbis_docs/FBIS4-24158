Germano de Sousa reports: [De Sousa] This afternoon CNE Chairman Brazao Mazula told correspondents that 20 percent of voting age Mozambicans have already registered throughout the country. This percentage represents 1.7 million voters. Mazula said at the news conference that a new timetable will be announced soon for the registration of a specified group of voters, who in view of circumstances cannot register within the established timetable. The people who will benefit from this include refugees still in neighboring countries and soldiers confined in different assembly areas waiting to hear their fate. Two issues considered important did not have definite answers at the news conference. They are the issues of emigrants who still do not have approval to vote in the election and the trust fund for the operation of political parties. Mazula said these two issues are discussed in almost all the CNE meetings. Mazula also said that the CNE has not yet issued guidelines on the operation of mobile voter registration teams, an issue which raises doubts about the voting process by the electorate in the areas concerned.
