FR940127-1-00027 FR940127-1-00011 Marbled murrelets spend the majority of their lives at sea, where they feed primarily on small fish and invertebrates in near-shore marine waters. Marbled murrelets nest inland, predominately in older, large-limbed trees in dense forest. Marbled murrelets have been found occasionally on rivers and inland lakes (Carter and Sealy 1986). The marbled murrelet is a social species that is semi-colonial around the breeding site. Two nests discovered in Washington during 1990 were located within 46 meters (150 feet) of each other (Hamer and Cummins 1990), and detections of marbled murrelets exhibiting behaviors associated with nesting activity are often aggregated. Nesting occurs over an extended period from early April to late September (Carter and Sealy 1987). Marbled murrelets have been observed at some inland sites during all months of the year (Paton et al. 1987, Naslund 1993). During the breeding period, adult marbled murrelets lay a single egg in a tree containing structures suitable for nesting (e.g., limbs at least 13 centimeters (cm) (5 inches) in diameter, mistletoe infections, witches brooms, deformities). Both sexes incubate the egg in alternating 24-hour shifts for approximately 30 days, and the young fledge after an additional 28 days (Simons 1980, Hirsch et al. 1981, Singer et al. 1991). Inland flights by adults feeding young are made from ocean feeding areas to nest sites at all times of the day, but most often at dusk and dawn (Hamer and Cummins 1991). Chicks are fed at least once a day. The adults carry only one fish at a time to the young (Carter and Sealy 1987; Hamer and Cummins 1991; Singer et al. 1992; Nelson, Oregon Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit, pers. comm. 1992). The young are altricial, but remain in the nest longer than young of most other alcids. Before leaving the nest, the young molt into a distinctive juvenile plumage. Fledglings fly directly from the nest to the sea rather than exploring the forest environment first (Hamer and Cummins 1991). For the purpose of proposing critical habitat, the Service has concentrated on two components of marbled murrelet habitat: (1) Nesting habitat; and (2) habitat needed to support foraging. Forest stands with conditions that will support nesting marbled murrelets are referred to as ``suitable nesting habitat.'' Throughout the forested portion of the species' range, marbled murrelets nest near the marine environment in forest stands containing characteristics of older forests (Binford et al. 1975; Sealy and Carter 1984; Carter and Sealy 1987; Carter and Erickson 1988; Marshall 1988; Paton and Ralph 1988; Nelson 1989; Burger, University of Victoria, in litt. 1990; Hamer and Cummins 1990, 1991; Quinlan and Hughes 1990; Kuletz 1991; Nelson in litt. 1991; Singer et al. 1991, 1992; Nelson 1992; Nelson et al. 1992). Historically, nesting habitat for the marbled murrelet was widely dispersed, particularly in the wetter portions of its range in Washington, Oregon, and California. This habitat was generally found in very large, contiguous blocks. Currently, the threatened population of marbled murrelets nests in most of the major types of coniferous forests in the western portions of Washington, Oregon, and north-central California, wherever older forests remain in close proximity to the coast. Habitat in the drier parts of the listed species' range (portions of southern Oregon and northern California) is less continuous, occurring naturally in a mosaic pattern. Although marbled murrelet nesting habitat is somewhat variable over the range of the species, some general habitat attributes are common throughout its range, including nesting structure, canopy closure, stand size, tree species, landscape condition, and distance from the marine environment. Individual tree attributes that provide conditions suitable for nesting include branches at least 13 cm (5 inches) in diameter, deformities (e.g., broken tops), mistletoe infections, witches brooms, or other structures providing a platform for nesting (Carter and Sealy 1987; Hamer and Cummins 1990, 1991; Singer et al. 1991, 1992; Ralph et al. 1993). These structures are typically found in old-growth and mature stands, but may be found in a variety of stand types including younger stands containing remnant large trees. Sixty-one tree nests have been located in North America, including 35 in the range of the listed population (6 in Washington, 20 in Oregon, and 9 in California) (Binford et al. 1975; Varoujean et al. 1989; Burger 1990; Quinlan and Hughes 1990; Hamer and Cummins 1990, 1991; Kuletz 1991; Singer et al. 1991, 1992; Nelson unpubl. data). All nests in Washington, Oregon, and California were located in old-growth trees that were greater than 81 cm (32 inches) diameter at breast height (dbh). Most nests have been located on large or deformed branches with a moss covering; however, a few nests have been located on smaller branches, and some nests were situated on conifer needles or sticks rather than moss.
