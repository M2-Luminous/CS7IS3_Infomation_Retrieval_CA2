It will also be the year the regime that brought destruction to Iran will ebb, he noted. In a congratulatory message addressed to the Iranian people on the Nauruz festivities and the beginning of a new Persian year, Rajavi added that the victories scored by the Iranian resistance last year undermined the structure of the ruling regime and surpassed the expectations of all observers. Rajavi indicated that the ruling Iranian regime is experiencing an impasse due to resistance attacks and the political and military siege, which has confused it and rendered it unable to address aggravated crises. Rajavi added that the popular protest waves which erupt from time to time throughout Iran confirm that the repression and oppression being used by the regime cannot muzzle free people throughout Iran. Concluding his message, he noted that the UN Human Rights Commission's condemnation of the Tehran regime a few days ago confirm that this regime is illegal.
