The organizations, which form the "Unified Djibouti Opposition Front," said in a statement that participants analyzed international and regional conditions as well as Djibouti conditions, which are characterized by "the continued liberation war against a dictatorship that is sacrificing the nation's present and future through forcible domination." They added that the Djibouti regime has always rejected the peace and democracy proposals adopted by the Front's first conference, which was held in Paris in June 1992. They stressed that peace and democracy are still the Front's basic aims and that Gouled's regime represents the main obstacle to their achievement. The organizations added that "Gouled insists on continuing the war despite the deterioration of the national economy and while government militias continue to commit inhumane practices, such as massacres and the daily torture of civilians." They said that, on this basis, the "Unified Opposition Front" has decided to work to achieve the following aims: "1. To topple Hassan Gouled Aptidon's dictatorship on the grounds that this is the only way to restore peace and democracy. It can be done in the following manner: "To continue to reinforce armed struggle, which should expand to cover all national territory. "To reinforce all forms of political and social struggle in the capital by mobilizing all groups of national society. "2. To work -- after the dictatorship is toppled -- to form a transitional government, achieve national reconciliation, and set up the institutions of a rule-of-law state in Djibouti based on integration with the region's states." The statement bears the signatures of Ahmed Dini Ahmed, leader of the "Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy"; Omar Khair, leader of the Democratic Forces Front; Mohamed Hussein Hassan, leader of the Djibouti National Movement; Djalal Abdel Rahman Ahmed, leader of the Movement for Salvation and Rebuilding; Mahdi Ibrahim Goud, official in charge of foreign relations in the Djibouti Democrats Union; Kamil Ali Mohamed, spokesman for parliamentary opposition; and Abdellahi Disingor, leader of the Democratic Socialist Union. Meanwhile, the "Society for the Defense of Human Rights" in Djibouti has said that government forces have arrested 50 civilians at random and put them in a prison situated some 60 km from the town of Tadjoura, north of the country. The society said in a statement that Djibouti authorities are keeping silent about the fate of these detainees, who are suffering from the dreadful conditions in prison.
