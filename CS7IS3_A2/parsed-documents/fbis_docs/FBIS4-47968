FBIS4-47968 "drafr089_e_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-089 Daily Report 8 May 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Further on Agreement Further on Agreement AB0805180094 Gbarnga Radio ELRL in English 1400 GMT 8 May 94 AB0805180094 Gbarnga Radio ELRL English BFN [Text] The two sides in the ethnic fighting within the United Liberation Movement, ULIMO, have agreed to a cease-fire, with immediate effect. The frontline commanders of the Krahns and Mandingos involved in the fighting are to begin withdrawing their troops from the main highway linking the Liberian capital, Monrovia, to Tubmanburg, ULIMO headquarters. According to the agreement, ULIMO are to remove all of their checkpoints and turn over areas captured by them to the Nigerian contingent of the multi-African national peacekeeping force, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. Hundreds of ULIMO fighters have been killed, along with civilians, in the Tubmanburg area since the outbreak of hostilities between the Krahns and Mandingos over two months ago. The ULIMO ethnic fighting has resulted in the displacement of more than 7,000 civilians from Bomi County. A cease-fire agreement by ULIMO factions follows stern warning by the West African peacekeeping force to their leaders, Alhaji Koromah and Roosevelt Johnson, to stop the fighting or expect serious military measures. Meanwhile, ECOMOG deputy field commander, Brigadier General John Addah, says the two ULIMO warlords are expected to meet in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, on Monday [9 May] to sort out the obstacles to peace in ULIMO. However, Koromah fighters have forwarded three conditions, rather the Krahn fighters have put forward three conditions, for ending the fighting. The Krahn commander, Roosevelt Johnson, says Alhaji Koromah will have to withdraw all those initially appointed to the Liberian National Transitional Government and set up a new committee to appoint other Liberians to occupy ULIMO positions on the government. He says this is the basis upon which he signed the agreement.
