International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said at a press conference, "We cannot practice managed trade or allow administrative guidance only to reduce the surplus with the United States by using double standards at home and abroad." "The government of (Prime Minister Morihiro) Hosokawa is trying to create transparency in markets," Kumagai said. Referring to reported U.S. criticism that bilateral trade framework negotiations have faced hard going due to Japan's bureaucracy, Kumagai said that bluff or dissatisfaction may be expressed when negotiations reach the final stage. "At least, I don't think the Ministry of International Trade and Industry insists on its own logic being accepted," Kumagai said.
