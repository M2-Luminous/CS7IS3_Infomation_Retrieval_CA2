In addition, the document urges the creation of innovative financial instruments and mechanisms, like a reconstruction levy, to fund the still to be determined cost of the RDP. "If excessive risk aversion in the major financial institutions prevents them from taking up socially desireable investments, the democratic government should consider some form of legislative compulsion such as prescribed assets," the document says. It notes the government cannot fund the RDP without support from the private sector and states therefore that regulations should be modified to compel financial institutions to fund basic needs such as housing, education, and health-care. Legislation would be introduced to transform the boards of mutual fund companies "to make them more socially responsible". A new government must impose non-discriminatory lending criteria, especially related to collateral, and require the banks to lend a rising share of their assets to small, black-owned enterprises. With regard to specific measures to fund the RDP, a new government would set up a reconstruction fund and include some form of a dedicated reconstruction bond. "In addition, it should draw on specific reconstruction levies. The design of reconstruction levies will depend on the aims of the RDP as a whole, especially in terms of promoting development and growth, but could also include levies on capital transfers, land and luxury goods." A housing bank is mooted by the document as well as a government-backed guarantee fund to protect private sector investors. Many of the proposals are expected to be financed through the capital markets and would not necessitate a massive increase in government revenue. The RDP envisages restructuring and rationalising current government expenditure to meet the most of the costs of the RDP so as to avoid undue inflation and balance of payments difficulties. "Given the fiscal malaise left by apartheid, careful programmes must be developed around financing increased capital expenditure, increasing the efficiency of consumption expenditure and improving the revenue recovery capacities of the government." The RDP documents states the current budget deficit of six per cent of gross domestic product would not be exceeded and neither should the overall tax burden be increased. Foreign funding in support of the RDP would only be used for those elements of the programme which would increase the country's capacity for earning foreign exchange.
