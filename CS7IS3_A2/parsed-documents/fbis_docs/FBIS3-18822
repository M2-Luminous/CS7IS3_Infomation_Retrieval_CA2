Illicit profits and gains cannot be considered earnings and are subject to confiscation, but not taxation, decided the court in a ruling on a case filed by the Naples prosecutors office in November that involved a street seller of pirated tape recordings. The question had divided judicial opinion "in the absence of any precise position by the legislature," the ruling stated, with penal experts expressing the view the fruits of crime cannot be taxed, while the civil section held it was appropriate to levy taxes on all unreported income. Today's ruling thus provides a precedent jurists had been seeking, both for those courts dealing with underworld economic activities as well as for judges dealing with the extensive flows of bribes and kickbacks that has been unveiled in anti-corruption investigations in the past two years. The high court ruled that illegal activities "go against the public interest protected by the constitution" and that they would be legitimated if recognized as a normal tax source. Further, the Cassation Court argued, those who commit crimes such as theft, larceny, fraud, corruption, mafia association, drug traffic and the laundering of illicit funds are already subject to financial and penal sanctions that include: liability to restore sums stolen and for payment of damages, and court-ordered confiscation of property. These existing measures, which aim to subtract all illegal gains and profits from their holders, would thus be at odds with a measure like taxation, which would recover only a part of those illegal funds, the court decided.
