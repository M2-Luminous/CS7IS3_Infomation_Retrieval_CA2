FR941230-2-00145 FR941230-2-00072 The Juvenile Justice Prosecutor Training Project_$200,000 For several years, OJJDP has supported a prosecutor training project developed by the National District Attorneys Association (NDAA). This project implements workshops on juvenile justice related executive policy, leadership, and management for chief prosecutors and juvenile unit chiefs, and provides background information to prosecutors on juvenile justice issues and programs. OJJDP proposes to fund a project for the above purposes, to be implemented by the American Prosecutors Research Institute (APRI), based on planning and input by prosecutors familiar with juvenile justice needs. APRI is the research and technical assistance affiliate of NDAA. The project will utilize a working group of chief prosecutors and juvenile unit chiefs to support the project's staff in providing training, technical assistance, and juvenile justice related research and program information to practitioners nationwide. The expectation is that within the next three years, a self-supported Juvenile Justice Prosecutor Center will be established through links with State prosecutor training programs. The award for the Juvenile Justice Prosecutor Training Project will be made to APRI. No additional applicants will be considered in fiscal year 1995. Technical Assistance to Juvenile Corrections and Detention (The James F. Gould Memorial Program)_$200,000 The purpose of the proposed program is to continue OJJDP's capability to provide technical assistance for juvenile corrections and detention. A major responsibility of the grantee would be to plan and convene the annual Juvenile Corrections and Detention Forum. The forum provides an opportunity for 100 juvenile corrections and detention leaders to meet and discuss issues, problems, and solutions to corrections and detention problems. A second objective is to provide workshops and training conferences on current and emerging national issues in the field of juvenile corrections and detention. The grantee would provide limited technical assistance through document dissemination. OJJDP will award a competitive grant to an organization experienced in this area of expertise to provide these services. Technical Assistance for State Legislatures_$163,000 State legislatures are being pressed to respond to public fear of juvenile crime, and that there is increasingly less confidence in the capability of the juvenile justice system to respond effectively. For the most part, State legislatures have not had enough information to properly address justice issues. Consequently, OJJDP proposes to award a grant to the National Conference of State Legislatures to identify, analyze, and disseminate information to help State legislatures make more informed decisions about legislation affecting the juvenile justice system. A complementary task will involve supporting more communication between State legislators and State and local leaders who influence decision making regarding juvenile justice issues. A $163,000 grant will be awarded to the NCSL in fiscal year 1995. No additional applications will be solicited in fiscal year 1995.
