FR940426-2-00092 FR940426-2-00058 Section 4204(c) of ERISA authorizes the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') to grant individual or class variances or exemptions from the purchaser's bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) when warranted. The legislative history of section 4204 indicates a Congressional intent that the sales rules be administered in a manner that assures protection of the plan with the least practicable intrusion into normal business transactions. Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess., S. 1076, The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980: Summary and Analysis of Considerations 16 (Comm. Print, April 1980); 128 Cong. Rec. S10117 (July 29, 1980). The granting of an exemption or variance from the bond/escrow requirement does not constitute a finding by the PBGC that a particular transaction satisfies the other requirements of section 4204(a)91). Such questions are to be decided by the plan sponsor in the first instance, and any disputes are to be resolved in arbitration. 29 U.S.C. 1382, 1399, 1401. Under the PBGC's regulation on variances for sales of assets (29 CFR part 2643), a request for a variance or waiver of the bond/escrow requirement under any of the tests established in the regulation (29 CFR 2643.12&hyph;2643.14) is to be made to the plan in question. The PBGC will consider waiver requests only when the request is not based on satisfaction of one of the four regulatory tests or when the parties assert that the financial information necessary to show satisfaction of one of the regulatory tests is privileged or confidential financial information within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) (the Freedom of Information Act). Under section 2643.3 of the regulation, the PBGC shall approve a request for a variance or exemption if it determines that approval of the request is warranted, in that it_ (1) Would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of Title IV of the Act; and (2) Would not significantly increase the risk of financial loss to the plan. Section 4204(c) of ERISA and ยง2643.3(b) of the regulation require the PBGC to publish a notice of the pendency of a request for a variance or exemption in the Federal Register , and to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the proposed variance or exemption. The Request The PBGC has received a request from The Home Team Limited Partnership (``the Buyer'') for an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) with respect to its purchase of The Orioles, Inc. (``the Seller'') on October 4, 1993. In support of the request, the Buyer represents among other things that: 1. The Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan (the ``Plan'') was established and is maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between professional major league baseball teams and the Major League Baseball Players Association. 2. The Seller was a participating employer in the Plan. 3. The major league clubs have established the Major Leagues Central Fund (the ``Central Fund'') pursuant to the ``Major League Agreement in re Major Leagues Central Fund.'' Under this agreement, contributions to the Plan for all participating employers are paid by the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball from the Central Fund on behalf of each participating employer in satisfaction of the employer's contribution obligation arising under the Plan's funding agreement. The monies in the Central Fund are derived directly from (i) gate receipts from All-Star games, (ii) radio and television revenues from World Series, League Championships, intradivision play-offs and All-Star games, and (iii) certain other radio and television revenues from regular and exhibition games, including revenues from foreign broadcasts. 4. For the Plan year ended March 31, 1993, the Central Fund contributed approximately $34.1 million to the Plan on behalf of the Clubs; 1/26 of that amount represented contributions paid on behalf of the Seller. 5. The Buyer and the Seller entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement for the Buyer to purchase substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the Seller relating to the business employing the employees covered by the Plan. The final closing of the transaction occurred on October 4, 1993 (the ``Closing'').
