FR941017-2-00031 FR941017-2-00017 NGT proposes to: (1) abandon nine 1-inch domestic taps located on NGT's Lines S and ST&hyph;8 in Louisiana, originally installed to deliver gas to rural domestic customers served by ARKLA, a division of NorAm Energy Corp. (``ARKLA''); and, (2) to relocate one tap on Line S at ARKLA's request. The estimated cost to relocate the tap on Line S is $353, and NGT will be reimbursed by ARKLA. Comment date: November 21, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 5. Questar Pipeline Co. [Docket No. CP95&hyph;7&hyph;000] Take notice that on October 5, 1994, Questar Pipeline Company (Questar), 79 South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;7&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act requesting authority to construct and operate new delivery point metering facilities, requesting an order for permission and approval to abandon by sale certain transmission and associated facilities and to abandon by removal certain metering facilities, and submitting a petition for a declaratory order finding that the facilities to be abandoned by sale will be exempt from Commission jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the application and petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Questar requests authority to undertake a number of adjustments and activities on its system which, collectively, will respond to operating changes on its system which have taken place in the past few years. The proposals give recognition to operating and functional realities on certain segments of the Questar system. Specifically, Questar proposes to construct and operate a new city-gate delivery point (the Little Mountain Gate Station) within the confines of its existing Little Mountain Pressure Regulating Station. The facilities are to be comprised of 6 12-inch turbine meter runs, six 20-inch and 24-inch valves, 100 feet of 20-inch and 24-inch yard and station piping, and telecommunications and appurtenant facilities. The new gate station is designed so that current operation and delivery service to Questar's local distribution company affiliate, Mountain Fuel Supply Company (Mountain Fuel) is unchanged. Questar states that the proposed facilities will permit it to consolidate metering, custody-transfer and pressure-regulating functions presently provided at the Little Mountain Pressure Regulating Station and the Sunnyside Gas Station (Sunnyside). It is indicated that Sunnyside currently serves as one of Questar's city-gate custody-transfer points to Mountain Fuel which serves the Wasatch Front area of northern Utah. Questar asserts that the consolidation of metering, regulating, and operational control activities at Little Mountain will streamline operations on this segment of Questar's transmission system. In conjunction with establishing the Little Mountain Station, Questar proposes to abandon by sale to Mountain Fuel (a) approximately 5.9 miles (31,175 feet) of its existing 24-inch transmission Main Line No. 2 and approximately 5.9 miles (31,275 feet) of its existing 20-inch transmission Main Line No. 14, (b) non-measurement-related facilities located at Sunnyside, (c) four intermediate delivery points located between Little Mountain and Sunnyside and (d) related piping, metering and regulating facilities. In addition, Questar proposes to abandon by removal, valves, metering, regulating and telemetry equipment, and appurtenant piping located at Sunnyside. Questar asserts that the abandonment by sale is appropriate because, due to rapidly increasing residential development in the Emigration Canyon (where the facilities to be abandoned are located), the subject facilities now function more like an extension of Mountain Fuel's distribution system than an Questar Pipeline's transmission system. Once Questar installs the Little Mountain Gate Station, the equipment proposed to be removed at Sunnyside will no longer be necessary. To consummate and complete the contemplated transfer to Mountain Fuel, Questar requests a declaratory order finding that the facilities to be sold to and operated by Mountain Fuel, upon transfer and sale, will be local distribution facilities and operations exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act. Questar states that the vase majority of the subject facilities are now surrounded by residential housing and that the three delivery taps downstream of the Little Mountain station are required by Mountain Fuel to provide exclusively local distribution service to residential end-use customers. In addition, because of the residential expansion in the area, Questar has reduced pipeline operating pressures in the vicinity such that the referenced sections of Main Lines 2 and 14 should be viewed as performing a local distribution function. Questar states that the total gross plant investment associated with the facilities proposed to be abandoned (both by sale and removal) is $1,735,822 with the book value being $1,025,157. The book value of the facilities to be transferred to Mountain Fuel is $864,069. The cost of the metering facilities proposed to be constructed in approximately $671,000, which would be financed from company funds on hand. Questar does not propose to modify any level of transportation service provided to Mountain Fuel or any other customer. Nor does Questar propose any change in its authorized rates. Comment date: October 28, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. Standard Paragraphs F.
