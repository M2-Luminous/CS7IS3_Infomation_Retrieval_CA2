FBIS4-5212 "dreas068_d_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 South Korea First Meeting of Security Policy Council Held First Meeting of Security Policy Council Held SK0804023394 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 0100 GMT 8 Apr 94 SK0804023394 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [Text] The government held the first meeting of the Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council presided over by Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok this morning. It was decided to hold a meeting of this council every Friday to coordinate the government's position on the North Korean nuclear issue and other security-related issues. It was also decided to promptly call a special meeting whenever it is needed to cope with changing situations. Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok; Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu; Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae; Kim Tok, head of the Agency for National Security Planning; Pak Kwan-yong, chief presidential secretary; and Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential aide on foreign and security affairs -- who are core figures in charge of unification and security affairs -- were present at the meeting. They have decided to seek an effective way to actively cope with unification and security matters by pursuing a one-voice policy [hanmoksori chongchaek] through close coordination of related offices' opinion, being reminded of the fact that this council was organized mainly because the people have come to distrust the government's confused unification and security policy. In today's meeting, they shared the view that the Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council will play the role of a virtual control tower in charge of generalizing [tonggwal] and coordinating opinion to prevent confusion in government policy, and that high-level strategic meetings and unification-related ministers meetings will be held continuously. In addition, after determining that a working-level body is needed to support the council's activities, they decided to form a working-level organization chaired by the deputy minister of the National Unification Board. In particular, the participants reconfirmed in today's meeting the government's fixed position [chongnidoen ipchang] that the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks cannot be held unless North Korea allows nuclear inspections and complies with the exchange of special envoys.
