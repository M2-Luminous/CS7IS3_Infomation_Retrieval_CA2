The sight of a missile trying to arrest another missile was sufficient to prove the validity of the air-defense system based on electronic equipment. Components that are produced by Japan Radio Co., Ltd. are the constituents of various guided ordnance and the "electronic eyes" that support the heart of the defense system. They cast watchful eyes on the sneaking enemies. Of the FY92 sales totaling ¥140.2 billion, the sale made to the Defense Agency amounted to about 14%. Although the ratio was as high as about 20% in the late 1980s, it has been declining since affected by the defense budget cut. Manabu Narasaki, a director in charge of the defense business, comments painfully, "we would like to think that we have reached the bottom; nevertheless, we are prepared to see a further erosion, even to the 10% line." The reduction of the contracts in terms of yen value is serious, as they forecast the FY93 sale to fall back to about ¥16 billion, a whopping 30% reduction from the previous year. The equipment related to guided ordnance such as missile and the electronic equipment for antisubmarine patrol aircraft are their two major product lines, the combined sales amount of which amounts to 60-70% of the total defense-related sales of the company. In addition to those product lines, they make communication equipment, radar, and various simulators. The main pillar of the guided ordnance products is the ground radar which controls the surface-to-air missile, "Hawk." Hawk homes in on the target tagging along the radio wave reflected by the target while the radar scans the target with the radio wave. It is intended to track down and capture an object flying at a relatively low speed, such as an airplane flying in formation and a missile released by a fighter. The ground radar is an eye of the Hawk system to look for the enemy in distance. As to the missile-related business, the company also supplies the communication equipment for the surface-to-air missile, "Patriot," and the radio altimeter to be built into surface-to-surface missiles. The electronic equipment for antisubmarine patrol aircraft captures the movement of submarines that cannot be captured by radars. The system functions in such a way that buoys dropped on the sea surface emit radio waves which bounce off the submarine and are collected by the patrol plane via the buoys. The electronic equipment the company supplies is used to receive the signal and deliver the data to a system that is used to identify the location of the submarine. The nucleus of their defense business relates to the front-line equipment which tends to be strongly affected by the defense budget cut, so that they cannot expect any increase in the foreseeable future. Therefore, they are considering the conversion of their defense technology to commercial applications. "We will investigate the possibility of venturing into the amusement industry (game machines, etc.)," says Mr. Narasaki boldly. They seem to be considering a drastic shift to commercial fields utilizing the technology they mastered through the development of aircraft pilot training simulators. They developed the simulator originally for the trainer planes of the Air Self-Defense Force. "The business is quite unpredictable, and sometimes there is no order for more than a year," says Kzaue Mukogawa, General Manager of Defense Sales. When it comes to the commercial airline industry, they still favor imported products so that Japan Radio has been able to sell only less than 20 units so far, mainly to All Nippon Airways. "Simulator sales occur only when new airplanes are adopted by the industry," says Mr. Narasaki; with the airline industry in such a depressed state they are currently in, there is little hope for this business to expand appreciatively. That is why they think that a higher growth potential can be created, if they shift their effort toward "non-aircraft" business such as game equipment, by means of adding multi-media output, i.e., voice, character and image, to the simulator technology. Accompanying the sales drop in the defense sector of their business, the number of employees related to the sector has been continuously decreasing. At the moment, it only amounts to about 14% of 3,900, the total number of people the company employs. The company claims that it has no intention of further reducing the number as it wants to sustain the defense-specific technology and know-how. However, they must generate a necessary earning to support all the employees and their families through business expansions utilizing the defense element technology they have nurtured. The informed sources in the industry predict, however, that it will be difficult for them to go beyond their boundary of communication and electronic equipment manufacturing even if they succeed in venturing into commercial fields. The key to the survival of the defense division of this company is whether they can successfully enter into new business sectors such as the amusement equipment industry while making sure not to miss any renewal orders of the front-line equipment they delivered in the past and maintenance service contracts.
