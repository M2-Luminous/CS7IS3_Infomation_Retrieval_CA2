In accordance with 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that on October 25, 1994, a proposed Modified Consent Decree as to Defendant South Essex Sewerage District (``Modified Decree'') in United States of America v. South Essex Sewerage District, et al., Civil Action No. 83&hyph;2814&hyph;Y, was lodged with the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The United States' complaint sought relief under the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251, et seq. The Modified Decree revises the existing consent decree as to the South Essex Sewerage District (``SESD'') entered by the Court in 1991. The Modified Consent Decree provides for a revised residuals disposition approach by SESD, under which SESD is required to enter into primary long-term and backup contracts for disposition of its sludge residuals and to design and obtain permits for a backup residuals landfill which it is to construct in the event of difficulties with contractual disposition. The Modified Decree also adds a construction schedule for an outfall effluent diffuser, which is to be constructed by February 28, 1997. The Department of Justice will receive comments relating to the proposed consent decree for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General, Environment and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 20530, and should refer to United States v. South Essex Sewerage District, et al., D.J. Ref. 90&hyph;5&hyph;1&hyph;1&hyph;2049A. The proposed consent decree may be examined at the office of the United States Attorney, 1003 J.W.
