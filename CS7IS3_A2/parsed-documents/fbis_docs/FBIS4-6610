As has just been announced by the coalition leaders, I have been selected from among the coalition party leaders, including Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, as a candidate to be the new prime minister of the coalition's second administration. Frankly speaking, I do not think I am a capable man, and cannot help feeling some hesitation in accepting the serious responsibilities over state affairs. However, since the coalition leaders have been trying so hard to reach a conclusion, I have to take upon myself the hair-raising responsibilities as top leader of the nation. Thus, I have decided to accept the candidacy. As Murayama just noted, the coalition has worked out a multiparty memorandum on a policy accord for forming a new coalition government. When I am approved as the new prime minister through Diet elections, I will try my best, in line with the policy accord, to make Japan a sound nation where everybody can live in comfort. Also, I will seek the high-quality nation advocated by Hosokawa. Another point is that, as other coalition leaders have stated, Japan must become a trustworthy, understandable, and beloved nation in the international community. I would like to try my best to achieve these objectives. I sincerely seek the understanding of the public. Thank you very much.
