FBIS4-27173 "dreas104_a_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 31 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Reports on U.S.-Japan Framework Talks Continue Reports on U.S.-Japan Framework Talks Continue Panel Dismisses `Result-Oriented' Trade OW3105081894 Tokyo KYODO in English 0804 GMT 31 May 94 OW3105081894 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A Japanese Government advisory panel on Tuesday [31 May] blasted the "unilateral" or "result- oriented" trade approach of the United States as only adding "an extra layer of confusion and difficulty" to global economic issues. A subcommittee of the Industrial Structure Council, an advisory organ to the trade minister, made the criticism in the 1994 report that identified and analyzed unfair trade policies and measures of Japan's 10 major trading partners. The report, the third of its kind, was compiled at a time when Japan-U.S. economic relations have yet to be fully mended under the long-running bickering over the definition of "objective criteria," a set of tools designed to gauge the openness of Japan's markets under the so-called framework trade talks. The council said analytical standards used in this year's report are in line with internationally accepted World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, which will expand the scope of coverage to include services and intellectual property rights from only trade in goods as under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The report said Japan's trade rules are basically in conformity with the WTO agreement while those of the U.S. deviate from it in that the country pursues "result-based criteria." "To a large extent, a preoccupation with trade results comes from a tendency to see a direct link between current account or trade imbalances and inadequate market access," the report said. The report branded the result-oriented U.S. trade approach as managed trade, explaining that the country resorts to "numerical targets" in order to achieve satisfactory results in market shares or import values for specific American goods. "We have grave apprehensions about the detrimental impact that such policies would have on the free trade system," the report said. In a country-by-country survey, the report found problems with U.S. trade policy in 10 of the 12 trade sectors covered. "It would appear at first glance that the U.S. has made little effort to improve its unfair trade policies and measures," the report said. The report showed concern about the recent revival of a retaliatory trade clause known as Super 301. "Thinking behind unilateral measures like Super 301 is the idea of the same country serving both as prosecutor and judge," the report said. U.S. antidumping measures against imports from Japan were described by the report as creating "serious problems." Of the 43 antidumping duties imposed by the U.S. on Japanese products since 1980, 36 duty orders were still in force as of March this year because of the lack of a "sunset" clause, the report noted. Regarding areas where unfair practices were dropped in Japan's trade with the U.S., the report cited elimination of requests for voluntary export restraints on machine tools and automobiles. In trade with the European Union (EU), the report pointed out problems in four of the 12 areas, including abuse of antidumping measures, arbitrary approach in enforcing rules of origin and unfair tariff classification of mecadecks -- a vital component of videocassette recorders. On the other hand, the report appreciated the EU's abolition of discriminatory quantitative restrictions on Japanese exports in March of this year. The report found five problem areas in Japan's trade with South Korea. Among them are rules of origin policy, standard and certificate systems and an import source diversification system intended to restrict imports from Japan. Other countries and an area covered by this report are Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Canada and Hong Kong. This year's report reviewed for the first time the countries' agricultural policies and measures, an area newly agreed on under the recently concluded GATT Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks. During the negotiating process of the Uruguay Round, trade positions were very large from countries to countries on farm issues like rice. The report stressed the need for countries to actively use a new dispute settlement mechanism under the WTO, a multilateral trade body that is expected to replace GATT next January. WTO rules will have more enforcing power with a judicial mechanism that will no longer allow countries to block the WTO panel's findings against them under the so-called "negative consensus" system. "Making use of the strengthened dispute settlement procedures is a basic obligation of those who support the multilateral trading system. Japan should be an active user of these procedures when necessary," the report said. The report assessed several issues involved in accession to GATT by China and Taiwan. Japan basically supports early GATT membership by China and Taiwan, both among Japan's 10 largest trading partners. The report noted, "however, we recognize it is important that both must first bring into conformity their trade policies and measures with the WTO agreement." High tariffs and quantitative import restrictions are among problems to be overcome before their entry to GATT, the report said.
