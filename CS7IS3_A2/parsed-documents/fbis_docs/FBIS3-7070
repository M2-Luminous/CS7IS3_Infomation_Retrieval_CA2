In the package, set for release Tuesday, the government will probably state it "welcomes" private-sector efforts to boost buying of U.S.-made auto components and automobiles, said the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. He declined to be named. But the reference does not mean the government will guarantee results for plans by each carmaker, the official added. The package will be formulated as a way to resume failed "framework" trade talks between Japan and the United States. The two countries were unable to reach accord on "objective criteria" as a tool to measure Japan's imports.
