Relating to a Pilot Program for Execution of Odd-lot Market Orders February 7, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on December 27, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On February 4, 1994, the Amex submitted Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify the duration of this pilot extension. 1 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 See letter from Geraldine M. Brindisi, Corporate Secretary, Amex, to Diana Luka-Hopson, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated February 4, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Amex proposes to implement on a permanent basis its existing pilot procedures under Exchange Rule 205 requiring execution of odd-lot market orders at the prevailing Amex quote with no differential charged. In order to permit the pilot program to continue without interruption, the Exchange also requests that the existing program be extended for an additional six month period in order to provide the Commission with the further opportunity, if necessary, to assess the operation of the program beyond February 8, 1994. 2 2 The Amex original requested that this pilot program be extended for an additional three months. However, at the Commission's request, the Amex has agreed to extend the pilot until August 8, 1994, in order to provide the Commission with further opportunity to review the Exchange's request for permanent approval of the pilot procedures. See Amendment No. 1, supra , note 1. The Exchange seeks accelerated approval of the six month extension included in the proposed rule change in order to allow the pilot program, which expires on February 8, 1994, to continue without interruption. See letter from Geraldine M. Brindisi, Corporate Secretary, Amex, to Diana Luka-Hopson, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated February 1, 1994. The complete text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be exchanged at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The Commission has approved, on a pilot basis extending to February 8, 1994, amendments to Exchange Rule 205 to require the execution of odd-lot market orders at the prevailing Amex quote with no odd-lot differential. 3 These procedures initially were approved by the Commission on a pilot basis, 4 and subsequently were extended seven times. 5 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32726 (August 9, 1993), 58 FR 43394 (August 16, 1993) (approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;24). 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26445 (January 10, 1989), 54 FR 2248 (January 19, 1989) (approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;88&hyph;23). 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 32726 (August 9, 1993), 58 FR 43394 (August 16, 1993) (approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;24); 31828 (February 5, 1993) 58 FR 8434 (February 12, 1993) (approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;06); 30305 (January 30, 1992), 57 FR 4653 (February 6, 1992) (approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;92&hyph;04); 29922 (November 8, 1991), 56 FR 58409 (November 19, 1991) (approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;91&hyph;30); 29186 (May 9, 1991), 56 FR 22488 (May 15, 1991) (approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;91&hyph;09); 28758 (January 10, 1991), 56 FR 1656 (January 16, 1991) (approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;90&hyph;39); and 27590 (January 5, 1990), 55 FR 1123 (January 11, 1990) (approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;89&hyph;31). Under the pilot procedures, odd-lot market orders with no qualifying notations are executed at the Amex quotation at the time the order is represented in the market, either by being received at the trading post or through the Exchange's Post Execution Reporting (``PER'') System. Enhancements to the PER system have been implemented to provide for the automatic execution of odd-lot market orders entered through PER. For purposes of the pilot program, odd-lot limit orders that are immediately executable based on the Amex quote at the time order is received, at the trading post or through PER, are executed in the same manner as odd-lot market orders.
