According to a communique issued by the Justice and Police Department, the meeting dealt primarily with the political issues of migration and domestic security. In addition, the ministers signed an agreement which settles the reciprocal acceptance of illegal immigrants staying in either country. This bilateral agreement also lays down the transportation conditions for those illegal foreigners from other countries being repatriated by Switzerland or Hungary. This measure is important for the repatriation of rejected asylum-seekers. The agreement is based on the principles embodied in the agreements signed by Hungary with neighboring countries. The decisive factor for repatriation is not the illegal crossing of the border, but the fact that the person was previously a legal and long-term resident of another country. Imre Konya also expressed his wish to see increased collaboration in the fight against terrorism and organized crime. According to the communique, both ministers agree that an effective migration policy and an efficient fight against organized crime must come through close international cooperation.
