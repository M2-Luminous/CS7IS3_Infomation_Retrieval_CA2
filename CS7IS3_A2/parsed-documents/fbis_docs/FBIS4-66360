Thus, "guaranteeing that the No. 5 generator is formally placed into operation during the second quarter of 1994 and striving to place the No. 6 generator into operation by the end of 1994" have become the increasingly urgent goals of the builders of the Manas power plant second-phase expansion project. A key state project during the Eighth 5-Year Plan and a key project of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the second-phase expansion project at Manas power plant (two 100MW generators, the No. 5 and No. 6 units) will involve a total investment of 375 million yuan. Since the ground was broken to start construction on 1 September 1992, an investment of 180 million yuan has been completed.
