He said this today at the Tandil air base, during the commemoration of the 12th anniversary of the Argentine Air Force's baptism of fire. President Carlos Menem attended the ceremony accompanied by Army Commander Lieutenant General Martin Balza and several government officials. During the ceremony to commemorate the Air Force's baptism of fire in 1982, Paulik said: "Man and his instruction will forever be the marrow of military organization," despite the "evolution of scientific and technological progress." "Technological progress will be of little use if the military career, the will to serve, the esprit de corps, loyalty, and the total conviction of our role as members of the armed branch of the nation is downgraded," Paulik said. He added: "The current moment poses serious questions regarding the Armed Forces" but he considered that it "inadmissible to doubt or judge the function of maintaining national sovereignty." The ceremony was also attended by former Air Force commanders Carlos Alberto Rey, Omar Graffigna, and Arturo Lami Dozo, Military Affairs Secretary Jorge Baeza, and union leader Diego Ibanez. Brig. Gen. Paulik said the Air Force "has not given up the supreme mandate of acting as part of the military instrument at the service of the objectives of the National Government." Finally, the Air Force chief paid homage to the pilots who fought in the South Atlantic war, describing them as "true examples of the duty of all Argentines, not just a few, to defend the motherland."
