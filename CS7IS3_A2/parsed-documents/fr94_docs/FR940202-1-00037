FR940202-1-00037 FR940202-1-00014 At present, California red-legged frogs are known to occur in about 190 streams or drainages from 15 counties in central and southern California. Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties support the greatest amount of currently occupied habitat. The most secure aggregations of California red-legged frogs are found in aquatic sites that support substantial riparian and aquatic vegetation and lack exotic predators (e.g., bullfrogs, mosquitofish, largemouth and smallmouth bass). The majority of aggregations are threatened, however, by expansion of exotic predators, proposed residential development, water storage projects, and other factors. For example, within the Central Valley hydrographic basin, only six drainages, all on the Coast range slope of the San Joaquin Valley, are known or likely to support California red-legged frogs, compared to over 60 historic locality records for this basin. Two of these drainages, known to support significant numbers of California red-legged frogs, are sites of proposed large reservoir projects. Also, in southern California, California red-legged frogs are known from only 4 locations south of the Tehachapi Mountains, compared to over 80 historic locality records for this region. Only three areas currently support more than 350 adults. Previous Federal Action On January 29, 1992, the Service received a petition from Drs. Mark R. Jennings, Marc P. Hayes, and Dan C. Holland to list the California red-legged frog ( Rana aurora draytonii ). The petition specified endangered or threatened status by distinct drainages (watersheds) within the range of the species. On October 5, 1992, the Service published a 90-day petition finding (57 FR 45761) that substantial information had been presented indicating the requested action may be warranted. Public comments were requested on the status of this species. The California red-legged frog had been included as a Category 1 candidate species in the Service's November 21, 1991, Animal Notice of Review (56 FR 58804). Category 1 candidates are species for which the Service has substantial information on biological vulnerability and threat to support proposals to list them as endangered or threatened. On July 19, 1993, the Service published a 12-month finding on the petitioned action (58 FR 38553). This finding indicated that listing of the California red-legged frog was warranted and that a proposed rule would be published promptly.
