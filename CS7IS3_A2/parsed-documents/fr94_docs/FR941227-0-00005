FR941227-0-00005 FR941227-0-00002 One commenter believes that, although delegation will reduce costs to OPM, it will increase them for the agencies. Based on the relatively small number of reconsideration decisions that OPM issues each year for the entire Government, it is unlikely that any agency will have a large enough volume of reconsideration requests to affect costs. However, if an agency should find that it is getting an unusually large number of reconsideration requests, it may find that the procedures or training it is giving to personnel staff in its installations need to be reviewed and strengthened. One commenter requested that OPM issue procedures regarding the review of agency actions when heirs contest the life insurance coverage of a deceased employee. This kind of dispute is a claims issue rather than an enrollment issue. Life insurance claims are handled by the Office of Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance (OFEGLI). If it appears that enrollment issues are involved OFEGLI normally contacts OPM for help in resolving the matter. Since this kind of dispute must be resolved on a case-by-case basis, detailed procedures for agencies are inappropriate. One commenter suggested that OPM give agencies more flexibility in the enrollment and change in enrollment rules. OPM is currently developing regulations that would bring much greater flexibility to the rules for enrolling in FEHB plans and for changing FEHB enrollments. We expect to issue these as proposed regulations within the next few months. One commenter asked how these regulations would apply to decisions on FEGLI and FEHB issues previously handled solely by the agency or the retirement system (for example, whether an employee meets the requirements for continuing coverage into retirement, whether a spouse meets the eligibility requirements for present or future benefits from the retirement system, or whether an individual meets the requirements for FEHB coverage as a hostage under Public Law 101&hyph;513). These regulations affect only reconsideration decisions that were previously made by OPM under ยง870.205 and ยง890.104, which will now be made by the employing agencies (or retirement system, if appropriate) rather than OPM. Agency and retirement system decisions made under other provisions are unaffected by these regulations. One commenter asserted that, since OPM has the statutory authority to administer both of these programs and to enter into contracts with carriers, these regulations constitute an abrogation of OPM's authority as plan sponsor. OPM disagrees. Both the FEGLI and the FEHB laws are structured so that agencies perform the day-to-day functions necessary to handle their employees' enrollments and enrollment changes. Although OPM has performed the reconsideration function in the past, the law does not prohibit the delegation of this function to agencies. Two commenters expresses the concern that employees would not have their cases reviewed outside the agency. One of these felt that, since FEGLI and FEHB decisions are not appealable to the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB), OPM should review these cases because it is responsible for the policies on which they are based. The other felt that OPM has the expertise necessary to resolve enrollment disputes that agencies lack, and that no change should be made unless chapter 71 of title 5, U.S. Code, is amended to allow employees to grieve agency decisions on FEGLI and FEHB enrollment issues. It is true that FEGLI and FEHB decisions are not subject to review by the Merit Systems Protection Board nor may they be grieved under chapter 71 of title 5, U.S. Code. We believe that, for the most part, agencies already have the expertise necessary to make these decisions and that a level of administrative review that is independent of the agency is unnecessary. OPM will provide guidance and other assistance to agencies in setting up procedures for making reconsideration decisions. One commenter suggested that we set a time limit on the length of the retroactive period that agencies may authorize. We do not believe that setting an arbitrary time limit would be appropriate. A retroactive correction must be based on an administrative error and the employee must request a retroactive correction. The agency must consider each case on its own merits. Most requests for retroactive correction are for FEHB enrollment issues. Generally, these are self-limiting in terms of the length of the retroactive period because carriers generally require that claims be made no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the one in which the medical service was provided. However, we recognize that agencies do not have experience in granting retroactive corrections; therefore, we are modifying the FEHB regulations so that they apply only to retroactive corrections of administrative errors that occur after December 31, 1994.
