Al-Qadhdhafi begins his speech by thanking the audience for a warm welcome. He says he values the courage displayed by the masses in this area against the possibilities of confrontation with the enemy and coping with economic sanctions. He underlines the fact that many tribes in Libya used to boast about how many martyrs they had given in their fight against the Italians. Today, Libyans are facing a direct confrontation with America and Europe. When you want to abuse someone you call him a renegade, he says, but no Libyan family wants to bring up a renegade. Al-Qadhdhafi goes on to talk about the Muslim Brotherhood and other religious fanatics. He describes them as people who reneged on Islam and the prophet's teachings. Foreign intelligence agencies are behind these Islamic tendencies, he states. The West wants Arab oil and it will do anything to get it. During the life of the Prophet Muhammad none of these Islamic movements existed. The Zoroastrians brought many of their rituals into Islam in the early days of the faith -- things that are alien to Islam, he says. There is a cold war going on today between the enemy and Libyans, he continues. America cannot send its sons to Libya to be killed, nor does it want to sacrifice its children on Libyan soil. As for traitors, these are dealt with by the police and the law, and the people set on them and burn their homes and their farms. Treason is under siege by the Libyan people. No one today can commit treason against the people and get away with it, he concludes. Al-Qadhdhafi goes on to say that the people of Abu Salim represent the entire people of Libya from the point of Arabism, patriotism, and other traits. The people of Abu Salim should bring up their children the right way. The general people's congresses are the place to make laws and to decide on many issues. The important thing is that the people must consume what they themselves produce and they must forget about importing worthless European goods, he says. Libyans should exploit all the potential they have at their disposal whether industrial or agricultural. Every family should regard oil as if it never existed in Libya and should therefore live without its benefits. If the West does not want to buy Libyan oil, so be it, he stresses. Libyans will not kneel or beg them to buy the oil. Libyans should boycott Japanese goods because Japan was one of the first to impose the sanctions, al-Qadhdhafi says. Libyans fought against the Italians long before the Italians started to export Italian goods and foods. Libyans should not import anything from the West if the West keeps its hostility to Libya, he concludes.
