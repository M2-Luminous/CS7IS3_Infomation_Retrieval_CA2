His action is not in response to the opposition party demands that have accompanied the outbreak of the affair, since the justice minister allegedly offered his resignation on Monday [20 June], immediately after the publication of the names of the recipients of loans. There have been many pressures for his replacement in the past, however, none of these demands referred to his work as justice minister. It is not known yet whether Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek will accept his resignation. Last night Drnovsek merely stated that he would demand a report from the incumbent service and resort to replacements if need be.
