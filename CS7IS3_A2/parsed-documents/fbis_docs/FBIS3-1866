The mining industry is a basic industry in China's national economy, including undertakings in coal, the chemical industry, nonferrous metals, construction materials, the metallurgical industry, and geology and mineral resources. China has abundant natural resources and can be considered a major producer of mineral resources. At present, the number of minerals that have been surveyed as being abundant is 151. China ranks third in the world both in terms of the potential value of its mineral resources and as a producer of mineral ores. In recent years, it has considerably raised the output of raw and semifinished materials which depend on mineral products for their raw materials. China's output of coal ores, cement, and glass has been the largest in the world, and its output of steel and nonferrous metals, crude oil, and gold has been, respectively, the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-largest in the world. Economists made the following comment on the issue: The development of the mining industry has enormously increased China's comprehensive national strength and has laid a material foundation for realizing the second-step strategic objective. While deepening reform and gearing up toward the market, China's mining industry has been actively seeking international markets. It has been learned that cooperation in marine oil exploration, which is generally concerned with international joint ventures, has continually expanded. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation has signed agreements with 50 companies from 13 countries and regions to open up 560,000 square km of the ocean's area, and foreign companies have accumulatively invested $3.68 billion of funds. China has made various types of progress in joint ventures to develop mineral resources with Brazil, Mongolia, and South Africa. China has jointly launched more than 30 geological exploration undertakings and surveying projects for mineral resources with 17 countries and regions. More than 20 Chinese mineral surveying teams have entered the international market, and these have contracts for more than 100 projects. China's new nuclear power and nuclear fuel industry has also begun to enter the international market. A Pakistani nuclear power project, which was the first nuclear power plant exported by China, is progressing smoothly. According to the leaders of relevant departments and commissions and mining industry representatives attending the meeting, even though China has made attention-catching accomplishments in developing its mining industry, it is still facing an arduous situation with many problems and restraining factors obstructing its path of progress. Therefore, they proposed: It is necessary to deepen reform in the mining industry's structure, particularly to enhance reform in enterprise and investment, mining rights, and social security systems.
