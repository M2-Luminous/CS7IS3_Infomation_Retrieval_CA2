Mr Rifkind, who offered his condolences to the men's relatives, told the Radio Four PM programme: "Clearly it is a matter of great tragedy. Great sympathy is extended to them." Mr Rifkind, speaking during an official visit to the United States, said: "We know that these people have lost their lives carrying out their duty in a very difficult situation. I believe it's appropriate that we should all therefore wish to pay tribute to them." The Ministry of Defence [MoD] in London said it was still seeking details about the British casualties. More than 20 people are believed to have been aboard the two helicopters. The MoD was refusing to release the names of the dead personnel until next of kin were informed. One report said the Britons were a colonel and a major. The servicemen were part of the British contingent making up a defence coalition with the United States and France set up to protect Kurds in northern Iraq. A MoD spokesman said: "We have been in the area since the Gulf war. We're there with our allies providing a degree of safety for the Kurdish people. The no-fly zone was imposed to give the Kurds in the area practical protection." He declined to comment on the numbers of British forces personnel serving in the area.
