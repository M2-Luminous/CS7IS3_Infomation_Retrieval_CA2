FR941011-2-00137 FR941011-2-00088 Currently, PHLX Rule 1014 and Advice F&hyph;6 establish a maximum quote spread of $1.00 for index options with bids of $20.00 or more. The PHLX proposes to amend the quote spread parameters for XOC options to establish the following parameters for XOC options with bids of $20.00 or more: $2.00 for XOC options with bids of $20.00 to less than $40.00; and $3.00 for XOC options with bids of $40.00 or more. According to the PHLX, recent volatility in the XOC caused floor officials to temporarily widen the quote spreads for XOC options pursuant to Advice F&hyph;6. 5 The Exchange proposes to codify these wider quote spread parameters for higher-priced XOC series. 5 Advice F&hyph;6 states that relief from the established bid/ask differentials may be granted upon the receipt of approval of two floor officials. The Commission notes that Advice F&hyph;6 permits an exception from the quote spread parameters only on a case-by-case basis. The PHLX states that the purpose of the wider quotations is to reflect the wider bid/ask differential in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') securities underlying the XOC, which market participants purchase in order to hedge XOC exposure. According to the Exchange, the aggregate bid/ask differential for the XOC's component securities is often greater than $5.00. 6 6 The bid/ask differential in the underlying securities is determined by adding the bids for such securities and dividing by 100 (the number of securities comprising the XOC) to arrive at the composite bid; to arrive at a composite, or average, offer, the offers for the underlying securities are similarly added together and divided by 100. The PHLX states that the bid/ask differential in XOC options is particularly problematic with respect to higher-priced option series because the higher bids represent a greater premium dollar value and thus more risk. Thus, the Exchange notes that a $40.00 bid represents a $4,000 premium. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to widen the XOC quote spread parameter only for higher-priced series. Moreover, the PHLX notes that the XOC series priced at $20.00 or less are most often chosen for investment by public customers ( i.e., ``customers'' who are not associated with broker-dealer organizations or subject to discretionary authorization by associated persons of broker-dealers). 7 7 See also September 22 Letter, supra note 4. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular with section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, as well as to protect investors and the public interest, because widening higher-priced XOC quote spread parameters should facilitate hedging, and, in turn, liquidity. The Commission has considered carefully the opinions of the commenter and the PHLX and finds, for the following reasons, that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5) in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade. 8 Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposal to establish wider quote spread parameters for XOC options priced at over $20 is designed to facilitate hedging in higher-priced XOC options, thereby helping XOC specialists to meet their affirmative market making obligations and providing for increased liquidity in higher-priced XOC series. According to the PHLX, the aggregate bid/ask differential for the securities underlying the XOC is $5&hyph;6, while the current bid/ask differential for XOC options priced at over $20 is $1. The PHLX states that the proposed quotations for XOC options priced at over $20 are designed to reflect the wider bid/ask differential of the securities underlying the XOC, which market participants purchase to hedge XOC exposure. Thus, the PHLX believes that the wider quote spread parameters will facilitate hedging of high-priced XOC options. 9 8 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). 9 See September 22 Letter, supra note 4.
