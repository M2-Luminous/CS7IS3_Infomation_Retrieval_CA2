FR940606-2-00081 FR940606-2-00057 The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register . Specifically, Amendment No. 1 removes the DPM as one of the persons authorized to impose a temporary suspension of trading. Because the DPM performs market making functions, in addition to having the responsibilities of an OBO, the Commission believes it would be inappropriate for a DPM to be able to suspend trading in a class of options for any period of time. Amendment No. 1 also makes certain clarifications to the proposed rule language. The Commission believes that these clarifications will minimize any potential for confusion as to the application of the rule. As a result, the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 1 on an accelerated basis. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should refer to the File Number SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;47 and should be submitted by June 27, 1994. It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 8 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;47) is approved. 8 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 9 9 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
