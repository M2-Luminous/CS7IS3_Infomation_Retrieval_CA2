Following the meeting he told newsmen that the Indonesia-Malaysia common border problem is expected to be completely settled within a period of six years. He said that several areas along the common border, which are difficult for the surveyors to identify, will be completely demarcated by the year 2000. This is possible through close cooperation between the two countries. Last year, the duration for the demarcation and survey work along the common border was increased to seven months annually instead of three months as it was in the past. He said that efforts to settle the problem have to be intensified because even though the joint demarcation project was launched 19 years ago, only 27 percent of the East Kalimatan-Sabah boundary line and 35 percent of the West Kalimantan-Sarawak border have been surveyed and demarcated.
