The sources said Tawfiq 'Abd-al-Hayy maintained close relations with the Russian ambassador in Greece and introduced him to Libyan officials. Libya was to pay Russia $1.8 billion immediately in return for Russia using its veto when the draft resolution to impose new sanctions against Libya came up for voting at the UN Security Council. The deal failed because Russia wanted the money paid before it used the veto. Libya suspected that Russia would take the money and consider it part repayment for Libyan debts to Russia and would not use the veto. Libya transferred just $65 million and the deal failed. It is known that the fugitive millionaire, who is wanted in Egypt, maintains close relations with 'Abdallah al-Sanusi, a close aide to al-Qadhdhafi and the man responsible for his security. ROSE AL-YUSUF has learned that the Libyan Council of Ministers recently submitted to Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi a memorandum demanding an investigation into all the funds paid to middlemen to solve the Lockerbie crisis without result.
