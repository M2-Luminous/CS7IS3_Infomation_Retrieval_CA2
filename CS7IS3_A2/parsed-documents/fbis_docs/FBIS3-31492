FBIS3-31492 "dreeu034__a94013" FBIS-EEU-94-034-A Document Type:Daily Report 18 February 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic RESPEKT Reports on Issue AU1802150694 Prague CTK in English 2230 GMT 17 Feb 94 AU1802150694 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, February 17 (CTK) -- An article in the political weekly RESPEKT comments on the announcement by the World Bank that it was ending all negotiations concerning a second loan of $225 million to the Czech Energy Works (CEZ) to be invested into improving the polluting coal-fired power stations of north Bohemia. The World Bank's decision to stop the Energy II loan comes just as the American congress is deciding whether to guarantee a loan of $317 million from the Ex-Im Bank to the Westinghouse company for the completion of Temelin nuclear power station in south Bohemia. A report issued by the Bank Information Center, an independent organization monitoring the work of several large banks, gives lack of interest on the part of the Czech Government as the reason for ending the talks on the Energy II loan. "Our relations with the World Bank have cooled so much that the talks were not going well," RESPEKT quotes CEZ spokesman Michal Kacena as saying. Kacena said Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus was to blame here for having said in Washington at the end of last year that the Czech Republic was not so badly off as to need developmental aid. Detailed reasons for the freezing of negotiations between the World Bank and the Czech side remain unclear, RESPEKT says, but very probably concern the inability of the Czech Government to guarantee the loan from its resources, which are almost used up from guaranteeing the first loan (Energy I), the Ingolstadt pipeline, the development of telecommunications and the motorway to Germany, and now possibly for the Ex-Im Bank loan for Temelin. RESPEKT said the key question was put to the CEZ chief spokesman last week when the English-language weekly THE PRAGUE POST asked if the reason for stopping the Energy II loan was that the money necessary for state guarantee had been swallowed up by the guarantee for Temelin. The answer was "probably yes." It can be seen once more, RESPEKT writes, that last year's government decision to complete Temelin is bringing the country a whole number of economic problems. Moreover, it is being confirmed that the completion of Temelin is using up money which would otherwise be invested into north Bohemia. The two loans from the World Bank, which refuses to finance nuclear power in any way, are to help desulfurize coal-fired power stations and to make their operation more efficient. If the Energy II loan is not forthcoming, CEZ has three means of finding money to clean up the coal-fired power stations. Either it slows down their closure program and does not desulfurize them, or it increases the price of electricity, or it exports electricity. Already last year CEZ broke a government regulation by exporting around 3 percent of the total electricity produced here instead of the approved 1.5 percent. Most of this went to Italy and Switzerland. If this had not happened, RESPEKT writes, at least two of the four blocs of the Tusimice II coal power station [could have been closed]. Last year the export of electricity brought CEZ 2 billion crowns. The completion of Temelin costs approximately 20 million crowns a day. The Children of the Earth environmental organization wants parliament to approve a law saying that the annual export of electricity may not exceed its import (last year the Czech Republic exported 3000 GwH and imported 885 GwH). Meanwhile CEZ makes no secret of the future export of electricity from Temelin. "Financing the loan for Temelin nuclear power station to the amount of 30 billion crowns will ensure without problems the future production of electricity in this power station and its sale at home or abroad. The repayment of foreign credits by future export (approximately a quarter of the yearly output for 10 years) would also help the Czech Republic's hard currency balance," the CEZ public relations department said in 1992. At the close of the article RESPEKT points out that last year's report by the World Bank (the one which Klaus said was "written overnight in a hotel," and therefore held no force for the Czech Government) says that "the medium-demand scenario for electricity shows that there will be no need of electricity from Temelin between 1995 and 2010." The report was written by Dale Grey, chief economist of the World Bank's Energy and Environmental Division.
