Many have already left -- 300,000 people did so in 1993 alone. Even more are planning to leave. One-half of the 17-million population of the [world's] ninth largest state are members of ethnic minorities, and ethnic tension is on the rise. There are varying reasons for potential conflict. Konstantin Erlikh, chairman of the Republic's "German Rebirth" Society, explains why people want to leave Kazakhstan. It is not only a case of economic necessity, but also of the "Kazakhization of the country," which does not promise ethnic minorities a political future. This is also compounded by the problem of citizenship. In a country rich in fuel resources people are freezing and suffering for want of food. Anyone who is able to leave is doing so, heading for Germany in particular. The number of mixed-marriage families among the emigres has risen appreciably as Germans persuade their partners of a different nationality to try for happiness in the West. With the adoption of the Constitution on 28 January 1992, Kazakh was officially declared the state language. Anyone who wants to remain in state service has to speak Kazakh and such people are very few and far between among the local Germans and Russians. The result is that the number of representatives of the ethnic minorities in leadership structures and the ministerial apparatus has dropped noticeably in a short period, representatives of "German Rebirth" say. According to them, anyone who does not have influential members of their ethnic minorities in very important positions will find it incredibly difficult to combat all-powerful officials in the corrupt morass in which God forbid you utter a "foreign" word. By the end of 1995 every non-Kazakh will have to say whether he wants to become a Kazakhstani citizen or not. Anyone who decides to obtain a Kazakhstani passport must bear in mind that it will be even harder to leave the country then. Anyone who takes the reverse decision will find themselves without citizenship in Kazakhstan after 1995. In line with legislation, Germany allows a maximum of 230,000 emigres from the former Soviet Union to enter its country each year. At the same time the federal government is trying to contain [soderzhat] immigration by providing Kazakhstan with economic aid. Since 1990, around 80 million German marks have vanished into Kazakhstan. The ethnic minorities' only hope is President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has officially assured them: "We do not want to divide our people into them and us." Kazakhstan will hardly be able to manage without Russian Germans or Russians, otherwise its development will come to a standstill. The departure of 45,000 Russians in 1992 was a serious blow to Kazakhstan, particularly if you consider the fact that the bulk of the Russians were members of the intelligentsia. The Russian Germans are also very essential. They are diligent artisans and peasants. However, aid is going no further than official declarations since in reality there are hardly any traces of it to be found. Why for instance is there still no Goethe Institute in Alma-Ata [Almaty] although the money has long since been provided? And why, lastly, are representatives of the ethnic minorities disappearing from important state positions if they are nonetheless essential, Germans wonder as they pack their bags?
