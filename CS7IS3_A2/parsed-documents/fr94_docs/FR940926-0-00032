FR940926-0-00032 FR940926-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 93&hyph;02; Notice 05] RIN [2127&hyph;AF14] Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Compressed Natural Gas Fuel Container Integrity AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule establishes a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard, Standard No. 304, Compressed Natural Gas Fuel Containers , that specifies performance requirements applicable to compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel containers: a pressure cycling test evaluates a container's durability; a burst test evaluates a container's initial strength; and a bonfire test evaluates a container's pressure relief characteristics. In addition, the final rule specifies labeling requirements for CNG containers. The purpose of this new standard is to reduce deaths and injuries occurring from fires that result from fuel leakage from CNG containers. DATES: Effective Date: The Standard becomes effective March 27, 1995. Incorporation by reference: The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of March 27, 1995. Petitions for Reconsideration: Any petition for reconsideration of this rule must be received by NHTSA no later than October 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Petitions for reconsideration of this rule should refer to Docket 93&hyph;02; Notice 5 and should be submitted to: Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Gary R. Woodford, NRM&hyph;01.01, Special Projects Staff, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (202&hyph;366&hyph;4931).

General Information Natural gas is a vapor that is lighter than air at standard temperature and pressure. 1 When used as a motor fuel, natural gas is typically stored on-board a vehicle in cylindrical containers at a pressure of approximately 20,684 kPa pressure (3,000 psi). Natural gas is kept in this compressed state to increase the amount that can be stored on-board the vehicle. This in turn serves to increase the vehicle's driving range. Since natural gas is a flammable fuel and is stored under high pressure, natural gas containers pose a potential risk to motor vehicle safety. 1 Standard temperature is 0 Celsius or 32 Fahrenheit and standard pressure is 101.4 kiloPascals (kPa) or 147.7 pounds per square inch (psi). Vehicles powered by CNG have not been numerous to date, although they are increasing. The number of CNG vehicles in the United States more than doubled from 10,300 in 1990 to 23,800 at the end of 1992. The number of CNG vehicles is projected to again double to an estimated 50,800 vehicles in 1994. As discussed in detail in a final rule regarding CNG vehicles published on April 25, 1994, recent Federal legislation, as well as the need to meet environmental and energy security goals, will lead to greater increases in the production and use of these vehicles.
