Mainland enterprises' transnational business activities are developing step by step along the "mainland-Hong Kong-overseas" route. In the beginning, businesses primarily concentrated on commerce, trade, resources development, contracting for construction projects, transportation and communication, and international tourism. Up to the end of last year, the total number of overseas enterprises reached 4,500 in 120 countries and regions throughout the world. The Hong Kong-based China-funded large enterprises -- such as the China Resources group, China Merchants Steam Navigation group, China Travel Service group, CITIC Pacific group, Everbright group, and Guangdong group -- have indeed developed into transnational corporations, and their business channels have already reached out to many destinations overseas. The mainland enterprises which are listed in Hong Kong, such as Tsingtao Brewery Company Limited, Beiren Printing Machinery Holdings Limited, Guangzhou Shipyard International Company Limited, Maanshan Iron and Steel, Shanghai Petrochemical Company Limited, Yizheng Chemical Fiber, and Kunming Machine Tools, as well as the several companies which are listed in the United States, have in fact taken the first step toward becoming transnational companies. Over the past two or three years, proceeding from trading companies, the mainland's overseas enterprises have one after another organized comprehensive commercial associations, that is, have grouped together some overseas enterprises and a large number of medium and small enterprises which are not very strong, to form transnational groups which possess great strength. For example, 20 large enterprises in Beijing, which engage in different trades, have organized themselves into a joint-stock transnational group, which possesses strong points in the areas of trading, industry, science, agriculture, and commerce and is vigorously exploring the market in Latin America. In Shanghai, approximately 480 overseas enterprises have recently reorganized themselves into five major overseas groups of companies situated in America, Oceania, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Japan, and Hong Kong. Early this year, the West Europe Group of Companies was founded. At the same time, the mainland authorities are encouraging large enterprises to go overseas for development. For example, in an international bid at the end of 1992, Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation bought the Peru Iron Mine, which had been losing money for years; one year later, the loss-making situation stopped and profits began to roll in, amounting to $7 million. One and a half years ago, the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation joined hands with Li Ka-shing to buy the Tung Wing group in Hong Kong; thereafter, it bought four listed companies in Hong Kong and set up its Hong Kong and U.S. headquarters. For example, the CITIC group recently bought Australia's largest meat processing enterprise at a price of 100 million Australian dollars, and the China National Petroleum Corporation joined hands with a Japanese company and a Chinese company in investing $1 billion in exploring and operating an oil zone in central Papua New Guinea. These are some of the success stories. Recently, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation revealed that it will spend five years building a transnational oil company, which will include a number of sole companies limited and a number of joint-stock companies, with some controlling a majority of shares while others holding a minority of shares. At present, the company is exploring and building 11 oil fields, which are expected to produce 12 million tons of oil and 4 billion cubic meters of gas annually by 1997. In the past, the company has absorbed $3.8 billion of foreign funds and has signed 94 contracts with 55 companies in the international community; it has already acquired the scale of a big international company, and will quickly develop into a transnational petroleum group. Mainland experts point out that, with the continuous increase in China's strength and its improvement of its operational methods, by following the path taken by the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, China will have a large number of companies developing into transnational groups.
