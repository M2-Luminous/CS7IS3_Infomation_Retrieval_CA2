The agreement, which was reached at the new multilateral talks (of the Uruguay round) last December, was originally scheduled to be put into force in July 1995; however, moves to put the agreement into effect six months earlier than scheduled have been noted. Thus, when the factor of time is taken into consideration, it will be difficult for GATT to approve China's membership. China regards its participation in GATT as an important step in joining the framework of economic regulations of the international community. And, in a bid to win membership, China has started making preparations. For example, it is busily engaged in talks on tariff cuts with various nations and in trying to work out a unified exchange rate for the Yuan. Once the agreement reached at the Uruguay round becomes effective, GATT will be changed into the new WTO (World Trade Organization). However, if China's membership is not approved before the WTO's inauguration, "China will be forced to start its membership application over again after the WTO's inauguration and would fall behind schedule by a wide margin in obtaining GATT membership," (as stated by a MOFA source). The United States has proposed putting the Uruguay round agreement into effect six months earlier than originally scheduled because it believes there will be no problem in getting ratification from Congress. Moreover, the EU (European Union) intends, in principle, to agree to this proposal. China will hold bilateral working-level negotiations in Geneva as early as 20 March in a bid to win GATT membership. However, if the agreement should be put into effect earlier than originally scheduled, it is expected China will have difficulties in obtaining approval for membership. As far as Japan is concerned, it believes: "If China's participation in GATT is delayed, Taiwan, which is scheduled to join GATT at the same time as China, will also be affected", (according to the same source). Therefore, Japan is concerned over the possibility that China and Taiwan, which now impose a serious influence on economic activities in East Asia, will be kept out of the GATT system. Japan plans to make greater behind-the-scenes efforts to urge European countries and the United States to cooperate in giving their approval -- as early as at the ministerial conference to sign the agreement to be held in Morocco in mid-April. Moreover, Japan is studying the possibility of indicating its stance of opposing the plan to put the Uruguay round agreement into effect earlier than originally scheduled.
