President Kliridhis made the statement after his meeting at the Presidential Palace today with Lieutenant General Alevromayiros, first deputy chief of the Greek Army General Staff. He also expressed full satisfaction over the joint Cyprus-Greece defense doctrine and noted that at the meeting they also exchanged views on the doctrine, adding that both sides are proceeding with the preparation of a Cyprus defense plan. President Kliridhis also referred to the Turkish plan, which was revealed by the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation last night, aimed at justifying their rejection of the confidence-building measures [CBM's] by creating the impression that the coexistence of Greek and Turkish Cypriots is impossible. The president expressed the conviction that the Turks will not succeed in justifying their positions because, he stressed, it is well known that there have been no provocations by the Greek Cypriot side. He added: The Turkish side rejected the CBM's because of a lack of political will. Lt. Gen. Alevromayiros expressed thanks to the Cyprus Government for the material and moral support it renders to ELDIK [Greek Forces of Cyprus]. [passage omitted]
