Union of Workers and Peasants Intends To Restore Soviets"] [Text] A Union of Workers, Peasants, and Working Intelligentsia has been created in Yekaterinburg, the Russian president's home town. The existence of such an organization in the Urals, where all processes connected with economic change proceed more painfully than anywhere else, could have a serious influence on the political situation in the region. Yesterday's sitting of the Coordination Council of this organization was attended by a visitor from Moscow -- Oleg Shenin, chairman of the UCP [Union of Communist Parties]-CPSU. The Union has been joined by the local branches of the Russian Communist Workers Party, the "Worker" association, the "Russian Union" national-patriotic association, the Agro-Industrial Complex trade union, and the teachers strike committee. The communists hope they will soon be joined by local members of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. While the Union was created way back in early 1993, the question of its official registration appeared to its leaders "untimely" until recently. However, the opposition's success in the December elections and the activization of the opposition forces in Moscow urged the Urals' leftists to emerge from "hiding." The arrival of Oleg Shenin seems also to be intended to underline the importance of the coming registration of the Union and its reliable connections with Moscow comrades. Despite the fact that the Union is a rather mixed bag, its members, the organizers are convinced, have common goals and only "insignificant differences" on tactics. Their immediate demands to the Federal Assembly and the government seem rather traditional: modify the tax system, provide state protection for commodity producers and a broader state protection system for the working people, ensure timely payment of wages. The Union conscientiously stresses economic demands -- they are more readily understood by the ordinary voter. The organization's only political task is to restore the soviets as "government of the people." At the same time, the organizers state, their Union is no opponent of reforms "with the exception of those that infringe on the interests of the working people." Entrepreneurs and bankers in the Urals have virtually ignored the consolidation of the communist and socialist forces. Maybe this is explained by the local elite's rather firm confidence in their power and their ability to prevent activization of the leftists. At the same time, it is possible, by expertly directing their consolidated forces, to bring pressure to bear on the federal authorities and the rich Moscow commercial structures which are increasingly infiltrating the industrial Urals.
