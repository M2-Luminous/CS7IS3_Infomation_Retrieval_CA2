"It is clear that the goal of Meciar's efforts is the gradual split of the Peter Weiss-led SDL into two parts, of which one will be finally swallowed by Meciar in the form of the so-called functional coalition," the weekly writes. It adds that the resistance of SDL deputies so far probably results from the disturbing example of the Slovak National Party (SNS) the HZDS's coalition partner now facing a split due to similar reasons. However, Meciar believes that everybody can be bought, its only the price what matters, the paper writes. That is why Meciar's offers have been still higher and have been repeated with "incredible persistence." The SDL leadership is aware that if Meciar gains more economic power, he would finally destroy their party. "Forty-eight HZDS deputies of the total of 66 run their own businesses, and Meciar has promised them that they will also privatize in a short time," DOMINO EFEKT quotes Borzova as saying. "Therefore it is politically unbearable for the SDL that the posts of privatization minister and chairman of the National Property Fund continue to be held by the Premier," the paper states. If the government draft amendment to the large privatization law is passed at the current parliamentary session, the opposition could definitively "give up everything," it adds. The weekly notes that Meciar has asked Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak to appoint him general. "Fortunately this is not aimed at gaining further powers, but making an impression," DOMINO EFEKT comments, adding that the appointment is to take place within two months.
