A foreign office spokesman here expressed the Pakistan government's "deep regret" at the escalation of fighting in Kabul. He said the aerial bombardment was posing "greater danger to civilians" living in the war-weary Afghan capital. He fervently appealed to all the Afghan factions involved in the clashes to agree to a temporary cease-fire for 24 hours starting from 6:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) Friday "so that all diplomatic and UN personnel living in Kabul and people wounded in the six days of fighting could be evacuated on emergency basis." "The government of Pakistan hopes that all Afghan leaders would respond positively to this appeal," the spokesman said in a statement here. Pakistan had earlier twice appealed for an immediate ceasefire in Kabul, scene of the worst power struggle, and other Afghan cities in the past few days. It also urged all sides to hold political negotiations with the object of reviving the process of conciliation for lasting political settlement. The appeals have not yet been heeded. Sources said the casualties in six days of bloody fighting Kabul had exceeded 3,300 with hundreds trapped in their homes awaiting medical asistance.
