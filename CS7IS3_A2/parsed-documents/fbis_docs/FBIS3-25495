He said in a statement in Ulundi he had been "extremely shocked and aggrieved" to hear of the massacre. Chief Buthelezi said: "We are never going to have peace and prosperity in South Africa by eliminating each other through such terrible acts of violence." He had noted with regret that there had already been some conjectures by the Midlands leadership of the African National Congress [ANC] about who was responsible for the carnage. Midlands ANC Deputy Chairman Chief Zibuse Mlaba said on Saturday he suspected those who didn't want people to vote were responsible for the massacre. The ANC said the victims were preparing for an ANC voter education workshop on Saturday and police said they were inside a hut when four gunmen shot at them. Some of the victims were stabbed to death. On the resignation of IFP's Deputy Secretary-General Simon Gumede, Chief Buthelezi said Mr Gumede, a chief, wanted to spend more time looking after the affairs of his people. There was no bad feeling between himself and Mr Gumede, Chief Buthelezi added.
