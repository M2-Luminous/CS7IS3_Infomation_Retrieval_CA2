The statement says: The Israeli Shamgar Commission's report places a large question mark on the real aim for which this commission was set up and whether the commission was indeed serious in finding out the real causes behind the Hebron massacre or if it was just an attempt to exonerate the Israeli occupation authorities from their responsibility. Through an elaborate examination of the report it becomes clear, with utmost regret, that it is tantamount to an elegantly polished facade that conceals a horrible feature. The report, in its results, aims, and recommendations has sought to affirm and reinforce the objective circumstances that led to the massacre for which it held a single person responsible, without paying attention to the causes and factors that produced this killer and which every day are producing scores of his ilk, who are seething with resentment against defenseless Palestinians. It is worth noting that such a repugnant and bloody massacre took place in a sacred site, resulting in scores of victims, without a single Israeli military or political official being called to justice, especially as numerous pieces of evidence and statements had pointed an accusing finger at more than an Israeli party whether directly or indirectly involved in this massacre. The report's recommendations are procedural, based on reinforcing the status quo with all its gravity. They do not rise to the level of analyzing the results and drawing conclusions from this massacre and the real reasons that led to it; namely, the settlers' presence in the heart of Hebron and the elements of provocation and instability which this presence represents, especially as thousands of settlers serve in the Israeli Army and implement their objectives within sight and earshot of their commanders. In addition, their work in various official Israeli agencies allows them to obtain the required information and the necessary weapons for perpetrating these massacres against the Palestinian people's sons. The report's results, apart from clearing Israel -- as an occupying authority -- of responsibility for the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, bestowed legitimacy on the occupation's measures inside the mosque and on the facts established forcibly by Israel there. These results were established based on measures that are basically null and void and which contravene international law and the Geneva Conventions. Out of concern for the rights, safety, and security of our people, we stress that the report ignored the roots of the problem, which is the Jewish settlement presence in the heart of Hebron, and disregarded the daily attacks by armed settlers against the citizens of the town. This constitutes a time bomb of dire consequences for which the occupation authorities bear full responsibility. While expressing our regret over the results and recommendations contained in the Shamgar Commission report and its disregard of all these facts, we call on the United Nations and its international institutions to refute this report and what it entails and to consider it merely as an attempt to contain the situation, exonerate the occupation from the Hebron massacre before public opinion, and cover up its crimes against the defenseless Palestinian people.
