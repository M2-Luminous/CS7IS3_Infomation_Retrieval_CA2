He announced that there are at least 100,000 cases of the disease, of which 46,200 have been reported by the National Service for the Eradication of Malaria (SNEM). Montalvo said that he is deeply concerned. He stated that in 1992 39,600 positive cases of malaria were reported to the SNEM, which means about 72,000 total cases, since it is estimated that for each reported case of malaria there is another case which has not been reported. In 1993 46,200 positive cases were reported to the SNEM, which would amount to a total of 100,000 persons affected by the disease. He stressed that in Guayaquil alone 12 persons died of malaria in 1993. He attributed the increased number of cases to the fact that there has not been a continuous process of spraying within and outside the home. He said that the principal officials of the SNEM are not specialists in the matter, and AID, the Agency for International Development, has stopped providing assistance to the SNEM, due to a series of labor, morale, and economic instability problems which have arisen. Montalvo said that the Province of Esmeraldas, where there are more than 12,000 cases of malaria, has become the area most seriously affected by the disease. Of those cases of malaria about 7,000 are of the so-called malignant type (Falsiparo) and more than 5,000 cases are of the so-called benign type (Viva). The Province of Guayas comes next with somewhat less than 12,000 cases, 6,000 of which are of the benign type and 5,000 of the malignant type. In the Province of Manabi there are 7,000 cases of benign malaria and 3,000 cases of malignant malaria. In the other coastal Provinces of Los Rios and El Oro, as well as adjacent upland areas in the Province of Austro, there are also about 15,000 cases of malaria.
