There are indications that the projectile which hit the market in Sarajevo could have been fired from the positions of the Muslim Army's Second Motorized Brigade, two to three kilometers north-east of Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb military sources told TANJUG. The Bosnian Serbs on Saturday categorically denied being responsible for the crime, and called for the immediate setting up of a joint commission of representatives of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the Serb and Muslim sides to investigate the crime. The proposal was turned down by the Muslim side. UNPROFOR military experts have analyzed the crater left by the shell but have not so far been able to determine for sure from which side the shell was fired. U.N. military observers at the Bosnian Serb military command at Lukavica and Bosnian Serb military sources agree on one point -- that the number of casualties is too high to have been caused by a single 120mm mortar shell.
