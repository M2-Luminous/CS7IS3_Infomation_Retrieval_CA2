The Socialist and Democratic Alliance parties each have 15 Lower House deputies while the Pact for Italy has 13, all below the 20-member floor limit for the formation of a separate group under the current rules. The three parties ran separately in the March elections (in some constituencies with the progressives) and are not keen to be forced into a single caucus and risk being seen by public opinion as interchangeable.
