As he said, Russia "had indeed advanced such an initiative, basing on some of Estonia's promises, and stipulated certain conditions." "None of them have been met by the Estonian side, and therefore the issue of final dates for the withdrawal of troops remains open," the diplomat said. Nevertheless, he noted, the Russian delegation is going to join the next round of Russian-Estonian talks, which opens in Tallinn on Tuesday, "in a constructive mood, and in the hope of reaching mutually-acceptable solutions to all the key issues." Udaltsov confirmed that Russia continues to think it necessary to prepare for signing a basic treaty on troop withdrawal "in a package" with an agreement on social guarantees for Russian military retirees living in Estonia. According to the diplomat, between Russia and Estonia "there are virtually no unresolved problems as regards the basic treaty." However, Estonia's stand on a number of fundamental issues concerning the destiny of military retirees is unacceptable to Russia. We hope that Tallinn will advance some new proposals to help resolve the situation," Udaltsov said.
