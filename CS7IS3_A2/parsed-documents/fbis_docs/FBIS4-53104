Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans has of late, openly and shamelessly declared that arms should be shipped to the two-headed government to further fan the flames of war against the Khmer Rouge. He has added that the shipping of arms to the two-headed government to fight the Khmer Rouge complies with the Paris accord. II. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] wishes to ask the representatives of the signatory countries of the Paris accord whether the Australian foreign minister's statement is correct or contrary to the essence and spirit of the accord. A. The Paris accord has already come to an end. However, if the accord is to be taken into consideration, it is asked whether the accord allows any country or power to provide arms to Cambodia and whether it has urged or incited any party to attack another party. No, not at all. On the contrary, the Paris accord: 1. Forbids arms supply to every party; 2. Clearly stipulates that Cambodia should have four parties that are all equal and that no party should have the upper hand. 3. According to the essence and spirit of the accord, Cambodia should achieve national reconciliation, national unity, and genuine peace. B. It is asked whether Gareth Evans' statement is correct or completely contrary to international law, the UN Charter, the principle of noninterference in other countries' internal affairs, and the respect for human rights and the rights to self-determination of each people. Is the Australian foreign minister's statement in line with or contrary to the above principles? Evidently, the provision of arms to the two-headed government is to allow the communist Vietnamese and their puppets to continue to destroy the Cambodian nation, people, and race. So will this action promote peace or just inflame the war? Will it alleviate the sufferings of the nation and people or only destroy the Cambodian nation and people? III. It is obvious the Evans statement is to inflame the war in Cambodia. It is an utterance by warmongers who use the Cambodians serving as the communist Vietnamese and American puppets to attack patriotic Cambodians, to oppose peace, national reconciliation, and national compromise, and to fan the flames of war across Cambodia. This is aimed at causing continued suffering to the Cambodian people and concern to Cambodia's neighbors, thus once again complicating the situation in Southeast Asia. The action by Australia and other unscrupulous alliances is in collaboration with the communist Vietnamese to enable the latter to swallow and eliminate the Cambodian race, thereby allowing all of them to grab at Cambodia according to their disgusting, vested interests. IV. The Cambodian nation and people as well as Democratic Kampuchea vehemently oppose the (?dirty) statement by the atheist warmonger Gareth Evans and the arms supplies to destroy the Cambodian nation and people.
