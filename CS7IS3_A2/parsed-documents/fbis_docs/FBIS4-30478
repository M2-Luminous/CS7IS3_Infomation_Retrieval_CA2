Realization of tax reform within the year is the biggest international commitment the new government is being urged to accept. One could say that because the Hosokawa administration was the "government of political reform," the new Hata administration's fate is to be the "government of tax reform." A policy accord was at last reached early on 22 April by the coalition parties who had steered a difficult course through tax reform which put forth a "radical reform of the tax system focused on raising the direct tax rate, including a restructuring of the current consumption tax and mechanisms for reducing the direct income tax." This ought to have advanced tax reform a step forward, but any sense of victory on the part of the coalition parties and the Ministry of Finance [MOF] was scant. At the coalition party tax reform conference, lower house member Murai (Shinseito), who serves as chairman of the subcommittee on the tax system, commented, "This is a case where we could not conclude without arguing over why the consumption tax rate was being raised after we had said we had achieved a policy accord." This resulted in a total stalemate. The MOF cautioned, "Even though we are in agreement in outline, when we get into the discussion of specific areas such as the tax rate and the timing of the increase, opposition resurfaces" (a senior official in the Tax Bureau). Standing in the way of prospects for tax reform is not just the departure of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the coalition government. "It's been okay up to now to think about the need somehow for tax reform, with a national debt reaching 200 trillion yen and how this is for the public welfare, but when it comes to each member's discussing it in his election district, can he do it as simply as that?" (Chairman Murai). The distress of each party increases with the prospect of actually adding tax reform to the schedule. "A hike in the new consumption tax rate to correct a deficiency in the revenue resources for the public welfare cannot be avoided." The secretary general of the SDPJ's Research Commission on the Tax System, Harumichi Hosoya, on 12 April, explained that having created "the '89 Club" in opposition to the consumption tax, which gave their candidates in the 1989 upper house election an overwhelming victory, the SDPJ was prepared to oppose any increase. He also said that many, contrary to expectations, were inclined toward showing an appreciation of the issues. Although clearly the disparity among the coalition parties regarding tax reform is narrow, how to proceed is still unclear. In response to the Ministry of Health and Welfare's "Vision of the Public Welfare in the 21st Century," which says that an increase in the public burden is unavoidable in order to finance social guarantees for an aging society, there are members of the government's Research Commission on the Tax System who say, "As things go, we do not understand if this concept has taken into account to what degree welfare services will be obtainable. We have no means to choose." At a plenary session of the Research Commission on the Tax System held on 15 April, one after another, beginning with delegate Haruo Shimada (a Keio University professor), there was impassioned pointing out of the fact that while welfare services are one of the bases for raising the consumption tax, none of the basic supporting data has been made public. To obtain the understanding of the public on tax reform it will be necessary to show them the options and the form to be taken by future public services. With the MOF saying, "There aren't enough resources," a prerequisite for tax reform is openly grappling with fiscal reform and revising the unfair tax system. It can be said that the process of "responsible reform" is to obtain public understanding of the radical reform needed for the tax system and the accompanying pain through exhaustive explanation. One more obligation we can seek of the government is that it not prepare the way for tax reform using honeyed words on the electorate, but that it address the resources available to and burdens facing an aging society and then make "responsible choices." There are many issues in addition to tax reform which the government should be pressed to take responsibility for and decide. The question is being asked how the coalition government will discharge its responsibilities following the defection of the Socialist Party to achieve a radical review of fiscal reform, deregulation, and the food management system in the face of bureaucratic resistance.
