[Being Burelli recording] As unusual practices developed during the elections, the OAS's spirit of equality and democracy was exceeded. The OAS has always maintained the alternation or rotation principle, by which a country, regardless of how honorable its aspirations are, should not occupy the OAS post if that country has already occupied it in the past. Such an attitude would be detrimental to those nations that have never occupied it. Of course, this attitude does not mean that the merits of the other candidates for this post should not be recognized. On those grounds, to continue serving the hemispheric cause with dignity, which is definitely important, the national government makes public the withdrawal of its candidacy for OAS secretary general, because there are no concrete objections to the autonomy of the elections.
