The moderate Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean on 3 January publishes on page 3 a 700-word editorial on Kim Il-song's New Year's address titled "The North's New Year's Address, Which Fails To Mention North-South Dialogue." Elaborating on the characteristics of Kim's address, the editorial notes that the address was nothing different from the previous addresses and that no mention was made in it regarding the North-South dialogue. The editorial concludes that while stressing the need for holding dialogue with the United States, Kim Il-song is not interested in holding the North-South dialogue. The editorial reports that Kim Il-song's remarks denouncing the civilian-led Government of South Korea indicates Kim is not interested in holding a dialogue with our government. Expressing disappointment over the address, the editorial concludes: "Judging by North Korea's attitude and President Kim's New Year address it is most likely that North Korea will utilize North-South dialogue as a means for dialogue with the United States. Therefore, we should renounce our optimistic view that we can improve North-South relations under circumstances favorable for us and should seriously grasp North Korea's intent. Thus, we should take countermeasures against it." The conservative Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean on 4 January publishes on page 2 a 700-word article by An Hui-chang commenting on Kim Il-song's address. The article notes that Kim's address revealed North Korea's intent "to recover from its backward economic situation and to improve relations with the United States and other Western countries." Noting the strongly worded denunciation of the South Korean government in the address, the article reports that the address "has cast pessimistic prospects on improving `bona fide' North-South relations." Elaborating on North Korea's new economic policies indicated in the address, including the development of external trade and the increase in production of export goods, the article reports this reveals North Korea's intent to make a partial opening within the framework of maintaining its self-reliant economy in a bid to overcome its present economic difficulties. Noting Kim's remarks on building up its defense capability, the North Korean nuclear issue, and the improvement of relations with the United States and Japan the article predicts that this year, too, North Korea will continue to use its nuclear card for various purposes, such as in maintaining its political system and enhancing its position in the international arena. The article concludes: Kim's address "has revealed an intent to follow the basic line North Korea has taken so far and, accordingly, North-South relations, as well, are expected to repeat a `tedious war of nerves'." The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean on 4 January publishes on page 3 a 800-word editorial on Kim Il-song's New Year address titled "Substantial North-South Dialogue Is a Key Factor." The editorial notes Kim's address offered nothing new and nothing different from his previous new year addresses and that it was a "long-winded talk" to stress communist ideology and motivate the North Korean people to work harder. The editorial summarizes the address into five points: 1. The Third Seven-Year Plan, which ended in failure; 2. The North Korean Workers' Party plenary meeting's designation of the next three years as a readjustment period in which North Korea will reportedly place emphasis on agriculture, light industry, and external trade; 3. The strongly worded denunciation of the civilian-led South Korean Government; 4. The provocative remarks on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, which are aimed implicitly at the United States; and 5. The reunification policy. The editorial stresses Kim's address is basically similar in content to previous years' addresses, though expressions and phrases used are different to some extent. Noting ongoing U.S.-North Korean contacts and anticipated improvement in relations between the United States and North Korea and between Japan and North Korea, the editorial stresses that "the utmost task facing us this year is how to realize `de facto dialogue' between North and South Korea for human and material exchanges and cooperation, which depends on Kim Yong-sam government's policy toward North Korea." Seoul HUNGUK ILBO in Korean on 4 January publishes on page 4 an 800-word article by Yu Sung-u commenting on Kim Il-song's New Year address. The editorial cites key points of the address and elaborates on their background and implication. The article then notes that the address "is characterized by the revelation of North Korea's strong intent to concentrate greater efforts on recovering from its difficult economic situation and, at the same time, to improve relations with the United States and other Western countries." The pro-government Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean on 4 January carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "We Are Disappointed in Kim Il-song's New Year Address." The editorial begins: "We expected North Korea to try to explore a new breakthrough this year to overcome the difficult problems it is facing, such as international isolation and economic failure." The editorial then notes, "Kim Il-song's New Year address, however, proved that Kim Il-song's objective of maintaining the anachronistic system called `our-style socialism' remains unchanged." The editorial continues: "Stressing that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should be resolved through U.S.-North Korean talks, Kim Il-song did not show any interest in inter-Korean dialogue. This reveals that North Korea is trying to press forward for the establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States, using the nuclear issue as a negotiating card, but that it is not interested in improving inter-Korean relations." The editorial concludes: "Inter-Korean relations, as well as the nuclear issue, should be resolved through dialogue between the parties concerned of the North and the South. North Korea should not disappoint us and the world anymore." The pro-government Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean on 4 January carries on page 6 a 600-word article by Ku Pon-yong entitled: "The Meaning of Kim Il-song's New Year Address Regards Improving Relations With the United States as a Matter of Vital Interest for the Survival of the North's System." The article notes that judging from Kim Il-song's New Year address, the North Korean foreign and domestic policy will concentrate on resolving its economic problems, and reports: "Kim Il-song declares in his New Year address that North Korea will develop `good-neighborly relations' with capitalist countries as well, thus hinting that North Korea will pursue practical economic interest through improvement of relations with the United States and Japan. Kim Il-song insisted that the nuclear issue be resolved through negotiations with the United States. This eloquently manifests that North Korea regards the improvement of relations with the United States as a necessity of vital interest for the survival of its system." The article then notes: "It is noteworthy that Kim Il-song mentioned nothing about the inter-Korean dialogue in his New Year's address. This reveals the North Korean scheme to carry on dialogue only with the United States, bypassing us. Nevertheless, the government authorities are of the opinion that the context of Kim's New Year's address does not necessarily mean that the inter-Korean relations will continue to remain in a stalemate in the New Year as well." The article then cites the remark by Song Yong-tae, vice unification minister, "The North Korean attitude toward inter-Korean dialogue will change depending upon the progress of the U.S.-North Korean unofficial contacts in New York." The left-leaning Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean on 4 January carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "President Kim's New Year Address and Inter-Korean Relations." The editorial notes Kim Il-song's New Year address gave the impression that the North Korean nuclear issue, which showed signs of a breakthrough, might turn, though temporarily, into a complication. The editorial notes the reason for this is that the New Year address did not mention the inter-Korean dialogue, but severely criticized the South Korean Government. The editorial then reports: "We are curious to know how the government, particularly President Kim Yong-sam, will react to this. During a meeting conveying New Year greetings on 3 January, President Kim stated: `Since the North Korean nuclear issue is directly connected with our nation's existence, we should resolve it early this year without fail.' We feel both expectations and worries about the fact that President Kim Yong-sam set `early this year' as a deadline for the resolution of the nuclear issue." The editorial then adds: "We hope President Kim Yong-sam's deadline of `early this year' for the resolution of the nuclear issue will not be a signal of a hard-line offensive toward North Korea." The left-leaning Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean on 4 January carries on page 3 a 700-word article by Kang Tae-ho entitled "What President Kim's New Year Address Signifies: Negative on Inter-Korean Dialogue, Stresses Resolution of Nuclear Issue Through North Korean-U.S. Talks, Details Trade Issue, Stresses Acceleration of Economic Construction." The article notes: "President Kim Il-song's New Year address, in short, regards the Kim Yong-sam government as nothing different from the preceding military regimes. This is in contrast with his expectations of the Kim Yong-sam government expressed in his 1993 New Year address. This negative view of North Korea toward inter-Korean dialogue was culminated during the ROK-U.S. summit talks held last November. North Korea thinks the South is laying an `artificial obstacle' to the North Korean-U.S. talks, which are heading toward the resolution of the nuclear issue." The article then notes that the New Year address placed greatest emphasis on the economy, economic construction, agriculture, light industry, and particularly trade. The article concludes by citing the view of North Korean experts, who find it unusual for the New Year's address to place so much emphasis on trade and exports in so much detail. The moderate Seoul KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean on 4 January carries on page 3 a 900-word editorial entitled "Let Us Clear Up Uncertainty." After elaborating on the dim North-South relations caused by North Korea's closed-door policy against the trends of the world, the editorial notes: "North Korea, which claimed that the issues concerning the North and the South should be resolved by the parties concerned, assumes the attitude to hold negotiations with the United States over the issues concerning the Korean peninsula. This clearly shows North Korea's double-dealing attitude." Referring to North Korea's nuclear issue, the editorial notes: "We should not have hasty expectations and excessive pessimism about the issues concerning the North and the South. To settle the nuclear negotiations, measures should be taken to resume the essential North-South dialogue." Referring to the North Korean- U.S. negotiations, the editorial reports: "The United States and North Korea have focused their negotiations on the international inspection team's entry into the North, thus ignoring the issue of developing a method to effectively inspect North Korea's nuclear facilities." The editorial then stresses that "under such circumstances, if the United States unilaterally announces the discontinuation of the Team Spirit exercise and the scheduling of the third round of the North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, this will result in ignoring the essence of removing suspicions about North Korea's nuclear development. Our repeated demand is that it be a prerequisite to ensure North Korea's nuclear transparency." The editorial notes: "Even though the United States and North Korea have agreed upon a principle, it is not desirable to assume an excessive optimistic attitude toward overall North-South relations. Kim Il-song strongly denounced the civilian government in his New Year address. This clearly shows that North Korea has still not changed. Worse still, Kim Il-song repeatedly revealed the attitude that the nuclear issue should be resolved through negotiations with the United States and that reunification should be achieved by means of a confederation. This is the attitude that shows North Korea has obtained almost everything through negotiations with the United States." The editorial concludes: "If North Korea adheres to a line of isolation, it is impossible for North Korea to exist. The world will not sit back and watch North Korea go against peace and the trends of the times. North Korea should become a member of the international community and participate in the North-South dialogue and exchange by ensuring its nuclear transparency." The moderate Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean on 4 January carries on page 3 a 900-word editorial entitled "The Difference in Views Between the Two Heads of the North and the South" and notes the desire of the people to solve North Korea's nuclear issue and to improve North-South relations. After comparing the new year addresses of President Kim Yong-sam and President Kim Il-song, the editorial quotes President Kim Yong-sam as stressing that: "Resolving North Korea's nuclear issue early this year is an absolute and vital task" and President Kim Il-song as saying: "The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be resolved through DPRK-U.S. talks" and "The South Korean civilian regime is only so in appearance and is actually not different from the preceding military dictatorial regime." After noting North Korea's silence about the North-South dialogue, the editorial notes: "North Korea should decide on its position toward the North-South dialogue." The editorial then raises questions about the government's position toward the solution of North Korea's nuclear issue and the issue of exchange of special envoys. The editorial concludes by reporting that North Korea is full of distrust of South Korea. The moderate Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean on 4 January carries on page 4 a 1,400-word article by Pak Che-kyun entitled "The Meaning Contained in Kim Il-song's New Year Address." The article notes that "in his New Year address, President Kim Il-song strongly emphasized improving relations with the United States and on strengthening friendship and cooperation with Western countries, including Japan." After noting that President Kim Il-song stressed that North Korea's nuclear issue should be resolved through talks with the United States, the article notes: "This is the first time President Kim himself stressed the nuclear negotiations with the United States. This proves that North Korea puts great efforts into improving relations with the United States." Referring to economic development, the article notes that Kim Il-song admitted great difficulties and obstacles in economic construction and mentioned agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policies. After elaborating on Kim Il-song emphasizing strengthening military power, the article notes: "Experts view Kim Il-song's emphasis on military power as consolidating its inner system, which may easily slacken as a result of opening up and economic development." After noting that Kim Il-song strongly denounced South Korea and placed the responsibility for failure of exchange of special envoys on the South side, the article comments: "It is expected that North Korea will attach importance to nongovernmental dialogue led by experts of South Korean affairs, including Vice President Kim Yong-chu, rather than dialogue between the authorities."
