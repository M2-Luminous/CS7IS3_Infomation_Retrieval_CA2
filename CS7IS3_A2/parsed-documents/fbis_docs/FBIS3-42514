G. Grigoryev, Ye. V. Zapletina, M. P. Zapletin; UDC 629.195.3] [Abstract] In earlier works, the researchers examined optimal transfers between the lunar surface and lunar orbit for a spacecraft with a rocket engine of high, but limited thrust, with landing and liftoff sites not fixed. Those studies focused on fastest transfer, as well as transfer with a minimum value for the compromise functional of time-mass expenditure. The transfers were set in a central Newtonian gravitation field in the plane of orbit of an artificial lunar satellite, with thrust vector controlled. This paper builds on the earlier work, but involves the spatial characteristics of the transfer of the same spacecraft in the same lunar context. The researchers discuss the numerical solution of boundary value problems for 13th and 14th-order systems of the usual nonlinear differential equations that appear when the solution of the problems of optimal control of motion of the center of mass of the spacecraft is based on the maximum principle. In the current context, solution that involves shooting requires selection of 4-6 unknown initial conditions. Figures 5, references 33 (Russian).
