FBIS4-17264 "drsov078_a_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Bosnian Air Strikes To `Complicate' Situation Bosnian Air Strikes To `Complicate' Situation LD2204111794 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1027 GMT 22 Apr 94 LD2204111794 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] There is every indication that events in and around Gorazde have entered a decisive stage. As a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official has reported to Interfax with reference to information from that city, hand-to-hand combat is underway there. For this reason, NATO may decide already on Friday to back the UN Secretary General's request for massive air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs. However, such a decision could only escalate the conflict and give the Serbs freedom of action not only in Gorazde but elsewhere in Bosnia, the diplomat said. In his words, NATO's massive air strikes might "seriously complicate" the position of peacekeepers in Bosnia and necessitate an evacuation of the Sarajevo-based Russian peace-keeping battalion. He declined to say how precisely Russia would respond to massive air-strikes, if NATO mandated them. "There are a few options. Let us not spur on events," he noted. He said that "this time Moscow cannot complain that it has not been consulted." Contacts with NATO and with Americans are underway at various levels. It is not ruled out that they will ultimately lead to a summit with Russia, US, EC, and UN to take part, on which Moscow has been insisting. It is hardly likely that efforts to prepare such a summit in just one month's time will succeed. As for a meeting at the foreign ministers level, it is not only feasible but necessary, the diplomat said.
