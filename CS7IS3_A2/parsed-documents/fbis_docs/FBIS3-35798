An Expected Victory"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Yuriy Aleksandrovich Meshkov was born in 1945. His mother is Ukrainian. His father is Russian -- a Don Cossack. After finishing secondary school in Simferopol he served in the Border Troops. He then studied at Moscow State University Law Faculty. After defending his diploma he was an investigator in the Crimea Prosecutor's Office and an attorney. Meshkov is a deputy of the Crimean Supreme Soviet, in which he heads the "Republic" deputies' group. He is chairman of the Crimean Republican Movement and Crimean Republican Party. By all accounts Meshkov's victory does not suit Kiev's politicians. Primarily because in his election program he advocated the lifting of the moratorium on a referendum on the Crimea's status. Its results, should it take place, are not hard to predict. But this carries the risk that the Crimean precedent could "detonate" Ukraine's eastern and southern regions. According to sociologists' data, pro-Russian sentiments are becoming increasingly strong in them. Moreover, a political force capable of consolidating them has appeared in Ukraine -- the Interregional Bloc for Reforms, which is headed by Vladimir Grinev and Leonid Kuchma, who advocate close cooperation with Russia. The first threats that the most resolute measures will be taken in relation to the Crimea, even including the introduction of troops there, have already been uttered in Kiev. It is no accident that anxious Kiev parliamentarians have granted the president additional powers -- to rescind decisions of local organs of power, including Crimean organs, if they do not accord with the Ukrainian Constitution. But Leonid Kravchuk has remained true to himself. So far he has not openly expressed his attitude toward the Crimean elections and is patiently enduring the accusations of radical national-patriots. The president once again finds himself in a difficult situation. On the one hand he gave his personal blessing to the election venture ("If the people want to elect a president they have the right to do so"), but on the other hand the demands to declare them invalid are altogether too insistent. It must be assumed that for now Kravchuk will confine himself to removing Ivan Yermakov from the post of his representative in Sevastopol and will wait and see how events in the Crimea develop further. After all, judging by his last television debate, Meshkov came across as a reasonable and flexible politician, dispelling the myth created about him that he is an extremist.
