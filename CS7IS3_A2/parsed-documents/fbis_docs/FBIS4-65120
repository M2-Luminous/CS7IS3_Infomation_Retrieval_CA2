[Previti] No. It is a change for the better. This is a wonderful moment for me: It is enough to consider that I entered politics on 3 February, and now, 10 May, I am a minister. It is incredible. [Palombelli] Do you have a program yet? [Previti] I will be one of the few defense ministers to have done my military service. I was an Air Force officer in Florence; that was a wonderful experience. [Palombelli] It is not much. [Previti] Actually, apart from my half serious reference to my military service, I do have real experience of defense matters, acquired during my nine years as deputy chairman first of Selenia, then of the new Alenia, the state electronics and aeronautics concern. Not everybody knows that our military industry is in the vanguard. Right now I can make a pledge to increase the annual budget and investment in the Armed Forces, which I consider our country's boast, a great human and professional asset. Furthermore, it will be necessary to examine the role of women . [Palombelli] End of commercial. Who decided to shift you -- [President] Scalfaro or [Prime Minister-designate] Berlusconi? [Previti] Neither. Scalfaro did not raise any objections in my regard; he did not even mention me in the letter in which he set out his anxieties. And Berlusconi insisted that I be made justice minister. It was I who decided to stand aside, in view of the hail of opposition. I did not want to constitute a problem. I did not want Silvio [Berlusconi] to have to fight a battle over me. I must say that [Northern League Secretary] Bossi and [National Alliance leader] Fini too encouraged me to stand firm. I am sure that [Justice Minister] Alfredo Biondi will do very well; in particular, he has much more political experience than me. [Palombelli] This is a victory for the Democratic Party of the Left, which said: Berlusconi's lawyer cannot become justice minister. [Previti] Those people are professional detractors. I have left my job, relinquished all my posts within Fininvest, have been elected to the Senate by the people; as of this morning my legal practice has passed to my son, Stefano, and I will resign immediately from the lawyers' association. Of course, I am come from a modest background, and from a profession that has given me both satisfaction and money: Forza Italia won the elections precisely on this basis, because it set its sights on the entry of professionals into positions of power. But perhaps they preferred the previous relationship that existed between the caucus leaders and the colonels, a relationship that was often murky. [Palombelli] Luigi Berlinguer, the progressive forces' leader in the lower house, pointed out that you are "a company lawyer and a senior manager of Fininvest, a firm into which the judiciary have initiated criminal inquiries." [Previti] I can confidently reply with an example that will please the progressive forces: U.S. President John Fitzgerald Kennedy appointed his brother, Bobby, attorney general. I became a friend of John and Bobby in September 1963 when I organized an international conference on forensic medicine in New York and Washington. A thousand academics, Italians and Americans, took part; it was a great success. [Palombelli] A friend of the Kennedys but a member of the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. [Previti] The time has come to clarify this matter. True, I was an MSI member as a boy. Like many others at Rome's Mamiani High School, we felt the shame of having lost the war and were motivated by our love of our country, the desire to regain Trieste. At university I was elected to the "Caravella" list, which comprised the Social Movement, monarchists, Liberals, the Everyman Movement. Then, at the age of 20, I graduated and abandoned all that. In the sixties I was a member of Malagodi's PLI [Italian Liberal Party] and joined the leadership; I was convinced that if we opted for a right-wing line we would win back all our votes from the MSI. My faction was defeated and I left. Now, 30 years later, here we have Forza Italia. [Palombelli] You often appear in photographs with a giant flame [MSI symbol] behind you. Are you happy about that? [Previti] That business of the photographs with the tricolor flame is a petty one. There is no mystery. I was a joint candidate for Forza Italia and the MSI, so I was very glad to take part in the final rally with Gianfranco Fini. He is a politician whom I highly esteem, but recently I have discovered that Bossi too is much better than he appears at first glance. [Palombelli] What about the international alarm about a Berlusconi government full of MSI ministers? [Previti] The National Alliance is something different from the old MSI, which in turn was something different from Fascism. Be that as it may, I think it is right that the government team that has been chosen is as remote as possible from that distant past. And yet people abroad accepted the Communists. [Palombelli] In fact the old PCI [Italian Communist Party] has split in two. Within the National Alliance we seem to see the coexistence of both tendencies -- the regressive and the moderate. [Previti] Perhaps some day there will be a separation on the Right, too. [Palombelli] In view of your past, if you had become justice minister, would you have demanded the extradition [from Argentina] of the executioner of the Fosse Ardeatine [Erich Priebke]? [Previti] Of course. Except that, unlike some former ministers, I would also have succeeded in securing it quickly.
