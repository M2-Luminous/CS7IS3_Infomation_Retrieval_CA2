Mr. Brazauskas said that every nation had its own criminals, but nobody can accuse and describe a whole nation as a criminal entity. This was the underlying principle of international law and everyone must keep to it, said the Lithuanian president. Mr. Brazauskas stressed that the Jewish genocide was organized and carried out by Nazi Germany on occupied territories. Therefore, Mr. Brazauskas did not see the Lithuanian nation as the initiator of the mass murder of the Jews. It is true that 8,000 Lithuanians had participated in the mass killing of Jews, but compared to the Lithuanian population of 3 million in those times, the total percentage of war criminals was very small. Mr. Brazauskas pointed out that 700 out of 50,000 persons were refused rehabilitation papers, while five rehabilitations were annulled after additional information had been received by the prosecutor's office.
