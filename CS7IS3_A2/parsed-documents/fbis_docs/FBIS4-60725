In the second sentence, this genius of a king went on to contend that keeping the sanctions in place will make sure there is no change in the stands toward Iraq of regional and world powers. In the third sentence -- in which he predicted that once the status quo ends, the region will see an era of stability -- he became unbalanced. The foreign minister added: It is well known to the population of Najd and Hejaz and to all Arabs and Muslims that the feeble-minded Fahd begins his day by gulping alcoholic drinks just as greedily as beasts guzzle stagnant water -- a habit he practices even during the pilgrimage. He is scarcely sober enough to conduct a meaningful conversation, even at official sessions, which explains why his utterings are typically absurd, revolting, and hollow. These particular remarks by Fahd fit the pattern of a filthy monarch's manner of speech. His memory, devastated by alcoholic drinks and possibly narcotics, must have led him to fantasize that his kingdom is the sixth permanent member of the Security Council. Influenced by a mixture of repulsive illusions, ignorance, and spite, Fahd set about slandering Iraq and accusing it of sidestepping Security Council resolutions. This agent forgets that his kingdom is not even a nonpermanent member of the council. What are we to make of his charge that Iraq is skirting Security Council resolutions, or his demand that the sanctions be retained, the foreign minister asked. These remarks, added al-Sahhaf, prove Fahd to be a petty agent of a Security Council member allied with Zionism -- a nation that attempts to force its influence and political agenda on the Security Council. Fahd can convince no one that he is a mere ally of nations that want to impose their hegemony. Fahd's inability to advance a convincing case is because in the eyes of these nations he is hardly an ally; he is viewed as trash, a petty agent attached to a huge pig that has put itself at the disposal of the Zionist Movement to torture the Arabs and antagonize the virtuous Islamic faith and its lofty and undying values. The changes favoring Iraq's cause regionally and globally are ongoing and will continue. The positive relationship between Iraq and the Security Council and the Special Commission is on course. The feeble-minded Fahd and his likeminded petty agents will only reap failure and suffer dire consequences. Great Iraq and its proud people will, in the meantime, continue to walk tall and be a lofty example of pride and dignity and a bastion for the Arab nation and revival, the foreign minister stated.
