Over the past year, however, he had to spend a great deal of time dealing with problems in Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, and the Middle East, and he was bogged down in a terrible predicament. Shortly after 1994 began, he packed his bags and prepared for a European tour. The purpose of his trip was to appease his West European allies, persuade the East European countries, and adjust relations with Russia. Even though his mother has just died, Clinton decided to set off today according to the original schedule. He will successively visit Brussels, Prague, Moscow, Minsk, and Geneva. In Brussels, he will attend the NATO summit meeting, and in Moscow, he will meet Russian President Yeltsin. These will be the two most important events on his itinerary. NATO is a military group composed of 16 Western countries. Its original target was the former Soviet Union and the East European bloc. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the drastic changes in Eastern Europe, however, NATO's orientation became a subject of debate among its member countries. At the same time, some East European countries applied to join NATO. At the upcoming NATO summit meeting, a major topic of discussion will be whether to admit East European countries into NATO. Due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the governmental changes in the East European countries, their military alliance--the Warsaw Pact--ceased to exist. This brought about a so-called a "vacuum" in Eastern Europe. On the other hand, the Russian domestic situation continued to be unstable, and division and ethnic conflicts occurred in some East European countries, such as Yugoslavia. Therefore, Poland, Hungary, Czech, Slovakia, and Lithuania successively demanded that they be admitted into NATO in order to seek protection against possible crises. These demands brought the NATO countries into a dilemma. First, Russia had already explicitly expressed its opposition to NATO's expansion to the East and regarded this as a "threat" against Russia. Because of Russia's status and its current delicate domestic situation, NATO countries have no choice but to give consideration to its feelings. On the other hand, if these East European countries are admitted into NATO, it will inevitably cause a division between them and the rest of the East European countries. If all East European countries, including Russia, are admitted into NATO, then we will have the situation that Kissinger described when he said "an alliance that includes everyone is in fact an alliance of nobody." This is obviously unrealistic. What to do? The United States has proposed establishing the "Partnership for Peace" as a compromise. According to this proposal, NATO may conclude bilateral agreements with Russia and other East European countries on increasing military cooperation, including carrying out joint military maneuvers and training. For those countries that have explicitly expressed their hope to join NATO, the "partnership for peace" may be a transitional stage before they officially become NATO members. It has been said that the option proposed by the United States would not offend Russia and would also satisfy the demands of some East European countries. The proposal has been supported by all other NATO members. Clinton's visit to Moscow and his meeting with Russian President Yeltsin will test U.S. policies and tactics. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States actively supported Yeltsin and his radical reform policies and made great efforts to persuade other Western countries to give Yeltsin substantial assistance. The United States consistently sided with Yeltsin throughout the prolonged confrontation between Yeltsin and the former Russian parliament. In the recent Russian legislative elections, however, the political party Russia's Choice, which represents the pro-Yeltsin bloc, encountered a setback, and the rising star was the "Liberal Democratic Party," which represents extreme nationalist forces. This fact shows that the radical reform policies that have been pursued by Yeltsin have been unpopular. Zhirinovsky, the leader of the newly rising "Liberal Democratic Party," was encouraged by the election results and began to more fanatically advocate great-nation chauvinism. He even called for expanding Russia's territory and launching a war. In facing this situation, Yeltsin had no choice but to keep the United States at a distance. It is now difficult to predict Russia's future, and the United States has been rather anxious about this. Therefore, the United States found it necessary to adjust its policy and tactics toward Russia. The United States will continue to give Yeltsin positive support, but it will also try to prevent this practice from giving an excuse to the opposition forces in Russia and from stimulating the development of nationalism in Russia. The United States will continue to support Russia's reform, but it will also require the reformist to adopt a more moderate and gradual method and to prevent excessively radical measures from going beyond the Russian people's endurance. Russia obviously holds an important position in the foreign policy consideration of the United States. Clinton will certain bargain with Yeltsin. However, how successful will he be? People will have to wait and see.
