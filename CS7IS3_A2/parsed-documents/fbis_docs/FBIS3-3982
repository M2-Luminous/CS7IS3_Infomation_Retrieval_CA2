After the one and a half-hour talks, Qian Qichen made a speech to Chinese and foreign correspondents, summing up the bilateral talks between China and the United States, and answered questions from the correspondents. Qian said that the 10-hour-talks between China and the United States were open, frank and realistic. The two sides unanimously agreed that the Sino-U.S. relations are not only bilateral, but should also be viewed in a world-wide perspective and with thoughts of the future and the 21st century. The three joint communiques between China and the United States are the cornerstone of the Sino-U.S. relations. China and the United States, both big countries with world influence and permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, have many common interests in global affairs and in safeguarding international peace and security. Their stands on safeguarding regional peace and stability coincide closely. Qian stressed that during the talks the two sides expressed satisfaction with the rapid progress in the fields of economy and trade and said that he considers the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries to have great potential and broad prospects. Qian pointed out that the issues of human rights and most favored nation (MFN) trade status were main points of the Sino-U.S. bilateral discussions. China opposes linking human rights with the issue of the MFN. The issue of human rights has two aspects: One is that China and the United States have different viewpoints on human rights, and this will remain as a long-term fact. Another is that the two countries deal with disputes differently. China is of the opinion that the two sides can hold talks on the issue of human rights on the basis of equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. China can only do things allowed by Chinese law. It is futile and damaging to use the human rights issue to exert pressure on China. On the concrete achievements of the Sino-U.S. talks, Qian listed the following five points: First, the two sides agreed to continue with high-level contacts. Chinese State Councillor Song Jian and Minister Wu Yi of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation will go to the United States in April to attend meetings of the Joint Commission of Science and the Joint Commission of Trade separately. Second, the United States reaffirmed its firm support for China's reentry into GATT. Third, the two sides have agreed to restore and develop military exchanges and have agreed to set up a joint commission for defense conversion. Fourth, out of the friendship and humanitarianism it feels toward the American people, China has agreed to allow a U.S. team to be sent to its territory to survey three Missing In Action cases which occurred during the Vietnam War. Fifth, the two sides signed the statement of cooperation in implementing the memorandum of understanding on banning the import and export of prison labor products. Qian said that the two sides have reached other agreements as well. He hoped Christopher's visit will enhance mutual understanding and improve Sino-U.S. relations. On Sino-U.S. differences on the human rights issue, Qian pointed out that the U.S. secretary of state said that he intended to link the human rights issue with the MFN because he had to implement the U.S. President's executive order and observe U.S. laws. This is understandable. The secretary of state is a lawyer. Qian said he had told him that neither the U.S. President's executive order nor U.S. law can rule China. China has no duty to carry them out. The disputes between China and the United States can only be resolved through consultations. On the issue of the MFN, Qian said that there are different opinions within the United States. The U.S. commercial circle strongly supports the postponement of China's MFN. There are also different views. China and the United States have many common interests and also have many differences. This is a fact. China will never become the United States. If it were required that China accept the U.S. standard and be the same as the United States as a precondition to developing trade it would be impossible and there would be no trade in the world. Qian said he believes that trade between China and the United States will continue. Qian said that the secretary of state's visit was of major importance to the Sino-U.S. relations. He said that the trend shows that to develop Sino-U.S. relations, the two sides should carry out the understandings reached by the Chinese and U.S. heads of states in Seattle last November. He believed that Christopher, during his visit, did attempt to resolve the questions and, despite difficulties, the positive trend in Sino-U.S. relations will continue.
