FBIS4-10265 "drlat069_q_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Paraguay Israel Alerts Police On Arab `Terrorists' Israel Alerts Police On Arab `Terrorists' PY0804151494 Asuncion NOTICIAS in Spanish 8 Apr 94 p 49 PY0804151494 Asuncion NOTICIAS Spanish BFN [Text] NOTICIAS learned from police sources yesterday that alleged Lebanese or Palestinian terrorists entered the country through Ciudad del Este during the week to attack the Israeli Embassy. Recent events in the Middle East and the possible signing of a peace treaty in the conflict area has allegedly hurt the interests of terrorists who are trying to boycott it through attacks against Jewish people and assets in South America and around the world. The police are handling the issue with absolute secrecy. The Israeli intelligence service told the National Police about the entry of the alleged terrorists into the country. They came through Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. In Brazil, these individuals allegedly obtained the support of some of their people to get false passports and other documents, including the famous special permits called "Border Controls," which are handled by the border mafia. The National Police ordered the Intelligence Department, the Investigative Department, Interpol, and the 4th Zone Police Command to carry out an in-depth investigation to locate the foreigners. Police Superintendent General Lopez Pintos, director of the Technical Support department, said foreigners are regularly and routinely controlled. He minimized the importance of the issue. Police Superintendent General Santiago Flores Torres, chief of the 4th Zone, said his first concern when he assumed the command of Canindeyu, Alto Parana, and Itapua Departments, was to order a census of foreigners residing in the border zone, which is very vulnerable to the entry of undesirable people. "The Immigration Department and this command are strictly controlling the situation. We will provide documents to residing foreigners and place illegal residents at the disposal of the court. We usually make those controls. We have been intensifying them in the past few days," Flores Torres said without confirming or denying the report on the presence of terrorists in the country. According to a reliable police source, the Israeli Embassy is aware of the possibility and has asked for police reinforcements for the guard outside the embassy and the residences of their diplomats. The embassy has also allegedly said that the terrorists are possibly members of Arab groups who are trying to prevent the signing of a peace agreement in the Middle East. They are allegedly moved by their interest in the arms trade.
