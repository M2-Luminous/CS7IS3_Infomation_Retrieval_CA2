The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirement to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Copies of this submission may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800.

Persons wishing to comment on this information collection should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10214 NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;3561. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0444 Title: Station Construction/Operational Status Inquiry Form Number: FCC Form 800&hyph;A Action: Revision to a currently approved collection Respondents: Individuals or households and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses) Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement Estimated Annual Burden: 11,500 responses; 1 hour average burden per response; 11,500 hours total annual burden Needs and Uses: Licensees are required to provide information to verify that a station has been placed into operation and to notify the Commission of the actual number of mobile units placed in operation after license grant. This form has been revised to incorporate data previously collected on FCC Form 6027&hyph;H. The FCC Form 6027&hyph;H will be cancelled after OMB review and approval and upon implementation of the revised FCC Form 800&hyph;A. The data is used by Commission staff to determine whether the licensee is entitled to their authorization to operate. From this data, the Commission is able to determine full capacity channel loading, making frequencies available for assignment and modifying or cancelling licenses. The data collected ensures licensees are not authorized for more mobiles than they are actually using. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary.
