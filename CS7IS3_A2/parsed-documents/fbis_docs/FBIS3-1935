In their speeches, the forum's participants expressed unanimous support for the two religion-related laws promulgated by the State Council, hailing the promulgation as a major step in enacting laws on religious work and codifying the management of religious affairs. Under the circumstances of reform and opening up, more and more religious affairs related to foreigners have cropped up in China. The "provisions" are promulgated precisely to meet the pressing demand for revising the legislation. The "provisions," which fully reflect the Chinese Government's policy of respecting the freedom of religious belief of foreign nationals in China, protect foreign nationals' participation in normal religious activities as well as their friendly contacts and cultural and academic exchanges with religious circles in China. Meanwhile, the "provisions" also effectively safeguard the Chinese Constitution's principle that "religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign domination." The promulgation of the "regulations," which provide clear stipulations for protecting normal religious activities and the lawful rights and interests of religious places of religious activities, is a long-awaited event of religious circles and is of great significance for conducting various concrete religious activities in China. The forum participants also offered many concrete suggestions and opinions for implementing these two laws. The forum was attended by officials from all national religious organizations, including Zhao Puchu, Ding Guangxun, An Shiwei, Zong Huaide, Li Yuhang, Jia Muyang, Gong Tangcang, Jin Luxian, Fu Tieshan, Wan Yaobin, Ma Xian, and Liu Bonian; as well as responsible comrades from the central departments concerned. Zhang Shengzuo, director of the State Council's Bureau of Religious Affairs, chaired the forum.
