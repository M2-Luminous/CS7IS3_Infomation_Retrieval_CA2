C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, March 5 (CNA) -- Reports that Beijing is planning to establish special investment areas along the coast of Mainland China exclusively for Taiwan investors have drawn mixed reactions here. Vice Economic Affairs Minister Chang Shih-chien said Saturday [5 March] that the government hopes the project is a success, but he expressed his doubts that the project would be completed given the current economic capability of Mainland China. Yang stressed that the Taipei Government's policy toward the mainland will not be affected by any moves Beijing will take, saying trade ties across the Taiwan Strait are currently regulated by the National Unification Guidelines and the statutes governing relations between peoples of the Taiwan area and the mainland area. Under both laws, Taiwan investors are currently prohibited from making direct investments in Mainland China. Unofficial statistics, however, show that Taiwan investors have channeled more than US$10 billion into the mainland. Richard Wu, president of the Council for Industrial and Commercial Development, hailed the Beijing proposal as a goodwill response to increasing mainland investments by Taiwan manufacturers. The establishment of such investment areas should help win tax incentives for Taiwan investors, Wu noted. Huang Nan-tu, president of the Wei Chuan Group, warned domestic manufacturers to beware of any hidden political intentions, but also admitted that the proposed investment zones would benefit Taiwan investors. The planned special investment areas are expected to have better factory infrastructure than the mainland's existing plants, many of which lack peripheral facilities including power supplies and means of transportation, Huang said. Domestic investors, however, should take into account their different needs and make cautious assessments before deciding to enter into the special investment areas, he pointed out. Moreover, he stressed, Taiwan investors must pay attention to Beijing's political intentions in such an initiative. The Hong Kong-based WEN WEI PO on Friday cited Beijing sources as reporting that the mainland will give the green light in the near future to the establishment of several Taiwan traders' investment areas on the mainland's coastal region in a new bid to attract more investments from Taiwan. The sources said the plan is consistent with calls by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to boost Cross-Strait trade exchanges and help curb calls for Taiwan independence, the newspaper reported.
