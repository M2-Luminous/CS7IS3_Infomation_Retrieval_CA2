Philippe, you are near the prefecture building? Is French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur still inside? [Lefebvre] Yes, I am behind the gates of the prefecture building. Edouard Balladur is inside the regional council building, but the situation has for an hour now been very tense around the prefecture building. Police and the demonstrators are clashing with Molotov cocktails and teargas bombs. The gas smoke can be seen reaching the windows of the prefecture. It was in this climate that Edouard Balladur met the delegates of the fishermen for 10 minutes or so. He confirmed to them that he will take the necessary measures at the national level to support this industry even if Brussels refuses to back down on the minimum price issue. This is the information that Dominique Lapart, the leader of the Committee for the Survival of the Fisheries Industry, wanted to communicate to the demonstrators but could not because of teargas bombs, which are making any movement between the prefecture and the Rennes city center, where the situation is very tense, impossible. The fact that Dominique Lapart has not managed to make this announcement will not calm the situation in the next few minutes.
