Troops headed by General Norberto Adrada Cordoba arrested top EPL leader Francisco Caraballo. The Army mounted an intelligence operation two years ago because they knew he had to come to Cajiga to visit his wife and son. He arrived last night and was arrested this morning. [Begin recording] [Caraballo] When I became a guerrilla, the possibilities for joining a legal political movement with the opportunity of being a political opposition were closed. [Unidentified reporter] Why did you murder the surgeon-priest? [Caraballo] I did not murder him. [Reporter] Why did you order his murder? [Caraballo] I did not order him killed. [Reporter] But you never wanted peace, and you have shown you do not want peace. [Caraballo] I disagree with that. [Gen. Hernan Jose Guzman] This is a hard blow to the guerrillas because in less than 15 days, the Army has arrested their commander, their third person in command, and other members of the organization. We have also arrested Genaro [not further identified], who was the coordinator of their activities. [end recording] The arrest of guerrilla leader Francisco Caraballo was the result of an intelligence operation conducted by the Colombian Army; no reward was paid.
