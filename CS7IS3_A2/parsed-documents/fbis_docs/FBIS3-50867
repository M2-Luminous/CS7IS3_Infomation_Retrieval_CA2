Instead, it urges the Executive Branch to better publicize the law. [Begin recording] [Attorney General Ricardo Ernst Contreras] The law is still in effect. A court ruling in connection with a request submitted by anyone does not derogate a law. Laws are only derogated by other laws. Laws are also derogated when someone submits an appeal for annulment because the law violates the constitution -- and the appeal has sufficient grounds. This can involve the whole law or some of its provisions. Also, a law can be rescinded in connection with a given process because one of the interested parties claims the law violates the Constitution. However, the ruling issued by such a court in connection with such an appeal obviously cannot derogate a law. [passage omitted] [end recording]
