FR940916-2-00061 FR940916-2-00054 National Toxicology Program; Availability of Technical Report on Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of 3,4-Dihydrocoumarin The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin, which is used as a flavoring agent in beverages, gelatins, puddings, candy, and other food items and as a fragrance in perfumes, creams, and cosmetics. Toxicity and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by administering 3,4-dihydrocoumarin (99% pure) in corn oil by gavage to groups of 60 male and female F344/N rats at doses of 0, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg body weight for 2 years. Groups of 70 male and female B6C3F mice received 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg body weight for 2 years. Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity 1 of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in male F344/N rats based on increased incidence of renal tubule adenomas and focal hyperplasia. The transitional cell carcinomas in two 600 mg/kg males may also have been chemical related. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in female F344/N rats receiving 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in male B6C3F1 mice receiving 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined). 1 The NTP uses five categories of evidence of carcinogenic activity observed in each animal study: two categories for positive results (``clear evidence'' and ``some evidence''), one category for uncertain findings (``equivocal evidence''), one category for no observable effect (``no evidence''), and one category for studies that cannot be evaluated because of major flaws (``inadequate study''). 3,4-Dihydrocoumarin caused ulcers, hyperplasia, and inflammation of the forestomach, parathyroid gland hyperplasia, and increased severity of nephropathy in male rats.
