Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren), was commenting on news reports the ruling coalition is expected to choose Hata as Hosokawa's successor. The new administration is expected to pursue the line followed by the Hosokawa government, and its foundations will be more stable than present ones, he said. The government will do its utmost to enact the 1994 fiscal budget, up for parliamentary approval, as soon as possible, Nagano said. He said the yen's appreciation has hampered economic recovery, and its value should be lowered to a level matching its purchasing power to help ease the impact on domestic industry. There are bright signs of recovery but they have yet to cover all industries, he said.
