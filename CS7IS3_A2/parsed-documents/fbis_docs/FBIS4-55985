FBIS4-55985 "dreeu101_c_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-101 Daily Report 20 May 1994 CZECH REPUBLIC Structural Changes in Agriculture Reported Structural Changes in Agriculture Reported LD2005155794 Prague Radiozurnal Radio Network in Czech 1200 GMT 20 May 94 LD2005155794 Prague Radiozurnal Radio Network Czech BFN [Excerpts] According to Minister Lux, the report on the state of Czech agriculture last year, which was published today, states that the structural changes in that sphere are being carried out much faster than those in industry. Ales Hermanek reports: [Hermanek] According to the report, the nonstate sector has a 77 percent share in overall agricultural production, which is almost double that in industry. In the Czech Republic, new private entities own approximately 85 percent of land, out of which 18 percent is owned by natural persons. In this connection, Minister Lux said that in view of the fact that the majority of owners have assumed their rights, their number is much higher than the number of business units. Another result of this is that rented land constitutes 60 percent of overall arable land. The average farm size -- probably still a result of forcible collectivization under the communist regime -- is 10 times as large as that of comparable entities in the countries of the European Union, representing over 135 hectares of land. [passage omitted] In 1993, the overall loss in agriculture was 9.7 billion crowns, while the share of state farms in this figure is over 3 billion crowns. Minister Lux noted as positive the approximately 16 percent rise in food prices last year, inasmuch as consumer prices grew by over 20 percent in the same period.
