In a statement for the Serb Sarajevo Radio, Gen. Mladic did not give any details of the talks, but said that "on the whole everything boils down to the fact that the Muslims do not want to sign an agreement to end of hostilities." Mladic did not wish to comment on the present situation in the areas in which Muslim units launched an offensive. He said that the Muslims had smuggled units from central Bosnia into the area toward Gorazde and that it is obvious they are backing the war option.
