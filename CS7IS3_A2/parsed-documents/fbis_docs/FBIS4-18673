[Juppe] You cannot continue a quarrel with a country like China for many obvious reasons -- economic, political, strategic, demographic, and so forth. In addition, the dialogue had been broken off without there being any major difference between our foreign policies. It was a question of aircraft and frigates -- an issue which was certainly not inconsiderable for our industries, but which did not justify this quarrel lasting more than two years. Especially in view of the fact that it is not impossible to gain on this side (China) what we have lost on the other (Taiwan). [LIBERATION] And yet no promise of contracts is expected from this visit. [Juppe] It is not a commercial visit. There is a great deal of work to be done to regain ground and that will take time. The aim is simply to improve a political climate which had deteriorated greatly. [LIBERATION] Are you writing off human rights and the memory of the 1989 massacre in Beijing? [Juppe] No. We will be accused of that, of course. But I will discuss it as I have already done each time I have received Mr. Qian Qichen (Chinese foreign minister). When Vietnam becomes one of our foreign policy priorities, in what terms is the human rights problem raised? We condemn the situation, we express our demands, but we are nonetheless making Vietnam one of our main targets. [LIBERATION] Does that not present you with a problem? [Juppe] Does it present a problem to the United States, which has still not questioned the most favored nation clause which it has granted to China? It has already closed the Tienanmen Square chapter. I met with the Dalai Lama (spiritual and religious leader of Tibet living in exile in India) during his stopover in Paris. What we are saying is clear, we are not abandoning any of our principles. But I do not conclude from that that we should close the door on China. Or, if we do, we would have to quarrel with three-fourths of the world. We would be on our own. [LIBERATION] In practice, what are you going to do? [Juppe] Tell the Chinese leaders during our talks that this problem worries us. Possibly give lists of names (of political prisoners) to draw attention to particular prisoners, as we have done in many other countries. [LIBERATION] Why impose sanctions on South Africa, propose sanctions against North Korea, and not against China? [Juppe] No country in the world has suggested that the Security Council should impose sanctions against China. In South Africa's case, there was a consensus on the part of the whole international community. Why stand alone in the case of China? [LIBERATION] Do you think that China is moving in the right direction in this sphere? [Juppe] Compared with the Tienanmen Square period, the progress is inadequate but it exists. But I believe very firmly in the logic of modernization and development. What is happening in China will make the system of repression untenable. It is this card we must play. While, of course, ensuring that it does not take another 50 years. Even if the Chinese time frame is not exactly the same as ours. [LIBERATION] Do you think France was wrong to welcome and help the Chinese dissidents after 1989? [Juppe] No. We can help them, and the Chinese must be told that we are not happy with the current situation. We must find a balance between indifference and excessive zeal. Of course, it is not easy. Moralism is often an easy way out.
