Mr. Krishnan Srinivasan, Indian foreign secretary, has made it clear to U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robin Raphel that provision of these planes to Pakistan will increase tension in this region and endanger security here. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has already said the same thing to the U.S. senators visiting India recently. History proves that whenever the United States provided large-scale weapon aid to Pakistan, these were used against India. Whenever Pakistan received weapons in large quantity by becoming member of the SEATO and CENTO military pacts, it started its conspiracy to take over Kashmir. At that time, the United States had assured us that Pakistan will not use those weapons against India. Pakistan did not pay heed to it and attacked India using Sabre jets and Patten tanks. It is not possible that the U.S. politicians are not aware of this fact. Robin Raphel should not have any problem in proving this through her government documents. Now that the United States is suspending Pressler amendment for one year and providing F-16 planes to Pakistan, we cannot deny the creation of a very dangerous situation. Robin Raphel told India's foreign secretary that the United States wants to initiate the process to resolve the problems between the two countries and welcomes the talks held between he two countries last January. So far so good, however, the United States is thinking about suspending the Pressler amendment for a short period. This will disrupt the power balance not only between India and Pakistan but in the whole of South Asia. While the United States is talking about maintaining peace in this region, its actions will only create military rivalry and conflict here. It appears that the U.S. government is trying everything to keep both India and Pakistan happy. It tried to remove the tension created by a statement issued earlier by sending the deputy secretary here and, at the same time, loosened the Pressler amendment to satisfy Pakistan. It is not difficult to see how this political ploy of Clinton administration is giving a conflicting message. Republican Senator Larry Pressler has expressed serious concern over this decision of the Clinton administration. He also met President Clinton to question him about the proposal to give exemption under this law. There is no doubt that if the Pressler amendment is suspended, Pakistan will get 71 F-16 planes, three submarines for its navy, and the destructive planes P-3 Orion. This will naturally increase Pakistan's military might. Not only its air force but also it navy will become significantly stronger. The step the United States is taking by suspending Pressler amendment for one year in order to comply with the older arms deal with Pakistan will greatly increase Pakistan's military power, which in turn will directly endanger India's security. As Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has said, this will trigger a new weapons race and India will have to rethink its defense policy. The United States is also the world's largest arms dealer. The Clinton administration is forced to consider suspending the Pressler amendment for a short time under pressure from the company that manufactures F-16 planes. In this context, he has to write a letter assuring that Pakistan does not have an atomic bomb. How will this be done? That is an interesting subject. The reason is that for the last several years there have been talks about Pakistan having nuclear bombs. This news was published in prominent American newspapers. The Pakistani prime minister has admitted that her country is not without a nuclear program. That is why the Pressler amendment was imposed on Pakistan. This law can be suspended only by sacrificing a declared policy and principles for trade profits and selfish reasons.
