The appeal noted that Comrade Kim Chong-il is an illustrious leader who enjoys boundless respect and reverence not only of the Korean people but also of the revolutionary people of the world for the immortal exploits and contributions he made for the times and mankind. The boundless reverence for Comrade Kim Chong-il can be seen in the fact that many units and objects of different countries were named after his august name. In recent years alone, streets, libraries, classes at schools of different levels and other objects and units in India, Pakistan, Mongolia, Lebanon, Palestine, Madagascar, Zambia, Uganda, Peru, Ecuador, Guyana and other countries have been given his name. Functions for naming them after Comrade Kim Chong-il were held grandly in those countries. Members of the State Council of Guyana including the minister of health took part in the function for naming the Guaber Street in Corriverton City Kim Chong-il Street. The minister of health at the naming ceremony said to have a street named after Comrade Kim Chong-il in Corriverton City was a highest honor for the Guyanese Government and people. There is the "Dear Leader Kim Chong-il Library" at the Asian Regional Institute of the Chuche Idea in New Delhi, India. The library is crowded everyday with Indian people of all strata who come to learn from the dear leader. The Ali Ali School in Karachi, Pakistan, the Onike Primary School of Nigeria, the Kuds School of Palestine and many other schools have classes called by the august name of Comrade Kim Chong-il. The boundless feelings of reverence for the dear leader are associated with "Kimchongilia", an immortal flower. "Kimchongilia" is a rare flower which was bred by Mototeru Kamo, a famous botanist of Japan, through his hard work for more than 20 years. The flower named after the illustrious leader is now in full bloom in more than 50 countries. Some time ago, the Mozambican president, praising the immortal flower "Kimchongilia", said the fact that a Japanese botanist bred and presented this flower to dear Comrade Kim Chong-il well shows how deep the respect and reverence of the world people for him is.
