"The recommendations and decisions of the European councils in Edinburgh and Copenhagen, and the measures recently approved by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the `12', which, by their contents exceed the framework settled through the association agreements, mark a new stage in the development of growingly closer political and economic ties between the European Union and its associated partners from Central and Eastern Europe, reflecting, at the same time, a greater interest on the part of our community partners in supporting the latter's efforts of nearing and integrating in this European body. "The Romanian Government has welcomed with outmost satisfaction these decisions which sanction, among other things, the principle of undifferential treatment of all associated partners, and which are capable to assure them that the process of their integration in the European Union -- a common target of both parties -- will follow its normal course, a rising course, free from influence from circumstantial situations. "As far as Romania is concerned, we are fully aware that integration in the European Union is a complex process that requires time, especially in respect of alignment to European legislation and standards, of reaching the necessary level of economic performance. on the other hand, we must not forget that the European Union itself is still evolving and even reconsidering its institutional mechanisms, as required by the implementation of the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and by the widening of Union membership with four new West European states. "The Romanian Government's view is that a document of such importance, as the application for admission to the European Union is, must take in consideration all these realities and occur when the conditions are met for starting effective negotiations, with the due consideration of interests and implications concerning both sides. "While reasserting its firm option for the adherence to the European Union, the Government of Romania is sure that, by converging efforts of all political forces and segments of the Romanian society, the required performance levels can be reached, including those of economic nature, apt to make it possible for this country to fully accede to the status of union member in an as close as possible perspective. "In the present stage, the Romanian Government pursues in its relations with the European Union the following objectives: the completion as soon as possible of the procedures for the ratification of the European agreement; the fulfilment by both sides of the commitments made under the association agreement; the obtainment of greater support from the European Union for the process of reform and for the reaching of standards as required for by integration purposes; amplifying the efforts for bringing domestic legislation in harmony with community legislation; the participation in all the great continental infrastructure projects; the active participation in the bilateral and multilateral political dialogue by capitalising all the opportunities offered by the association agreement and the decisions made subsequently at community level."
