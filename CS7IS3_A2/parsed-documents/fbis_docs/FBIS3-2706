This method can generate a profit rate of 100-200 percent, about 10 times higher than by traditional turtle breeding. Farmer Wang Zhunduo, 29, said that the 50,000 young soft-shelled turtles he is raising can be sold for no less than three million yuan (about 345,000 U.S. dollars) by the end of this year, when they are fully grown. Local official Zhong Juntian said a farmer raised soft-shelled turtles on more than 20 mu (about 1.4 ha [hectare]) of land and incubated another 100,000 soft-shelled turtle eggs last year, earning more than two million yuan (about 230,000 U.S. dollars). The rearing of soft-shelled turtles first started in 1992 in the village, which boasts abundant geothermal energy resources. The spring water there, of the HA.K-HCO [expansion not given] type, is 78 to 91 degrees Centigrade and is rich in trace elements. Experts said the new method of raising soft-shelled turtles in spring water has greatly shortened their growth period. Such turtles can grow up to 800 g [grams] within a year, compared to 500 g over three to four years in the past. They said the new method has also reduced the death rate of young soft-shelled turtles during the winter hibernation season from around 80 percent to one percent. The stable temperature of the spring water keeps soft-shelled turtles actively growing all the year round, the experts said, adding that spring water also ensures high egg-laying and incubation rates. In addition to a total of 120 mu of open spring water area, the village has artificially developed another 150 mu and constructed a spring water farm. And the open area is expected to expand to 300 mu by the end of this year. Counting at the current price level, every ha devoted to the raising of soft-shelled turtles can generate three million to 4.5 million yuan (about 345,000 to 457,000 U.S. dollars) in output value, with a net profit of more than 1.5 million yuan. Local farmers are planning to build enclosed farms for raising soft-shelled turtles. These farms will be lit up at night in order to speed up the growth period. Zijin County, to which the village belongs, has decided to spread soft-shelled turtle fries to all its territory after they have spent the winter season in spring water.
