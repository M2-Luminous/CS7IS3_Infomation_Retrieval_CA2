According to information obtained by RESPUBLIKA, the six-hour discussion on national defense problems was very heated. The meeting was attended by Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, National Defense Minister L. Linkevicius, leaders of the LDDP and its faction, members of the Seimas [parliament] National Security Committee [NSC] who belong to the LDDP faction, and V. Juskus, chairman of the Seimas Commission for Investigating Economic Crimes. Participants in the meeting decided not to provide any information to the press and restrict themselves to an official report (by doing this they deprived the press of the chance to present objective and overall information) which was circulated yesterday by the government rather than the party spokesman. According to the information, the meeting heard L. Linkevicius' report entitled "National Defense: Condition and Perspective," discussed the overall concept of defense, the upgrading of the national defense system, and closer cooperation among the National Defense Ministry [KAM], the government, and the NSC. According to RESPUBLIKA information, the larger part of the meeting was devoted to the clarification of relations between the KAM and the NSC. The meeting drew the conclusion that there were no contradictions in principle and proposed to resolve the existing mutual claims. According to one participant in the meeting, who wished to remain anonymous, the failure to do so "can mean trouble." According to the words of another participant, the meeting demanded the L. Linkevicius toughen up order in the Army so officers do not discuss whether the Army needs a commander or not. Participants in the meeting also insisted on an investigation into the fate of the property of the [former Soviet] Society for Assisting Army, Air Force, and Navy. Explanations concerning this issue should be provided by former National Defense Minister A. Butkevicius and current Deputy Minister J. Gecas. NSC members were reprimanded for violating the law and providing secret information to the press. As the third person who wanted to remain anonymous said, if NSC members continue to violate the law, "relevant conclusions will be drawn." Some representatives of the LDDP faction demanded that the NSC not admit journalists to its meetings in the future. The fourth participant of the meeting, who did not want to be named, said that V. Juskus, chairman of the Seimas Commissions for Economic Crimes, had stated with determination that as long as he headed the commissions, the national defense case [reference to arms deals] would be investigated to the very end. J. Juskus demanded that some LDDP faction members did not hang around the prosecutor's office and interfere with the investigation. [LDDP faction chief] J. Karosas denied this information. He told RESPUBLIKA that neither he nor the other four faction members impeded the investigation of the national defense case, but only inquired to the prosecutor's office whether "this matter was not forgotten." According to information from the editorial office, the next meeting may address the fate of L. Linkevicius. There were also proposals to demilitarize the KAM by placing all servicemen and the counterintelligence service under the Army commander, and to reduce the staff at the ministry and its International Relations Department.
