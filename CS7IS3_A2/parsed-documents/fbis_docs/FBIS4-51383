Foreigners would rephrase it by calling it the "world's last Shangri-la," which means the same thing. However, the reality is totally different: This "roof of the world" amid reform and opening up has unprecedented vigor and vitality and has in store formidable hopes and prospects..... At one time, Tibet was considered the "rear" of China's reform and opening up. No wonder. The blueprint for the 1990's drawn up by Tibetans themselves does not seem to aim high. It fixes the annual average growth rate at only approximately 5.8 percent. Of course, it has difficulties which outsiders have difficulty understanding. The "blood-transfusion" economy consistently pursued over the past 40 years alone is a high wall that destines Tibet to have a very, very long way to go for its economic development, not to mention the contradiction between the gradually decreasing farmland and the drastically increasing population and the numerous restrictive factors such as communications, energy, and population quality. But this is no reason for Tibet to be content with the present situation and not to think of making progress. After the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's remarks during his southern tour was relayed to the ice-capped plateau in early 1992, Tibetans could no longer remain calm. They began to ask themselves: Can Tibet remain "special" forever and continue to depend on the state's long-term "blood transfusions"? Is Tibet willing to accept the label of "being special" and stand at the rear of reform and opening up? Backwardness is not terrifying. Being geographically closed is not terrifying. What is terrifying is rigid and conservative thinking and the psychology of idleness. Since April 1992, a big discussion on "changing the way of thinking and finding out about the difference," which involved everyone on the plateau, began in this context. By transforming the "rear" into the "forefront" facing South Asia and changing an advantage in resources into an economic advantage, Tibetans this time seized the opportunity to increase the extent of reform and strive to develop in pace with the national economy. At the beginning of July 1992, Tibet introduced a series of policies and regulations, including those intended to "deepen reform and increase the degree of openness," "encourage investment in Tibet from abroad and at home," and quicken the development of tertiary industry and township and town enterprises. In mid-July, the ports of Tibet's Burang and India's Gongci open and close at the same hours. The Yamarong Border Trade Fair, which had been suspended for 33 years, and other traditional border markets were restored. In August, Tibet announced 19 projects to attract a total investment of over 4 billion yuan. It also set up an office for attracting investment from abroad and at home. Afterward, border-trade and export-oriented economic development zones were set up in 10 counties and ports on the Tibetan border. In September, large-scale economic and trade talks between Tibet and Nepal solemnly opened in Lhasa..... With its unprecedented high efficiency, quick tempo, and new attitude, the "roof of the world" made the world see it in a new light. That summer, an unprecedented market wave swept across Tibet. In Lhasa, the barriers of government organs on Linguo Road, Beijing Road, and Jinzhu Road were all pulled down almost overnight. Half a month later, a metals market was set up on Linguo Road and Beijing Road was changed into a street of clothes shops, and deluxe restaurants and hotels were found on west Beijing road. According to the Lhasa Bureau of Industry and Commerce, in the June-July period alone, over 500 individual industrial and commercial entrepreneurs were added, almost 10 percent of the city's total individual and commercial entrepreneurs. Several bustling commercial streets were also found in such central cities and towns as Xigaze and Zetang. Furthermore, local governments introduced "economic and trade" contents to the numerous ethnic traditional festivals in the summer and autumn of that year, such as Lhasa's Xuedun festival, Gyangze's Dama festival, Nagqu's Horse-Racing festival, Shannan's Yalong Cultural Festival, and Nyingchi's Spring Festival. At the same time, they also held trade fairs of different scales so that the Tibetan peasants and herdsmen could experience a new way of spending the festivals. In the meantime, governments at all levels in Tibet have introduced preferential policies, set aside special funds, quickened market development, and shifted their attention from the previous trade fairs to all types of multifunction, multilayer, and multiform special markets. In this connection, real estate development, capital, labor service, and old-clothing markets have come into being. Transactions in the timber, grain, and fruit markets have become brisker. What is heartening is that peasants and herdsmen have begun to appear in the market arena. A special market has been set up in Lhasa specifically for peasants and herdsmen coming into the city to do business. Today, Lhasa people are beginning to speculate on stocks now that the Lhasa Securities Exchange has been put into operation. Over the past two years, Tibet's national economy has developed at a higher growth rate each year. As far as its GNP is concerned, it was 2.535 billion yuan in 1991, 3.27 billion yuan in 1992, and 3.65 billion yuan in 1993. Calculated at comparable prices, these figures were 3.7 percent, 7.1 percent, and 8.1 percent higher respectively than in the previous year.
