The Republic of Croatia is seriously concerned over the situation in Gorazde, where nobody is trying to prevent yet another slaughter by the Serbs, Nobilo says. He warns that direct violation of the UN resolution on safe zones is a dangerous precedent, which could affect the peace process not only in Bosnia-Herzegovina but also in Croatia. The situation in Gorazde is already having a negative effect on the negotiations between the Croatian side and the Serb rebels. The rebel Serb authorities have refused to take part in the second round of talks, scheduled for last week. There is an increasing number of reports on provocations by Serb paramilitary formations, particularly in sectors west and south. The Serb rebels in Baranja have again taken up arms, thus violating the cease-fire agreement of 29 March, Nobilo says. The Croatian ambassador also warns that, due to the situation in Gorazde, another wave of refugees could arrive in central Bosnia, which could damage the prospects for gradual implementation of the agreement on the Croat-Bosniak federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, signed in Washington. Nobilo notes that a refugee wave could spread into the Republic of Croatia, which is already providing accommodation for 280,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina. The situation in Gorazde is a repetition of the tragedy of Vukovar, where the world merely watched as innocent people were victimized by a regime held in contempt. The Serb aggression must finally be halted, Nobilo's letter says. The UN Security Council must be ready to impose peace. Lack of decisive action within the possibilities open to the Security Council would at the moment threaten not only the prospects for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also the territorial integrity and safety of the Republic of Croatia. My government, while continuing to support the peace process, retains the right to re-examine its position regarding the situation in the occupied territories in these dangerous, deteriorating circumstances, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, the letter says in conclusion.
