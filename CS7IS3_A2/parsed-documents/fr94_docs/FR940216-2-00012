SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for OMB approval to revise the following report: 1. Report title: Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks Agency form number: FFIEC 002 OMB Docket number: 7100-0032 Frequency: Quarterly Reporters: U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks Annual reporting hours: 44,045 Estimated average hours per response: 19.15 Number of respondents: 575 Small businesses are affected. General description of report: This information collection is mandatory [12 U.S.C. 3105 (b)(2), 1817(a)(1) and (3), and 3102(b)] and is given partial confidential treatment [5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)]. On a quarterly basis, all U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks (U.S. branches) are required to file detailed schedules of assets and liabilities in the form of a condition report and a variety of supporting schedules. This balance sheet information is used to fulfill the supervisory and regulatory requirements of the International Banking Act of 1978. The data are also used to augment the bank credit, loan, and deposit information needed for monetary policy purposes. The report is collected and processed by the Federal Reserve on behalf of all three federal bank regulatory agencies. The proposed changes affect several existing schedules; the proposed changes are as follows: (1) Revisions to reflect the effect of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities'' (FASB 115), which agencies and branches of foreign banks must adopt for FFIEC 002 purposes for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993: (a) A new item would be added to Schedule RAL, ``Assets and Liabilities'', for ``Assets Held in Trading Accounts.'' (b) In the Memorandum section of Schedule RAL, ``Assets and Liabilities'', Memorandum item 1, ``Market value of securities held'', would be deleted. Four new memoranda items would be added for ``Fair value of held-to-maturity securities'', ``Amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities'', ``Fair value of available-for-sale securities'', and ``Amortized cost of available-for-sale securities.'' (2) On Schedule RAL, ``Assets and Liabilities'', a memorandum item would be added to indicate the level of auditing work performed for the U.S. branch. (3) On Schedule C, ``Loans'', a new item would be added for ``Lease financing receivable (net of unearned income)'', with a split into separate subitems for U.S. addressees (domestic) and non-U.S. addressees (domestic). (4) On Schedule M, ``Duefrom/Due to Related Institutions in the U.S. and in Foreign Countries'', the title for Part IV, ``Allowance for loan losses'' would be retitled as ``Confidential Loan Information'', and a new item would be added for ``Other Real Estate Owned.'' (5) On Schedule M, Part V, ``Commitments and contingencies with related depository institutions'', two new items would be added for ``all other off-balance sheet contingent liabilities'' and ``all other off-balance sheet continent claims.'' In addition, the general instructions to the FFIEC 002 would be modified to allow on-balance sheet amounts associated with conditional and exchange contracts (e.g., forwards, interest rate swaps, and options) to be offset in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39. This would be an interim treatment pending clarification of an interpretive issue under Interpretation No. 39. However, consistent with existing instructions to the commercial bank Call Report, the instructions to the FFIEC 002 would be modified to indicate that the netting of assets and liabilities other than those arising from conditional and excange contracts will not be permitted unless specifically required by the instructions. The effective date for the proposed changes, if approved, would be the March 31, 1994, report date. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 10, 1994. William W. Wiles, Secretary of the Board. [FR Doc. 94-3539 Filed 2-15-94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6210-01-F
