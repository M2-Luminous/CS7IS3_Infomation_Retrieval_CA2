It is very unusual for a chief cabinet secretary, who serves as the prime minister's "head clerk," to contest the government's policy. Apparently, Takemura had thought that the prime minister's final decision would not indicate the rate of tax increase or the period of implementation, and that it would be acceptable to the SDPJ. He seems to be increasingly unhappy with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who acceded to the wishes of Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] -- who represents the Finance Ministry's views -- as in the recent case of the Diet deliberations on the political reform bills. At a general meeting of Sakigake's [Harbinger] Diet members held in the early hours of 3 February, strong criticism of the prime minister flared up. Takemura seemed to believe that "What happened was so abrupt that we were all baffled. There are many Diet members who do not approve of this. If we let things go on like this, the situation is going to become very serious." Some Sakigake members expressed the opinion that "You should (ask the prime minister to revise his plan) with a determination to resign [if he refuses]." Takemura also spoke at the gathering. One Diet member attending the meeting said, "Our leader [Takemura] thinks that if the plan is not revised, the coalition government will collapse. He was dead serious." He disclosed that if the prime minister does not revise his plan, Takemura is determined to resign as chief cabinet secretary. However, Takemura himself denied this at a news conference in the early evening of 3 February, saying: "I have not expressed any intention to resign. I am not thinking of leaving my job half done." Nevertheless, he seemed to have definitely given the impression at the Sakigake meeting that he would resign. Takemura visited the prime minister at the latter's office on the morning of 3 February to ask him to revise the tax plan. At a news conference held later, Takemura said: "There are no absolutes in politics. There is also the saying that the best thing to do with a mistake is to correct it. There are instances in which it is not right to take the attitude that what has been decided cannot be changed." He thus indicated that an agreement has been reached at his meeting with the prime minister to revise the tax plan. It seems that a rebellion from the very core of the administration, on top of the bitter opposition from the SDPJ, the No. 1 ruling party, has succeeded in accelerating moves to effect a revision. Takemura had commended the flexible attitude taken by the SDPJ before the prime minister made his decision. He was, therefore, taken by surprise by the subsequent decision of the prime minister, whom he had expected to take the SDPJ's position into consideration, to accede 100 percent to the suggestions of the Finance Ministry. In this connection, Takemura said during the news conference: "The prime minister had been fully informed of developments in the SDPJ. He might have taken the optimistic view that somehow things would work out in the end." Other senior government officials gave a different version of what happened. They claimed, "Because top- ranking SDPJ officials had said 'The government can do as it likes,' there could be various interpretations of this." In any case, the influence of Ozawa, in speaking for the Finance Ministry, can undeniably be felt behind the prime minister's decision. Takemura, who was not able to participate directly in the decisionmaking process leading to the plan to introduce the national welfare tax, must have had very mixed feelings.
