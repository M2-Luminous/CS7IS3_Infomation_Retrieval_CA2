FR940616-0-00026 FR940616-0-00007 3. 310 IAC 12&hyph;0.5&hyph;116‚ê£Soil Productivity This term is defined to mean the capacity of a soil for producing a specified plant or sequence of plants under a physically defined set of management practices. In its submittal of this definition, Indiana stated that its definition of the term ``soil productivity'' is modeled after the definition of the same term as found in the ``Resource Conservation Glossary,'' Third edition, Soil Conservation Society of America, 1982, page 159. There is no direct Federal counterpart to this definition. However, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 823.15 use the term soil productivity in the regulations on prime farmland revegetation and restoration. The Director finds the proposed definition to be consistent with the Federal use of the term ``soil productivity'' at 30 CFR 823.15. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments Agency Comments Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various interested Federal agencies. No agency comments were received on the proposed amendments. Public Comments The public comment period and opportunity to request a public hearing was announced in the August 5, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 41669). The comment period closed on September 7, 1993. No comments were received during the comment period, and no one requested an opportunity to testify at the scheduled public hearing so no hearing was held. V. Director's Decision Based on the above findings, and except as noted below, the Director is approving Indiana's proposed amendment 93&hyph;5 as submitted by Indiana on July 2, 1993. As discussed in Finding B&hyph;3, the Director is approving 310 IAC 12&hyph;0.5&hyph;139(b) except to the extent that the proposed language is silent concerning the applicability of State statutory law. In addition, the Director is requiring that Indiana further amend 310 IAC 12&hyph;0.5&hyph;139(b) to provide that the interpretation of the terms of the document used to establish a valid existing right shall be based either upon applicable State statutory or case law concerning interpretation of documents conveying mineral rights, or where no applicable State statutory or common law exists, the interpretation is based upon the provisions at subdivisions 139(b)(1) and (2). The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 914 codifying decisions concerning the Indiana program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage the State to conform its program with the Federal standards without delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. Effect of Director's Decision Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In his oversight of the Indiana program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials approved by him, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require the enforcement by Indiana of only such provisions. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. ) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq. ). The Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories and that EPA's concurrence is not required. VI. Procedural Determinations Executive Order 12866 This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met. National Environmental Policy Act No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).
