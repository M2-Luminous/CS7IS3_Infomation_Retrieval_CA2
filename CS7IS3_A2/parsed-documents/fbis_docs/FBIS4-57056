FBIS4-57056 "drlat092_r_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-092 Daily Report 3 May 1994 Peru `Feliciano' Takes Measures Against `Possible Defeat' `Feliciano' Takes Measures Against `Possible Defeat' PY1105213094 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 3 May 94 p A2 PY1105213094 Lima EXPRESO Spanish BFN [Text] Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand, who for some time now has been known as "President Feliciano" by those who currently reject Abimael Guzman Reynoso's leadership, has reportedly simultaneously ordered an increase in Shining Path actions in Lima and the transfer of Shining Path bases and refuge areas to border regions, so as to expedite the Shining Path's escape abroad in case of possible defeat. This is according to an intelligence report based on statements made by Shining Path members who have resorted to the repentance law and who have been in contact with Ramirez Durand's lieutenants. There are indications that a few months ago, "Feliciano" tried to meet with terrorist cadres operating as "roving" columns in Azangaro and Melgar, in Puno. There is also, however, testimony that Ramirez Durand is currently in the Gran Pajonal jungle area in Pasco. Another theory states that he is in Lima, personally heading the so-called "Neighborhood Class Movement" in Lima shantytowns. The fact is that a so-called "Emergency Central Committee" has started to operate in Lima. This committee seeks to coordinate actions in seven areas in the outskirts of Lima, in the same places where the establishment of an "iron belt" was attempted, before Abimael Guzman's fall, to strangle and take over the city. Ramirez Durand reportedly has a contingent of about 200 Shining Path members called the "People's Guerrilla Army." They are armed and the majority of them have been selected for their "loyalty" and for having shown cruelty and the capacity to strictly follow "orders." They are like robots, willing to sacrifice themselves for "Feliciano," who holds complete control over them. Only a few of them personally know him, however. Intelligence souces report that "what they ignore is that Ramirez Durand will employ the `sausage' policy against them: When he sees he has lost, he will leave them behind as cannon fodder to cover his withdrawal. They will be grouped in platoons to divert attention or to halt the Army's advance so that "Feliciano" can escape to the "refuge" areas.
