Tankers with waste docked near the factory wharf of Zvezda in Bolshoy Kamen are filled to capacity, and can contain no more dangerous cargo. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this by Vladimir Ignatenko, representative of Russian president in the Maritime Kray. He said the government should have allocated funds to build a facility for processing the waste, but not a single ruble has been allocated for this purpose so far. Meanwhile, one of the tankers, which contains 794 tonnes of waste, is in a dilapidated condition. Either the factory has to be stopped so that the already critical mass of radioactive liquid will not increase, or else it has to be dumped at sea. However, this may take place only after coordinating it with the Russian president, said Vladimir Ignatenko.
