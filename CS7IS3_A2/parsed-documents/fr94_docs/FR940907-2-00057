FR940907-2-00057 FR940907-2-00042 [Docket No. 94N&hyph;0243] Certification for Exports; Revised Compliance Policy Guide; Availability AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a revised Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 7150.01 entitled, ``Certification for Exports.'' Firms exporting products from the United States are often asked by foreign customers or foreign governments to supply a certification relating to products subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other acts that FDA administers. FDA has historically issued a number of different types of such certificates, e.g., Certificates of Free Sale, Certificates for Export, Certificates to Foreign Governments, and most recently the European Union Health Certificate for Fishery Products. With expanding world trade, ongoing international harmonization initiatives, and developing international agreements, pressures on FDA to issue more certificates for U.S. products are escalating. Therefore, FDA has revised the CPG to clarify that it is the responsibility of the certificate requestor to provide information that will allow FDA to issue a Certificate for Export and to provide guidance on the preparation of such certificates, including model forms. The revised guidance will improve agency uniformity and consistency in providing export certifications for FDA-regulated commodities. ADDRESSES: CPG 7150.01 may be ordered from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Rd., Springfield, VA 22161. Orders must reference NTIS order number PB94&hyph;204401 and include payment of $9 for each copy of the document plus $2 shipping and handling. Payment may be made by check, money order, charge card (American Express, Visa, or Mastercard), or billing arrangements made with NTIS. Charge card orders must include the charge card account number and expiration date. For telephone orders or further information on placing an order, call NTIS at 703&hyph;487&hyph;4650. CPG 7150.01 is available for public examination in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven M. Solomon, Office of Regulatory Affairs (HFC&hyph;230), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;443&hyph;1500. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This revised CPG describes current agency views on certificates requested by U. S. firms to facilitate the exports of FDA regulated products to other countries. The agency recognizes the current importance of fulfilling requests for export certificates, however, FDA's long-term policy is to work towards the reduction or elimination of export certificates by finding other means to satisfy other countries' need for reassurance about imported products. The new guide replaces CPG 7150.01 entitled ``Certificates of Free Sale'' that was issued in 1989. The statements made in CPG 7150.01 are not intended to bind the courts, the public, or FDA or to create or confer any rights, privileges, immunities, or benefits on or for any private person, but are intended merely for internal FDA guidance. Dated: August 15, 1994. Ronald G. Chesemore, Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22033 Filed 9&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
