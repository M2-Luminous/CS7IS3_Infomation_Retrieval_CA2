President of the National Assembly and of the FRODEBU [Burundian Democratic Front] majority party, Ntibantunganya, who claims that recent events have brought the government and army closer together, has been designated to serve as the interim government leader following the death of former head of state, Cyprien Ntaryiamira, who was assassinated in Kigali. A rather frail figure in a grey suit, he is a man who has established himself following the conflict in Kamenge, the Hutu "rebel" stronghold in Bujumbura, and who consented to receive us in his residence overlooking the capital. [Papy] The Kamenge crisis turned out to be a major political test for the government. Was it a successful one? [Ntibantunganya] I have personally congratulated the army on its behaviour while the crisis was being resolved, both the command and the troops in general. The aim of the disarmament operation was to carry it out while causing as little damage as possible. And that was what duly happened. It should serve as an example for the security of the capital. However, disarmament alone is not enough. We must now examine the defense and security of the population in a global context, break the yoke of distrust between the population and its army, encourage this rapprochement so that reasonable solutions can be found in tense situations. The Debate Is Open [Papy] Is army reform a path that must be trodden in order to ensure stability in Burundi? [Ntibantunganya] The problem with the army (which has a Tutsi majority -- LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note) must be analyzed by all of the country's leading politicians. The debate is open. Moreover, you know, the army is not opposed to this. Even before June 1993 (the date of democratic elections), a report pointing to the same conclusion was drawn up by the military institute itself. What is more, I would hope that people might take a fresh look at it now. I do not think there is a need to deal with the problem in terms of "ethnic quotas." Rather, we must get to grips with it in the general framework of the various state corps: The police, the army, and the administration on the basis of ideological, regional, and ethnic criteria so that these institutions are representative, legal, and respectful of human rights. [Papy] Claims are being made that a certain military hierarchy which has gained in strength through the present collaboration is actively backing your candidacy in the presidential elections. Is this true? [Ntibantunganya] First of all, the time has not yet come to stand as a candidate. The current priority is to restore security. Secondly, the army should not support a single candidate, but rather the political authorities he represents within the framework of democratic mechanisms. [Papy] There are those who reproach the FRODEBU of being incapable managers, the prime illustration of this supposedly being the "rebellion" in Kamenge, which was supported by some of your members. [Ntibantunganya] It should be recalled that the government established after the elections did not have the time to establish its authority. President Ndadaye was assassinated just 102 days after coming to power. Then he was hunted down and the country was left to its own devices. How can you be expected to govern a country as large as this one responsibly when you lose two presidents in the space of six months? On the other hand, the reaction after the tragic death of Cyprien Ntaryiamira was positive. The country stayed calm and we did not experience any spiral of violence like in Rwanda. Disinterest On this latter point, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya deplores the disinterest of the international community and "the abdication of responsibilities" by the United Nations which "is setting up a Human Rights Commission and at the same time showing that it is incapable of guaranteeing even the very first of these rights, the right to live." Furthermore, the Burundian Interim President is calling for the presence in Bujumbura of UN civil authorities who would serve as a base from which the democratic process could be observed and monitored. Today, President Ntibantunganya is being forced to face up to one priority: "To stamp out extremism" with the help of the population.
