The Southern Command can evacuate the region in less than a week from the moment the agreement with the PLO is signed. Our military correspondent Roni Daniyel has the details: Everything which is not vital has already been removed from the Gaza Strip, and the Southern Command can carry out the task of evacuation, if and when the agreements are signed, by the middle of April. We are not fully packed, it was stated in the Southern Command, but what is left can be evacuated in only a few days. There are detailed plans for overlapping with the Palestinian security forces, including a joint command for the days of the evacuation which will begin in Rafah and end in Gaza. The security system which will be in effect after the evacuation is also already in operation in the Qatif Bloc. The usual security activity, including the chasing of armed wanted people, continues, but the IDF is surely waiting for the signing of the agreement and the evacuation.
