China's economic development has made a new step forward from a new starting point. The whole world is closely watching how we head toward the 21st century. Displaying a high sense of responsibility, the 5,000 or so deputies and members attending the "two sessions" -- the Second Session of the Eighth People's Congress [NPC] and the Second Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] -- have also been seriously pondering on this issue. (1) The calls for "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, expediting reform, and maintaining stability" and "properly handling the relations between reform, development, and stability" have become the most important topics discussed, analyzed, and studied by everybody during and after meetings. They maintain that China's economic development is undergoing a transitional period toward a stage of more reasonable development. Many deputies say that, although China has achieved world- renowned economic successes and enjoyed the highest economic growth in the world over the past 15 years, reform takes a relatively long time and cannot be achieved overnight. They also realize the simple but profound truth that haste makes waste. This is the same warning served by the lessons the nation learned the hard way from its economic development after the republic was founded. Some deputies say: The 9 percent economic growth set for this year is still quite high in the world. The hindrance caused by basic industries has become more noticeable owing to the high growth in the past two years. Lowering the growth appropriately is sensible and totally in line with economic law. This shows that the Chinese Government has walked out from the odd cycle -- when control was imposed, the economy became lifeless; and when control was removed, the economy was in disorder -- and become even more mature in applying economic law. The 1.1 billion Chinese people have learned from personal experiences that economic prosperity depends on reform and development. But just as Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Stability prevails over everything." The country needs political unity and stability because China needs a harmonious social environment with less controls for reform and development. Without stability, nothing can be accomplished. Some deputies say that in this crucial year for reform, readjustment of interests has to be made in certain economic sectors, and it will give rise to many new problems. To ensure success, priority must be given to ensuring a stable social environment. When we do our work, we must pay special attention to discovering problems and dealing with them promptly so as to make sure that reform and development can proceed smoothly. China's economic development is also becoming healthier and more mature as can be seen from the fact that stability is now considered as a very important part of the requirement of overall importance set for the whole party and the country. The deputies and the CPPCC National Committee members also note that, while stability is underscored, it does not mean that we have to be overcautious and ignore the rare opportunity for development. On the contrary, to achieve genuine social stability, we must promote stability through development and reform. This is because if the country lacks the strength, it cannot improve the people's living standards, the economy will be bleak, the market will wither, and there will not be genuine social stability. The nation can have long-term peace and stability only when it is economically prosperous. (2) Market economy is an economy supported by a legal system. Well- conceived laws and regulations are important indicators of a country's economic maturity. The deputies are pleased to talk about their legislative achievements: Since the convening of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the NPC and its standing committee have enacted nearly 200 laws. The deputies and members of the CPPCC National Committee are excited to know that, to keep pace with economic development, the nation's legislative departments will from now on give top priority to providing economic development with legal protection. Some CPPCC National Committee members point out that, since the 14th national party congress, the guiding thought for China's legislation has changed from serving primarily the planned economy to accelerating the establishment of a market economic system; and from primarily summing up the successes of reform and opening up achieved in real life to setting the norms governing future economic conduct. The Eighth NPC promised one year ago that the construction of a legal structure framework for the socialist market economy will be basically completed within five years. Now, one year later, people can already see the fruitful results. During the six meetings it has held, the Eighth NPC Standing Committee has deliberated on more than 40 draft laws, of which two- thirds are about market economy; and drafted and revised 21 other laws, of which 13 are about market economy. This is to say that the number of market economy-related laws examined and adopted by the standing committee of this term is proportionally larger than those of all previous standing committees. The deputies and members maintain that the establishment and improvement of the socialist market economic system must be governed and protected by a sound legal system; and that improvement of the law is also essential for economic prosperity and development. They stress: China's reforms and legislation must be closely coordinated and the policies governing reforms and legislation must be integrated. Legislation must reflect the spirit of reform; and our laws must guide, promote, and safeguard the smooth progress of reform. Without a doubt, China's legal system is still far from being able to meet the requirements of China's economic development. Some deputies and members say that there is yet to be a legal structure supporting the market economy, and certain badly needed economic laws are still defective. Fortunately, people have begun to confront the defects and insufficiencies and will deal with them step by step. This year the NPC Standing Committee will continue to give top priority to speeding up legislation, especially economic legislation. Making laws that serve reform, promote reform, set the norms for reform by utilizing the successful experiences gained from reform, readjusting the new relations between economic sectors, and preventing mistakes from being unnecessarily made during reform will continue to be the core of China's economic legislation. Members of the CPPCC National Committee note that the high speed and quick rhythm of China's economic legislation are telling the people that China's economic development has started to proceed in an orderly and healthy manner and has entered a brand new area in which economic development has the support of laws. (3) During the two sessions this year, NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members have commented emotionally on the need to "study effective measures and pay attention to actual results." They say that the whole party and society as a whole must energetically advocate the need to study effective measures and pay attention to actual results so that new progress can be made in building a socialist market economic system and in ensuring a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and other central leading comrades have emphasized at almost all group discussions that people in the country must work with one heart and one mind, do solid work with genuine efforts, fight in unity, and make concerted efforts; and that we must strengthen our conviction, seize the opportunity, and bring about a sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development. NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members coming from various parts of the country say that people throughout the country should have the common understanding that "empty talk can hinder national development and a strong country can be built by doing hard, solid work." Some deputies say: The central authorities have now set the general policy, the key requirement now is that, when we implement this policy, we must resort to effective measures and pay attention to achieving actual results. Leading cadres at all levels must guide the masses to exert concerted efforts, take real and effective measures to carry out various projects, make sure that actual results are achieved, and work practically in rallying and leading the vast number of people to push forward all economic and other construction projects. Many deputies and CPPCC National Committee members agree that being pragmatic is the distinctive characteristics of the two sessions this year. They say this characteristics can be observed from the length of the government work report, which is the shortest one in recent years; from the phrases and terms regularly used by deputies and members in their talks; and from their pledges that, after the two meetings are over, they will make practical efforts to carrying out their guidelines. This shows that NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members are improving in participating in administration and discussion of state affairs, and that China is also improving in handling economic and other affairs. Some deputies and members add that China's maturing economic work can also be observed from this year's government work report which states that the Chinese Government will not evade problems but will confront them. Some deputies say that, in the past several years, the hot topics of discussion used to be policies, reforms, and opportunities. Since the nation's economic reform was still at the exploratory stage, those words were quite "insubstantial." Now the framework of China's economic reform has basically taken shape and many reform measures have been introduced. This means that China's economic development is maturing, and that NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members are also maturing and have become more "pragmatic." In a word, the Chinese people have become more pragmatic. A pragmatic nation is a nation imbued with hopes. We believe that China's economic development will proceed steadily and become more mature, and China will head for the world and the 21st century with ample confidence!
