Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-12JAN94-JAPAN-U.S. Japanese Government Appears Divided on Framework Talks SUMMARY Japanese press reporting over the past few weeks suggests that Tokyo is divided over its strategy for the Japan-U.S. framework talks and over its assessment of the U.S. position in the talks. In the absence of any clear direction from Japan's political leadership, elements of the Japanese bureaucracy that reportedly favor a hard-line approach appear at present to have the upper hand. However, there appear to be some sections of the bureaucracy that are arguing for a more conciliatory approach. Some Japanese press reports suggest that, as the deadline for concluding the negotiations nears, the hard-liners may be forced to modify their stand somewhat in order to avoid scuttling the talks and souring Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's summit with President Clinton on 11 February. END SUMMARY The Japanese Government appears to have developed no clear strategy for resolving the current impasse in the U.S.-Japan framework negotiations, in part because the sections of the Japanese bureaucracy responsible for conducting the talks seem to be divided over what approach to take. On the one hand, one group appears to favor continuing to take a hard-line in the talks, categorically rejecting any U.S. demands to establish objective criteria to measure Japanese trade performance. This group also appears to be insisting that the talks address measures that Japan wants the United States to take to improve its competitiveness, and to be refusing to consider setting any guidelines for imports in specific industrial sectors. This position, which appears to be held primarily in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF), has received wide coverage in the statements made by key Japanese officials in the Japanese press. -- In an interview in the 27 December-3 January issue of the English-language Nikkei Weekly, targeted at a foreign audience, MITI Vice Minister for International Affairs Sozaburo Okamatsu rejected a U.S. suggestion that imports into Japan should be measured against the level of imports in other G-7 countries. Using a familiar Japanese argument, Okamatsu asserted that Japan could not be measured against other G-7 countries because the foundations of its economy were different, requiring the country to "import natural resources and export manufactured goods," in contrast to other G-7 countries that have greater natural resources. He also insisted that the talks should address steps the United States should take to improve its competitiveness as much as measures Japan should take to increase imports. "Mutual efforts should be the starting point of the framework talks," he said, adding that Washington seemed to be "concerned only with pressing Japan rather than concentrating on the lack of effort by U.S. industry." -- The 11 January Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted an unidentified MITI official as stating, in connection with the framework talks, that "criteria that can lead to agreeing on targets cannot be accepted." -- An 11 January Kyodo report quoted MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai as rejecting any effort to set guidelines for imports in various sectors, saying that Japan "cannot practice managed trade or allow administrative guidance alone to reduce the surplus with the United States by using double standards at home and abroad." Kumagai reportedly argued that to do so would run counter to the Hosokawa government's efforts to "create transparency" in Japanese markets. -- According to the 28 November Nihon Keizai Shimbun, as far back as the fall of 1993, MITI and MOF became concerned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) might be too inclined to make concessions to the United States. According to the paper, MITI and MOF therefore agreed to coordinate their positions in the talks, to staunchly reject any U.S. demands to set objective criteria to measure Japan's trade performance, and to resist any pressure to present compromise proposals to the Prime Minister unless the United States dropped its demands. A major concern of those advocating a tough stand against the United States, particularly on the issue of objective criteria, appears to be that the United States might invoke sanctions against Japan if the criteria are not met. In his interview with the 27 December-3 January Nikkei Weekly, MITI Vice Minister Okamatsu voiced this concern by commenting that "it remains unclear whether Washington would use unilateral sanctions against Japan" if Japan failed to meet any of the objective criteria Washington is calling for. At the same time, however, Japanese press reporting has suggested that there are some elements of the Japanese bureaucracy--mainly within MOFA--that maintain Japan should be more flexible and make some concessions to the United States. In late December, in the wake of reports in the Japanese press that Washington might be softening its position, various MOFA officials began to signal in comments to the press that they believed Japan's large trade surplus placed Tokyo in a weak position in the negotiations, and would eventually force the country to compromise with the United States. -- According to the 25 December Nihon Keizai Shimbun, an unidentified senior MOFA official told the paper on 24 December that "fundamentally, the United States will be making demands on Japan at the Japanese-U.S. framework talks because Japan has a huge trade surplus with the United States." The official reportedly added that, for the negotiations to succeed, Japan would therefore have to "make further compromises." -- Similarly, the 27 December Asahi Shimbun, in a report sourced to an unnamed senior MOFA official, stated that although Tokyo plans to continue to reject numerical targets for specific trade sectors, it "understands that it is necessary on the macroeconomic level to show some degree of a positive stance toward U.S. demands for expansion of Japan's domestic demand and reduction of its trade surplus." -- The 4 January Nihon Keizai Shimbun also reported conciliatory statements by an unidentified senior MOFA official, quoting him as saying that Japan would be "required to make more concessions" in the talks than the United States because of its trade surplus. Another official possibly advocating a more conciliatory approach is Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama. The 12 January Asahi Shimbun quoted him as telling U.S. Under Secretary of State Joan Spero that he believed "it is possible for Japan and the United States to hold talks to work out something that is acceptable to both sides." None of these reports indicated what compromises the officials quoted have in mind. Divisions over Assessment of U.S. Position The bureaucracy also appears to be divided in its assessment of the U.S. position in the talks. Some sections of the Japanese bureaucracy appear to have interpreted remarks reportedly made by President Clinton at the APEC Summit and by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in a 20 December letter to Nihon Keizai Shimbun as indicating that the United States has softened its stance on the issue of setting objective criteria for measuring Japan's trade performance. For example, the 19 December Mainichi Shimbun quoted an unidentified Japanese source close to the framework negotiations as stating that President Clinton indicated during talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Seattle in November that the U.S. would back off the concept of numerical targets. The paper also cited the same source as saying that an unidentified senior U.S. embassy official had also told the Japanese Government that Washington would abandon numerical targets in favor of some other type of objective criteria to measure Japanese trade performance. The 20 December Nihon Keizai Shimbun, possibly reflecting thinking of the paper's sources in the bureaucracy, described the wording of Ambassador Kantor's letter as "slightly toned down" on the issue of objective criteria and noted that Kantor did not discuss the issue of setting a target for reducing Japan's trade surplus. At the same time, however, other sections of the bureaucracy have voiced skepticism that the United States has backed off from its demands for the setting of numerical targets. According to the 22 December Asahi Shimbun, an unidentified senior MOFA official described reported U.S. statements that Washington was not seeking numerical targets as a "feint." The official reportedly added that "the substance of U.S. policy--attaching more importance to trade results than to the market opening processes, and pressing Japan to raise the share of foreign goods on the Japanese market to levels comparable with other G-7 countries- -remains unchanged." Similarly, the 23 December Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted an unnamed MOFA source as stating that reported U.S. calls for Japan to increase the Japanese market share of imports to levels similar to the share of imports in other G-7 countries was "as bad as setting numerical targets." The 29 December Yomiuri Shimbun reported that some MITI officials were also concerned that the objective criteria demanded by the United States "could actually turn out to be new targets." According to the 12 January Nihon Keizai Shimbun, unidentified sources in MITI responded to a U.S. Government report on the U.S. position in the talks, "In Search of a New Partnership," by commenting that "a careful reading" of the report showed that Washington remained "preoccupied with numerical targets." At present, both schools of thinking about the current U.S. strategy appear to be agreed on one point--that the best way to deal with the United States is to continue to take a hard line. Bureaucrats who apparently think that the United States has backed off from its demands on objective criteria appear to believe that the United States may eventually make even further concessions in order to conclude the talks. A 20 December Kyodo report quoted an unidentified Japanese Government source as stating that Washington's reported decision to back off numerical targets would provide a "solution" to the framework negotiations. Similarly, bureaucrats who believe that the United States has not changed its position appear to be arguing that Japan should redouble its efforts in the face of what they expect will be increased pressure from Washington. The 4 January Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted an unnamed top MITI official as stating that Tokyo would "reject" any criteria that resembled numerical targets, regardless of how they were described or packaged. The official commented that it was "unclear" whether there is any difference between what the United States means by such terms as "standards" and "indicators" on the one hand and "targets" on the other. U.S. Position on Hosokawa A third area of disagreement appears to be in the Japanese Government's assessment of the U.S. stance toward the ruling coalition government. Some officials appear to believe that Washington will eventually compromise because it does not want to jeopardize the coalition by pushing Prime Minister Hosokawa into a corner. For example, the 23 December Asahi Shimbun reported that the United States might be softening its position on objective criteria because of its concerns for the Prime Minister's "difficult" position. Similarly, the 23 December Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that U.S. Ambassador Walter Mondale had strongly advocated that the United States take a more conciliatory approach to Japan in order to avoid exacerbating Hosokawa's problems. Other officials, however, appear to believe that Washington may be prepared to get tough with Hosokawa at the February summit. The 7 January Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted unidentified "close aides" to the prime minister as stating that they were concerned that Washington's patience might be running out and that President Clinton might be "asking for results" at the February summit. Such views appear also to have some currency in MOFA, where some officials apparently advocate a more conciliatory approach to the framework talks. According to the 31 December Tokyo Shimbun, at the end of December, MOFA issued a position paper on Japan's foreign policy in which it warned that the off- year election in the United States in November would force President Clinton to seek progress in talks with Japan which he could present to U.S. voters. The paper concluded that Prime Minister Hosokawa would therefore probably face pressure to take "concrete steps" to reduce the trade imbalance. Confusion in the Bureaucracy Infighting within the bureaucracy may also be contributing to the lack of movement in Japan's framework strategy. The 1 January Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that progress on the talks may have been disrupted by an internal power struggle in MITI that led to the resignation of the Director General of the Industrial Policy Bureau, Masahisa Naito. The paper stated that MITI was obliged to cancel meetings between Naito and U.S. negotiators aimed at resolving some of the issues under dispute in the talks after Naito was charged with abusing his office. Outlook Tokyo will probably continue to take a hard-line stance in upcoming sessions of the framework negotiations in the absence of any internal political pressure to take a more flexible approach to the negotiations. Prime Minister Hosokawa and other key political leaders are currently preoccupied with getting the coalition government's political reform package through the upper house of the Diet and with putting together a package of measures to stimulate the floundering Japanese economy. Until these issues are resolved, few of the key leaders are likely to devote much attention to the framework talks. Once the political reform bill and the economic stimulus package are out of the way, however, the coalition is likely to face some political pressure to break the impasse in the framework talks. If the political reform bills pass and the government draws up and passes a stimulus package, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party may turn to criticism of the coalition's handling of Japan-U.S. relations and the framework talks in an effort to discredit the government. To prevent this, and also to avoid souring the atmosphere at the February summit, Prime Minister Hosokawa and other political leaders may put pressure on the bureaucracy to reach face-saving compromises with the United States on key issues in the talks.
