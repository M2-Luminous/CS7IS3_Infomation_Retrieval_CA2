In view of the discussions made by the cabinet members and Majles representatives, the Second 5-Year Plan might not start from the next Iranian calendar year and might be postponed to 1374 (1995- 1996). An official announcement has not yet been released in this regard. Thus the year 1373 will be of momentum, making the sound and meticulous survey of the budget and adoption of favorable policies decisive for the country. The country's overall budget in 1373 will amount to Rls. [rials] 79686.7 billion, showing marked increase as compared to the previous year. Revenues stand out prominently in next year's budget: Of the entire revenues of next year's budget--that is Rls. 33,592 billion, some Rls. 22,026 billion (amounting to 65 percent) are earned through oil incomes. Apparently, this is largely wishful thinking in view of the slope in the oil prices over the past year and the possibility of continued oil price drops. By far, if the year 1373 opens up with such a speculation, the country's economy will face manifold bottle-necks. To put it better, the officials in charge of the country's economy and industry try to boost the oil prices in the global markets. Meanwhile, these officials should have a sound and realistic estimation of the oil prices so as to prepare themselves for hard times, to pocket more revenues through non-oil exports, and to base the next year's budget on less dependence on oil incomes. The year 1373 is a milestone since important plans such as the first phase of Martyr Rajai's Thermal Power Plant, Sarkhun's Gas Refinery, the second phase of Arak's Petrochemical Plant, the Petrochemical Plant of Imam Khomeyni's Port, and ... will come to fruition. As such, the incomes, expenditures, economic policies should be more realistic. Hopefully, the Majles representatives and the cabinet members will approve of the 1373 budget bill after thoroughly and precisely discussing and surveying it, so that next year will see the materialization of the country's economic, social, and cultural objectives.
