The representatives of the IG Metall trade union and the Gesamtmetall employers organization parted in the evening, without agreeing on a date for fresh talks. Gesamtmetall's president, Hans-Joachim Gottschol, blamed the trade union for not accepting the employers' proposals on securing jobs. The employers had suggested opening up wage agreements, which would have allowed companies to increase work time to 40 hours, or decrease it below the current 36 hours per week on a temporary basis. IG Metall had rejected longer working hours and demanded wage compensations in the event of a shorter working week, which would be counterproductive on the labor market, Gottschol said.
