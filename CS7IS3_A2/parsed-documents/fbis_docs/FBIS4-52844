FBIS4-52844 "dreas094__a94017" FBIS-EAS-94-094-A Daily Report 26 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan Transportation Policy Under Pressure To Change Transportation Policy Under Pressure To Change Construction, Funding Viewed 942A0160B Tokyo SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI in Japanese 26 Mar 94 pp 42-45--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0160B Tokyo SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI Japanese CSO [Interview with former Transportation Minister Shigeru Ito by unidentified SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI reporter: "Discussion on Major Modification Required of Aviation Administration"; place and date not given] [Text] [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] This publishing house has been extremely troubled by your statement, during a press conference after the 8 March cabinet meeting, which became a topic of controversy in the newspapers and in which which you said, in effect, "A paper was published in SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI through oversight, without a thorough check on my part." [Ito] What I wanted to say at the press conference was, "That was a paper that was written in collaboration with a friend and the lack of a thorough check on my part resulted in a failure to express myself adequately." In that respect, I would like to apologize for having troubled the editorial staff of your magazine as well as the readers. I have learned a lesson from the fact that I did not adequately review the paper as minister of transportation. Passionate Sentiments About Narita [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] What sections of the paper are you referring to when you say you "failed to express yourself adequately"? [Ito] I would like to say one thing before I discuss that aspect. It will not be long before we enter the 21st century, but the question now is whether it will be acceptable for 21st-century transportation administration to remain an extension of current policies? I have strong feelings about this. I feel that our planning actions should be more comprehensive and mobile. For example, I feel that there should be closer coordination between ministries for programs and actual construction of highway arteries like freeways that fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Construction and the construction of railways and airports which come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport. The other day, I spoke with the chairman of the German national railways, but in Germany almost all matters concerning transportation are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport, including railways, roads, and airlines. Accordingly, gasoline taxes are allocated to cover costs of roads as well as railroads. Logically, they operate under the concept that a balance will be achieved in the administration of transportation systems as a whole in utilizing the special features of each means of transportation to the optimum degree feasible. In this day of internationalization, Japanese domestic transportation networks are not complete in terms of domestic facilities alone. I believe we need to approach the issue from a much broader perspective. Japan must not limit itself to its current midterm program and devise a plan which assumes a broader perspective of this nature and rethink its strategy so as to implement government investments that are consistent with the new approach. Absent such an approach, it will be impossible to create policies for the 21st century. I feel it is desirable to establish a forum consisting of interministerial representation and industry, public organization and business world participation, to debate such issues. [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] Having established that premise, I believe the airport issue, especially the issue of Narita is of special significance... [Ito] Yes, you have delineated the most important issue. I believe it is acceptable to have a comprehensive array of opinions concerning policy relative to Narita. I have strong feelings about Narita because I was in charge of issues concerning Narita within the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. Narita Airport was approved by the Sato cabinet in 1966, making it a full 28 years in July. Considering the situation at that time, it was as if the airport had fallen upon local residents from heaven. It was a decision made with hardly any reference to the logical rules of democratic society, resulting in an unfortunate and sustained dispute and complaints from local residents that "democracy did not exist in our locality." Even I participated in several opposition demonstrations and rallies and joined in scrambles with local residents. Whenever I reminisce about Narita, I feel I am looking back at the first half of my lifetime. During sessions of the Diet's Standing Committee on Transportation, I was sharply questioned by members of the Liberal Democratic Party with the words, "We recall you participated in the movement to oppose Narita. What do you think of Narita now, as minister of transportation?" My reply in those instances would be, "It was wrong to approach the construction of the airport from an authoritarian posture. That being the case, the opposition movement was a logical phenomenon. I feel that my personal behavior at that time was correct in principle. However, I do not believe that I was 100 percent correct. I believe politicians should examine their pasts on a mutual and frank basis and assume a posture as to how they will cope with the future." [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] I understand a settlement is in progress with the opposing alliance. [Ito] Because of the efforts exerted by Mr. Mikio Sumida of the investigation team, symposia open to the public were held for about 18 months which were attended by former Transportation Ministers Okuda and Ochi who expressed frank words of regret. After my appointment as minister, roundtable discussions were initiated and I attended the first session. I conceptualized the establishment of an "airport for coexistence" with local residents and hope to exert sincere efforts in this area. Need for Hub Airport [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] In the minister's treatise published in the 12 March edition of this magazine, you advocate the construction of an international hub airport which can serve as the center for international flow of people, things, and information. Can you explain the relationship between that concept and Narita? [Ito] At the present time, Narita has only one runway. Even the Kansai International Airport which is to open in September has only one runway, which means that the complete conceptual development of the Kansai airport becomes a matter of the future. The Chubu International Airport will require further development in that it too has only one runway. Moreover, take-off and landing fees are the highest in the world. Japan is surrounded by Seoul, Singapore, Bangkok, Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong, which have plans to build airports with two to six 4,000-meter runways, scheduled for opening within several years. I believe there are two schools of thought on this issue. One assumes the stance that we cannot afford to lose out to competition from our neighboring nations. And the other assumes the stance that Japan does not have the land, land prices are high, and it is acceptable that Japan will not possess an Asian hub airport. However, I believe both postures reflect extremism and it is my belief that, disregarding any perception relative to status, there is a compelling reason for Japan to have an international airport that is compatible with its economic strength and its relationship with the rest of the world. I believe we should give serious consideration to an international airport based on the two premises covering coordination with neighboring nations and Japan's geographical configuration forming an extended archipelago from north to south. [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] I understand your goals. However, it is difficult for us to visualize a future design for Narita. [Ito] Airports are not built only because there is a need for international hub airports. The aspect of coexistence with the local community is very important in the building of an airport. Relative to Narita, I hope to hold symposia and roundtable discussions for thorough exchanges of views and strive assiduously to build an airport that can coexist with the local community. The approach of attempting to resolve issues through dialogue on the Narita issue is extremely significant in today's situation. I hope to cherish this trend and continue my efforts aiming at early resolution of outstanding issues. I feel sincere remorse in the sudden publication of the paper and the distrust inspired in the local community and among others concerned with Narita. Further, speaking of the future, a supersonic aircraft capable of linking Japan and the United States in five to six hours is being developed for production sometime in the early 21st century. Airports visualized for that aircraft when it goes into production include one each on the east and west coasts of the United States, one each in northeastern Asia and Australia, and one or two in Europe. There is a need to formulate policies with a view towards the age of the supersonic aircraft. [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] Is the Ministry of Transport conducting research on that? [Ito] No. We cannot say that an official study is being conducted. As a general statement, the business world and others can present the issue of a "superior international hub airport for Japan," but any such proposal from my perspective must be preceded by additional research. Narita's Position [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] We too feel that a sense of crisis calling for a Japanese international hub airport lest we be abandoned by the rest of the world is logical. One premise of a hub airport is that it must be a joint airport serving both international and domestic routes. However, it appears that the Ministry of Transport's plans for the second-stage project at Narita do not consider the idea of a joint airport. [Ito] This is an item that requires future study. Full-scale international airports currently in existence are Narita and Kansai Airports. [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] That being the case, can we interpret your statement to mean that if Narita can be expanded, that domestic services will be increased and that it can become a hub-type airport? [Ito] Construction at Narita Airport is being implemented with the primary idea of making it responsive to international airline requirements. We still haven't come to a decision on what we will do about domestic routes at Narita. As stated in the beginning of this discussion, we are currently engaged in an all-out effort to bring an end to 28 years of confrontation and dispute and to overcome those barriers. When Narita is completed, the Kansai Airport opens and the Chubu International Airport is finished, we need to conduct a comprehensive study about how we will make use of each airport's special features and capabilities. New Ideas About Airport Funding Whether we speak of building a new airport or expanding an existing airport to establish hub-type capabilities, funding becomes an important issue. Needless to say, there are methods such as funding from the general account budget or investing fiscal investment and loan program funds, but there is the argument that using such methods only for aviation would be unfair to competing projects such as those for railways. However, the high take-off and landing fees at Japanese airports and the high airport user fees that are charged to individuals have become major international issues. What are your thoughts on the use of government funds? [Ito] I believe we must exert new efforts in this area. As an example, the idea that "rigidity in the distribution of public works investment funding must be modified" is an item agreed upon among the coalition parties and the Fiscal System Council is in the process of trying to assign priority to existing projects. In the postwar period, many midterm programs were developed and implemented and some of them underwent more than 10 stages. I believe we have reached a point where such repetitive programs should be subject to reexamination. Those programs must be reexamined on the basis of the question of what policy goals are to be sought in a comprehensive outlook for the 21st century. As an example, we speak of a welfare-type society, but we are not speaking of limited welfare programs. We are speaking of ensuring that roads and urban areas are designed so that they accommodate a wide array of welfare needs. Both the nature and content of public works projects must be designed to meet welfare needs. Further, in the past we have been prone to place excess emphasis on hardware, but I believe we need to invest in software as well. We hear the slogan, "My Town Tokyo," but there is a need to consider the cultural and international environment. [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] Would it be correct for me to interpret your statements as saying that we should consider the use of government funds once we arrive at a consensus on the requirement for building airports, including hub airports, as we approach the 21st century? [Ito] In the 50 or so years of the postwar period, separate actions were taken in building roads, airports, railways, and harbors. Roads were built with special funding derived from gasoline and automobile weight taxes and the five-year program incorporates the vast sum of 76 trillion yen. On the other hand, central government and local government subsidies are provided for railways, subways, and the new trunk railways, but the approach is that their construction is handled autonomously, while the national railways have been privatized under the national railway reform program and are now referred to as JR [Japan Railways]. Some airport construction is government-funded, but the bulk of the money comes from usage fees. Earlier I spoke of the German approach. I think we should consider their approach and the preceding discussion and decide on the government-investment approach. [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] The high take-off and landing fees have been criticized both internationally and by the general public and require early resolution. [Ito] They are certainly a major problem in terms of take-off and landing fees for international airports and are the subject of negotiations handled by the IATA (International Air Transport Association). However, this too is a structural issue. On the other hand, if fiscal investment and loan program funds or general account budget funds are used for the construction of domestic airports, we should be able to lower take-off and landing fees and opinions exist that say that that should lead to lower fares. These issues are being energetically examined by the Aviation Council in terms of construction funding and take-off and landing fees with a target date of June of this year. I believe we should wait for the results of that study.
