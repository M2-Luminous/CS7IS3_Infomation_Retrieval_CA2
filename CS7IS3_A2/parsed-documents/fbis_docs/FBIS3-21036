New techniques for parallel computers should now make possible extensive optimizations in the planning and production processes. Moreover, the Aachen firm Parsytec Computer, Ltd., (Juelicher Strasse 338, 52070 Aachen) has formed the Pamips (Parallel Mixed Integer Programming Systems) consortium. It has been reported that, together with BASF [Baden Anilin and Soda Factory], Inc., Ludwigshafen, Gesa, Palma de Mallorca, and Dash, Coventry, as well as the Universities of Buckingham, Heidelberg, and Leuven, these techniques are to be used industrially. The developers expect to have the initial results as soon as the beginning of 1994. In industries with high production volumes that are distributed among many individual products, efficiency depends on the cost structure. A reduction in production costs can, for example, be achieved through better use of raw materials as well as better use of the means of production through minimization of machines' service life. Another important factor in optimizing production is firms' global organization with production sites distributed worldwide. With them costs can be reduced through deciding on a day-to-day basis where a given product is to be produced on the most favorable terms. The prerequisite for this, however, is consideration of the various costs for wages, raw materials, energy, and shipping, as well as currency exchange rates. These formulations are similar to those involved in long-range planning for major investments in, for example, the energy supply sector or commercial airlines. Costs can be cut this way inasmuch as sound prognoses of needs, new products with lengthy development periods, and the scheduling of fewer expensive resources could be submitted. But up to now this too has failed to materialize due to a lack of software and computer power. In this area computer-supported production optimizations and process simulations can only solve small parts of the problem because of their traditional computer architecture. What is required for this are discrete optimization techniques that go far beyond the range of the classical "linear programming approach" that stems from operation research. Discrete, integral, binary, and semicontinuous variables have to be included too in order to portray a discrete selection or binary decisions in a model way. This is why for over five years algorithms have been developed that make use of massive parallelism. The goal of the Pamips consortium that has now been formed is to for the first time solve major optimizaiton problems of relevance to industry with the aid of massive parallelism. Thefirms BASA and Gesa bring into the project different ways of looking at unsolved problems and the know-how to create models from the fields of chemistry and energy supply. With its Xpress-MP product, Dash is one of the leading companies in the optimization software market and provides the basis for implementing the management of problems. New algorithms and approahes to implementation have been developed at the Universities of Buckingham, Heidelberg, and Leuven. The Aachen firm Parsytec is assembling the hardware and software with the North Rhine-Westphalia Center for Industrial Applications of Massive Parallelism (ZIAM) and has taken over the marketing, especially in Germany. The Pamips optimization method is soon to be incorporated into the ESPRIT [European Strategic Program for Information Technologies] project and provided with aid. The parallelized version of the Xpress-MP should be available to users for a test phase for the first time at the start of 1994 for Parsytec GC and XPlorer Computing.
