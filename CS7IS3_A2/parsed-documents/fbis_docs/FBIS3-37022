If there is no other way, measures should be taken. Not only one or several states, but the entire world community should decide on this, he told journalists in Kiev Thursday. The president believes the coincidence of positions of Ukraine and Russia on the issue is incidental. "I am sure that our positions will continue to coincide," he said. Answering questions about the internal political situation in Ukraine, including on the republic's federalization, Kravchuk said that he favored broad economic freedom to all regions of Ukraine. However, he said: "I believe the question is premature from a political point of view." At the same time the president admits that the idea could be expedient in the future. Asked what political structure for Ukraine - presidential or parliamentary - would seem preferable for him, Kravchuk said: "I prefer the political structure of France, where, he said, a strong parliament co-exists with the president who has large powers. Foreign Minister Zlenko told reporters in Madrid that the NATO decision on air strikes if Bosnian Serbs refuse to lay down arms may aggravate the situation around Sarajevo and will put under threat the lives of Ukrainian servicemen who are part of the UN peacekeeping contingent in the zone. Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy told journalists in Kiev Thursday that in case of air raids, the Ukrainian battalion will be withdrawn to a safer place. He also said that Ukraine does not intend to give up its preliminary understanding with the United Nations on tripling its military presence within the framework of the UN peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia. Late last year the Ukrainian parliament decided to increase the Ukrainian battalion in Sarajevo from 400 to 1,220 servicemen.
