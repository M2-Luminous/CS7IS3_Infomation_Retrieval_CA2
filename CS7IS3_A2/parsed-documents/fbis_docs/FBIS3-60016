Why do people believe [Army Commander] General Lino Oviedo has so much power in the country. Is it just their imagination or does he really have so much power? I am asking you this question in your capacity as commander of the Armed Forces. Wasmosy: I would say that he is a very active person. Within the Armed Forces he is probably the most concerned about his subordinates. This attitude is probably interpreted by some as if he were the most powerful person within the Armed Forces. However, looking you straight in your eyes I can tell you I have never had any problems with Lino Oviedo. I, personally, here in my office, filled in the posts of the Armed Forces organization chart. First I worked on it with [Military Forces Commander Vice Admiral Eduardo] Gonzalez Petit, then with the Army, Navy, and Air Force Commanders and the chief of the joint staff. The logistics commander was also present on some occasions as was [Division General Pedro de la Cruz] Ocampos, the chief of staff. They can confirm that the appointments were made directly by me. I would like to refer to those remarks that so-and-so was appointed because it will help Oviedo or that so-and-so is against so-and-so, and that sort of comment. I can show you the service record, the military law, and the seniority list, and you will see that I have respected the officers' seniority and their merits. So much so that the commanders of the engineering, transmission units are the best there are. Nobody can accuse me of having discriminated against anybody who was the top of his class. By no means. Why do you think they respect my decisions? Injustices surface sooner or later. Ruffinelli: What many people question is the possible political actions of Gen. Lino Oviedo. Wasmosy: Do you consider it to be political action when he helps each and everyone in his home town by building a school, giving social assistance, and so on? I regard it as absolutely normal. Now, if he stood up and said he wants to be president of a Colorado Party precinct or that so-and-so must be appointed, etc., yes, that is engaging in politics. I would really like all my aides to help me. I am being frank and must say that many commanders--within their jurisdiction--do so. Not long ago we dedicated social projects with General Barreto, the Curuguaty commander. When these ceremonies occur in rather distant regions and there is no transportation, the media just do not turn up. Ruffinelli: When there is no means of transportation? Wasmosy: This is probably why these ceremonies are not covered sufficiently. But they are all doing their best to increase the level, to humanize the Army. Soldiers and sergeants currently live like human beings. These activities are criticized because it is always...[changes thought]... well this is the price of being the Army commander, this is the price I have to pay for being president of the Republic. As a means of consolation, and to give myself a bit more courage, when I receive criticisms which I accept happily--well, not happily but which I tolerate... Ruffinelli: Let us talk about that later... Wasmosy: ...which I tolerate, because we must be frank, I tell myself they are directed against the president of the Republic. Juan Carlos Wasmosy is president of the Republic, but only temporarily. Every criticism is directed against the leader, against the authority. That is only normal. It happens within the Army, religious congregations, among bishops and cardinals, right? For example, you women sometimes complain about your husbands, because they are the boss at home. Ruffinelli: Of course. Well, we will see who is the boss. Wasmosy: Well, in some cases the husband is the boss. Ruffinelli: Engineer, sometimes Gen. Oviedo's actions--which may be done in good faith--are questioned. There is a very narrow margin between proselytism, campaigning, and engaging in politics. As you well know, this is banned by the Constitution. Right from the beginning of this interview you have said that your main concern, your main goal is to respect the Constitution. Is there any chance, if he were to engage in politics, that .... Wasmosy: If Gen. Oviedo were to engage in politics, let us say seeking to obtain a post within a party precinct, that is one thing. Ruffinelli: I don't think he will go that far. Wasmosy: That situation would justify your criticisms, but if he is only helping the government--to which the Armed Forces belong--implementing social projects because you should recall that the Army... Ruffinelli: Do you believe he is acting in good faith? Wasmosy: I believe he is acting in good faith. What is more, I have no complaints against him. I believe that to have the Army cooperating as it is now, guarantees this democratic process. Ruffinelli: Why? Wasmosy: Because the Army will not tolerate anything that violates the Constitution. People believe that we will only live in democracy through the downfall of the Colorado Party. We are proving that the Colorado Party brought democracy back to the country and that it is consolidating this democratic process. People also say that free elections and democracy are not possible until Lino Oviedo is not discharged or retired. [sentence as received] That is not true, young lady. Quite the opposite. Let us look at things positively. I believe the Colorado Party and an institutionalized, well organized, rationalized Armed Forces are the best guarantee to consolidate our democracy. This is not a story, I am absolutely convinced of what I am saying. Ruffinelli: Engineer. Changing the subject and referring to another subject that has surfaced... Wasmosy: I don't know whether I am passing your test. Ruffinelli: I am not testing you. We want to share this moment with the SNT listeners throughout the country during the last few days of this year. I want to raise another important topic which has been a matter of concern lately: drug trafficking and money laundering and the U.S. Government's concern reflected in a press communique written and signed by [U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay] Jon Glassman. What do you have to say about this? Wasmosy: There are three aspects to this problem. There are countries that consume drugs, produce drugs, and others that act as routes for drug trafficking. Let us hope our country is not used as a route between producer and consumer countries. Ruffinelli: This is what we are being accused of. Wasmosy: It would be regrettable if our youth became hooked on this really lamentable vice. I have repeatedly and publicly stated that I am in favor of a total struggle against drug trafficking, money laundering, and I am against those who kill to steal, who traffic in stolen vehicles, etc. I believe Ambassador Glassman made a rather hasty comment when he stated that honest people have been replaced by dishonest people, yet failed to say who the dishonest people are. One cannot make groundless charges. I respect him in his capacity as ambassador but, as long I am president of the Republic, I will not allow him to interfere in the domestic affairs of this country. Paraguay is a small but sovereign country. There is a lot of talk about obscure situations, that so-and-so is involved. If people provide me with evidence I will dismiss the guilty parties. I have already removed several people involved in the contraband of cigarettes, chickens, and onions brought from Brazil or Argentina, but one cannot make groundless charges and suspect everyone. Do people not trust me? I have proven I am trustworthy. I want to tell the listeners that I summoned Ambassador Glassman to Government House together with [Alternate Senator Eustacio] Morel Garay and General Escobar Anzoategui [National Antinarcotics Secretariat, Senad, executive secretary] and told him that if he wanted to know anything about the Senad he should ask General Escobar and not Morel Garay or anybody else because there is a chain of command that must be respected. We cannot tolerate intervention at the various levels. Either you have trust or you do not. I cannot decide if a person is involved in drug trafficking or money laundering if I do not have evidence. If you tell me who is guilty of these crimes and bring the evidence against the person then it is my responsibility to follow it up, but in the meantime I cannot prejudge. Ruffinelli: Engineer, please allow me to mention some figures that are of concern to the U.S. Embassy which, as you known, is a landmark in international affairs. They say that during the past years we have only managed to seize a few kilos of cocaine, I think it was 48 kg or a similarly small figure: meanwhile neighboring countries talk about tonnes. More than 30 Paraguayan citizens charged with drug trafficking or consumption have been arrested abroad, but this has not happened here. This is out of proportion. Wasmosy: There are two alternatives. Either drug trafficking has dropped here or the entire government is involved in this trade. Therefore, to uncover the government officials involved in this trade I need the necessary means. I have asked them to install radar units in Mariscal Estigarribia, Ciudad del Este, Concepcion, and Ayolas and to provide two helicopter-gunships operated by U.S. Marines. What better proof is there than that to show I want to fight this scourge openly? Ruffinelli: However, they maintain that when you list the aid received you do not mention the DEA agents who use the infrastructure exclusively designed to fight drug trafficking. Wasmosy: That is right but the U.S. Embassy has also included in the global aid granted us the cost of bringing an aircraft with radar [AWACS] to our country. I am grateful to them for this aircraft but the decision to send it here was theirs. They cannot charge the cost of sending an aircraft equipped with radar to the aid granted to Paraguay. They are trying to determine the origin of this nefarious merchandise which is consumed in their country. They cannot charge this cost to the aid granted to us. That is a U.S. expenditure or investment, not a Paraguayan expenditure. No. If they were to really grant us support and we did not fight drug trafficking, then we would be guilty. But with what budget can I fight these people who are much better equipped with more sophisticated weapons than what our Army has. They have money to buy the most sophisticated weapons. We have discussed this subject with the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay. This must be a joint effort with the aid of the United States, which is the greatest drug consumer. The United States must help us. What can we do alone or in an isolated manner? Ruffinelli: Engineer Wasmosy, do you know how this is being interpreted? Jon Glassman, to some extent, has warned that the funds obtained from money laundering and drug trafficking may become a very strong political power that is very hard to eradicate. Wasmosy: I fully agree with him. Ruffinelli: What worries him is the impunity that may currently prevail in Paraguay and that is generating a system of privileges that may even undermine the democracy we are currently enjoying. Wasmosy: This risk not only exists in Paraguay, it exists in any South American country. Ruffinelli: We are no exception. Wasmosy: We are no exception. Do you think it was easy to catch [Colombian drug trafficker Pablo] Escobar, or do you think he was a sort of superman that flew from one place to another? How do you think he got out of prison? There is the answer to your question. [passages omitted]
