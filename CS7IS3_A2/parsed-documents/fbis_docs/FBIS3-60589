The threat of aggressive nationalism has replaced that of totalitarianism. This was stated today by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, speaking at the fourth session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the CSCE which is taking place in Rome. The fact that manifestations of aggressive nationalism are gripping not only eastern but also central and western Europe demands much more decisive and urgent reactions, the minister emphasized. He considers that what is needed above all is "unambiguous moral condemnation of these manifestations." The Russian side has therefore proposed the adoption of a document in which the CSCE participant states would declare that intolerance and xenophobia are incompatible with a civilized Europe standing on the threshold of the 21st century. In A. Kozyrev's opinion it is important that the Rome forum should adopt measures to support and strengthen the institution of the CSCE's Supreme Commissar for National Minority Affairs. "There should be a guaranteeing of the effectiveness of humanitarian law in armed conflicts engendered by aggressive nationalism," he declared. Andrey Kozyrev believes the CSCE has another important task; namely, to reinforce its peacekeeping potential in order to settle conflicts where agressive nationalism has led to bloodshed. He pointed to the special role of CSCE observers, who are "working heroically in South Ossetia, the Dniester region, and Abkhazia, acting hand in hand with the Russian Federation peacekeeping forces." In this connection A. Kozyrev called upon the CSCE to support Russia's peacekeeping efforts and to reexamine the issue of CSCE observers returning to "hot spots" in the territory of former Yugoslavia. The minister thinks it would be correct for the CSCE to make the authorities in Belgrade aware that constructive steps on their part would open up prospects for the FRY to rejoin the CSCE. The minister believes that the CSCE should take upon itself the political coordination of peacekeeping efforts, within the framework of such organizations as NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], CIS, NATO, and the Western European Union. A. Kozyrev described as a fresh and unprecedented challenge to European security the fact that "for the first time since the signing of the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1968, we are seeing under way in Europe not a strengthening of the nonproliferation regime and new states joining it, but essentially the reverse." "One of the CSCE member states," the minister pointed out, "has, contrary to the obligations it assumed, officially announced that it possesses nuclear weapons. Furthermore, we are speaking here of an awesome nuclear potential exceeding that of some powers possessing nuclear weapons." The Russian Federation minister believes that this creates a completely new situation in terms of security on the continent of Europe. A. Kozyrev called upon the CSCE to make a determined declaration of the inviolability of the Nonproliferation Treaty.
