To put it mildly, the top statesmen in Bucharest are protecting them and say nothing when they reveal their appetites for "the ancient Romanian lands." The "Great Romania" Organization has itself admitted in a letter that it is acting under the authorities' wing. Again, Prime Minister Vacaroiu is reported to have told the parliament speaker not to provide any information about the "Romanian Guard." The nationalism game in the Balkans has reaped enough victims this century. It is time for the people in Bucharest to remember that we are living in a powder keg, so they should refrain from making territorial claims. Alternatively, they should proclaim their claims openly, instead of hiding behind real or fictitious organizations.
