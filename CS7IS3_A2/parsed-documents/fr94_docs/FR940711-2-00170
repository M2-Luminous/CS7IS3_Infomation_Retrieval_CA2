FR940711-2-00170 FR940711-2-00072 Wavelength range: 280&hyph;400 nm. Dynamic range: Spectral irradiance measurements are to be made over a maximum solar signal of 1.0 W/m 2 nm at 400 nm decreasing to less than 10 ^6 W/m 2 nm at 290 nm. Accuracy and precision: Instruments must maintain their calibration in the field without shelter up to 40 ○ Celsius for a month time period. Wavelength: a. Resolution of wavelength setting (smallest setable difference): # 0.02 nm; b. Repeatability: # 0.02 nm; c. Accuracy: # 0.02 nm; d. Bandpass: <=0.3 nm; e. Straylight: < 10 ^8 at greater than +5 bandwidths from center wavelength. Intensity: a. Resolution: is to be 0.001 of full scale from all decade ranges from 1 to 1×10 ^5 W/m 2 nm and 2×10 ^8 W/m 2 nm for ranges less than or equal to 1×10 ^6 . b. Repeatability: must be within 0.2% of the decade range value. c. Accuracy: instrument shall hold a calibration to an accuracy of # 1% of signal level between 1.0 W/m 2 nm and 10 ^6 W/m2 nm. Finally, instrument calibration and characterization with regard to the criteria specified herein, and standardization among the several instruments, is considered critical. The research plan should give consideration to data collection, storage, retrieval, processing, and statistical analysis. It is expected that these data will be handled in a manner appropriate for use by the U.S. and international scientific communities; for support of atmospheric science research; model development and validation; and documentation of UV&hyph;B climatology. In accordance with Section 2(b)(7) of the Act of August 4, 1965, as amended (7 U.S.C. 450i(b)), funds will not be awarded for the planning, repair, rehabilitation or acquisition, or construction of a building or facility or purchase or installation of fixed equipment. Proposals are invited from investigator(s) at a single or multiple institutions with the proper competence and facilities to accomplish the objectives. Investigators are encouraged to contact the Program Director at 202&hyph;401&hyph;4871 prior to developing a proposal for this program. When to Submit To be considered for funding during fiscal year 1994, proposals submitted in response to this announcement must be postmarked by August 15, 1994. It is preferable that proposals be submitted via Express Mail or overnight courier to assure their prompt receipt. The bill of lading for such submissions must be dated no later than the above postmark date. Where to Obtain Additional Materials The solicitation, which contains Research Program descriptions and detailed instructions on how to apply, may be obtained by contacting the office indicated below. Please note that Part 1 of the Program Description is necessary for preparing a proposal. If you do not already have Part 1, please request that document as well.
