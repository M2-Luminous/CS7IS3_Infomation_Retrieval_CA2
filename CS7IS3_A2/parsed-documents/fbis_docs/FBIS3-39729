Do you have the names? [Occhetto] I have said this many times and I will repeat it: Berlusconism is the product of Craxism. Anyone writing about the history of Italy would link these two phenomena. On the other hand, just two or three years ago even a child would have answered Berlusconi if asked which businessman was linked to Craxi. Now it seems to be blasphemy but we know how important historical memories are. [Roscani] You have said that the word of a malefactor has become the yardstick of justice. This means that the PDS intends changing all legislation that favors those who confess, because this is what has happened to date in Italy. [Occhetto] You have distorted my statement in saying this: I spoke about the word of a malefactor becoming a yardstick of false justice. [D'Alema] And then we are not aware of the fact the Craxi is a confessor, if anything, he is a recidivist. If we want to talk seriously about emergency legislation, however, let us do so, but it has nothing to do with all this. [Roscani] Honorable Occhetto, in these days there has also been the [PDS official] Morandina case and the judicial notices of investigation to the DC [Christian Democratic party] heads in the Veneto region. What is your opinion about this? [Occhetto] I learned about the Morandina case from the press. He made statements saying that these accounts belonged to him. This situation does not convince me and I hope that the judicial authorities will help us understand what has happened. We would be extremely severe with anyone who may have abused the name of the PDS for its own illicit activities. [Roscani] This morning the front page of all the newspapers read: D'Alema under investigation. Do you mean that all the press misunderstood? [Occhetto] The current state of the situation is this: Craxi accused Occhetto, D'Alema, Stefanini, and others. D'Alema went to lodge a counteraccusation. As a result D'Alema was reported as being under investigation. I said that it could be a case, which would then hold true for everybody, of the automatic application of Article 835 of the Code on Proceedings which has a purely technical significance and not the political and judicial significance attributed in some newspaper headlines. Accused by Craxi: This is our situation today. [D'Alema] Neither you nor I can know if a name is included in the register of those under investigation. Nobody can know, nor must they know. A person is under investigation if he receives a judicial notice to that effect. I have received none. [Roscani] The newspapers have been going on with these rumors for two years now. [D'Alema] I am not able to confirm or deny this for the simple reason that I do not know. None of us can know. [Occhetto] If the public prosecutor's office does its work properly your case and our case are identical: that of people who do not know. Because if we were to know, this would mean that one aspect of that institution has been violated. In fact, that one aspect is secrecy. [Roscani] Do you think that Craxi's move is a means of supporting Berlusconi's electoral campaign? [D'Alema] Occhetto has been very clear. Objectively it is, even though this does not mean that there was an agreement or a plot.
