The Vatican spokesman considered what has been achieved during the bilateral meetings between the organization and the Vatican as an important starting point that constitutes an initial step toward officially promoting the relations. The organization's delegation, led by brother Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, member of the PLO Executive Committee, Nimr Hammad, Ibrahim al-Daqqaq, and Zuhdi al-Tarazi, had held talks over two days at the Vatican with a high-ranking Vatican delegation led by the Vatican's foreign minister [title as received], Jean-Louis Tauran, and with the participation of the deputy [foreign] minister and the head of the Middle East Department. The Vatican's official delegation said during the talks that the Vatican's policy was firm and has not changed regarding the Palestinian people's inalienable rights, the issue of Jerusalem, and the Palestinian people's right to regain it, and the Vatican's commitment to legal legitimacy on the basis of UN Resolution 181, stipulating the partition [of Palestine] and the establishment of two states [Palestine and Israel]. In another development, WAFA's [Palestinian news agency] correspondent in Rome has learnt that the Palestinian-Vatican joint committee will continue its meeting at a later time to draw up all the details in connection with bilateral relations.
