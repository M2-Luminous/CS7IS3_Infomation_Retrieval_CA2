The National Trade Estimate Report, the ninth of its kind and released here today, said that by the end of 1993, "China had committed to substantial improvement of transparency" of its import approval process. "Permission to import products now subject to quotas or quantitative restrictions appears to be considerably simple and more transparent than it was in the past," the report said. China, the report said, had streamlined its import approval process for industrial goods, and eliminated "a substantial number of industrial products -- particularly in the machinery and electronics sectors." The 280-page annual report, compiled by the office of U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), listed a wide range of trade barriers maintained by 39 U.S. trading partners. In its special 14-page chapter on China, the report called the U.S.-China trade consultations in 1992, which covered implementation of market access agreement, intellectual property rights enforcement and market access for services and textile, a success. According to the USTR, U.S. trade deficit with China in 1993 was 22.8 billion U.S. dollars. U.S. merchandise exports to China were 8.8 billion dollars last year, up 1.3 billion dollars from the year before. The stock of U.S. direct investment in China was 469 million dollars in 1992. Pledged U.S. investment in China in 1993 stood at seven billion dollars. Actual on the ground committed investment stood at three billion dollars. In 1992 agreements with the U.S., China agreed to dismantle almost 90 percent of its non-tariff import restrictions in five years and to publish either the quantity or value of any products subject to quantitative restrictions.
