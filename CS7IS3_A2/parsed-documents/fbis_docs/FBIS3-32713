Instead of saying the government, I should say the executive branch which sets the conditions although, according to the Constitution, Congress makes the decision. But let us not be pedantic. The division of power here goes along with the confusion of power. What I mean is this: The government defends national sovereignty by taking a hard stand against the North Americans. It seems fine to defend national sovereignty, but it should not be defended just once a year and only from the North Americans. It should be defended throughout the year, no matter who complains. Not just U.S. soldiers should be asked how many weapons and of what kind they carry. Arms traffickers should get the same treatment. As "most favored nation," however, the smugglers of Ciudad de Este sell bazookas, submachine guns, and all kinds of stuff. The UZI submachine gun costs less than a deputy. The same strictness should be enforced with the people who smuggle logs. These people carry Army "notes" when they cross the border at will, carrying the fruit of their work. The clandestine lumbermen like the clandestine hunters both steal and destroy nature. For these reasons they should be treated like U.S. soldiers. Precise information should also be demanded from those who launder money. The Army can probably actively cooperate on this moralizing task because several exchange houses, banks, and finance companies are owned by the Armed Forces members. In sum, the law should be the same for all: Not just when dealing with imperialism, which this time wants to give what Paraguayan nationalism does not have: $12 million. (with 92 percent of the national budget allocated to pay salaries, the government does not have the money to build a latrine in San Pedro). Inevitably, when charity is too generous even a saint becomes suspicious. This sudden government nationalism is bewildering. If there is one sin of which the government is not guiilty, it is that of being nationalist. It is neoliberal, therefore it is cosmopolitan. It is capitalist and the capital is stateless. Yet it is not a savage type of capitalism it is a parochial [given in Guarani] capitalism. Under such circumstances, it should be seen if, through its intransigence, this government defends national sovereignty or the sovereignty of the corrupt I am referring to all those who -- if the soliders come -- will find themselves having to explain why instead of growing mate they are growing marijuana. It is known that even the last square meter of marijuana has been photographed from the satellites. It is one thing is to know something in general terms and another to run into it headon. Any movement in the zone of San Pedro, even to collect yaguarete ka'a [a medicinal herb] will highlight the zonal and national problem: drugs. As the government cannot stop it, it prefers to play the hero.
