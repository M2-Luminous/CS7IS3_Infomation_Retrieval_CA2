FR940426-0-00031 FR940426-0-00009 FARM CREDIT ADMINISTRATION 12 CFR Parts 600, 604, 605, 611, and 615 RIN 3052&hyph;AB41 Miscellaneous Technical Changes AGENCY: Farm Credit Administration. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Farm Credit Administration Board (Board) adopts, as final regulations, technical amendments to certain regulations relating to the organization and responsibilities of the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) and other technical revisions. The objective of this action is to reflect changes in the FCA organization and to update a statutory citation and a mailing address. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations shall become effective on the expiration of 30 days after this publication during which either or both houses of Congress are in session. Notice of the effective date will be published in the Federal Register. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John J. Hays, Policy Analyst, Regulation Development, Office of Examination, Farm Credit Administration, McLean, VA 22102&hyph;5090, (703) 883&hyph;4498, TDD (703) 883&hyph;4444; ␣␣␣ or Frances A. Pedersen, Senior Attorney, Administrative Law and Enforcement Division, Office of General Counsel, Farm Credit Administration, McLean, VA 22102&hyph;5090, (703) 883&hyph;4020, TDD (703) 883&hyph;4444. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The amended regulations, described in detail below, reflect changes in the FCA organizational structure and revise a statutory citation and a mailing address. The amendments pertaining to the FCA organizational structure include the following: (1) Adding a Chief Operating Officer and an Office of Secondary Market Oversight to the FCA organizational structure; (2) Revising the name of the Office of Regulatory Enforcement to read Office of Special Supervision and Corporate Affairs; and (3) Revising the descriptions of office responsibilities within the FCA. The amendments that do not relate to agency organization include: (1) Revising a statutory citation regarding the transfer of funds and equities between Farm Credit System (System) institutions, to reflect amendments to the Farm Credit Act of 1971; and (2) Updating the mailing address of the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation to reflect its move from New York to New Jersey. In acting on the regulations, the Board determined that notice and public comment are neither required nor necessary. Section 553(b)(A) of title 5 of the United States Code provides that the notice and comment requirements do not apply to rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice; thus, no notice is required for regulations relating to the FCA internal organization. In addition, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) provides that notice and comment requirements do not apply when the agency for good cause finds that notice and public comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. Because the amendments other than those that relate to agency organization are not substantive changes to the regulations, involving only technical revisions to a statutory citation and a mailing address, the Board finds that notice and public comment are unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. Therefore, the Board finds for good cause that public participation in the promulgation of these regulations is not required, and these regulations are hereby published in final form.
