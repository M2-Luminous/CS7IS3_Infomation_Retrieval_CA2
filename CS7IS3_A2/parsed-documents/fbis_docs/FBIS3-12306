The prime minister reviewed all dimensions of the criminal act and the Arab, Islamic, and international reactions as well as the impact of this incident on the peace process. He also reviewed the measures adopted by the Jordanian Government on the local, Arab, and international levels in view of the magnitude of the tragedy in the Ibrahimi Mosque, indicating that this incident conflicts with all human, religious, spiritual, and ethical values. Dr. al-Majali explained the urgent contacts the Jordanian Government held with all concerned parties. The minister of state for foreign affairs briefed the Council of Ministers on his summoning of the ambassadors of the Security Council permanent member states and the Greek and Indonesian ambassadors in their capacity as chairmen of the EEC and the Nonaligned Movement respectively. He communicated to the envoys the Jordanian Government's denunciation of this ugly inhuman crime and demanded their countries shoulder their responsibility toward protecting the Palestinian people in the occupied Arab territories, providing security to them, and forcing Israel to abide by the UN resolutions, withdraw from the occupied Arab territories, and dismantle the Israeli settlements as guarantees for the continuation of the peace process and the establishment of a just, permanent, and comprehensive peace as aspired by the peoples of the region. The Council of Ministers announced a three-day mourning in the kingdom in condemnation of the ugly crime. Flags will fly at half mast over the ministries and both the official and popular departments. The government decided to suspend work today for two hours from 1200 to 1400 in solidarity with the Palestinian people in the occupied Arab territories. The Council of Ministers also decided to offer donations to the martyrs' families to alleviate their suffering as a show of solidarity with them at this sorrowful time. The ministers also decided to make personal donations. The Council of Ministers decided to form a higher national committee to supervise the collection of donations to the martyrs' families and the wounded. It will be chaired by the Chief Justice and consist of the secretary general of the Awqaf and Islamic Affairs Ministry, the secretary general of the Social Development Ministry, the director general of the Palestinian Affairs Department at the Foreign Ministry, the chairman of the Welfare Societies Union, a representative from the Chamber of Commerce, and another from the Chamber of Industry. It was also decided to form committees to collect donations in all Jordanian governorates. These will be chaired by the administrative officers. Medical aid and urgent assistance will be extended to the wounded. Medicine and medical supplies will be sent to all West Bank hospitals. The Council also decided to pursue contacts with sisterly and friendly states in order to adopt the necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such ugly crimes and intensify diplomatic efforts to guarantee the Israeli withdrawal so that the Palestinian people can exercise their legitimate rights on their soil and achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. At the conclusion of its session, the Council of Ministers issued the following statement: The Council of Ministers became acquainted with the news of the Jewish settlers' sinful criminal attack on defenseless worshipers in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron during the dawn prayers--an attack which resulted in the martyrdom and injury of a large number of worshipers. The Council of Ministers expresses its profound denunciation and vehement condemnation of this terrible massacre. This massacre, unprecedented in savageness, targeted the innocent worshipers in this blessed month and in one of the holiest shrines. It was a continuation of a chain of inhuman attacks and violations targeting the Palestinian people. Jordan has long warned against the grave consequences of such attacks and violations on security, stability, and the peace process. Israel must bear full responsibility for this action, put an end to all kinds and forms of terrorist acts, particularly those perpetrated by the Jewish settlers, disarm the settlers, remove settlements, and secure the protection of Palestinians in the occupied territories. The Council of Ministers also appeals to the international community and both world and humanitarian bodies to shoulder their responsibilities and prevent such incidents by guaranteeing the protection of the Palestinian people, securing their legitimate rights, and seeking a just and comprehensive settlement that ends the conflict and guarantees Israel's withdrawal from all the Palestinian and Arab territories, headed by holy Jerusalem. The Council of Ministers, while extending deepest sympathy and condolences to the patient and steadfast kinsfolk and brothers in Hebron and the occupied territories and to the martyrs' families, stresses the solidarity of Jordan--king, government, and people-- with them in confronting such measures and violations. It stresses that it stands by their side in their just and legitimate struggle. The occurrence of such incidents requires us to unify efforts, close ranks, overcome Arab differences, and realize a unified Arab position based on pan-Arab constants and capable of advancing the peace process in order to achieve a just and lasting peace that will return rights to their owners and that is acceptable to future generations. The Council of Ministers, while addressing the sons of the one Jordanian family, who were distressed by this serious incident, hopes that this will be an occasion for further cohesion and national unity in order to confront challenges and deal with them with wisdom, reflection, and reason.
