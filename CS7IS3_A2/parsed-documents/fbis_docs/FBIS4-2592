Estrada noted that since the origin of Philippine-Chinese relations goes back to ancient times, and since over half of the Philippine people have Chinese blood in their veins, there is no reason not to maintain a friendly relationship between the two countries. He Yong relayed Chinese Vice President Rong Yiren's invitation to Estrada to visit China, which Estrada accepted with pleasure. He Yong and his party arrived in the Philippines on 5 April at the invitation of the Interior and Local Governments Ministry of the Philippines. This is the first time the Chinese Supervision Ministry has sent a delegation to visit the Philippines. The aim of the current visit is to establish contacts between the administrative supervision organs of the two countries and to lay a foundation to enhance cooperation and exchanges in the sphere of supervision between the two sides in the future. The delegation will depart the Philippines for Thailand on 10 April.
