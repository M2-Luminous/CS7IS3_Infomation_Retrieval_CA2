FBIS4-45217 "jptdd023__l94061" JPRS-TDD-94-023-L JPRS Narcotics 1 June 1994 EAST ASIA CAMBODIA Vietnamese Drug Users Face Prosecution Vietnamese Drug Users Face Prosecution 94WD0305B Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA in Cambodia 7-8 Mar 94 pp 1,5 94WD0305B Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA Cambodia CSO [Text] A group of Vietnamese who have been involved with illegal drugs have been arrested by the Criminal Police of the Ministry of the Interior in Doeum Thkov Market Ward right in front of the Beng Trabek School in Chamkar Mon District. In activities against this use of drugs, a high level force of the Criminal Police arrested three Vietnamese illegal drug users and seized a 20 ml. bottle of drugs on 3 March at 1700. According to a statement by Mr. Chey Ritthi, the deputy chairman of the High Level Office of Criminal Affairs at 0800 the following day, 4 March this High Level Criminal Police Force conducted operations in this area and arrested a Vietnamese named Sar Van Kha a.k.a. Thanh who collaborated with his wife to provide intravenous drugs. At that time the authorities confiscated a number of pieces of evidence: seven packages of opium power No. 4, a can of cotton impregnated with drugs for rubbing or sniffing, four hypodermic syringes, approxiametly 10 ml. of drugs, a number of ampules of diazepam and prometazine made in China, and a number of hypodermic needles. People who know say that the drug problem became very active in South Vietnam when the American soldiers arrived. Later, the Vietnamese communist government made a show of strongly suppressing this problem, but without much success. The Vietnamese drug addicts who use these drugs call them "si ke" in Vietnamese. In Cambodia prior to this the use of drugs in this way has not been confirmed by any source. So this should be a sign for the appropriate ministries and for the people in general. Din Tieng Ngoc Vang, a woman aged 33 born in Hau Giang Province, Vietnam and currently living in an unnumbered house in front of the Beng Trabek School in Phsar Doeum Thkov Ward admitted to the High Level Criminal Police, "I have been earning a living giving intravenous drugs for the past five months. During the five days before I was arrested, I ceased taking intravenous drugs because I feared being arrested by the authorities and I didn't dare buy any more drugs. I changed from injecting drugs to taking them orally or applying them by rubbing (rubbing them on the skin or on wounds) and sniffing them." Din Tieng Ngoc Vang admitted that she had known how to take intravenous drugs since her first marriage, but her first husband later went insane and returned to Vietnam. Din Tieng Ngoc Vang admitted that she bought these drugs from an old man about 70 years old whose name she did not know and that he brought them from Vietnam in 1 chi lots (equals a little less than 4 grams) worth 6,000 riels. Each day Din Tieng Ngoc Vang provided illegal drugs giving injections to at least six or seven addicts. Responding to the question when had he started using drugs, a Vietnamese man named Ha Hung Ung, age 35, a native of An Giang, Long Xieng Province, Vietnam, employed as a carpentar in Phsar Doeum Thkov Ward recently admitted that, "I have been an intravenous drug user for perhaps more than one month. At first I got injections from an old woman whose name I don't know. Then I got them from Din Tieng Ngoc Vang a.k.a. Sieng. I took intravenous drugs once a day. At the beginning my friends got me hooked. Now I am addicted to opium and I have to use drugs every day. If I don't get a fix, I feel terrible." Ha Hung Ung added that, "On 3 March at 1700 I was just about to inject drugs when suddenly the police arrived and arrested me and brought me here (the Ministry of the Interior)." Ha Hung Ung's partner who, according to him, is called "A Tung," is a worse drug addict than him. A Tung is also a Vietnamese. This opium addict with heavily lidded eyes and who constantly drools annoyed the High Level Criminal Police Force because he would not admit to any of their accusations. Sar Van Kha a.k.a. Thanh, a male age 28 a native of Ba Dinh, Hanoi, Vietnam first lived at house No. 105 Borikeyla 7th of January District when he came to Cambodia, but he later moved to the Beng Trabek area to a new house in Phsar Doeum Thkov Ward. He worked as a runner crossing the border from Cambodia to Vietnam and buying stolen motorcycles. A police investigation revealed that Sar Van Kha a.k.a. Thanh was a sapper for the Hanoi communist government which had discharged him, but when arrested by the police he had a Human Rights Card [as published] which had been issued by the LICADO Organization. Responding about his arrest for conspiracy together with his wife in the illicit distribution of drugs, Sar Van Kha a.k.a. Thanh admitted that, "the drugs that the authorities took away on the morning of 4 March 1994 were my wife, Din Tieng Ngoc Vang's, drugs, but I don't know where she bought them." The High Level Criminal Police are building a case against these four Vietnamese who are involved in the use and distribution of illegal drugs in order to send it to court and punish them according to the laws in effect. This is the very first success of the Cambodian police in the suppression of people involved in the illegal use of drugs which in the past we only heard stories about in Hong Kong videos.
