The FDR said that it has "undertaken to resolutely pursue the political and military struggle until all vestiges of this disastrous system -- the present system in Niger -- have been completely stamped out." The communique, which was signed by Mamane Kodelami Ali, a representative of this movement, adds: "With the advent of the ruling Alliance of Forces of Change, which supports President Mahamane Ousmane, the people of Niger are seeing their hopes crumble like a house of cards." The FDR, which is based in the Lake Chad region, accused the present regime of "corruption, favoritism, lies, wastage, and the deliberate alteration of democracy." The FDR's program proposes to cut up Niger into regions, with a federal status in conformity with the geographical and social realities, in order to ensure stability in the country.
