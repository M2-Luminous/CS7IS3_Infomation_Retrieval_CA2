In an interview with Caracol Radio Network, Gonzalez denied assertions that the current Colombian legal system is a "narcocode." Just as the Attorney General's Office, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Supreme Court have been saying, the minister admitted that the code requires immediate changes, especially regarding sentences given to drug traffickers. Gonzalez insisted that despite the success of the policy to get drug traffickers to surrender, the law can still be improved. He said the code, contrary to what some groups are saying, does not grant automatic benefits to drug cartels and establishes discretionary mechanisms that allow authorities to impose strict sentences. The minister said that the recent differences regarding sentences given to certain criminals arose because of problems in the way the sentences were applied and the interpretation of norms. The minister, however, refrained from identifying the reasons for the problems. He also described as unacceptable statements made by U.S. Senator John Kerry that Colombia is a "narcodemocracy" and said that "Colombia is a democracy that grows stronger each year, a democracy that has made huge sacrifices to fight organized crime, terrorism, and drugs."
