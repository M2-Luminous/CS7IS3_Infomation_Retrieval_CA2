He reaffirmed British troops would be sent to the Muslim town of Gorazde only when a ceasefire was in place. And he expressed confidence in Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander on the ground in Bosnia, who has asked for troops to police Gorazde. In spite of the Serb assault on the town and the United Nations' attacks in response, Mr Rifkind said: "I believe we are still in the position of considerable hope compared to the past. One has always assumed it will be a situation of three steps forward, one step back." He added: "It is not going to happen overnight. We are not going to have a sudden peace settlement in a sudden blaze of glory. It's going to be worked on slowly and painfully. But over the last few weeks we have seen more progress than we have seen in two years and that is a cause for cautious optimism." He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, from New York, that British troops would be needed in Gorazde to monitor the situation, man the checkpoints and disarm and get between the combatants. Responding to Sir Michael's request for troops there, Mr Rifkind paid tribute to him and said: "I don't think we should normally try and second guess the commander in the field as to how he wishes to use the forces at his disposal. He knows the local scene. He knows the best impact that can be made by using his forces in a particular way."
