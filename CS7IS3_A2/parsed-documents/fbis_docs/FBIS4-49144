Ever since Chinese patriarch Deng Xiaoping overruled his Foreign Minister a decade ago, and declared that China would definitely station troops in the territory after 1997, there have always been doubts about what role they would play. Doubts which were only reinforced by the events of June 4, 1989 in Tiananmen Square. No one disputes Beijing's right, as a matter of sovereignty, to garrison Hong Kong, just as Britain has done for the past 150 years. The future People's Liberation Army (PLA) contingent has a legitimate role to play in everything from conducting air sea rescues to defending Hong Kong against outside threats. But what is desperately needed is more information on what form their presence will take. More than 100 Beijing-appointees travelled to Guangzhou yesterday in search of that, on a long-anticipated trip they hoped would give them some idea of how the PLA is training the soldiers who will be coming to Hong Kong in 1997. Instead all they got -- during day one of their two-day visit -- was a long lecture on the revolutionary role of the Red Army, the PLA's pre-1949 counterpart, and a glimpse of some army barracks. Lectures on the Communist Party's past are the last thing that is needed if Hong Kong is to be reassured that the troops who will be stationed here will be a modern, disciplined and professional force. Bland reassurances, such as local XINHUA (the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) deputy director's remark yesterday that "it's our own army protecting us: isn't it laughable to be worried" are not enough either. What Hong Kong needs are some solid answers. What exactly is the training programme for the troops which will be sent to Hong Kong? How many will they number and who will be their commander? What part of China will they come from, and where will they be stationed in Hong Kong? Will they speak Cantonese and English and understand the local customs and culture? Some of these matters may become clearer, when the long-awaited Sino-British agreement on military lands is unveiled within the next few months. But most such details can only come from China. The Beijing's appointees' trip is not yet over, it can only be hoped that today's concluding part of the tour of military facilities will be more productive and produce answers to some of these questions.
