Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: My visit is aimed at strengthening the relations of good neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation between Vietnam and Cambodia. The visit is also aimed at making preparations for the forthcoming visit to Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. Besides my talks with Prince Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, I was also received by First Prime Minister Ranariddh, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, and Chea Sim, acting chief of state and chairman of the National Assembly. It is necessary to say that talks and meetings between the Vietnamese and Cambodian delegations proceeded in an atmosphere of frankness, sincerity, and mutual understanding. The Cambodian leaders stressed the long-standing relations of traditional friendship between the two countries. In this spirit, the Cambodian leaders expressed the confidence that all issues of bilateral relations can be definitely resolved. We have discussed orientations and measures aimed at accelerating bilateral relations. We have exchanged views on the signing of agreements on economic, trade, scientific-technological, cultural, and education cooperations. We have also discussed cooperation in the fields of promoting investment and avoiding double taxation. We have agreed that efforts should be made to complete all essential work so that these agreements can be signed during the official visit to Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. The two sides expressed the confidence that the upcoming visit to Vietnam by Cambodian National Assembly Chairman Chea Sim and the official visit to Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will open up a new stage in the relations of friendship and cooperation between the two nations. We have agreed to settle the pending issues through negotiations in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding. These are issues related to the border demarcation and Vietnamese residents in Cambodia which were discussed during the visit to Vietnam by the two copremiers of the Cambodian provisional government in August 1993. Concerning this issue, both sides agreed that it is necessary to set up an essential mechanism to exchange views and work out a solution for the problem in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding. We have also agreed to exchange visits by delegations of different fields and levels between the two countries. During my meetings with Cambodian officials, we discussed orientations, measures, and other concrete issues in the field of bilateral relations. Minister Nguyen Manh Cam stressed: During talks between the Vietnamese and Cambodian delegations, both sides expressed the common determination to strengthen and expand the relations of good neighborliness and friendship and the multifaceted cooperation for mutual interest. It is necessary to say that these relations have developed on the basis of the principles stipulated in the January 1992 Vietnam-Cambodia Joint Communique and the August 1993 Vietnam- Cambodia Joint Statement. These are the principles of respecting each other's national independence, sovereignty, self-determination, and territorial integrity. In summing up, my visit to Cambodia was a splendid success. It is hoped that this visit will undoubtedly contribute to strengthening, consolidating, and developing the relations of traditional friendship and cooperation between the two countries. I can say that these relations not only serve the interests and meet requirements for development and prosperity in each country, but also contribute to consolidating the trend of peace, stability, and cooperation for development in the region. Afterward, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam answered reporters' questions. Answering an AFP correspondent's question on the mechanism for resolving pending issues between the two nations, Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: We have planned to exchange delegations at two levels, namely the specialist and governmental levels. When the specialists complete all essential work, delegations at governmental level will meet to make the final decision. Dealing with an ASSOCIATED PRESS correspondent's question on ethnic Vietnamese who were stuck in the Cambodia-Vietnam border areas, Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: In our talks and meetings with the Cambodian side, we asked the Cambodian Government to take measures to resolve the issue of ethnic Vietnamese and Vietnamese who live in Cambodia for a long time. These people have fled to the border areas in the wake of the Khmer Rouge massacre in the recent past. The Cambodian side said that they will pay special attention to resolving this issue by studying and taking essential measures to alleviate difficulties endured by these ethnic Vietnamese. Answering the Voice of America correspondent's question on the Khmer Rouge's action of continuing to massacre ethnic Vietnamese and Vietnamese residents in Cambodia, Minister Nguyen Manh Cam stressed: Stemming from the relations of friendship and cooperation, we believe that the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia will take essential measures to stop this massacre. I understand that this act of the Cambodian Government will contribute to ensuring security for Cambodia itself, this is because the massacre of foreigners in the country will directly affect the security of Cambodia. Racial discrimination and massacre only create complications to countries concerned while causing losses to the nation with ethnic minorities. This is because the ethnic minorities, in one way or another, have contributed to economic building and developing of the country of their residence. The Khmer Rouge's massacre of ethnic Vietnamese has been and will be further condemned by world public opinion. Dealing with a REUTER correspondent's question on the possibility of Vietnam selling weapons and military equipment to Cambodia at the proposal of the Cambodian Government, Minister Nguyen Manh Cam asserted: Vietnam has never engaged in arms trading.
