The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries started rice imports on an emergency basis last November to make up for a supply shortage resulting from a poor rice harvest in Japan last year. The sources said the ministry estimates total rice imports at 2.29 million tons. They said the ministry set the ceiling of rice imports at 2.65 million tons and if the imports hit the upper limit, the ministry's earnings amount to about 250 billion yen. The ministry makes profits by selling foreign rice to wholesalers at prices higher than import prices. The yen's appreciation also boosted the ministry's gains. The sources said the ministry's gains from rice imports average about 92,000 yen per ton. The sources said the ministry will use the gains for payments of mutual aid insurance to rice growers who suffered from the poor harvest. They said insurance payments have hit a record high of 440 billion yen.
