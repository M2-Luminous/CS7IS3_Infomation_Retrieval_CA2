China said the government had acted irresponsibly and had misled the public over the $12 billion sewage treatment project. It said the project should not have been given the go-ahead without consultation with the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG). A Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office official said, if it went ahead, the urgent task of solving the territory's worsening water pollution would run into trouble. "We have already demanded the issue be discussed at the coming JLG full meeting," he said. "The British side said they can go ahead with phase one of the project that will be completed before 1997 and will only discuss with us the second phase that straddles 1997." "But does that make sense? The project cannot be cut in two. It should be considered as a whole." "We are not trying to block the project. We do want immediately to do something to stop further pollution of the waters in Victoria Harbour. The worsening pollution has not only caused red tide in Hong Kong but also poisoned aquatic products in the Pearl River Delta region," he said. "Government officials were misleading the public when they said we had no dissenting views on the project," the official said. Rather, he said, the Chinese were surprised by the decision of the government to launch the project with the recent award of a contract involving hundreds of millions of dollars. The government said yesterday that China had not been formally consulted on the project because a preliminary survey was being carried out with the help of mainland authorities to see whether the project was technically feasible and environmentally acceptable. "We are not yet in a position to apply to the Chinese side for construction of the second phase of the project," said Principal Assistant Secretary for Environment Chang King-yiu. If the government could confirm that there were good grounds to go ahead with phase two of the project, it would officially apply to the Chinese side to conduct a joint environmental impact study. Under the strategic sewage disposal scheme, the government expected the facility to extend beyond the southern side of Hong Kong waters. "The final alignment has yet to be decided," she said. According to the mainland official, the project envisaged a huge marine underwater pipeline with a total length of dozens of kilometres to be built linking Stonecutters Island with Tangangdao in Zhuhai. At least several hundreds of tonnes of sewage would be discharged into the waters off the Tangangdao. "Some people in Hong Kong have already criticised that as an unethical project. Discharging the sewage water in your neighbours' place is simply unreasonable," he said. According to international law, a government wanting to build a pipeline in another country's waters has to seek that country's consent. The official said the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office has organised a team of researchers to examine the issue including the hydrology of the Pearl River Delta. Some basic studies on the treatment of sewage in the territory have already been completed, he said. The official claimed that the Chinese Government proposed in August last year the issue of conducting a detailed feasibility study on the sewage project and the corresponding assessment on its environmental impact be put on the agenda of the JLG. He said the British side agreed to do so only early this month, but soon granted contracts for the project.
