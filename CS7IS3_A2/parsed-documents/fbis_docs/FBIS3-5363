The statement pungently denounced the moves of the traitor Kim Yong-sam in seeking dependence, fascism, nuclear war and permanent division, not independence and democracy, peace and reunification, as unpardonable criminal acts challenging the aspiration of the South Korean people and the trend of the times. "We will stand firmly on the side of Hanminjon and the South Korean people who are intensifying the movement for the overthrow of the Kim Yong-sam regime, expulsion of the U.S Forces and reunification, upholding `10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country' and extend positive support and solidarity for their cause of independence, democracy and reunification," the statement said.
