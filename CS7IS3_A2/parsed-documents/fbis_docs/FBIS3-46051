In Jiangsu, township enterprises and tertiary industry in the countryside account for about half of its GDP -- the value of goods and services produced. In the rural areas of the province, township enterprises and rural tertiary industry rose to 86 percent of the total output value in 1993 from 50 percent in 1978, an 11 percent increase over that of 1991. Traditionally, agriculture has been confined to the countryside in China and industry to cities. Township enterprises came into being only in the 1970s. In 1978, township enterprises and other non-agricultural tertiary industries for the first time produced half of Jiangsu's agricultural output value. Their golden age came in the 1990s when the Chinese Government decided to develop the market economy in cities. The past three years were the fastest development period for township enterprises in Jiangsu. In 1992, the industrial output value produced by township enterprises increased by more than 100 billion yuan over the previous year to 300 billion. In 1993 it leapt to 400 billion yuan. Seven of the top 10 most developed counties in China are in Jiangsu. In 1993, township enterprises in the province contributed to about 45 percent of the province's revenue turned over to the state. For the past few years, about three-fourths of the province's increased GDP has come from the countryside, where 80 percent of the added output value has come from township enterprises. Meanwhile, township enterprises have exerted influence on the layout of China's cities. Thousands of small towns which have been born and prospered on the basis of township enterprises link the countryside with cities. In some areas, cities can hardly be distinguished from the countryside.
