The National Assembly held group discussions in the morning and a plenary meeting in the afternoon under the direction of National Assembly Vice Chairman Nguyen Ha Phan to discuss the draft law on encouraging investment at home." This is the draft law that has been formulated over a long period of time on the basis of ideas solicited from various discussions, sectors, and the people. "National Assembly deputies focussed their discussion on issues such as the name of the law, its relationship with other laws, enforcement of the law, forms of investment, measures to protect investment projects, and state management on encouraging investment and so forth." Most deputies contend that it is necessary to promulgate the law as soon as possible. They agreed that it should be called the Law on Encouraging Investment at Home. "Many deputies suggested that overseas Vietnamese who want to invest in Vietnam should not be treated as Vietnamese investors at home. Other deputies, however, argued that to promote and attract investment by overseas Vietnamese we should create favorable conditions for them to invest in the country." Many deputies also suggested that the law should encourage afforestation projects, reduce or exempt taxes for investment projects in areas with numerous difficulties or in regions inhabited by ethnic minorities. Other deputies suggested that to avoid inconvenience caused by paper work and negativism, the law should clearly stipulate that people's committees of provinces and municipalities directly subordinate to the central government, are units authorized with the power to receive applications of investors for consideration and forwarding to agencies concerned for approval. Tomorrow, 7 June, the National Assembly will continue its work at the conference hall in Hanoi.
