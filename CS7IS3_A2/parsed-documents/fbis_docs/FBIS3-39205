"We hid behind a veil of media-inspired excuses, posturing, and well-meaning generalities in order to avoid having to do anything, to try to influence the course of events at an earlier time," he stated during a radio program jointly sponsored by LA CROIX [Catholic daily]. "Kouchnerism -- that is, a humanitarian policy that sends soldiers to the field without providing them with a political goal nor military means -- acted as a grave digger for the foreign and defense policies of large democratic nations," added the Val-d'Oise representative, who stated that "this policy led us down a cul-de-sac, delayed decisive events, and in effect sanctioned the territorial status-quo." To the question "must Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic be brought down?," Pierre Lellouche answers: "Of course, Milosevic must be brought down." "National-Communism and the dictators" which rule former Communist countries "will spell disaster for the world," he adds. On the subject of NATO's ultimatum, Jacques Chirac's diplomatic advisor says he is "very proud of the work done by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and the government. In the three years that this horror has been going on (in former Yugoslavia), this is the first time that we get out of the quagmire where we have lost our honor," he concluded. "For the first time, there is a glimmer of hope."
