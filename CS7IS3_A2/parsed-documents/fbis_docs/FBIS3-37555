FBIS3-37555 "drsov034_b_94015" FBIS-SOV-94-034 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Feb 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Media Issues Friction Between Media, Authorities Examined LD1702232094 LD1702232094 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian at 1725 GMT on 17 February broadcasts the "Details" current affairs program introduced by Sergey Dorenko. Todays program was devoted to media relations with the Russian Government and State Duma and carried interviews with Duma opposition personalities, including Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Georgiy Zyuganov, and Aleksandr Nevzorov. Dorenko begins the program by suggesting that the present government was nostalgic for a previous age when it could maintain strict secrecy around its work. He then reports from the day's session of the Information Judicial Chamber under the Russian Federation president, over which Anatoliy Vengerov was presiding. The video shows the chamber at work. Dorenko says that journalists attending the session had attacked the government for refusing media access to cabinet meetings two weeks previously. He then remarks that Vengerov had shown pro-government leanings at the actual session. Dorenko says that Vengerov had "twice thanked government representatives for attending, and said that the press had complaints to make, then corrected himself and said that they were not complaints, but requests." Dorenko then interviews Vengerov. When he suggests that the public was being kept in the dark about government business, Vengerov replies that official statements were released after every cabinet meeting. Returning to his commentary, Dorenko says that the government has defended its decision to bar access to journalists on the grounds that there was not sufficient space to accommodate them at the meetings. "Picture if you will, tens of thousands of journalists at a cabinet meeting. Truly a monstrous sight. It seems that it is not possible to find any bigger premises." "The whole joke of it is," he continues, "that you will get to learn of everything anyway, only you will have to get your information from the government's enemies, among others." He goes on to say that the reason for the government's secrecy is that: "The government is busy with specific business. It is portioning out your quite specific money and is accounting for it not to you, but to the president." The video then switches to Dorenko in the State Duma lobby, where he remarks that, in contrast to the government, the Duma is seeking as much media exposure as possible because it is suffering from an "orphan complex." He says that the anti-media sentiments of the last Russian parliament, which had "frequently attempted to do away with" the liberal Soviet-era press law, had continued into the Duma. A succession of opposition politicians then comment on the media: Vladimir Marychev, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia says: "The attitude of the Duma to the press is quite simple. That is to say, that all deputies are united in saying that where the press is concerned, the deputies have no chance of the truth being told." Communist Faction leader Gennadiy Zyuganov says: "It is perfectly clear that a qualitatively new weapon is being used to destroy and tear at our power: It is called the information manipulation of public awareness." Independent Deputy Aleksandr Nevzorov says: "To be perfectly frank, I believe that there is nothing more filthy than the so-called Russian press, and that this press has, for a long time now, been waging a deliberate war against all directions of authority and its own people. An information war for which there is no reason and which is doing its utmost to befoul practically everything. It is criminal to entrust any press whatsoever with covering the activities of parliament." Dorenko then quotes Zhirinovskiy as having written in "his book" that journalists were "lonely, unfortunate people." Then Zhirinovskiy is shown being interviewed: "I am the leader of the party that won the elections. On the lists, we won on the 12 December. Therefore, journalists should be asking me about what I think of the president's helpers. But here the opposite is the case. Journalists ask the president's helpers what they think of the parties." Then Duma Deputy Anatoliy Dolgopolov, dressed in Cossack-type regalia, complains that the press had reported that deputies had "multimillion salaries," "reserved cars," and "Bahamas lifestyles." Marychev then complains that media attention is focussed on a handful of deputies such as "Vladimir Volfovich, Gaydar, and Chubays." Oleg Mironov, a Communist faction deputy, is then interviewed. He, too, complains that "the work of the Duma is reduced to Zhirinovskiy and talk about this or that privilege." When the female interviewer points out that Zhirinovskiy constantly insulted people, he replies: "We are not talking about hiding anything, but a lot depends on the dosage." Dorenko then remarks that many deputies saw the only solution to the coverage problem in live broadcasting of parliament. Nevzorov is again interviewed. After referring to the "filth" being put out by the press, he says that he is himself a "great expert in the area of humiliating and destroying the body of deputies. I see my own methods being used, albeit in an unprofessional way. At least we used to do it with a sense of humor." He then concludes: "This Duma is, of course, doomed. There is no relay and the journalists cannot be trusted." The video then switches to Zyuganov again: "Information and television are now not the fourth estate, but the first, second, third, and fourth, and a well-produced program directed against the law or something else prevents all the other estates from working properly. If we pass a law and the same evening a nice commentator appears and begins to pad it out, then believe you me, nobody in the country will obey that law." Dorenko says that the Duma had adopted a law that day instructing the state media to cover its work in weekly reports in "Vesti," "Novosti," and "Details." Dorenko says that this instruction is worthless because no mechanism has been introduced to monitor the content of TV programs, and disarray among Duma deputies meant that it would be difficult to create such a mechanism. He further points out that the Duma has no authority to issue instructions to the "Details" program as it was an independent production. Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Duma's Media Committee, is then interviewed. Poltoranin says: "This does not mean that you are going to get phone calls saying: Look here, Sergey, you are shooting such-and-such a thing today -- well, you will have to drop it. Nothing of the sort. All we mean is that where, for example, we are debating the criminal codex or economic problems, we will say to you: Listen, Seresha, there is an interesting topic being worked on in the committees at the moment. It is important for the fight against corruption, the fight against crime, it is important for everyone, and we would like people to know what is being done about it in the highest corridors of power. Then you will say: Right, we will take a look. Who is dealing with it? Then we will just tell you who to see and you go ahead and judge for yourself." Dorenko concludes by saying that there was nothing more frightening for his program than "endearments from the authorities."
