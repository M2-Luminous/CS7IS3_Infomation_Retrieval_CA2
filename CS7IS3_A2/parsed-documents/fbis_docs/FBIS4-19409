The car manufacturer is therefore in a good position from which to look to a recovering 1994 market. In an interview with LE MONDE, Renault President Louis Schweitzer outlines his strategy in terms of alliances, cooperation, and international development. His leadership could be challenged on 31 May, date of the next Renault board of directors meeting, or at the time of privatization (postponed until after the presidential election). However, he has confidence in the "rationality" of his shareholders, who he believes will reach their decision based on industrial rather than political considerations. [Kahn] In 1993, Renault continued to collect nearly 700 million francs from the AMC transfer to Chrysler in 1987. Without that special revenue, would the automobile division still have shown a profit? [Schweitzer] Absolutely. In contrast, the heavy truck branch was in the red. (Ed.'s Note: Renault Industrial Vehicles (RVI) lost 1.4 billion francs in 1993.) Furthermore, the positive balance sheet of the firm and the auto division includes provisions for reorganizational costs. [Kahn] The financial result exceeds 500 million francs, while the figures were slightly in the red in 1992. What are the reasons behind that recovery? [Schweitzer] It stems from the fact that we got out of debt, took advantage of the drop in interest rates, and made a number of positive transfers. [Kahn] Did the Volvo sale impact the 1993 figures? [Schweitzer] No. The Volvo operations took place in 1994. For the current fiscal year, the general outcome of the partnership, meaning the cancellation of joint participation and the sale of Volvo's shares in RVI for 4.5 billion, will have an impact on our own funds. The transfer of AB Volvo shares will also have an impact on our results. [Kahn] There was an 8-percent drop in turnover in 1993. How is the outlook for 1994? [Schweitzer] Orders picked up significantly during the first quarter, although turnover will not reflect it immediately because of the gap between the time of the order and manufacture. Nevertheless, there is a recovery thanks to the government's measures in France, but also targeting other European markets. We have a feeling of having hit bottom and are now revising our estimates upward. [Kahn] In 1993, Renault profited from additions to its line with the Twingo, Safrane, and Laguna. Do you not risk being at a disadvantage during the recovery while facing increased competition from Citroen in the mid range and from PSA [Peugeot, Inc.] and Fiat on the "monospace" market? [Schweitzer] We have no inferiority complex. The Laguna, which came out right after the Xantia, has exceeded our expectations in France and the rest of Europe, even Germany, where we are becoming a recognized builder over the entire range rather than just for small cars. At the top of the line, we have not yet convinced the Germans to "think French" when they want to buy a luxury car. [Kahn] If there is a recovery, do you expect to stop laying off workers? [Schweitzer] No. We are in it for the long haul. We want to manage the company's productivity in a consistent manner. It is better to avoid fits and starts so as not to disturb either the social climate or the smooth operation of the company. Using temporary workers, overtime, and partial layoffs give us short-term flexibility. [Kahn] But are you not afraid that social conflicts will arise with the recovery? [Schweitzer] Our men and women must be treated fairly. Since 1985, Renault has cut its full-time personnel every year. I do not think that personnel cuts generate social movements. We see no such signs, but I cannot say we are safe from them either. [Kahn] How will the postponement of Renault's privatization affect the company? [Schweitzer] Renault's management will not change. Since 1985, we have managed as a competitive enterprise in the private sector. We were ready for privatization and its postponement may generate a feeling of being on hold. We must make sure that the company concentrates on its business and its strategy, on what it basically does. I think that is possible because privatization is not a break. It is part of a process. [Kahn] Renewal of your stewardship depends on two things: the next board of directors meeting on 31 May or privatization if you make it through the first. Does this not confront the company with yet another source of uncertainty? [Schweitzer] This is absolutely typical of publicly-owned firms and is a phenomenon that is understood fairly well outside of France. I do not perceive any floating within the company. The controls continue to work well. [Kahn] Your name has been mentioned in connection with the SNCF [French National Railroads]. [Schweitzer] I read that in the newspaper, but no one has ever spoken to me about it! As a child, I loved electric trains, but if you want to know whether I prefer cars or trains, I am quite comfortable where I am! I have great faith in the rationality of the shareholders. Their concern is to have a well-managed, well-directed Renault firm. They will judge the president of Renault on those criteria. [Kahn] Imagine that you were in charge of privatization. Would you favor Matra's participation in Renault's stock or even absorption by Matra Automobile? [Schweitzer] It is fitting and proper to have partners among our shareholders. It would be natural for Matra to own stock because we have a long and successful relationship with Matra Automobile that we have confirmed for many years. However, that relationship is all the better because Matra Automobile is independent of Renault. Otherwise, the larger company could bring the smaller one under its yoke. One great virtue of Matra is its flexibility, its capacity for innovation. That must be preserved. [Kahn] Following the failure of the merger with Volvo, do you feel a need to look for another partner? [Schweitzer] One must make a distinction between cooperation and partnership. All automobile builders engage in cooperation and it therefore seems obvious to me that Renault would maintain and develop it. As far as heavy trucks are concerned, Renault VI must capitalize on the fact that along with Mercedes and Volvo, it is one of the three major heavy truck builders whose presence is felt across the Atlantic. Because of developments in engine technology, it is possible to work together with our American subsidiary Mack. It is the only builder of American trucks that makes its own engines. RVI must also develop other forms of cooperation. Should they lead to a partnership? That is an open question. In the automobile industry, a partner is not a vital need. It can be an opportunity, as when BMW took over Rover. [Kahn] Do you regret not grabbing it? [Schweitzer] No. There was nothing in it for us. What Rover had to offer was British plants not even as good as Renault's and a bunch of models whose ability to complement Renault would be far from obvious! Nor would we have gained in technology because theirs is Japanese. The idea never even occurred to me! [Kahn] Has there been talk of an agreement with Fiat? [Schweitzer] That is not on my agenda, either in the case of cars or heavy trucks, in which case Iveco does not complement RVI. However, never say never! [Kahn] In other words, you do not think that mergers are indispensable in the European auto industry? [Schweitzer] I have always maintained that no such thing was inevitable. In certain areas, there are large-scale savings; in others, so-called losses. In the United States, GM has not systematically beaten Chrysler! Our flexibility, capacity for innovation, and organization mean that we can make the most of our "lightness." And we can be present everywhere along the line in market spots thanks to cooperation. If we wanted to build a 4X4, we would not do it alone! [Kahn] Don't you think that European builders risk being "sandwiched" in between the American and Japanese builders, who are truly "world class," which is not the case of the Europeans and particularly Renault? [Schweitzer] I do not think that world-class cars are a success because the market is not homogeneous. The surcosts of the Mondeo (Ed.'s Note: Ford's international car) are greater than the savings created. It is vital to be everywhere in Europe, but it is not essential to have other support points, even if a presence outside of Europe is a plus. However, Japan and the United States are prohibitively expensive. We must try to develop on the markets of the future: Southeast Asia, Latin America, East Europe. [Kahn] And yet, you have surrendered your majority participation in Colombia and Argentina. [Schweitzer] We concluded that a local partner was more effective. One must deal with the unwieldiness inherent in big business. Experience has shown that such transfers have improved our sales and industrial operation locally. [Kahn] What do you think the automobile industry will look like in 15 years? [Schweitzer] I have ordered precisely such a study. There are two main schools of thought: one utilitarian and the other emotional. The former holds that in the long run, people will look at price and inside accessories and that their choice will be purely rational. Buying a car will be like buying a refrigerator. The second group thinks that style, anything having to do with the pleasure of buying an automobile, of making one feel good inside, will play an important role. I fit into the latter.
