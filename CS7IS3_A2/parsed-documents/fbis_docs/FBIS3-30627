Mr. Coposu was received in audience by His Majesty King Mihai on 1 February, between 1000-1730 hours. Their meeting will continue today. It is likely that his majesty the king will entrust Mr. Corneliu Coposu with a message for the Romanian leadership. The PNTCD president told us that he will not convey that message to President Ion Iliescu, but only to Messrs. Melescanu [Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu] and Danescu [Interior Minister George Ioan Danescu]. The reason why Mr. Coposu does not want to discuss the matter with Mr. Iliescu is that the latter has made false statements last December in connection with the king's envisaged visit. The essence of the king's message, Mr. Coposu said, is that he comes as a simple citizen. "The king is not coming in order to organize strikes or revolutions. He will come as Romania's sovereign, when the majority of the Romanian people calls upon him," Mr. Corneliu Coposu told us.
