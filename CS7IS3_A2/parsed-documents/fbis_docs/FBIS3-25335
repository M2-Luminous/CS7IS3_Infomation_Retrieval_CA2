Doukoure Amadou reports: [Begin recording] [Amadou] It was the former executive secretary of the Economic Community of West African States [ECOWAS] and presently foreign minister of his country, Sierra Leone, who was the last foreign personality to bid farewell to President Henri Konan Bedie yesterday at 2100. After the audience, Abbas Bundu stated that he had been sent by Captain Valentine Strasser to attend late President Houphouet-Boigny's funeral and then congratulate President Henri Konan Bedie on his assumption of office of president. [Bundu, in English fading into French translation] First and foremost, I was asked by my head of state, Capt. Valentine Strasser, to bring greetings to His Excellency President Bedie, to renew the felicitations conveyed to him on his assumption of the office of president of this great country. My president also asked me to convey to the government and people of Cote d'Ivoire, the condolences of the government and people of Sierra Leone on the death of Houphouet-Boigny. The Sierra Leonean people join the Ivorian people in sharing the pain inflicted by the death of the late president. I was also charged with informing the president concerning what is happening in the subregion. Last November, the war had almost ended in Sierra Leone, so the government decided to decree a unilateral cease-fire and grant amnesty to the rebels. Thus, a cease fire came into effect on 1 December, which was to last 30 days. Unfortunately, instead of a reduction in the war effort, the war intensified. The rebels took the opportunity to replenish and strengthen their positions by receiving arms from Charles Taylor of Liberia. [Amadou] A few hours earlier, President Henri Konan Bedie had granted another audience, this one with the secretary general of the OAU. President Bedie discussed the upcoming OAU summit, which will take place in Tunis in June, with Salim Ahmed Salim. [Salim, in English fading into French translation] The president and myself discussed the heritage left by President Houphouet-Boigny, not only to Cote d'Ivoire, but also to Africa as a whole and the possibility of continuing this struggle which President Houphouet began -- the struggle to improve the continent's economic situation, the fight to resolve conflicts in Africa, and the fight to maintain the dignity of our people. [Amadou] Is there already an idea of the major issues to be discussed at the Tunis summit? [Salim] By the time of the summit, the elections scheduled for South Africa will have already taken place. So there willl be a new government in South Africa and it is most likely that South Africa will become a member of the continental organization at this summit. So the issue of decolonization and apartheid in Africa will be over. We shall then have to focus attention on issues of economic development, economic integration, and issues relating to the African Economic Community. We shall discuss what should be done concerning inter-African cooperation, subregional cooperation, and also we shall discuss the issues of stability and security -- since we cannot speak of economic development within an environment of chaos and anarchy. [Amadou] Both audiences took place in the presence of the Ivorian Foreign Minister Amara Essy. [end recording]
