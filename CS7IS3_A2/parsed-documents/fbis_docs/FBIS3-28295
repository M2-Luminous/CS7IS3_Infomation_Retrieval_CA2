But the U.S. demand is a dangerous means that could lead to managed trade and the U.S. Government should withdraw the demand. We propose that the Japanese Government carry through its policy of absolutely opposing "numerical targets." 2) We are fully aware that Japan has the task of changing distribution business practices on the Japanese market, allowing more foreign access to the market in several sectors, relaxing bureaucratic regulations, simplifying the procedures for license and approval of new goods and services, and strengthening its general competitive policy. We believe that the U.S. choice of sectors for numerical targets is highly doubtful. Using numerical targets as a means to achieve a specific goal will precipitate a cartel among enterprises and strengthen the oversight authority of government ministries and agencies. As a result, numerical targets will backfire. 3) At bilateral negotiations and to the world, the Japanese Government should put forth a vision of how it plans to narrow price differentials between Japan and other nations, strengthen the Antimonopoly Law's enforcement, and what it plans to do with the Japanese economy. Numerical Targets Have No Economics Basis At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks presently under way, the United States has raised the issue of the closeness and intransparency of the Japanese market that stem from bureaucratic regulations and conventional business practices, and has asked Japan to increase imports and foreign access to the Japanese market. To that end, the United States has pressed the Japanese Government and enterprises to set numerical targets for several sectors and businesses and to make a commitment to them. There are many problems with the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. However, the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets for three priority sectors has no economic grounds at all. Any attempt to use numerical targets as a means to settle trade disputes will do more harm than good to the interests of Japan and the healthy development of the world trade system. So far, the Japanese Government has taken a passive attitude in negotiations with the United States. The Japanese Government has repeatedly decided to yield to U.S. demands, which, in an effort to avoid short-term frictions with the United States, has resulted in long-term damages to Japan. This are responsible for the latest U.S. demand for setting numerical targets. In handling the latest U.S. demand, the Japanese Government should not repeat its past mistakes by yielding to the U.S. demand that holds no economic rational. Is it all right for Japan to simply say "no" to the U.S. demand for setting the numerical targets? We do not think so. Japan needs to listen to foreign firms' criticism that "The Japanese market is closed and lacks transparency." To regain the economic vitality and make the life of Japanese consumers affluent, Japan needs to vigorously implement new projects, develop new goods, and further relax bureaucratic regulations. Japan should also exclude unfair business practices that lead to bid-rigging. We are fully aware that Japan is faced with the task of changing the Japanese market's distribution business practices, allowing more foreign access to the market in several sectors, relaxing the bureaucratic regulations, simplifying the procedures for license and approval of new goods and services, and strengthening the general competitive policy. It is fully expected that once this task is accomplished, access for newly developed goods and services to the Japanese market will grow and the imports of manufactured goods to Japan and their share on the Japanese market in sectors in which foreign firms hold a competitive edge will grow. We, however, do not believe that in bilateral negotiations with the United States, the discussion for something like "trade results" and "managed trade," that aim for Japan's commitment to foreign firms' access to the Japanese market, will be effective in revitalizing and internationalizing Japan's economy. Japan should announce to the world that it will relax the bureaucratic regulations and adopt a thorough competitive policy that will serve the Japanese economy and should put it into effect without delay. To that end, Japan should adopt a new economic policy. In a bid to reduce Japan's current account surplus and open the Japanese market, the United States, during bilateral negotiations, has asked that Japan set numerical targets (for the share of foreign goods on the Japanese market and the amount and number of American-made goods on the market). This will lead to managed trade. The Japanese Government should resolutely say "no" to the U.S. demand. If both Japan and the United States agree on numerical targets, the following problems will arise: A) The act itself of the Japanese Government agreeing to numerical targets would be interpreted as Japan acknowledging "its difference from other nations." The act would reinforce the assertions by anti-Japan hard-liners in the United States. European nations and Australia would ask Japan for the same bilateral agreements. B) If Japan agrees with the United States on setting numerical targets in a certain sector and the agreement is put into effect, this would inspire the United States to claim: "Now that the numerical targets are going well, let us expand them to other sectors," and would demand that it be done. If numerical targets are not met, it will spur the United States to assert that "Japan has not lived up to its promise and we have no choice but to slap sanctions against Japan." C) Automobile and auto parts have become a priority sector in negotiations under the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The primarily reason for a low share of American-built cars on the Japanese market lies in the failure of American automakers to manufacture cars that are salable on the Japanese market. The U.S. demand for more sales of American-built cars on the Japanese market holds no ground at all. The Japanese Government should not step back from its position of opposing the U.S. demand for setting the numerical targets in the automobile and auto parts sector. D) Further more, the United States has no economic reason to push Japan for "numerical targets" in other sectors. Numerical targets run counter to the desirable policy of relaxing bureaucratic regulations and strengthening competitiveness. E) If Japan devotes its time and energy to bilateral negotiations with the United States and yields to U.S. demands, this will have an adverse impact on Japanese and American feelings toward each other by reinforcing America-dislike among the Japanese and spurring Japan-bashing in the United States. That would also taint Japan's image among Asian nations and weaken Japan's leadership in multilateral negotiations. Japan's Conventional Response To U.S. Demands Inspires U.S. To Make More Demands The Japanese Government must reflect on the fact that its conventional way of responding to U.S. demands has "encouraged" the United States to make its latest demand for setting numerical targets. The Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement explicitly stipulates a target share of 20 percent of the foreign semiconductors on the Japanese chip market. The Japanese Government encouraged Japanese automakers to announce their plans for the purchase of American-made auto parts when former President Bush visited Japan in 1992. The Japanese Government also agreed with the United States during the 1993 Tokyo summit that Japan would hold economic framework talks to discuss the question of setting numerical targets, which the United States had almost given up on at the time, and an accord would be concluded between the two countries at the end of the talks. This action was the Japanese Government's makeshift and short-sighted concession to the United States without considering long-term economic implications. Given this history, it is quite natural that the view is surfacing in the United States that if it threatens Japan with "sanctions" and the "Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act," Japan will go along with what the United States demands. The United States imposed retaliatory tariffs on Japanese-made semiconductors, citing Japan's breach of the 1987 Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement and called Japan an unfair trading nation based on the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. Japan "accepted" the U.S. trade sanctions without taking its case to GATT. Japan-U.S. trade friction will be defused in a short period, but the Japanese Government's pusillanimous attitude will adversely affect Japan-U.S. relations in the long run. If Japan insists on saying "no" (to the U.S. demand) and the United States takes hard-line measures (such as the revival of the Super 301 provision and one-sided sanctions), it would be possible for Japan to take such countermeasures as lodging a protest, taking the case to GATT, or taking retaliatory sanctions. Because the U.S. measures would be based on no economic justification or GATT procedures, Japan could expect sufficient political and public support for its protest or appeal. However, if sanctions are imposed on Japan unilaterally for the reason that Japan cannot attain numerical goals after it has agreed to set numerical targets, the justification for Japan's insistence would be insufficient. In that case, the world's economists, as well as the "pro-Japanese" and "free trade supporters" in the United States, would take the view that "sanctions against the violation of promises are necessary." There are some cases in past trade negotiations between European countries and the United States where the U.S. "sanctions" failed to bring about effects or retaliatory "sanctions" were imposed from both sides. As far as fair arguments are exchanged, "sanctions" or "retaliation" would not necessarily hurt a relationship of trust between the two countries. When taking into consideration the contents of the priority sectors in the ongoing economic framework talks, it cannot be guaranteed that if the United States should move to impose "sanctions" over the "automobile and auto parts" issue, public opinion in the United States or other countries would support it. Strenuous Efforts Should Be Made To Narrow Disparities Between Domestic and Overseas Prices Is it appropriate for Japan to only says "no" to the demand for setting "numerical targets"? No, it is not. Japan, for its sake, should tackle its own economic restructuring, independent of bilateral negotiations. What is necessary at first is to ease existing regulations and to strengthen competitive policies. Deregulation will create new business opportunities for domestic and foreign firms which want access to new businesses and will revitalize the market. This will be effective in invigorating the sluggish economy. Moreover, the living standard reflecting the economic strength should be attained by adopting more consumer-oriented policies. The fact that domestic consumers' purchasing power is low because of the high prices for land and commodities has led to criticism from countries abroad that Japan must be doing something wrong or that it is dumping goods on foreign markets. If deregulation is promoted and the economic structure that fully satisfies consumers is established, most foreign criticism against Japan will become meaningless. As a matter of course, the disparities between domestic and overseas prices should be narrowed through measures other than setting "numerical targets." If competition is sufficiently guaranteed in the distribution process, the differences between domestic and overseas prices that must be dealt with will be rectified automatically through market mechanism. In that sense, easing regulations and strengthening competitive policies (by cracking down on practices of soliciting price maintenance) is of great significance. To that end, the Japanese Government should not make (or announce) a pledge in the bilateral negotiations, but rather, should display (to the world) the future direction of the Japanese economy. What is now being demanded is an effort to rectify the differences between domestic and overseas prices, an improvement of the social infrastructure, a strengthening of competitive policies, and implementation of thorough measures to deregulate the permission and authorization system -- for example, cracking down on "dango" [illegal bid-rigging practice], drastically easing regulations for setting up FM radio stations, liberalizing air fares and route rights, introducing competitive bidding, and assuring the freedom to enter and withdraw from various industries. The strategy that the Japanese Government should take at present should be to indicate a long-term vision for restructuring the Japanese economy while continuing to say "no" to the demand for setting numerical targets. The Hosokawa administration has been given a good opportunity to adopt a new policy different from the past shortsighted policy toward the United States. We expect the Japanese Government to display strong leadership in promoting healthy development of the world trade system, to promote constructive dialogue between Japan and the United States, and to foster cooperation between the two countries from the long-term viewpoint.
