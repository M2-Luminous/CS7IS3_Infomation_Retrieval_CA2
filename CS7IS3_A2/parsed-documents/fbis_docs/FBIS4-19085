In a statement before the meeting, Cetin noted that there are historical ties between Turkey and Croatia and expressed the belief that economic and political relations will develop even further.

The agreement was signed by Ambassador Tugay Ulucevik, deputy under secretary of the Foreign Ministry, and Croatian Ambassador to Ankara (Hidayet Vichdivic).
