FBIS4-18857 "drweu070__a94010" FBIS-WEU-94-070-A Daily Report 12 April 1994 ANNEX Inter-European Affairs EU To Finance High-Speed Railroad in Germany EU To Finance High-Speed Railroad in Germany AU0804192294 Hamburg DPA in German 1342 GMT 8 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0804192294 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Text] Athens (DPA) -- In order to stimulate the economy, the European Union [EU] will participate in financing two express train tracks in Germany. During a meeting in Athens on Friday [8 April] the EU finance ministers basically agreed on 10 large-scale projects in the field of trans-European traffic networks, telecommunications, and energy, which are to be pushed ahead as a priority. However, according to FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel, the financing of the project must not be achieved via loans. Waigel said in Athens that two German projects were included on the list, which can be implemented quickly. Thus, ICE [Intercity Express] high-speed tracks from west to east and from south to north are to be expanded. According to available information, these are the lines from France via Strasbourg, Karlsruhe, and Frankfurt to Berlin and the south-north axis from Milan via the Brenner Pass to Munich, Nuremberg, Halle, and Berlin to Warsaw. Brussels' exact share in the construction projects, which involve billions, are yet to be determined at future ministers' meetings. However, the financing of investments in the networks must not be achieved via loans, Waigel said. "Financing via loans raised by the commission is out of the question," the minister said. No new debts must be incurred. According to Waigel, Germany, France, and Great Britain reject the idea that the commission can get money on the capital markets via so-called Euro Funds. The minister added: "It is the clear line of most countries: no new instruments." Existing EU budget means, as well as those in the form of guarantees and loans of the European Investment Bank must be sufficient. In order to overcome the economic crisis in the EU the Commission had presented a strategy paper (white paper) to the partners and there also suggested the expansion of the networks. As a result, the EU states decided to allocate ECU5 billion from the EU budget and ECU7 billion in the form of leans from the European Investment Bank every year for the next six years for this purpose. The finance ministers should clarify how the additionally necessary means of ECU8 billion can be raised. Waigel warned that a policy to safeguard growth and employment must not concentrate solely on infrastructure measures. It is urgently necessary to improve the prospects for growth in Europe and reduce the burdens on the companies created by excessive regulations. In addition, wage policy must contribute to safeguarding employment.
