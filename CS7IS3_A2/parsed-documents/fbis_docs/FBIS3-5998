Seventy percent of the money will go into the very popular ECIP credit scheme which benefits ordinary people and repatriates as well as those who wish to borrow money to start small businesses. The rest will go into microprojects to improve the living standard in areas heavily affected by economic migration. The decision reinforces the UK's position as the largest single national donor to the ECIP and takes the total British contribution to almost USD 10 million, not including the standard contribution which the UK pays automatically as a member of the EC. Commenting on this event, British Ambassador to Vietnam Peter Williams said: `This additional sum underlines the UK's commitment to real cooperation with the Vietnamese Government in solving the tragic humanitarian problem of boatpeople in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region. We believe that the ECIP offers the best possible source of assistance for returnees and for local authorities who have to reintegrate them into society. I hope that as many migrants as possible will understand this and avail themselves of the benefits of the ECIP by returning before the end of the programme in November.'
