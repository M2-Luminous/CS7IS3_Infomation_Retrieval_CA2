Actually, it is located in Campinas, Sao Paulo, where the Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications Inc.] Research and Development Center (CPqD) has been operating for 18 years. In partnership with universities and industries, the CPqD does applied research, which helps the Telebras System save $2 billion per year. The CPqD's 1994 budget amounts to $113.3 million -- the highest one since its establishment. Is so much investment worthwhile? CPqD Managing Director Leoncio Rezende Neto answers affirmatively. "Our cost-benefit ratio is 2,000 percent, much higher than any other activity," he said. Besides promoting the technological enhancement of the companies operating in the Telebras System, i.e. government-owned telephone companies, the CPqD develops products and transfers them to industry. Royalties [preceding word in English] from these transfers have already greatly exceeded $11 million. "We study everything, but we do not produce everything since we also try to establish the appropriate conditions to absorb foreign technology. There is no xenophobia," he said.
