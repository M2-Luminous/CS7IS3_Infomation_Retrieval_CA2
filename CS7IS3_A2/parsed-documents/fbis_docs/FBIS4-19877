Government spokesman Ioannis Kassoulidhis told the Cyprus News Agency Saturday [23 April] that "really President Clinton has shown personal interest" in the efforts for a Cyprus settlement. "He (Clinton) correctly noted that the ball has been in Denktas's court," the spokesman said. Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas has so far refused to accept the U.N.-proposed CBM's package while President Glavkos Kliridhis has accepted it in principle since May 1993. Spokesman Kassoulidhis said he would not make further comments "until we really see that Mr Denktas has accepted the 21 March document" of the United Nations regarding the implementation of the CBM's Asked "what about Cyprus" before his White House talks Friday with Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou, President Clinton said: "We're working hard on Cyprus, and I think, I hope there will be some movement from the Turkish side on Cyprus in the next couple of days with regard to the confidence-building measures. I think that the ball has been sort of in Mr. Denktas's court, and I hope he will take it up, and then I hope that Greece and all others will support pushing forward. I have worked hard to resolve this since I've been in office, and I will continue to stay on it." Speaking during a press conference after his talks with Premier Papandreou, the U.S. President said the U.S. "supports the U.N. confidence-building measures. Those measures grew out of discussions with President Kliridhis soon after he took office, and we hope that both sides will support them." He said his coordinator for Cyprus Robert Lamb had just returned from talks with both sides. He said "A settlement in Cyprus would benefit all the nations in the region, especially Greece and Turkey, two vital members of NATO." President Clinton pledged to do what he can "to promote greater understanding between these two critical nations and, in the process, to promote progress on Cyprus." Meanwhile, U.N envoys on Cyprus were due Saturday to start a new effort to try to convince the Turkish side to accept the CBM'S. U.N. secretary-general's special representative Joe Clark was scheduled to meet Saturday in Washington Greece's Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who is accompanying premier Papandreou on his U.S. trip. On Sunday, the former Canadian prime minister will fly to Ankara for talks with the Turkish Government. He will be joined in the Turkish capital by the U.N. chief's resident representative to Cyprus Gustave Feissel. The U.N. envoys will come to Cyprus on Wednesday for talks with President Kliridhis and Rauf Denktas. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied 37 per cent of its territory. Among the confidence-building measures proposed by the U.N. is the transfer of part of the Turkish-occupied town of Famagusta to the U.N. administration to allow some 16.000 Greek Cypriot refugees to return to their homes and the re-opening of the now defunct Nicosia International Airport.
