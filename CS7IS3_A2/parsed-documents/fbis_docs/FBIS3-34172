The supply of F-16 planes and other equipment, which were withheld due to the Pressler Amendment, will begin soon. Pakistan has already paid the United States $1 billion for the F-16 planes. Pakistan is also trying to acquire arms from France and the PRC to fortify its defense. The possibility of acquiring F-16 planes and other equipment from the United States is viewed as an indication of improving relations between the two countries. Pakistan also can purchase the equipment necessary for its defense from the open market. However, if they can be obtained from the United States or any other friendly country, then their uninterrupted supply can be assured. Pakistan is not oblivious of its defense requirements even for a moment and is meeting its defense needs on a priority basis.
