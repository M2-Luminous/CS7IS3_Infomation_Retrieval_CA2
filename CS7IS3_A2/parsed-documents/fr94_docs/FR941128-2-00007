FR941128-2-00007 FR941128-2-00005 Patent Licenses; Biological Treatment for Controlling Wood Deteriorating Fungi AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) has developed and patented an environmentally friendly microbiocide, Actinomycete mutant, which protects wood and wood products against wood-attaching fungi and is seeking to license it and to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for its further development. DATES: The FPL will receive applications for exclusive and/or co-exclusive licenses together with proposals for further development of the research under a CRADA until 4:00 p.m. January 9, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John G. Bachhuber, USDA, Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory, One Gifford Pinchot Drive, Madison, Wisconsin 53705&hyph;2398, (608) 231&hyph;9282. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Patent No. 5,536,624, ``Biological Treatment for Controlling Wood Deteriorating Fungi'', has been granted to the FPL. The environmentally benign technology contained therein protects wood against discoloration by sapstain (blue-stain) and mold fungi and degradation by wood-rotting fungi. It involves the treatment of wood and wood products with the microbiocide in the form of (1) living cells, (2) metabolites, and (3) metabolites with low concentration of cobiocides. This technology is an alternative to treating wood with synthetic chemical preservatives which can pose a serious threat to the environment. The current market worldwide for antisapstain chemicals alone is about eighty million dollars annually. The value of treated wood shipments for the United States of America is about two billion, five hundred million dollars annually. It is anticipated that the entity entering into a CRADA will be granted a right of first refusal to license any new patents resulting form the research under the CRADA. This notice is issued under the authority of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 3710a). Dated: November 17, 1994. Kenneth R. Peterson, Acting Director.
