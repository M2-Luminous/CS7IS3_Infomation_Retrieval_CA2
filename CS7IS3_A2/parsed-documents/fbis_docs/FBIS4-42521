If the forecasts turn out correct, then the Belgian Government deficit, this year amounting to 5.7 percent of the GDP, will fall slightly below the European average. Van Rompuy pointed out that tax levels, despite increases since 1991, remained below 1987 levels. "We must watch over competitiveness," the minister said. "But the forecast of a balance of trade surplus of 400 billion Belgian francs (BFr) this year (Bfr350 billion in 1993) still remains remarkable. It cannot be put down to weak imports, since growth will be higher than 1 percent." Van Rompuy criticized the Leuven-based economists who called for a currency devaluation last year to bring down interest rates. "Short-term interest rates are just as low as German and Netherlands rates and the surplus on the balance of trade is the best justification for the strong currency," Van Rompuy said. He said that "it was encouraging that companies' investments, after a serious downturn, would increase by 3 percent in real terms this year and by 6 percent next year." But there are structural weaknesses. The state employs 637,000 people, and 995,000 people receive unemployment benefit. The private sector employs 2.1 million people, and there are 680,000 independent workers. That group of 2.8 million people is too narrow, the minister said. "The vicious circle of unemployment has to be broken through," he said. "When we consider reaching the Maastricht standard of a 3 percent reduction in charges, then reducing the employers' social contribution must be given priority over reducing personal income tax," he said. "Social insecurity has a price. Insecurity adds costs to the budget. The Justice Ministry budget increased by Bfr4.2 billion between 1978 and 1988 and by Bfr9 billion, or three times as quickly, between 1988 and 1993. For this reason, care is needed with low benefits," Van Rompuy said. "Our problem is that in some sectors, the number of people entitled to social benefits is too high. More selectivity is necessary," he said. "In my view, the seriousness and the likelihood of the risk to income should be taken into consideration," he said. "Nothing undermines the legitimacy of the social security system more than not tracking down and punishing abuses." The answer lays in delegating responsibility. "People, organizations, and institutions must be encouraged to manage their affairs economically," he said. "The approach in the health care sector is already bearing fruit," he said. "Real growth was reduced to 1 percent in 1993. We are expecting a growth of 1.25 percent in 1994. In 1991 and 1992, the increase was 7 percent," he said. "Making people responsible for themselves goes hand in hand with solidarity," Van Rompuy concluded. "If the economy is to survive and flourish, then Homo Economicus is in himself not enough. We must remain deeply aware of this paradox," he said.
