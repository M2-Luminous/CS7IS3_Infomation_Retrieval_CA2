FBIS4-4943 "dreas066_d_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 South Korea Government: Envoy Exchange, Inspection Necessary Government: Envoy Exchange, Inspection Necessary SK0604051194 Seoul YONHAP in English 0502 GMT 6 Apr 94 SK0604051194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 6 (YONHAP) -- The government reaffirmed Tuesday [5 April] the initial Seoul-Washington position that no further high-level talks between North Korea and the United States will be held unless Pyongyang allows additional inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and exchanges special envoys with the South. Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang chaired a strategic cabinet meeting attended by Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and the director of the Agency for National Security Planning, Kim Tok, and reiterated the South Korean-U.S. stance after being briefed on Han's visits to Washington and Tokyo. Han played up the significance of a statement by the United Nations Security Council in the name of its President Jean-Bernard Merimee, adopted unanimously last week, urging North Korea to permit full nuclear inspections. Concerned countries are working closely to ensure that North Korea allows additional nuclear checks before the deadline, reportedly fixed for early May, Han reported at the meeting. The foreign minister said he had discussed dropping the inter-Korean exchange of envoys as a condition for high-level North Korea-U.S. talks with his American counterpart Warren Christopher and other senior officials, but decided against it in light of South Koreans' sentiments.
